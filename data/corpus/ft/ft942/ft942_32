FT  07 MAY 94 / Collecting: Collectors still play hard to get - Good omens
in the saleroom have yet to progress into a firm revival

Many antique dealers are starting to resemble Pagliaccio, the clown. Time
after time they put on the motley - beautifully displaying all their
wonderful goods and standing by them with their most welcoming smiles - only
to be left drained and disappointed at the end of the day. Despite many
false dawns a consistent improvement in the demand for antiques refuses to
emerge.
You can see them this weekend at the Duke of York's Headquarters in London's
King's Road. For the second successive year around a hundred top dealers,
all members of the British Antique Dealers Association, have gathered
together in a plush marquee to show off antiques. It makes a splendid sight,
but grandeur alone may not be enough to give trade the jolt it needs.
The BADA Fair is pitched about half way between the hurly burly of Olympia,
opening on June 2, with its 380 dealers making the exhibition centre look
like an exclusive souk, and the international glitz - and mega prices - of
Grosvenor House, (opening June 9), and it will appeal to the solid British
collector who likes to fill his home with fine things.
The problem is that such collectors have got out of the habit of buying. The
travails of Lloyd's play a part: in the halcyon past many Names used to
invest their annual pay outs in antiques. The trade is amazed that the
crisis at Lloyd's has not forced more antiques on to the market - although
this could happen when the final reckoning arrives - but it has certainly
shrivelled demand.
Some sectors, like furniture, have held up well during the recession, and
Witney Antiques, for one, reports that business this year to date is 40 per
cent higher than in 1993. But picture dealers in the main have seen too many
revivals peter out after a couple of months to be really optimistic.
According to a recent report by Butler Research, the number of antique
dealers in the UK has fallen by a quarter, to around 8,200, since the 1990
boom, while turnover has declined from approaching Pounds 3.5b in 1989 to
under Pounds 2b last year.
Things should be getting better - the economy looks promising; house prices
seem to be on a gentle rise, which should stimulate home re-furnishings; and
there have been some healthy stock exchange bonuses this year. Leslie Weller
of Michael Norman Antiques is encouraged by the number of City traders who
have started to spend between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 10,000 a year on
acquiring a Georgian table or a Regency desk as a tangible expression of
their success. Many become serious collectors.
But to date good omens have not progressed into a firm revival. The antiques
market was late into the recession and it is slow to emerge from it. The
best consensus is that trade is not deteriorating and that most dealers are
busier than a year ago. The impetus for the improvement is coming from the
US, where business is much brisker. Many of the leading British dealers
traditionally sell extensively to Americans, and there are signs that more
will be coming over this summer.
At the BADA Fair the red spots for a sale were appearing this week with
encouraging frequency at Spinks, William Drummond, Key Antiques, and
elsewhere. John Bly sold a pair of fire grates, of 1880, for Pounds 18,500
and Derek Roberts three carriage clocks for Pounds 17,000. It could mean
that, with prices so comparatively low, some pent up demand is finally
bursting through.
This could be the ideal time to buy - the only reservation being that there
is a real scarcity of top class antiques. Many of the finest items changed
hands during the 1980s boom, and the minority of new owners wishing to sell
are waiting, where possible, for a price upturn. If anything of top quality
does emerge, it commands a premium.
Some seasoned dealers, like George Levy of Blairmans, think that there might
have been a sea change in the antiques business, and that there will be no
return to the unsustainable boom of the late 1980s. He worries that the
introduction of VAT on imported antiques from non-EC countries, even though
it has been set initially at a low 2.5 per cent in the UK, sounds the death
knell of London's pre-eminence as an international art centre. Once
accepted, VAT could rise remorselessly.
Levy also thinks that the auction houses have succeeded in convincing a
substantial number of new collectors that they can buy direct from them
rather than relying on the advice of dealers. This is certainly the case in
such markets as 20th century British pictures and furniture.
There is an obvious contrast between the current fortunes of the dealers and
of the auction houses. In 1993 Sotheby's managed a 32 per cent rise in sales
in sterling terms to Pounds 879m and Christie's a 14 per cent improvement to
just under Pounds 730m. In contrast, only 2 per cent of British dealers
managed sales in excess of Pounds 1m last year: in 1991 3 per cent hit the
Pounds 1m turnover target.
Not surprisingly, helped by their massive marketing teams, it is the auction
houses that grab the headlines and give a rosy glow to the state of the art
trade. So Christie's in March had its best modern British sale for years,
with 93 per cent sold and records for such varied artists as Gillman (Pounds
110,500) and David Sheppard (Pounds 40,000) while last month Old Masters
brought in Pounds 7.3m, (84.5 per cent sold) with a Canaletto way above
estimate at Pounds 2.1m (in contrast, one Mayfair Old Master dealer went six
months without a sale). An English furniture auction totalled Pounds 1.4m
and was 86 per cent sold.
Collectors have also maintained their enthusiasm and this year to date
Christie's South Kensington has managed a record of Pounds 8,520 for a
drawing by Beatrix Potter; a record Pounds 560 for a 1790 Valentine card; a
record Pounds 3,850 for original postcard artwork; and a record Pounds
12,100 for a Disney toy, a clockwork Mickey Mouse cranking an organ. In the
US Sotheby's secured a record Dollars 63,000 for a baseball bat: it had been
used by Babe Ruth.
Henry Wyndham, chairman of Sotheby's in London, reports that sales this year
are 4 per cent up, and its good things are yet to come. This week Sotheby's
announced that it was offering in its July 6 sale of Old Masters a newly
discovered early Velazquez, 'The Immaculate Conception', which could make
Pounds 6m. Its Impressionist and Modern sale on June 28 is its best for
years, with a Pounds 3m Manet, an early version of 'Bar at the
Folies-Bergere', and a Monet 'poplars', which could also make Pounds 3m. The
contemporary auction is also top quality, with a major work by Lucian Freud.
Obviously these important pictures have been lured out by the prospect, at
last, of greater demand and higher prices. It could go wrong. Christie's
came unstuck in New York this week when, encouraged by last winter's
auction, it accepted higher reserves on contemporary pictures and was left
with almost half the lots unsold. Buyers are still selective; there are many
fewer of them than five years ago (the Japanese have almost entirely
disappeared); and they are unwilling to pay over the odds. They know they
are in the driving seat.
The theory is that a successful New York black tie auction of Impressionist
art will have a knock on effect down as far as the rag, tag and bobtail of
Portobello Road. If the rich feel confident enough to buy art again then, in
time, so will the middling classes, which include the true lovers of art.
Many dealers have become so impoverished waiting for the upturn that they
have given up the business, or cut costs by trading from home. Those that
have held on, or some of them, may soon experience the first stirrings of
recovery. Or maybe not.

A WAY IN THE WORLD by VS Naipaul Heinemann Pounds 14.99, 369 pages
It has to be said at once that VS Naipaul's new book is not a 'novel' in the
usual sense of the word. His publisher bravely claims that A Way in the
World is 'unconfined by the conventional novel form, but in a classical
story-telling tradition'. So what is it, this so-called first novel for
seven years from one of today's half-dozen most esteemed writers in the
English language?
The answer lies in Sir Vidia's own (I assume) sub-title - A Sequence. It is
a collection of nine self-contained but inter-linked episodes drawing on the
writer's autobiographical memories of Trinidad and the adjacent South
American coast, and adding a number of extended versions of scenes from the
history of that region. It becomes, I suggest, a Meditation on a number of
themes - on the Caribbean's historical legacy, on the relationship between
Indian and African, on the clash between Spanish and British imperialism, on
colonialism itself.
The format is so unusual that it needs description. We start with a brief
youthful memory of Leonard Side, Trinidadian mortician and cake decorator,
who possesses 'an idea of beauty', an inheritance whose origins must remain
a mystery. We continue with another fragment of autobiography, still in
Trinidad, which begins to develop the wider theme of the book - the
unknowable sequence of the island from aboriginal settlement to 18th century
Spanish settlement to English marauding, and then colonial rule, up to more
recent immigrations.
Then we have a 'story' based on a modern-day up-country expedition, with the
first (and mystifying) sighting of a doublet from Tudor times, relic of an
old betrayal, later to be explained. And so back to Naipaul's early years in
London, where he discovers his metier and begins to understand 'the great
chain of changing outside vision' of the Caribbean, starting with John
Hawkins and Sir Walter Raleigh. From here, after a portrait of the
Trinidad-Panamian communist 'Lebrun' and his role in the writer's
development, we are ready for extended chapters on Raleigh and Francisco
Miranda, the Venezuelan revolutionary, precursor of Bolivar, who, like
Raleigh two centuries before, ended an adventurous life in a prison cell.
Naipaul's fascination with Miranda is palpable and his chapter 'In the Gulf
of Desperation' is brilliantly done, stimulating some of his persistent
themes. Initially, writes Naipaul, 'I saw him as a very early colonial,
someone with a feeling of incompleteness, with very little at home to fall
back on, with an idea of a great world out there, someone who, when he was
out in this world, had to re-invent himself. I saw in him some of my own
early promptings . . . But Miranda was also, right through, from the time he
left home, something of a confidence man . . .' Naipaul is reminding us here
not so much of his Caribbean fiction as of his wonderful history of the
area, The Middle Passage.
He finishes with a brief chapter that takes us back to his two East Africa
masterpieces, In A Free State and A Bend in the River. This chapter is
autobiography again, taken from his teaching days at Makerere in Uganda. We
have come full circle: Blair, the Trinidadian colleague we have earlier met
in pre-student days, has become an international civil servant; he visits,
is murdered. He will be buried in the funeral parlour that features in
chapter one. Naipaul celebrates him.
So what is this? Not a novel. A Sequence. A meditation by a fine writer who
no longer needs the formulas, no longer cares for the demands, and perhaps
the limitations, of traditional fiction.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Books: Noble through a nightmare time - Whatever his
defects, Churchill deserves better than this book
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CHURCHILL by Clive Ponting Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20, 900 pages
There has never been much dispute that if it had not been for the second
world war, Winston Churchill would have gone down as a political also-ran.
Having entered Parliament at the beginning of the century, he was overtly
over-ambitious, an uncomfortable colleague in any cabinet, changed party not
once but twice, had a string of mistakes and lost causes behind him and a
habit of losing his seat in elections.
There is not much to be said for his performance after the war either. He
sulked at the Conservative Party's defeat in the general election of 1945,
though the result was more due to social change than a personal judgment on
him. Thereafter he stayed too long as party leader. He returned as prime
minister when the Conservatives won the election of 1951 and spent much of
the next few years resisting advice from colleagues and friends to retire.
The new post-war conservatism owed little to him.
Only recently, however, have attacks begun on Churchill's conduct of the
war. Clive Ponting, the former civil servant who fell out with the ministry
of defence over the Belgrano affair in the Falklands War, lays it on with a
shovel. For Ponting, Churchill the war leader was no better than Churchill
the peacetime politician: selfish, inconsistent and often plain wrong.
If one accepts the initial premise that Churchill was a bad man to start
with, the argument is carefully built up. The chapters on the second world
war occupy less than a quarter of a book of 900 pages; the section on
Churchill after 1945 is perfunctory. The wartime prime minister has already
been condemned by his words and actions before 1940, and the condemnation is
not only political.
Here is an example of Ponting's style: 'Churchill was also not a
particularly attractive figure. He was below average height (five feet six
inches tall), with a large head (balding from an early age), a small
hairless chest, small hands and feet, a less pronounced version of his
father's large staring eyes, and smooth, soft skin (which he wrapped in silk
underwear and bathed twice a day).' Before that we have learned that
Churchill 'never travelled on a bus in his life, and travelled on the
underground on only one occasion, when he promptly got lost.'
The sneering goes on. Ponting has further defects as a historian. He quotes
selectively. He suggests that Sir John Colville, Churchill's wartime private
secretary, and Sir Alexander Cadogan, the head of the Foreign Office, were
wholly critical of their political master. Quotations to the contrary are
omitted.
Ponting commits the historian's cardinal error. He condemns the past by the
standards of the present. Churchill was not alone in regarding Kenya as a
white man's country, nor in believing non-whites to be inferior; he was very
largely a man of his time.
Sometimes sources are given, sometimes not. What is one to make of the
throwaway statement that in 1934 on a cruise to the Dutch East Indies
Churchill's wife, Clementine, 'fell in love with Terence Philip, who was
seven years her junior and almost certainly homosexual'? Who was (is)
Terence Philip? Not even The Sun newspaper could - or would wish to - get
away with a claim like that without some substantiation.
By this stage the reader may sense that there is something wrong with
Ponting's book - a tendency perhaps to drive on relentlessly, just as
Ponting accuses Churchill of an addiction to aerial bombing and gas warfare.
The reader would be right.
This is a pity because Churchill clearly was an infuriating man even to
those who served him loyally. He made many mistakes in war as well as in
peace. For instance, he underestimated the submarine and came to believe
that only he could handle Stalin in a way that Neville Chamberlain once
believed that only he (Chamberlain) could deal with Hitler.
Yet Churchill did stand up to Nazi Germany. If Halifax, the only other
contender, had become prime minister in 1940, subsequent European history
might have been very different. Churchill also had a way with language
which, although sometimes florid, caught the imagination of the British
people. Sometimes he had the common touch. As even Ponting admits, it was
Churchill who insisted that the Local Defence Volunteers called for by
Anthony Eden at the War Office should be renamed the Home Guard.
The best quotation in the book comes from John Maynard Keynes reviewing one
of Churchill's early works in 1919. Keynes wrote of Churchill's 'undoubted
conviction that frontiers, races, patriotisms, even wars if need be, are
ultimate verities for mankind, which lend for him a kind of dignity and even
nobility to events, which for others are only a nightmare interlude,
something to be permanently avoided.' Yet nightmares occur and Churchill was
there.

MONEY AND THE MARKETS by Graham Bates and Jane Chrzanowska Bowles
HarperCollins Pounds 9.99, 200 pages
For all the high-speed electronic gadgetry, public disclosure requirements
and deep analysis, stock markets remain sadly imperfect markets. Why?
Because although they anticipate the future, they cannot predict it.
What a joy, then, to discover that the missing ingredient has been hiding
under our noses all this time. It is called financial astrology.
Do not let those derivatives get you down. All that the prudent investor,
hedger or speculator needs to know is contained in the 'ephemeris', the
daily record of the positions of sun, moon and planets.
Now, the ephemeris may look a little daunting at first. No matter. You can
master the basic theology of cycles, orbits, nodes, transits and trines by
plodding through Bates and Bowles's book; then spend six months as a student
at Bates's Astrological Association, then buy a computer, programme it, and
Bingo] You are an extra-planetary insider.
Well, almost. The science of astrology is still somewhat undeveloped, warn
Bates and Bowles. Furthermore, 'there is no universal astrological formula
that can be mechanically applied to suit all occasions.' Later they say:
'There are so many astrological factors that affect the market . . . even
the strongest cycles are overwhelmed by other factors.'
Oh. Perhaps that is why the Black Monday stock market crash occurred 12 days
after the ominous eclipse on October 7, 1987. Perhaps that is why, for each
event, there seem to be only one or two of the astrological brotherhood who
get it right in advance.
But lack of precision does not explain all the inconsistencies. For
instance, B and B say that fellow-astrologer Daniel Pallant foresaw the 1987
crash 'well in advance.' If you look at Pallant's prognostications in the
Weekend FT you will discover that as late as June, 1987, he was predicting a
bull market at least until November. No mention of a crash.
One suspects a little retrospective tidying up is going on here. It turns
out that every event does indeed have a planetary explanation - after the
event. And even the most superstitious punter may find it difficult to
swallow the idea that stock markets and the companies quoted on them -
indeed, whole countries - have astrological birth charts just like us from
which their financial fortunes can be plotted.
Determining the time of birth of a country - you need it to monitor the
underlying economic cycles - 'is not always a straightforward affair',
concede B and B. But company horoscopes are easily dated from the day of
registration. (What you do about name changes, mergers, and so on it is not
clear.)
Yet it is obvious that Polly Peck's troubles stemmed from 'its particular
sensitivity to eclipses and a crushing sequence of Pluto transits.' Virgin
Atlantic's natal conjunction of Mercury and the moon clearly augured well
for a company in the airline business. Mercury had winged feet, remember?
The fundamental principle to grasp is that free enterprise, represented by
Uranus, gets its resources (Venus) from the investing public (the Moon).
There is a superstitious streak in all of us, so it is not impossible that
financial astrologers are being secretly consulted - as they claim - by some
heavyweight stock market institutions.
Yet one sniffs a logical loop, a Russellian paradox, here. If financial
astrology worked, then the markets would discount every significant
planetary conjunction before it occurred. But then what influence would the
planets have on the day? In other words, if it works it doesn't work, and if
it doesn't it does.
One final puzzle. Bates describes himself as a former investment fund
manager in the City. Why, then, does he not keep his insights to himself and
make himself a fortune? Answer: one sure way to wax fat is to sell a million
books about slimming; one way to make money is to tell other people that
only you know how to do it.
Perhaps the science of astrology will one day get its Isaac Newton, as Bates
and Bowles hope (though they seem not to know that Newton was a keen
astrologer). Until then, however, you would be best advised to look up your
stockbroker, not Uranus.

INSTALLATION ART text by Michael Archer Thames and Hudson Pounds 28, 208
page
Turning these pages is to experience the tedium of scanning catalogues of
light fittings and office furniture, lift cages, sound-baffling materials
and air conditioning ducts. If this book is intended to excite our interest,
engage our sympathy, or at the very least to enter into reasonable
intellectual debate with those who find the installation risible as an art
form, then it is utterly defeated by the mannerisms and affectations of
design.
The brief introduction offers little enlightenment, its notions of hybrid
discipline, the questioning of autonomous art forms, the crossing of
frontiers, the activation of space, the specific influence of local sites,
are already commonplace in criticism and excuse - we all already know that a
bold band of critics believes and preaches that painting has descended from
the wall, that sculpture has stepped from the podium, that art is now
anything anywhere if anyone says so, and that Everyman is now an artist if
he thinks he is.
The text avoids the pitfalls of definition by declaring that the book's
compilers do not wish to confine the subject so, but only to set out 'a
series of markers', and only by the weary turning of pages do we learn that
anything from grand pianos, billiard tables and the racing car, to empty
rooms, shafts of light and the discarded jockstrap are now the stuff of art.
The Happening, that tiresome business of the late 1960s, of which the young
man who knelt in Grosvenor Square to shoot an imaginary arrow from an
imaginary bow at the eagle atop the American Embassy is an example, is (or
was), we learn, art as a process, not as an object - it was, it seems, more
important that Michelangelo should spend four years with a crick in his neck
and paint in his mouth, than that he should have left posterity the Sistine
Ceiling. Installation, we learn (and here; by chance, we have a definition
of sorts), is 'a method of art production', justified by Duchamp,
Schwitters, Dada and Surrealism, the development from Schwitters' pretty
little Merzbau (a thing of fairy tale fantasy) to the vast assemblages of
last year's forgotten art school graduates, seen as a match for the rise of
the Italian Renaissance from Masaccio's Brancacci Chapel frescoes to the
Sistine Ceiling.
The trouble with installation is that so little of it is by any stretch of
the imagination beautiful, and little of it now, post-Dada, post-Surrealism,
stretches the imagination, for we have become inured to shock and the
frisson of dismay. The vast enlargement of a tonguing kiss is merely a
trifle nasty, the functionless machine an old familiar, the inconsequential
conjunction of even the rolls of felt and grand piano of Joseph Beuys
already too homespun to be noticed.
Too many installations make the same demands as advertisements on hoardings,
and we close our eyes; too many have less to do with the arts of painting
and sculpture than with the illusions of the set for theatre, ballet, opera
and window dressing, television and the computer game - Indonesian shadow
puppets seem a prime influence. Some depend on sexual imagery, others on the
visual pun (excavating machines stationed in the forecourt of the British
Museum, for example), or on the sheer scale and number of the elements
involved, or on the contrast of hallowed setting and unhallowed, even
mischievous, intervention. Some incorporate printed texts for ready
exegesis, others consist only and entirely of printed texts of Sybilline
obscurity.
On the rare occasions when beauty plays a part, it is the beauty of material
and natural accident - a flooded crypt, a shaft of sunlight, the broken
stones of Richard Long's arrangements - all beautiful without an artist
there to tell us so; and sometimes it is the beauty touched on by the
discreet interior decorator - matters of placing and proportion, texture and
tone - but these can be seen a-plenty in the pages of The World of
Interiors, unblemished by the fumbling, bumbling and pretension of the
self-proclaimed installation artist.
This wretched book performs two unintended functions - it offers all the
assistance of an old-fashioned 'How to . . . ' book, so that we may make our
own installations from the detritus of the household - potato peelings and a
used condom, for example, should intrigue one's visitors  - and it reveals
the business to be, with rare exceptions in which political allusion or
autobiography play their part (usually with artists who have traditional
skills) - a shallow fraud.

ELIZABETH BISHOP: ONE ART, SELECTED LETTERS edited by Robert Giroux Chatto &amp;
Windus Pounds 25, 668 pages
Of the great American post-war poets, Elizabeth Bishop was by far the most
sane. Her friend Robert Lowell was a manic depressive; her mentor Randall
Jarrell threw himself under a truck; other near contemporaries, such as John
Berryman and Sylvia Plath, also committed suicide. Bishop by contrast never
acted the tortured genius. She had a bizarre, difficult life, she was
absorbed in her art - often taking a decade to find the right word to finish
a poem. But when she died in 1979, it was her 'modest lifelong
impersonations of an ordinary woman' that were remembered.
And so it is in her letters, where the ordinary woman, honest, affectionate,
domestic, dovetailed with the extraordinary poet, reserved, finicky, always
striving for the perfect composition. For anyone interested in how life
becomes art, this volume is a joy. An odd invitation to take Marianne Moore
to the circus, for instance, recalls Efforts of Affection, where the two
poets feed performing elephants brown bread. In the letters, formal Miss
Bishop lets her hair down, but is still just an echo away from the offbeat,
understating, impeccably polite poet. Her art has always seemed curiously
mannered; in the light of these letters, it looks more like the natural
extension of her temperament.
Literary New York on the razzle, then, has Bishop's charmed restraint. At a
breakfast party Mary McCarthy 'wept into the batter' when she made lumpy
popovers. Bishop got drunk on vodka at the Lowells, fell and broke her
shoulder, and 'I find I owe you Dollars 105 for my delightful ambulance ride
through the park.' There is much good living ('please eat a lobster for me')
little gossip ('the newly married Valerie Eliot looks like an English
pudding'), almost no confessions. When Lowell pours out that proposing to
her was 'the might have been for me', Elizabeth replies, four months later,
only with an effusive thank you for a Christmas gift, ending 'remember me to
your lady.'
Nevertheless, Bishop's letters form a vivid autobiography. Born in 1911, her
mother went mad, she was orphaned at five, brought up by grandparents, and
felt rootless until her forties - as the string of rapidly changing
addresses confirms. After stardom at Vassar, Bishop was taken up by Marianne
Moore, and won the Pulitzer Prize for her first poems, North and South, in
1946. Letters to Moore and Lowell here stand out as labours of love:
elegant, contrived almost as works of art, generous yet distant - Miss Moore
takes four years to ask Miss Bishop to call her Marianne.
In 1951 Bishop, now famous, visited Brazil and fell ill in the Copacabana
Beach penthouse of her hostess, Lota de Macedo Soares. As she recuperated,
Lota fell in love with her and asked her to move in. 'It was the first time
anyone ever offered me a home, or so much. Lota's gesture meant - just
everything.'
She loved exile. Lota was devoted but strict - when visiting poets stayed up
chatting, she pounded on the wall, ordering them to go home - and they
fought over Bishop's drinking (a friend ambiguously called her 'the soberest
poet we've had here yet.') After 15 years Elizabeth returned to New York.
Lota, ill and depressed, cabled that she was following. They met at Kennedy
Airport; at 6.30 the next morning, Lota crept out of bed, took an overdose
and died.
Elizabeth probably needed those close to her to live on the edge of madness
 -she committed her next lover to an asylum - while she survived and rooted
herself in the everyday. Salamanders, sulking babies, housepainting, trips
to the post office, making a custard, fill her letters: as in her best
poems, emotion and meaning suddenly emerge from a casual moment. Of
confessional poets she writes, 'You just wish they'd keep some of those
things to themselves.' As the opposite of a kiss-and-tell memoir, this book
is a revelation about the private woman behind Bishop's poetry.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Sport: Dreams of a trip to Lord's / Teresa McLean goes to
watch a fiercely contested match on the rural road to a cup final - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To celebrate the 23rd year of the National Village Cricket Championship, I
took my husband last Sunday to see one of its opening round matches for this
season, which gave us some splendid cricket.
We watched Barrington, near Cambridge, at home against Pytchley, who had
come from near Kettering, Northamptonshire. Both teams are in group 16:
Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk.
This contest was supervised by one umpire from each team. The Barrington
umpire was a noble figure, in the best village tradition of long, white coat
far below the knees and clear decisions softened by smiles free of teeth. A
tireless supporter of his village's cricket, he had moved from playing to
umpiring as years passed by.
Barrington is keen on its cricket. Gary Smith, the captain, looked down last
Sunday's page in the Barrington score-book, in the care of a villager, and
told me 'nine of the lads are from the village'.
A cement works not far away employs most of the village and supports its
cricket. The works is going to pay half the cost of extending the sturdy
little pavilion.
Cricket and football are played on the same stretch of long, thin village
green, cut as occasion demands. The wicket did not look bad on Sunday, but
the cutting of the uneven outfield that weekend, ready for cricket, had not
served to speed it up. Whatever landed on the outfield stopped dead.
Barrington players knew its evils and some took aggressive action to
overcome them, including 'the famous square upper-cut airborne towards the
boundary'.
The championship is organised by The Cricketer magazine, which has no
illusions about the difficulty of finding such teams. Susan Hill, who is one
of those running the operation, laughed when I asked whether players are
meant to live in their villages. 'That would be impossible to work out or
enforce. We would spend all our time checking addresses.'
They have settled for getting together teams of village players. Every
player must be a paid-up member of his village club, who has played at least
eight outdoor matches for it in the last two seasons. No problem for
Barrington.
Every village must also provide an umpire for the first four rounds and a
scorer for all the rounds. Barrington's scorer on Sunday was Mr Wilkins.
Pytchley's scorer was Sylvia, who scores for them every weekend, 'as a way
of getting out'. Sadly for Pytchley, the Barrington wicket-keeper, Marcus
Jarman, kept the scorers hard at work with 50 in 64 balls, including some
fine shots. He was 62 not out at the end of Barrington's 40 overs.
His captain too was hitting the ball well before being caught behind for 22,
attempting an ambitious cut. Young and generously built Keith Faint was
smiting rather than hitting, with a vast six into a nearby garden, then
played on for 27. But the most sparkling cricket was one of those miraculous
moments that can never really be described: a high, leaping, one-handed
catch, facing the sun, by a Pytchley deep fielder called Weston, to remove
Barrington's hard-hitting Mr Heginbotham, scourge of the nearby garden.
Scoring eased and in the end captain Smith was not over-pleased with his
team's total of 178 for six.
'I prefer about 200 in this sort of game,' he told me, but with a quiet
smile. He knows his bowlers, starting with lively openers Faint and Chicken,
experts at extracting nasty bounce from the Barrington pitch. No runs were
scored off the bat by Pytchley until the sixth over.
Bowlers are allowed nine overs and Barrington's opening spell on Sunday was
enough to warn poor Pytchley of its imminent dismissal for 92. Barrington is
used to getting through the first few rounds. It once reached the group 16
final, which it lost but which boosted morale and re-enforced ambition.
'The main reason we enter is to play in the final at Lords,' the
vice-captain told me.
The Cricketer confirmed this as the motive for most villages' participation.
About 650 villages take part each year. Sometimes the whole village turns
out for the final, complete with village loyalists who have no interest in
the game. Some hire five or six coaches to London. Troon in Cornwall, the
first champions, hired a train.
The 1994 Championship Annual describes last year's final between local
rivals Kington (Herefordshire) and Frocester (Gloucestershire), as well as
the banquet for players and wives at the Regent's Park Hilton the night
before. Hill told me: 'The villagers have a marvellous time. It's a real
treat for them.'
Might not some villages prefer a donation to their cricketing efforts,
rather than a banquet?
The question is less likely to arise this year because, the annual explains:
'Rothmans UK Ltd, who have recently sponsored the competition so generously,
have opted out due to a change of policy.' A new sponsor is wanted.
All that is wanted at Barrington is to reach Lord's. In the next round, it
is another home match: Barrington versus Barley. I enjoyed the last game
enough to go and watch the next one.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Sport: Rome courts change - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On and off the court, there is a new look about this year's Italian Open.
That old Romanian rascal Ion Tiriac has bought the commercial rights from
the Italian Federation, replacing International Management Group in that
role. 'I must have been mad to guarantee them such a sum,' he says. 'Please
don't ask me how much it is. Every time I think about it I faint.'
To protect his health, Tiriac has shrewdly lured away IMG's Cino Marchese,
to help with the promotion of the tournament. Together they have invited
some blue chip companies to the party: title sponsor Mercedes Benz, Nokia,
Rado and IBM among them. Doubtless they are paying handsomely for the
privilege of prominence, but it seems to work.
Players and VIPs are whisked to and fro between the Hilton and the Foro
Italico in the sponsor's gleaming limousines. Everyone who is anyone carries
a portable telephone; many actually use them. Rome's beautiful people, who
by tradition have always flocked to the elegant surrounding of the
commercial village for lunch, are there again in large numbers - principally
to be seen.
Some have even been watching the tennis where the theme of change persists.
Two women who have been causing havoc are the 18-year-old Italian qualifier,
Adriana Serra-Zanetti, a pocket Hercules of a girl who smites the ball
two-fisted on both wings a-la-Seles, and Irina Spirlea, a willowy Romanian
who admits to being on 'Hi]' terms with Tiriac.
Serra-Zanetti, a former Italian national champion in all age groups from 12
up, has beaten Anke Huber, the world number 11, as well as Brenda Schultz,
the 10th seed. These successes alone will earn her more ranking points than
the combined total of 97 she has amassed from 15 tournament appearances
since joining the professional tour last year. Her present ranking of 197
will improve to around 100.
The spindly Spirlea reminds me of another fine Romanian, Virginia Ruzici -
especially the long legs - which, my wife says, I am not supposed to notice.
They propel the 20-year-old Spirlea around the court with great efficiency
as she thumps the ball into the corners. She thumped too many for the
four-time former champion and third seed Gabriela Sabatini on Wednesday.
How sad it was to witness the further disintegration of a fine athlete whose
world ranking has slipped to seven. A catastrophic lack of confidence is at
the heart of her present problems. It was here in Rome two years ago that
the Argentine last won a tournament. But you would never have guessed it the
way she nervously frittered away the points. As her coach, Carlos Kirmayr,
said to me wistfully: 'If only she could play her matches as well as she
practises]' Ah yes, 'twas ever thus.
Some things never change. One of them is Martina Navratilova. Even at 37
this remarkable athlete retains an enthusiasm for the game that is
infectious. 'Sure, there are still things about my game I can improve,' she
insists.
She had to improve on Thursday when she faced again Ines Gorrochategui, the
20-year-old Argentine right-hander who had won their first meeting one month
ago on clay at Hilton Head. The score then had been 4-6 7-5 7-5 and Martina
had been furious with herself for letting slip a winning chance in the
second set.
In Rome it seemed for a moment that history might repeat itself. After
winning the opening set easily on a cold and windy afternoon, Mart-ina's
length on return of serve deteriorated. Her opponent took her chances well
and hit many blazing winners from mid-court to sweep through the second set.
Order was restored in the decider as Martina's depth of placement improved.
At 5-3, though, she was broken and she was fortunate that her younger
opponent did not know how to sustain the pressure. Keeping the ball in play
when it most mattered, Martina broke to 15 for victory.
Navratilova may not win this title. It would be surprising if she did
because in all her 20 years as a professional she has never won a title on
Italian soil. Furthermore, she came here at the last moment as a wild card
to fill the vacancy left by the withdrawal of Steffi Graf. 'I probably would
have played anyway,' she reflected. 'After two first rounds (at Houston and
Hilton Head) and a semi (Amelia Island) I need the match play.'
The tournament's need for her presence was even more serious. With Monica
Seles understandably postponing her return while her father is being treated
for cancer, and the date of Jennifer Capriati's return still uncertain, the
women's game is over-dependent on the presence of Graf, Navratilova and
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario.
With this state of uncertainty and no new stars on the horizon it seems
unlikely that the Women's Tennis Council will find a sponsor to replace
Kraft General Foods which withdrew at the end of 1993.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Sport: Big guns battle at the fortress / A look at the clubs
in today's cup final - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today fortress Twickenham (two huge raking new stands built; two to go),
again posts 'house full' notices. In the process, the gate for the
Pilkington Cup Final between Bath and Leicester will beat the 66,000 for the
Varsity match last December and set a new world attendance record for a club
game.
Bath and Leicester are by some way the leading two clubs in the four home
unions. They badly need a European club competition if they are not to grow
stale.
Leicester were the team of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Before leagues
became established, the cup competition was the criteria by which success
was judged. Losing finalists in 1978, Leicester then won three cups in a row
and were losing finalists again in 1988 and 1989 (against Bath). It was only
last year that they began to re-emerge, winning the cup against Harlequins.
In the 1970s Leicester played a style of rugby which was exciting, open,
adventurous, intelligent and pacey. Generally they did this with a small but
perfectly competent pack and a fast-ish back-row. Critically, in the five
single positions on the field, hooker, number 8, scrum half, outside half
and full back they had five international players: Peter Wheeler, Gary Adey,
Nick Youngs, Les Cusworth and Dusty Hare.
A decade on there is only one international in these single positions, the
evergreen number 8, Dean Richards, the players' choice for player of the
year.
Bath, by comparison, were a joke side. I should know. I played for them for
four years. Under 'Grocer' Jack Rowell this has changed. Bath emulated
Leicester. They have done that very difficult thing. They have, like the
Australian national side, managed change successfully.
With Rowell being elevated to the England coach is this the end of the line
for them? Brian Ashton, Rowell's successor, has been his assistant coach. As
a player, Ashton was desperately unlucky not to be capped by England. He
was, with Jacko Page, one of the two best scrum halves in the country.
In the 1970s, Page played when England beat Scotland 7-6 - but he was not
selected for the Australian tour of 1975. Ashton went as the senior player
with Peter Kingston from Gloucester (also uncapped) as his deputy.
The week of the first international Ashton had a family bereavement and flew
home. Kingston won two caps and we never heard from Ashton again.
Under Rowell, Bath's success has been quite astonishing, beyond anything the
city has experienced before.
Leicester always had a more serious pedigree. Their annual game on Boxing
Day against the Barbarians, which dates back to 1909, has always been a
sell-out. Nevertheless, their comparative lack of success in the middle and
late 1980s forced them to advertise for a chief coach. They made the
sensible decision to bring in a fresh face, Tony Russ, from the Saracens
club and have worked hard to make the jump back to first class.
A win this afternoon would be a deserved return for their work.
It will not be easy. Bath are a formidable team, able to soak up enormous
pressure and score the winner when the game is two minutes into overtime.
Just ask Harlequins who lost in the semi-finals this year and in an epic
final two years ago.
It is now Bath who have the five internationals in the five crucial
positions: Graham Dawe (playing better than ever), Ben Clarke (ditto),
Richard Hill, Stuart Barnes and Jon Callard.
But, their best player of the season is undoubtedly Mike Catt who was capped
right at the end of the game against Wales. Catt reminds me of Jean-Claude
Gachassin, the free-thinking French three quarter of the 1960s who could
play anywhere and frequently did. He was rugby's equivalent of Johann
Cruyff, the Dutch soccer star.
In eight days, the builders will start hacking at Twickenham's West Stand.
Its replacement should be complete within 15 months. The RFU borrowed Pounds
24m before they knew that their share of the next television contract for
the Five Nations Championship would net them close to Pounds 12m.
Rugby's negotiators managed to keep two secrets. The first was that Sky, the
satellite channel, was never interested; the second was that the bidding
between ITV and BBC was very close. In sealed bids ITV offered Pounds 27m;
BBC topped it by Pounds 250,000.
Next Friday, at the Dorchester, rugby pays homage to the the Penguins and to
Tony Mason and Alan Wright, two stalwarts of Sidcup who founded the touring
side 35 years ago. Since then the Penguins have visited 32 countries
including the Soviet Union in 1977, Brazil in 1984 and Malaysia in 1994.
For players past and present, rugby is still the best amateur team game in
the world. The Penguin club epitomises this perfectly.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Sport: An English frenzy is on the way - How teams aim to
add to their playing staffs this summer - Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomorrow afternoon, on the last day of the English league programme,
Manchester United can finally take the field wearing the champion's crown.
The surprise is not that they have won the prize for the second year in a
row, it is that the coronation has been so long delayed.
Early this year United were top by more than five wins. Yet their final
triumph was delayed until the last week of the season - by dogged pursuit
from Blackburn Rovers who were not knocked out of contention until they lost
at Coventry on Monday.
Manchester United will remain in the spotlight for another week as they
pursue the double against Chelsea in the FA Cup final next Saturday. There
will be time to consider their strengths and occasional frailties then. The
final weeks of the season have shown that the butterflies United suffered
when Leeds United closed on them in similar fashion two years ago have
flown.
Two years ago, while Leeds were wresting the title from United's grasp,
Blackburn were clawing their way into the old second-division play-offs. It
took a much-debated penalty to beat Leicester at Wembley and make Rovers
founder members of the new Premier League as they were of the old Football
League. Since then Kenny Dalglish, the manager, has used the millions of
Jack Walker to build a title contender.
Blackburn, soccer and money have always gone together. The town is the
birthplace of the professional game. Rovers were founded in 1875 and turned
professional five years later. They were the first northern team to appear
in the FA Cup final when they lost to Old Etonians in 1882. The next year
Blackburn Olympic beat Old Etonians. It was OE's sixth and last appearance
in the final, the end of an era. Rovers won the following season. Hard
northern cash had banished the southern amateurs.
Even though Blackburn were part of football's old aristocracy, they are now
the flashiest of its nouveau riche; a small-town club plucked from obscurity
by an extremely wealthy fan and competing with the old money of Manchester
United. The fact that the league boiled down to a contest between these two
suggests that, just as in 1884, money is a key ingredient of success. But it
is no guarantee. A glance down the Premier League table proves that.
When Dalglish became Blackburn manager he took over a solid second division
team without any stars or the large, talent-stuffed youth programmes which
the glamorous clubs are able to run. In the circumstances he has spent his
pile of cash with surprising patience. He has given most of the big-money
signings a little while to bed down before buying the next one and he has
stockpiled young talent.
His squad is still shallow. In the first month the club struggled without
the wonderful Alan Shearer. Over the last month the majority of its other
seven-figure signings - Ripley, Batty, Gallagher, Newell - have been
injured.
Yet Blackburn plodded on. For the run-in, the core of the side, the central
defence and midfield, was made up of men who played in the promotion team.
Their sustained challenge is proof that Dalglish can coach as well as shop.
His team is big, fast, tough and hard working. Its success is based on
relentless pressure. It counter-attacks quickly and makes the most of
corners and free kicks. Wimbledon have shown that this formula can turn a
team of cast-offs and bargains into a force. Blackburn have shown that even
paying players Pounds 8,000 a week need not dull their appetite.
While Dalglish was turning round a second division team, his successor at
Liverpool, Graeme Souness, was spending large sums of money turning a good
side into a mediocre one. Souness has lost his job. So has Howard Kendall
who managed Everton to two league titles. Today, Everton need to win while
others lose to avoid relegation.
Manchester City and Spurs also flirted with relegation. City chucked one
last sack of money at the problem and staged a rally which means they should
stay up. Tottenham, who scraped clear on Thursday with a win at Oldham,
tried the same trick but the more players they bought the worse they played.
All three clubs have been weakened by boardroom battles. All three have
switched managers in the last year. All three seem locked in an eternal
cycle of reconstruction. As each has slipped further behind the top teams,
they have become more impatient for success but have found greater
difficulty in attracting the very best players. Stability, not money, was
the missing ingredient.
These three clubs are part of a weak group of eight or nine clubs at the
bottom of this year's Premier League. Last season, Crystal Palace were
relegated with 49 points: at least eight Premier League clubs will finish
with fewer points this year.
Most clubs have had little problem spending the increased wealth generated
by the Premier League, many have failed to translate it into improved teams.
The unprecedented carnage wrought by first and second division clubs on
their elite relatives in the two cup competitions suggests that the gap
between the rich Premier League and the rest is not widening but shrinking.
Many of the talented youngsters who shone for lower-division teams in the
cups will make the leap to the Premier League this summer as clubs scramble
to close the gap on United and Blackburn by spending. The tenor of the
auction has already been set.
Queen's Park Rangers are taking bids for Les Ferdinand, sometime England
centre-forward. The asking price is Pounds 4m and United and Blackburn have
their bids in as do Newcastle United, who are third and Arsenal, fourth.
If George Graham, the parsimonious Arsenal manager, feels he must spend such
sums on the team which won the European Cup Winners Cup with such grit on
Wednesday, then English football is in for a spending frenzy this summer.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Motoring: Take your 4x4 off-road
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Urban pedestrians are not the only people who need protecting from the motor
vehicles they have to share their space with. What about walkers - and for
that matter, riders - who say their enjoyment of the countryside is being
threatened by off-road cars and motor cycles?
It is a vexed question. The market in on-off road four-wheel drives
continues to grow. Fortunately, the great majority of the 14,670 Land Rover
Discoveries, Range Rovers, Shoguns, Land Cruisers, Jeeps and the rest sold
in Britain last year will rarely if ever leave the tarmac. They were bought
to enhance a life style, not to cross trackless terrain - incidentally,
something it is very difficult to do legally in a crowded little island.
But enough owners of Britain's estimated 150,000-plus on-off roaders
exercise their right to use Byways Open to All Traffic (Boats) to cause
problems. People who enjoy using these green roads on their feet or on
horseback resent having to share them with growing numbers of 4x4s and trail
bikes.
Frank Tait, of Alton, Hampshire, for example, is among readers who have
written in support of my plea two weeks ago for urban pedestrians to be
better protected from cars and lorries that are driven too fast and whose
drivers treat footpaths as an extension of the roadway. I suggested kerbs
should gradually be made too high for vehicles to mount and that
particularly dangerous areas should be railed off. And I thought we should
copy the French and raise pedestrian crossings high enough to damage
speeding cars.
'No doubt central and local government will say it would cost too much,' he
comments. 'Only when one takes quality of life into consideration do the
figures start to stack up.'
Tait is no push bike-riding environmental fanatic - 'I own two cars and once
had a Land Rover' - but he hates the way our green roads are being turned
into quagmires by four-wheel drives.
'Legislation has allowed these byways to be used at all times by those who
want to test out their vehicles under off-road conditions. So once again
pedestrians are harried in an environment where they might expect peace and
safety.'
Unlike militant ramblers, he does not wish to ban 4x4s and trail bikes but
reckons their use of Boats should be limited to a number of days each year
decided by the local authority. Users should also pay a fee to help make
good the damage they cause. Here there is a precedent: the Forestry
Commission does exactly that when it opens its roads for car rallying.
To be fair, all the makers of 4x4s give buyers literature asking them to
follow a driver's countryside code of conduct produced by Lara, the Land
Access and Rights Association.
Lara, which fights for the legal right of off-roaders to continue to use
Boats, tells them how to behave. 'Travel at a quiet and unobtrusive pace . .
. do not use green roads when they risk being damaged beyond a point of
natural recovery when the weather improves . . . be courteous to other road
users, including walkers, and take great care when passing horses.'
And it warns of pitfalls. Examples: Not all green lanes have vehicular
rights so always check first. If a route is not obvious, ask locally or
check maps held at highway authority offices.'
Objectors would have far less to complain about if every off-roader followed
Lara's code. But it is plain that many of them do not.
At the same time, it has to be said that one huge farm tractor and trailer
can do as much damage to a green lane in winter as a whole convoy of light
4x4s. And that some walkers feel just as venomous about riders as they do
about off-road drivers, complaining that horses' hooves cut up soft ground
far more than human feet. Which I am the first to admit they do. That is why
recreational riders such as me are quite properly banned from areas such as
Ashdown Forest in Sussex when the conservators consider horses would damage
rain-soaked soil unacceptably.
So what are the poor 4x4 owners, all dressed up in their knobbly tyres with
nowhere to go, to do? They should buy one of the specialist off-road
magazines published each month - most newsagents have them - and turn to the
small advertisements. Landowners have realised money can be made from
allowing 4x4 owners to play with their machines over rough country - for a
fee. Some even provide a pressure washer to get rid of the filth afterwards.
Off-roading on these private courses will not offend walkers or riders. It
is a nice little earner for farmers who are down to their last Jaguar. And
4x4 owners who have not been on a training course will get some idea what
their vehicles can do when given the chance to show their mettle.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Motoring: The latest Range Rover Vogue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Off-roading is the last thing typical buyers of the latest Range Rover Vogue
(pictured left) with a 2.5-litre, direct injection diesel engine and
automatic transmission (from Pounds 29,995) will have in mind, even though
it is perfectly at home in thick mud. The lofty driving position, ease of
control, tons of headroom, airbags and impression of strength are appealing.
Acceleration is leisurely and the engine sounds growly while speed is
picking up. Noise vanishes in fourth gear. The diesel moderates the Range
Rover's traditional thirst so well that over 30mpg (9.4 l/100km) is
achievable compared with the equivalent 4.2-litre petrol V8's under 20mpg
(14 l/100km).

FT  07 MAY 94 / Property: Sotogrande - an estate with the Californian touch
 -Gerald Cadogan visits southern Spain to see where smart development was
pioneered on the Costa del Sol
</HEADLINE>

On landing at Gibraltar airport, it is easiest to walk through the frontier
into Spain. If you are in a car, you could be delayed. A poster warning of
'very dangerous' terrorists greets you and dogs wait to catch a whiff of
drugs. Go a little further and you find the Guardia Civil parked by the sea,
binoculars searching for speedboat-borne smugglers from Morocco.
Just over the border is La Linea where, for 200 years, British servicemen
rested from the Rock's confined life. The closing of the frontier for many
years up to 1982 was hard for La Linea and the country around. Moroccans
took the jobs Spaniards had held and the easy way to the Costa del Sol from
Britain, then Spain's biggest market, was shut.
This helped Malaga airport, but reaching Marbella by the old coast road was
a nasty and dangerous drive. Today, though, the motorway and bypasses make
it easy from either airport. Gibraltar has fewer flights and smaller planes
but is probably preferable for places west of Marbella. And its duty-free
prices are phenomenal.
There is still unspoilt country close to the border and up in the hills
(where people suffered badly in and after the 1936-39 civil war for
supporting the republicans). Cork oaks abound. The Rock rules the sea view,
although often it is surrounded by fog. Beyond, and not far away, are
Africa's Atlas mountains.
The 1,618 hectare (4,000 acre) Sotogrande estate, between Marbella and
Gibraltar, pioneered smart development on the Costa del Sol and is now 32
years old. Its first golf course was completed in 1965 and the second in
1975. Wide roads were built and utilities installed from the start.
Today, it is a bit like California, a mix of Mediterranean scrub and lush
trees, flowers and lawns where the ground has been reclaimed and watered.
Indeed, water is not a problem for Sotogrande, which extracts what it needs
from the Gaudiaro river that flows through the estate (and brings migratory
birds).
The owner of the estate is the Sotogrande Public Company, which has at least
20 years' more sales in prospect before the estate is full. Even then, it
will not be cluttered. The main shareholder is Carlo de Benedetti's Cofir
group.
Like the rest of the Costa del Sol, boom and gloom has been the story of
Sotogrande. The boom years were 1971-74 and 1983-87 but the recent decline
started late in 1989, a year when 43 per cent of all foreign investment in
Spain went on property in Malaga province; by last year, prices were 40-50
per cent down on 1989-90.
The fall of the pound in September 1992 made matters worse, while lower
interest rates hit British pensioners. The subsequent decline of the peseta
(now around Pta200 to Pounds 1) has been some recompense, but many homes are
for re-sale along the coast.
It looks now, however, as if prices have bottomed; many more people are
inquiring and some are buying. In Sotogrande, inquire at the sales office;
elsewhere, Hamptons/Randal-Williams and BD Wood offer a good selection.
Sotogrande slashed prices last year on 43 unsold apartments and only seven
are now left (at realistic and attractive prices between Pta16m and
Pta33.6m).
That has released cash for the first phases of a new inland marina where
house prices (Pta18m to Pta29m) include the entrance fee for the two beach
clubs - which are still old-fashioned enough to separate children and
adults. A mooring costs Pta4.5m.
To maintain standards, the company has decided to stop selling other plots
to outside developers and, instead, is building the houses itself. Most cost
from Pta30m to Pta40m - the cheapest is Pta27.2m and the dearest Pta60.5m.
They are ideal for the three golf courses and two polo grounds: the sport
still attracts the British army from Gibraltar.
Golf has been a boom sport in Spain in the past two decades. Robert Trent
Jones laid out the Sotogrande courses, of which the best is Valderrama (a
handsome, private club which hopes to host the Ryder Cup in 1997). The
nine-hole La Canada course is the only municipal layout in Spain and there
are plans to build another 27 holes, making 72 in all.
Sotogrande is not a British enclave - about half the sales are to Spaniards,
mostly from Madrid and the Basque country. But the British are nibbling
again and the Germans now constitute about 15 per cent of the market. Among
the rest are people from Hong Kong, South Africa, northern Italy and
Morocco. An international school follows the British and Spanish systems.
Marina Puente Romano is an apartment-only development east of Sotogrande and
just west of Marbella, next to the Puente Romano luxury hotel. La Concha
mountain dominates the view on the land side, and a neighbouring mosque,
built by the Saudi royal family, is a surprise reminder of the Moors who
occupied southern Spain. The Roman bridge (puente romano) survives in the
hotel garden.
The 234 apartments are built around three gardens, each with its own
swimming pool. Best of the gardens is the Japanese - the others are Persian
and Andalucian. The entrance fee for the top-class on-site tennis club is
included in the price of the apartments. Although serious marketing began
only last year, 35 per cent are sold already, with a mix of buyers similar
to Sotogrande.
Prices range from Pta33m to Pta120m (for penthouses which have their own
private pools on the balcony). Cheaper units are farther from the sea but
the Persian Garden is only 20m back: it had received planning permission,
and work had begun, before a law was passed that all new buildings must be
100m back. Basement parking and storerooms are extra while the monthly
community charge includes water.
Close by is Marbella, now a much cleaner town thanks to its controversial
mayor, Jesus Gil y Gil, who has tackled its drugs and crime image with
gusto. The old part, particularly, is well worth an hour or two's
meandering.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink (The American Way): I'll take pastrami, in
Manhattan - Peter Berlin goes in search of a sandwich and finds a symbol of
an entire culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a New York familiar to millions who have never been there. It is
the screen city of Kojak, Cagney and Lacey, NYPD Blue and The French
Connection. Law-abiding television watchers around the world know exactly
what the inside of a New York police station looks like. We know these are
in Manhattan, even if they are only anonymous film sets, because when the
detectives are too busy to lunch, their colleagues bring them a pastrami
sandwich. For me the unsolved mystery at the end of every episode was: what
is pastrami?
My dictionary defines pastrami as 'highly seasoned smoked meat'. The word
comes from Romanian via Yiddish, imported to New York by Jewish immigrants.
I went to the Carnegie Deli on Broadway, itself a set in Woody Allen's film
Broadway Danny Rose. I ordered a pastrami sandwich. The waiter brought me an
entire cow, sliced, with two slices of rye bread. There was more meat on my
plate than Tevye (of Fiddler on the Roof fame) would have seen in a whole
year. The sandwich is not so much a reminder of the old country as a
monument to the wealth of the new home. But then at Dollars 9.45 (Pounds
6.50) it ought to be.
The meat was moist and fatty - my waiter had told me not to order 'lean'
because it would be too dry. The surprise was that it resembles boiled
rather than smoked meat; pastrami is smoked and boiled or steamed. It was
not particularly spicy. I found it dull and, defeated by the bulk, declined
the doggy bag.
Still I may be wrong. The sandwich came blessed by the thousands of
celebrities whose signed photos smile down from the walls at the low rows of
bare long tables, proud to have eaten at the Carnegie.
The Asian tourist at my table was evidently satisfied, he told his
girlfriend that this was the real New York experience. Tomorrow they would
come back for a corned beef sandwich.
Carnegie's boasts that it serves the 'best pastrami in the world'. So hoping
this was an exaggeration, I headed downtown, to the lower east side and the
2nd Avenue Deli.
The menu at the 2nd Avenue Diner offered the information that in 1910,
600,000 Jews lived on the lower east side. The menu also offered beef lo
mein and turkey kabobs (sic) as well as the more traditional 'Roumanian'
tenderloin steak, Nova Scotia lox and potato kugel.
I could not be tempted. I ordered a pastrami sandwich. The decor, like the
fare on the menu, was heavy and serious. The sandwich was much the same: an
over-generous serving of good but boring meat.
By the time I penetrated the seedier reaches of the lower east side my heart
was heavy, and not just with cholesterol. At Katz's, on a stretch of Houston
that used to be ghetto but has gone downhill, I received a pleasant
surprise.
Katz's has remained where it was and as it was (except for a modern cash
register) while the Jews of the lower east side have moved up and out. Down
one wall is a long counter behind which white-coated middle-aged men prepare
the food. The motto, unchanged in 50 years, is: 'Send a salami to your boy
in the army.'
I ordered a salami sandwich. The man in the white coat, Robert Krinsky, was
distraught when he heard I could not face any more pastrami. He took his
knife to his side of pastrami, a slim hunk of meat, which could not possibly
have yielded slices of the width that I had so far tried. It was drier and
tastier than elsewhere.
I asked Krinsky where pastrami came from. 'From New York,' he replied,
indignantly. 'Everything has to do with the fresh drinking water.'
(Manhattan takes its water from reservoirs in the mountains of upstate New
York.) The Indians, says Krinsky, were the first to use the local water to
preserve meat.
Salted, pickled or smoked meat and fish and vegetables were always a staple
of the Jewish ghettos in Europe, preserved against the bad times.
'Your water in England smells, if you go to Queens (a New York borough) the
water there smells.' Even the bread, said Krinsky, laying my meat between
two slices of plain, white rye, was better because of the water. 'You won't
have tasted better bread.'
Katz's, said Krinsky, a salesman as much as a sandwich maker, cooks its
pastrami, even though that makes the meat shrink and cooked pastrami must be
sliced by hand. Others, he confided mentioning no names, steam theirs.
Krinsky is nostalgic for a lost past. Katz's represents a better time and
place. 'It is not what it was,' he says gesturing to the street outside,
'nothing is. It used to be better. For me the 1950s were best.' Katz's -
large, bare, full of atmosphere - is the place for tourists to find a good,
manageable pastrami sandwich. It may put some visitors in mind of Kojak; for
Jewish New Yorkers, like Krinsky, it conjures up memories, not of the old
country, but of old New York, a city of immigrant communities where a waiter
could look out of the door and see familiar faces.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink (The American Way): A beer with a diva in New
York's front room / City of bars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HAVERSON and ERIC REGULY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Manhattan, diversity is everything. There is something in this
inexhaustible city to meet every need, or indulge every fantasy, and its
bars are no exception.
If you hunger for reggae with your sushi, bikers' leather with your beer, or
simply want to prolong the night with a strong drink and a sympathetic ear,
Manhattan's bars have it all.
There is the saloon that has survived two world wars, two stock market
crashes, prohibition and flared trousers, twice. The jazz joint that is so
laid back it never bothers to take down the Christmas decorations. Or the
bar where regulars gather around an upright piano to belt out Broadway show
tunes late into the night.
No other city can boast such variety, and nowhere else are bars so tightly
woven into the fabric of everyday life. They are not just the preserve of
the boisterous male; they are New York's front room. Here are a few of our
favourites.
ARTHUR'S TAVERN The old man with chalk-white hair and thick black spectacles
has been an Arthur's regular since the late 1940s. 'No Cover / No Minimum,'
has little to do with his unfailing patronage; it is the music, played in a
way and in a place that reminds him of his youth. Arthur's is a rare holdout
from the Truman era - Greenwich Village unplugged.
Although it is a jazz joint, you do not have to be a jazz buff to enjoy
Arthur's. The music never overwhelms, even if you sit at the rickety counter
that surrounds the musicians' podium at the back of the bar. The place is so
relaxed and unpretentious that it never even bothers to take down its
Christmas decorations.
There are no cover charges, cappuccino makers and no-smoking signs. 'Look at
this place,' says one patron. 'You'd think you were in the 1940s.'
MARIE'S CRISIS The barmaid is a diva with thick, false eyelashes, diamond
earrings and a provocative walk. His name is Albert Walsh and his large
frame is too lumpy for taffeta and velvet. He wears a white tank-top and
white shorts. While the drag effect may be half-hearted, the singing is not.
Albert puts down his tray of drinks. Pianist Sam Austin, in the middle of a
medley from Show Boat, strikes up the crowd-pleasing 'Your Love'. Albert
clasps his hands together, cocks his head and bats his eyelashes. His voice
soars as if he were on Broadway, centre stage. The patrons, mostly gays and
lesbians, are enthralled. Brava diva] they shout. A moment later, Albert is
back slinging vodka-and-cranberries and greeting the regulars with a peck on
the cheek.
Welcome to Marie's Crisis. This old bar - Thomas Paine, author of the
Revolutionary War's 'Crisis' papers, died on the site in 1809 - is roaring
good fun whether or not you are gay.
An appreciation for Sondheim and Rogers and Hammerstein is more important
than your sexual preference. People come here to gather around the piano and
sing, and almost everyone joins in. There is something wonderful about
belting out show tunes with complete strangers and not feeling self
conscious. PETE'S TAVERNNestled south of Gramercy Park on a quiet,
tree-lined back street, Pete's Tavern fits like a favourite wool cardigan. A
'speakeasy' during the Prohibition era, Pete's has played host to numerous
Gotham notables in its 130 years, including the turn-of-the-century writer
and celebrated boozer O Henry, and the Tammany Hall Democrats, who struck
many political deals here. The atmosphere of those times still lingers in
its dark, woody interior - a place for serious drinking and scheming.
Pete's is also a bar for all seasons. In winter it is warm and welcoming, in
summer, tables snake around the corner of the block outside, and the dark
rooms inside offer a blessedly cool refuge from the humid heat. It has all
the features of an old New York tavern - a tin ceiling, tiled floors, and
cosy wooden booths - and serves food in a couple of converted carriage-house
rooms at the back.
It is the bar in the front room, however, which lures drinkers back. Often
cramped, usually cheerfully noisy, and staffed by wise-cracking bartenders,
Pete's is authentic, timeless New York.
CAFE LUXEMBOURGIt is midnight and Cafe Luxembourg is changing from Art Deco
bistro to Art Deco bar. The kitchen cools down. Three pretty waitresses in
tight black dresses and wine-dark lipstick share a strawberry sorbet at the
end of the bar. The slinky redhead behind the zinc counter pours Veuve
Clicquot into a crystal flute and greets a patron with a kiss while Can't
Help Loving That Man Of Mine plays softly in the background.
The bar at Cafe Luxembourg, one of the more urbane and vibrant restaurants
near the Lincoln Center, is no afterthought even though it is fairly small.
Its style is Tenth Arrondissement, pre-war, with its Deco light fixtures,
mirrors, black and cream tiles and chrome cash register. Vodka martinis,
Chardonnay and champagne are the preferred drinks here. The bartenders are
invariably exotic-looking women, some of whom can legitimately say they are
between roles.
CHUMLEY'SLealand Stanford Chumley, a stage-coach driver turned journalist,
would not approve of the 1990s' rendition of the bar he founded in 1927.
Back then, the West Village speakeasy was the sequestered court of New
York's young Bohemians. It was full of trendy writers, actors and
socialists. Die-hard 'Wobblies' - members of the rebellious, left-leaning
union that had blossomed before the Great War as the Industrial Workers of
the World - made it their refuge.
Today, Chumley's is a cacophonous fusion of restaurant and bar, the patrons
of which look like they spent their formative years reading MBA textbooks,
not Marx. Nonetheless, it is well worth a visit.
The food is decent, the beer selection is superb and, clientele aside, it
retains the dark, smoky aroma of its Prohibition past. Finding Chumley's is
half the fun. It is located behind an unmarked door on enchanting Bedford
Street. The original structure was built before the Revolutionary War, in
1732.
During any one week, as many as 60 brands - all of them from American
micro-breweries - are on tap. A warning: ever faithful to its past,
Chumley's does not accept credit cards.
Arthur's: 86 Bedford St, west of 7th Ave. Telephone: 212 675 4449.
Marie's Crisis, 59 Grove St, west of 7th Ave. Tel: 212 243 9323.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink (The American Way): California dreaming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An enjoyable part of my job is answering readers' queries about where to
eat. But recently I was asked a more general question by a restaurateur who
will be opening a large restaurant on London's South Bank this autumn. He
was planning to send his chef on a restaurant research programme and wanted
to know where I would suggest.
Five years ago the answer would have been a tour of France. Two or three
years ago I would have said northern Italy. Today my immediate response was
California - with a stop-over in New York.
I suggested this itinerary not just for the pleasure of eating Jeremiah
Tower's food at Stars, San Francisco, or finding what Alice Waters was up to
at Chez Panisse in Berkeley, or of negotiating the culinary maelstrom
generated by Manhattan's 13,000 eating places.
The main reason was to see what makes food in the US so attractive, exciting
and affordable. What American chefs and restaurateurs have done, more
successfully than any other country's, over the past decade, is look at the
entire eating-out experience - from the consumers' view as well as their
own.
In doing so they have started with several advantages. First, America is the
world's largest, most efficient food producer - but for ambitious chefs
bigger and cheaper does not necessarily mean better.
Led by Alice Waters, American chefs have dictated what they want: the best
local produce grown for flavour and an emphasis on regional dishes prepared
with the best local ingredients.
Second, restaurateurs owe a great deal to the American wine industry. The
American Institute of Food and Wine, based in Santa Barbara and the
brainchild of Julia Child and wine makers Dick Graff and Robert Mondavi, has
educated thousands of customers and trained many chefs.
The Beringer winery in Napa runs a course which professional chefs are keen
to join. In Mendocino, the Fetzer winery uses talented chef John Ash to cook
its own organically-grown produce to match its organically-produced wines.
Such a symbiosis cannot happen in the UK.
Perhaps the most important, factor is the enthusiasm of the American diner.
It was 33 years ago that Julia Child became America's first television cook.
She has converted millions to the joys of good food. In the US today not
only do food and cookery programmes get considerable prominence on PBS, the
educational channel, but Channel 54 has become the television food network.
Millions of Americans buy Gourmet and Bon Appetit magazines every month - in
contrast to the UK which is still without a really successful independent
food, wine and leisure magazine.
American restaurateurs have more than matched their customers' enthusiasm
for better food and service and have overcome major obstacles with a
typically American 'can-do' philosophy.
When the neo-Prohibitionist lobby threatened to dent sales of alcohol,
American restaurateurs were the first to offer a comprehensive range of
wines by the glass. Drink less but better has been a successful marketing
campaign.
When the going got rough, tough American restaurateurs got going. With the
recession causing the prospect of thousands of empty tables in the spring
and summer of 1992, some 100 New York restaurateurs devised and promoted the
Dollars 19.92 lunch which filled tables and rekindled demand.
Two final snippets whetted my appetite for a culinary trip around the US.
The first was a late-night discussion with Jean-Georges Vongerichten, one of
New York's most exciting chefs. In addition to his two restaurants, Jo-Jo's
and Vong's, Vongerichten plans to open a third in the autumn, where you will
pick up a trolley at the door, buy fish, whole and filleted, which you can
take home and cook or it will be cooked for you. Finally, there will be a
restaurant proper.
This weekend menus arrived for dinners to be held in Chicago which exemplify
the style of cooking which makes eating out in America so exciting. The
celebrated chef Charlie Trotter will be cooking yellowtail tuna, marinated
with chilli and sizzling sesame oil, diver-harvested scallops with charred
bell pepper tapenade, organically-raised venison with sweet potato
tortellini and, as a dessert, a poached plum with star anise ice cream. But
an airline ticket was not included.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Travel: Naked in Slovenia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILMA PATERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sweet, melancholy sounds of a folk song echo down the corridor, its
words incomprehensible except for the last of each verse - 'Maria'. I am
waiting alone, naked and apprehensive. The melody changes to the major mode,
the pace livens, and then the singer comes in smiling, wheeling a trolley.
She is pretty, plump and lip-sticked. I understand nothing of what she says,
but I give myself up completely.
She places a great lump of steaming mud on the bed I am standing beside, and
in her seductive language she tells me to lie on top of it.
She takes more armfuls of mud and pins me down so that I am immobilised. It
covers my abdomen, my shoulders and my arms with a great fiery weight. Then
she wraps me first in a cotton sheet and after that she swaddles me in a
thick blanket, all the while murmuring babytalk.
She has set the timer for 20 minutes of this exquisite torture, and every so
often she breaks off her song and tenderly wipes the sweat from my brow.
When the allotted time has elapsed she offers a further five minutes - which
I decline - and then a welcome shower. Then she brings strong, sweet coffee
prepared in the Turkish manner, and a bottle of slivovka, the fiery spirit
of the country.
A visit to the Slovenian spa of Zrece seemed a must after a week of
gourmandising in country farmhouses. First we had the water massage, when we
were immersed in enormous computer-controlled baths heavily scented with
sweetly aromatic oils. Then the medicinal bentonite mud treatment, and after
that an agreeable swim in the naturally warm thermal waters of Zrece, this
most recently discovered of all Slovenian spas. It was immensely relaxing.
Spas in Slovenia were highly developed under the old communist regime, and
they are remarkably sophisticated. Technology is advanced and the treatments
extremely varied. Slovenian patients are referred by doctors for treatment
after operations or injuries, or for many varied complaints ranging from
rheumatism to diseases of the peripheral nervous system and psychiatric
stresses. But for fit, healthy people, too, the spas offer considerable
benefits at prices which are incredibly cheap by western standards.
It is the same with Slovenian farmhouse accommodation. In this tiny but
diverse and very beautiful country you can discover tastes and sensations
that are all but forgotten in the west. Processed, industrialised food is
practically unknown in Slovenia, and in the country you find meat which is
produced on the farm, milk and cream straight from the cow, home-made
salamis and prosciutti, cheeses, pickles and preserves, salads, vegetables
and fruits from the garden, or from the woods (strawberries, raspberries and
bilberries), and excellent wine.
If western tourists have been shunning these delights in the belief that
Slovenia is war-torn, Italians - and bears - know better. Bears have been
making their way north from Croatia in search of a haven, to the
consternation of farmers, if not hunters. Many of the latter are Italians.
But mainly, Italians go to Slovenia to sample the delights of a peasant
cuisine similar to that of north-east Italy but which (unlike theirs) is
preserved intact, at least for now.
Information about farmhouse holidays, as well as spas, can be had from
Slovenia Pursuits: Brummells, Guilden Morden, Royston, Hertfordshire SG8
OJP, tel: 0763-852646. There are flights from Heathrow and Manchester to
Ljubljana, with Adria Airways. Prices for farmhouse holidays, including
flights (B&amp;B in high season) are approximately Pounds 280 per person per
week; full-board supplement: Pounds 45. The Slovenian Tourist Office is at
Moghul House, 57 Grosvenor Street, London W1X 9DA, tel: 071-495-4688.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Travel: Queen Victoria drank here - Adrian Gardiner tours
Scotland's distilleries and samples the 'water of life'
</HEADLINE>

Want to know the secret of eternal life? It is whisky, according to James
Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd: 'If a body could find oot the exac' proper
proportion and quantity that ought to be drunk every day, and keep to that,
I verily trow that he might leeve forever, withoot dying at a', and that
doctors and kirkyairds would go oot o' fashion.'
After my first distillery visit on the newly-opened 'Whisky Trail' I was
little wiser about the process. The guide's Aberdonian dialect was
incomprehensible even to a lowland Scot. That was 10 years ago. Today things
are different. Distilleries on the Whisky Trail have multilingual guides and
audio-visual presentations in seven languages, including Japanese. All you
have to get your tongue round is a dram of Highland hospitality: uisge
beatha, Gaelic for the 'water of life'.
There are about 200 distilleries in Scotland - six on the island of Islay
alone - and the greatest concentration is on Speyside, the Grampian region
between Aberdeen and Inverness. The Whisky Trail is a route of about 70
miles, linking eight prominent ones.
Tomintoul, the highest village in the Highlands, is at the southern end of
the circuit. Here the peaty burns which spring from the Cromdale and Ladder
hills supply one of the three ingredients of malt whisky. The others are
yeast and malted barley.
That so many distilleries now have visitor centres is the result of the only
real change in the production process in 150 years: few distilleries still
malt their own barley on site. It makes better economics to buy it in from
specialists, so the empty maltings are put to use as whisky museums, shops
and visitor centres.
A distillery visit will acquaint you with the folklore and peculiar
terminology of whisky. The malted barley is steeped in hot water in a mash
tun and the liquid, known as 'wort', is piped into washbacks where it is
fermented into 'wash'. This is distilled twice; of the second distillate,
only the middle portion is kept: the 'feints' and 'foreshots' are discarded.
Whisky off the still is colourless. Caramel is sometimes added to blended
whisky, but the honey colour of single malts comes from long maturation in
oak casks. Sherry casks are preferred. During this time - eight, 10, 12, 15
or more years - at least a quarter of the spirit is lost by evaporation: the
'angel's share'.
There are things, however, the Scots rarely mention: that tartan and
bagpipes originated outside Scotland, and that the father of the Scotch
whisky industry was an Irishman. In 1831 Aeneas Coffey invented a still
which made continuous distilling possible, enabling whisky to be produced in
bulk.
Whisky is a big employer and a big export earner. At one end is an elaborate
worldwide marketing machine. At the other: skilled trades which, but for
whisky, would have died out. Specialist companies in Glasgow and the
Lowlands make and repair casks (coopering) while coppersmiths maintain the
stills.
'Rome was built on seven hills, Dufftown on its seven stills.' From
Dufftown, home to Glenfiddich, we travel clockwise to Tamnavulin (the 'mill
on the hill') and to The Glenlivet, which in 1824 became the first licensed
distillery in the Highlands.
Following the River Avon north we meet the River Spey and the distilleries
of Glenfarclas, Tamdhu and Cardhu. North again is the town of Rothes, home
to Glen Grant, and a few miles east is Strathisla in Keith. Strathisla is
the heart of the famous Chivas Regal.
Also worth visiting is Dallas Dhu near Forres. This distillery was a
casualty of the 1970s recession and was taken over by Historic Scotland as a
museum.
Elsewhere in Scotland, both Dalwhinnie and Blair Atholl are easily
accessible from the A9 Perth-Inverness road, and from Pitlochry it is two
miles to Moulin, where a little whitewashed huddle of cottages called
Edradour forms the smallest distillery in the country, producing a mere 600
gallons a week.
While travelling this north-east corner of Caledonia you might take in the
castle country of Aberdeenshire, and drive the 'Royal Route' from Braemar to
Aberdeen. It follows the Dee, second only to the Spey as a notable salmon
river.
Braemar is not a town to linger in, unless you are a fan of tartan tat. Its
only merit is the cottage where Robert Louis Stevenson stayed in 1881 and
wrote most of Treasure Island. There is a gravestone in the churchyard
inscribed 'John Silver'. Aboyne and Ballater are more dignified: solid
conservative towns.
Short detours off the main A93 bring you to some remarkable turreted
castles. Craigievar is perhaps the best known. Now in the care of the
National Trust for Scotland, this fortified tower house, complete with
plasterwork ceilings and secret passage, is said to have inspired Walt
Disney's drawings for the castle in Sleeping Beauty.
Crathes, just outside Banchory, is another fine castle set in famous formal
gardens. But the main-crop tourists make for Balmoral, an architectural fake
built by Prince Albert around 1850. Queen Victoria had a lifelong love
affair with Deeside. Signposts featuring that well-known silhouette now link
her favourite places on the Victorian Trail.
Victoria was known to be fond of a dram or two. You can follow her footsteps
today to the Royal Lochnagar Distillery. Victoria lived a full life and died
aged 82. Perhaps the Ettrick Shepherd was right.
Maps of the Whisky, Castle and Victorian Trails are available from the
Tourist Information Centre, 45 Station Road, Banchory AB3 3XX, tel.
033-022-066. August is the distillers' holiday month. Visitor centres are
open but you might not see the whole operation in action.

published by Thomas-Lochar. It includes a chapter on the Whisky Trail.

FT  07 MAY 94 / The Nature of Things: Is the quark hunt over?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Momentous news last week from the Fermilab atom smasher outside Chicago:
physicists have discovered the top quark, the last of 12 subatomic building
blocks believed to make up the whole material universe.
Or have they? The nature of the top quark - it disintegrates into a shower
of other particles less than one billion-billion-billionth of a second after
its creation - makes it impossible to 'discover' in the traditional Eureka
sense. Its existence has to be deduced by an extremely complicated
mathematical analysis of millions of collisions in the Fermilab accelerator,
looking for patterns that could only come from the creation and immediate
disintegration of a top quark.
The evidence, to be published as a 200-page scientific paper by a team of
440 physicists, shows that there is still some doubt. Statistical analysis
gives 1-in-400 odds that the Fermilab patterns occurred by chance and had
nothing to do with the top quark.
Although 399-in-400 may seem good enough odds to claim the top quark's
discovery, some scientists would like to see more convincing evidence for
such a fundamental finding. They are well aware that Carlo Rubbia and
colleagues at Cern, the European particle physics centre near Geneva,
thought they had found the top quark 10 years ago - and then turned out to
be victims of coincidence and wishful thinking.
If the quark hunt has been successfully concluded, it is one of the most
overdue discoveries in science. Physicists have been looking for the top
quark since creating its companion, the bottom quark, at Fermilab in 1977.
It will fill the last gap in the 12 fundamental particles - six quarks and
six leptons - which, according to the 'standard model' theory, make up all
matter that has existed in the universe.
To appreciate the significance of the quark, think back to the 1860s when
Dmitri Mendeleev drew up his periodic table of the 92 chemical elements from
hydrogen to uranium, by systematically studying their properties.
The underlying reasons for the patterns revealed in the periodic table
remained a mystery until the discovery at the end of the 19th and the
beginning of the 20th century of the particles that make up the atom: the
electron, proton and neutron. Then scientists realised how the chemistry of
each element - the way atoms join with other atoms to form molecules -
depended on its atomic structure.
The mid-20th century view of the atom, with negatively-charged electrons
orbiting around a nucleus made up of positively-charged protons and
uncharged neutrons, was correct, so far as it went. Scientists today still
regard the electron as a fundamental indivisible particle - one of the six
leptons. But protons and neutrons have their own internal structure.
Each proton and neutron consist of three point-like particles which Murray
Gell-Mann, the great Californian physicist, named quarks in 1964, after the
line 'Three quarks for Muster Mark' in James Joyce's Finnegans Wake.
The idea of quarks and leptons came from studying patterns among the myriad
of short-lived particles detected in cosmic radiation from space and created
on earth in atom smashers. Their properties could be explained if they
derived from combinations of quarks and/or leptons, just as the periodic
table had been explained in terms of protons, neutrons and electrons.
According to the standard model, both the six quarks and the six leptons
come in three sets of twins. The quarks bear the whimsical names 'up' and
'down', 'strange' and 'charm', 'top' and 'bottom'; the leptons are
'electron' and 'electron neutrino', 'muon' and 'muon neutrino', 'tau' and
'tau neutrino'. But the theory sheds no light on why there should be 12
building blocks nor on their peculiar distribution of masses.
Whereas individual leptons can exist free, quarks are always bound together
with other quarks in either pairs or triplets. The proton, for example, can
be seen as a tiny bag in which two up quarks and one down quark can wander
freely but from which they cannot escape.
All ordinary matter familiar to us on earth is made up from the up and down
quarks and electrons. Neutrinos are ghostly particles, which pervade the
universe but are almost impossible to detect because they carry no electric
charge or mass. The other, heavier quarks and leptons exist only for tiny
fractions of a second under ordinary temperatures and pressures but they
probably play an important role in much more extreme conditions - inside a
neutron star, for instance, or in the early universe soon after the Big
Bang.
Although the discovery of the top quark completes the list of particles that
can come together to create matter, it is far from the end of the story. The
universe also contains non-matter particles performing other functions, such
as transmitting forces. Best known is the photon which carries the
electromagnetic force. Quarks are held together in the atomic nucleus by
gluons which transmit the strong nuclear force.
The most wanted particle of all, after the top quark, will be the Higgs
boson, which is believed to play a role in giving all the other particles
their mass - in non-technical terms, their weight or substance. Cern wants
to spend Pounds 1bn building the world's most powerful atom smasher to find
it.
If further experiments at Fermilab this year confirm the almost-discovery of
the top quark, supporters of the Standard Model will be highly relieved that
a theory of matter built up over three decades has not collapsed. But it
leaves them with many more mysteries to solve.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Vietnamese remember the day the fortress fell: The 40th
anniversary of the French surrender at Dien Bien Phu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CLEVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forty years ago this weekend in a remote corner of north-west Vietnam, the
French garrison of Dien Bien Phu surrendered to the besieging Communist
Vietnamese forces. To preserve a little amour-propre, General Christian de
Castries, the French commander, raised no white flag but simply ordered his
troops to cease firing.
The French, French Union and Foreign Legion forces were exhausted; with
nearly 2,000 dead and 7,000 missing or wounded after 55 days of remorseless
fighting they had been pummelled into the mud and could resist no longer.
The loss of the battle marked the end of the First Indochina War. Had a
37-year-old John F Kennedy taken more careful note of the French defeat, the
appellation First would be redundant.
In Geneva, on Saturday May 8, 1954, Pham Van Dong, later to become Prime
Minister of a united Vietnam, listened to the strained voice of Georges
Bidault, French Foreign Minister, as he conceded defeat.
Negotiations at the Geneva peace conference had ebbed and flowed, reflecting
events in Vietnam. But General Vo Nguyen Giap, commander of the Communist
Viet Minh, had dealt this historic victory in the nick of time.
Holding the moral and military high ground, as well as 7,000 newly-captured
French prisoners, Vietnam had a strong hand. During the next 74 days of
negotiations, the French recognised the Communist government of the north
and the end of 150 years of colonial rule in Vietnam.
The battle of Dien Bien Phu was one of the most decisive battles of this
century: it spelt out clearly what was known to many but what others chose
to ignore - colonialism was morally unacceptable, economically ruinous and
now militarily unenforceable.
But what was Dien Bien Phu? And why did such significance attach to the loss
of the French fortress? The town of Dien Bien Phu and its wide open valley
provided access to the upper Mekong River and to Luang Prabang, the royal
capital, and Vientiane, the administrative capital, of neighbouring Laos.
General Henri Navarre, the French supreme commander in Indochina, was
determined to prevent further Viet Minh incursion into Laos and built the
fort to block the route. Dien Bien Phu's significance was simply this: if
the French, with US support, could not hold just one strategic fort their
authority in Vietnam (ever tenuous and always imposed) was at an end.
By March 1954, after five months of fitful progress, the French garrison was
more or less ready: the central command post, complete with underground
hospital, air strip and howitzer emplacements, was protected by outlying
strongpoints atop flanking hills, each within range of supporting fire from
its neighbour.
But the strongpoints, supposedly named after de Castries' mistresses -
Beatrice, Gabrielle, Anne-Marie among them - fell like dominoes: Beatrice
fell after just one day's fighting.
The French defence disintegrated, revealing flawed strategy and hopeless
under-estimation of what a mobilised People's Army could do.
The Viet Minh dragged heavy artillery and anti-aircraft guns over high
mountain passes to positions in the forested hills surrounding the French
camp. Tunnels were dug right through these hills and Viet Minh artillerymen
were able to fire from them with virtual impunity, concealed by jungle.
Shells rained down on the French, almost immediately preventing use of the
airstrip and isolating the strongpoints.
The loss of the airstrip was a catastrophe: supplies could not be landed and
the wounded, who could not be evacuated, piled up in recesses in the walls
of the sick bays and then the trenches. Reinforcements, food, medical
supplies (whole medical teams), ammunition and fuel had to be parachuted in.
As the Viet Minh advanced with what Giap called 'a tactic of combined
nibbling and full scale attack', so the French-held area shrunk from 10 to
two, to just one square kilometre.
And as the drop zone into which men and material had to be parachuted grew
smaller, so the flak which civilian and military pilots had to face
intensified. Experienced US pilots claimed the barrage, from Soviet and
Chinese-supplied 37mm anti-aircraft guns, was worse than any they had
experienced over heavily-defended German targets 10 years earlier.
So the Dakotas and C119 transports flew higher and higher as the drop zone
grew smaller and smaller. Dreadfully high losses followed, as parachutes
drifted over enemy lines.
As the action progressed, the beleaguered encampment found itself on the
sharp end of its own shells - most terrifyingly the delayed-action 105mm
shells, which penetrated the bunkers before exploding - unlike the normal
variety which exploded comparatively harmlessly upon impact.
Luck was against the French too: in a freak incident, a hapless pilot rolled
to avoid the flak and accidentally dropped on to Vietnamese lines a pouch
containing detailed maps of French positions, the latest aerial photographs
pinpointing Vietnamese anti-aircraft positions and code names of all enemy
targets.
The pilot had pushed back his canopy in preparation for a drop, but became
unnerved by the accuracy of Vietnamese shooting and banked. The pouch fell
from the cockpit.
Memories of two of the better-known heroes of the battle have faded with
time but merit recall. Both were medics who became trapped at Dien Bien Phu.
Genevieve de Galard-Terraube, known as the 'Angel of Dien Bien Phu', was a
medical orderly who travelled on the evacuation flights that flew between
Dien Bien Phu and Hanoi in the early days of the siege.
When she became trapped after her aircraft was blown-up on take-off, she
remained to care for the wounded. 'She was the only one who could get the
wounded to be content with five cigarettes a day without grumbling,'
remarked camp doctor Major Paul Grauwin.
Grauwin himself had agreed to stand in at Dien Bien Phu for a fortnight as a
locum, prior to sailing home to France. He too became trapped when the air
strip was closed. He operated on hundreds of abdominal cases and head
wounds, and he amputated dozens of limbs in the field hospital.
Conditions deteriorated as the monsoon set in: water streamed along the
passageways and the clay floor became a sea of mud into which discarded
needles fell. And heat and humidity produced a plague of flies and maggots,
crawling over the hands, faces and ears of wounded men as they slept at
night.
Grauwin tried to allay the men's panic by explaining that the maggots ate
only pus and rotting flesh leaving a nice clean wound.
But in spite of French heroism, and the best efforts of the large German
contingent of the Foreign Legion, Dien Bien Phu eventually fell, finally
overrun by the waves of Viet Minh infantry sacrificed by General Giap in
response to pressure from Geneva for a quick, decisive result.
Perhaps the greatest tragedy of Dien Bien Phu is that the Americans, who
worked closely with the French in supplying the garrison, and who at one
stage offered bombers and even discussed the use of nuclear weapons, failed
to see how the French experience applied to their own military adventurism
in Vietnam less than 10 years later.
It is quite remarkable that they not only believed they could hold a
now-divided Vietnam by force but they made the same tactical errors and fell
prey to tried, tested, and perfected Vietnamese strategies.
The US was, of course, blinded by the holiness of its crusade. But the cost
of America's pledge to pay any price or bear any burden for the survival of
liberty was to be millions of Vietnamese lives.
Today, 40 years on, the scars of battle have healed and France is one of the
largest foreign investors in Vietnam. It is nearly 20 years since the
unification of Vietnam, and in north-west Vietnam, the government is
preparing the country's newest tourist attraction.
De Castries' bunker has been rebuilt; the battlefield is liberally scattered
with rusting tank hulls (eight in all - two others still see service in the
Vietnamese army); and American-made 105mm and 155mm howitzers point
menacingly skywards, complete with their maker's stamp - United Engineers &amp;
Foundry Co - or servicing details and acquisition number, ORD DEPT M2A1
152473.
On hill Eliane 2 (scene of the fiercest fighting and known to the Vietnamese
as A1) is a war memorial, a bunker and a tank, Grazielle.
Around the back of A1 is the entrance to a tunnel dug by coal miners from
Hon Gai. The shaft ran several hundred metres to just below the French
strongpoint; it was filled with 1,000kg of high explosives and detonated at
11pm on May 6, signalling the beginning of the final assault. The huge
crater remains.
Quite whether all this justifies the new twice-weekly air service from Hanoi
remains to be seen. Dien Bien Phu can hardly be considered an attractive
place in spite of, and because of, the tourist infrastructure of karaoke
bars and other essentials.
The town is a building site and clouds of dust mingle with smoke from the
brick kilns and the burning hills to reduce visibility to a few hundred
metres.
Apart from a few trees on A1, the hills are stripped of vegetation - not
French napalm but centuries of shifting cultivation.
The barren hills and polluted atmosphere would have served those entombed
French soldiers well - but not, one suspects, French tourists.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Lunch with the FT: A snail man making tracks - Michael
Thompson-Noel meets Dr Steve Jones, geneticist and commentator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Snail platter? Snails in a spring onion sauce? Such thoughts occurred to me
as I made my way to the Savoy Grill, London, for lunch with Dr Steve Jones,
one of Britain's wittiest and most accessible commentators on the mysteries
of science.
As a malacologist and geneticist, Jones has studied snails for more than 25
years, and has said he would rather be regarded as the world's foremost
snail geneticist than as a world-class communicator. Come to think of it, he
added, he was the world's foremost snail geneticist; there were almost no
others.
In the event, I forgot about snails. We both had oeufs cocotte, after which
our preferences diverged in textbook fashion: his to grilled turbot, mine to
the caremalised glumness of the Savoy's braised oxtail.
Anyway, says Jones, he is virtually 'snailed-out'. These days he is into
slugs. 'I am used to being mocked for snails, but slugs are guaranteed to
stun anyone into silence.'
He is professor of genetics at the Galton Laboratory of University College,
London, and gave the 1991 Reith Lectures on BBC radio on genetics and
evolution. They were widely praised and led, last year, to his well-received
book, The Language of the Genes, now selling briskly in paperback.
He is working on a new book, Sex, Age, Death, as well as a BBC television
series - seven 50-minute programmes - called Origins. I had wanted to meet
him since receiving a copy of The Language of the Genes for my birthday,
inscribed, erroneously, by an otherwise reliable colleague: 'To Michael, on
your 50th . . . so old, yet still evolving' - an over-statement of 2.040816
per cent.
Jones is 50. He was in high spirits when we met. He had just celebrated his
birthday and sloughed off, after five years' toil, the 'nightmare' burden of
the chairmanship of his department. He is treating 1994 as a sabbatical
year.
His hatred of bureaucracy runs deep. The new Britain, he has written, 'gets
more like the old Soviet Union every day - forms in triplicate, reports to
higher authority, and five-year plans. Nowhere is the new Stalinism more
obvious than in education'.
And, like many scientists, he has had immense difficulty getting funds for
research - 10 appeals have been rejected. 'Over the years I have researched
different things - mainly fruit flies, snails and slugs. When I was an
undergraduate I was given a research project on snails, and it has taken
more than 25 years to finish it. In real terms the amounts I have asked for
have been going down, while the real costs have gone up, because of
technology. Like health, there is no limit to the amount you can spend on
science.'
At least his public profile has given him the freedom to comment tartly on
things that displease him, including professorial pay. I said that I
imagined his book sales and journalism provided useful extra income.
'Certainly,' he said. 'My salary as a professor is Pounds 34,500; for
Origins, the BBC is paying me twice that. I'm not particularly complaining
about my salary, but I am complaining about trying to recruit people in
their late 20s for Pounds 17,000.'
He is a small and intense man, spike-haired, who speaks so quickly that it
is hard to hear him properly. The day he telephoned, I had to ask him to
repeat himself.
'Sorry,' he said, 'I tend to mumble.'
'Where would you like to lunch?'
'Anywhere,' he said. 'I often miss out lunch. Isn't there a restaurant at
London Bridge?'
'Oh, no,' I said. 'You're thinking of one of Terry Conran's. The food's
quite good but the acoustics are dreadful. I mumble, too. Anyway, for Lunch
with the FT we're entitled to kill the fatted calf. I'll take you to the
Savoy.'
We were awarded the best table. The professor surveyed the room with immense
caution. I told him that in myth, the Savoy Grill at lunch-time was
populated by movers and shakers, but that in my experience most of the
customers seemed obsessed with just one topic: the D-Mark-dollar rate.
The professor smiled winterily. He is a humorous man himself. It is one of
the reasons his book is such a good read. Yet often, humour does not travel.
The Language of the Genes has already been published in the Netherlands,
Germany and Korea, and a US printing is being readied, but he is not sure
how it will be received in the US.
In a chapter called The Evolution of Utopia, Jones says that the (fairly
recent) change in human mating patterns - outbreeding - may mark the
beginning of a new age of genetic well-being. 'Outbreeding,' he writes, 'is
not usually due to deliberate policy. Much of it arises . . . as a
by-product of social change . . . there is little doubt that the most
important event in recent human evolution was the invention of the bicycle.'
Fine, you might think. 'But I am having great trouble with the American
editors,' says Jones. 'They didn't get the bicycle joke. I explained it.
'But the bicycle isn't very old,' they said. 'Shouldn't you say the wheel?'
But then they said: 'What about Australia? The first people who got to
Australia got there by boat. Shouldn't you say that the most important event
in recent human evolution was the invention of transportation?''
I asked Jones whether he was fed up with people asking him to predict their
gene-ordained futures - whether they would die of this disease, or that. But
they do not. Jones knows which blood group he is, but almost nothing else
about his own genetic make-up. And he thinks it possible that, despite rapid
progress in genetics research, many people will not want to know what the
future holds.
Even so, genetic testing raises great ethical and practical questions.
Already, for example, insurance companies are refusing to insure those
doomed to Huntington's disease, and there are many ailments of a similar
kind. In Britain, about 10,000 people have a one in two chance of carrying
the Huntington's gene, but only a small number have come forward since the
test was first offered in 1987.
'What does impress itself on me,' says Jones, 'is not curiosity about
genetics but the way people blame science and scientists for bad news of all
kinds. It is extraordinary. Even ostensibly well-educated people hold
science accountable for the things it discovers. I tell them that the
dangers from progress in genetics are far less marked than those in physics
and chemistry.'
At the end of The Language of the Genes, Jones argues that the human biology
of the future may not be very different from that of the past. It may even
be that 'humans are almost at the end of their evolutionary road, that we
are as near to our biological Utopia as we are ever likely to get.'
I said I thought this sounded conservative. 'Science,' agreed Jones, 'is
intrinsically an intensely conservative occupation.'
I said I had been struck by the difference between the short shrift he gives
eugenics and his description of the potential for combatting human disease
and improving the human condition offered by gene therapy and biological
engineering - applied evolution.
'Surely,' I said, 'the eugenicists' basic wish, to improve the fitness of
humanity, was not, in itself, contemptible? Won't genetic screening and gene
therapy help do the trick? You say in your book that 'in life, tinkering
works,' and that 'the new biology has brought little but benefit'.'
He agreed: there could be nothing wrong with wishing to improve human health
or the lot of the disadvantaged. Nor was there anything intrinsically unwise
with the conviction that a smaller world population might help humanity.
But he was determined to hold the line there. After all, Francis Galton,
Charles Darwin's odd-ball cousin and the father of eugenics, founded the
laboratory in which Jones now works at University College, London - the
world's first human genetics institute.
'The agenda of the original eugenicists was to improve the human race,' said
Jones, 'whereas the agenda of modern genetics is to improve the health of
hundreds of thousands of people. That is the difference.'
We found no time whatsoever for the D-Mark-dollar rate.

FT  07 MAY 94 / 'Could you spare five minutes?': Journalist John White tells
his own experience of redundancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birthday presents come in all shapes and sizes. On the day before my 38th I
was made redundant. As a journalist I had written plenty about unemployment
over the years, but I soon found I had never really understood the word:
redundancy.
I was not alone in facing the call-up to the ranks of the unemployed. First
in line was the editor of our Emap-owned Cambridge-based free newspaper,
known quaintly as the Town Crier. And queueing right behind me was our
photographer. Three out of five members of the editorial staff out of a job
in less than 15 minutes.
Mick Ferris, the editor, was summoned to the managing director's office with
the apparently innocuous phrase: 'Could you spare five minutes?'
Five minutes, 10 minutes, an hour, days, weeks, months. Mick had plenty of
time on his hands, though he did not at that point know it.
He returned clutching a white envelope in one hand and moved to turn off his
computer terminal. He had been told not to talk to the rest of us, he said,
but he had been made redundant and they wanted to see me next.
Knowing the state of the economy and realising our small-time outfit had
been losing money for some time, I had been mentally preparing myself for
this moment for more than a year, while continuing to hope for the best.
I had reached 37 years and 364 days without having to 'sign on' but time was
running out.
I was motioned to sit on the other side of a boardroom-style table that
looked larger and longer than I had noticed before. Facing me was David
Nizol, the boss, recently recruited from London's Yellow Advertiser free
newspaper group. He had shaken hands with me a few weeks earlier on being
given the usual first-morning meet-the-people tour. At his side was Anthony
Hawkswell, the newly-appointed group editor, looking rather stiff and
awkward.
Something was said. I do not remember what. It was management-speak. I do
recall asking the face in the distance to cut the nonsense, but apparently
there were procedures to go through. Whatever they were, I did not hear them
and they amounted to no more in my language than: 'You're redundant.'
Immediately afterwards the whole thing does not feel too bad. There is a
comforting, sort of numb feeling and everything seems to be happening at a
distance. Is this shock? It should not be. Today, everyone knows a little
white envelope with their name on it may be lurking in their manager's top
drawer.
For whatever reason, for some time everything seems unreal. A chunk of your
life has been taken from you and you know it has; a part of your existence
has been torn from you, but your brain has not got round to accepting that
an irreversible change has taken place.
And so, people make appropriate noises saying how sorry they are (and they
really are) and you go through the motions of accepting with good grace and
a forced smile, their condolences and commiserations.
By the time it gets to two or three in the morning and you still have not
been to sleep, you decide to put the kettle on.
You find yourself using a secondhand teabag and consciously thinking that
you're having to save money now. You tell yourself you are coping quite well
 -and you probably are compared to any others hurled into the psychological
abyss of redundancy.
Your situation is not as bad as it might be. Your partner is working. You
have worked out your finances. You will be able to survive, just.
Now I think about it, I do recall some phrases, and one in particular. The
face on the other side of the table muttered something amazing as it was
about to hand me my envelope. The mouth opened and it said it thought it was
being quite reasonable about all this. Could it hear itself? Did it believe
what it was saying?
When your time comes, you are expected to sit on the other side of that
table, conducting yourself in a civilised fashion. You are expected to
accept that 'rationalisation' is vital for the future viability of the
company, that the 'managerial bullet' has to be bitten.
There is a form to be followed, as if the ritual will take away the pain for
you and absolve others of responsibility. We must behave reasonably,
maintain our posturing as sensible grown-ups.
Unless we experience it for ourselves, it seems, we have no understanding of
the way in which redundancy rips people's lives apart, tearing up the fabric
of their home, stripping them of their sense of self-worth, and destroying
their experience of being valued people with a place, a role and a stake in
the community.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Financial Times Round the World Ski Expedition: Dangerous
descents in Mont Blanc's shadow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They began in North America, moved to Europe in
March, and are now on their way to India and Japan.
High above Chamonix, Lucy gazed in wonder at the astonishing array of
needle-sharp peaks, huge seracs and moraines and said: 'This must be the
most awe-inspiring and beautiful descent on skis in the world.' We were half
way down the Envers du Plan route to the Mer de Glace, and allowing for
possible French bias, she could be right. We shall see. Perhaps there will
be something to cap it in the Himalayas next week.
Both the pace and the temperature of the Financial Times Round The World Ski
Expedition are hotting up. Far from relaxing towards the end of our 524
miles of skiing in April (more than 100 vertical miles), we have been skiing
some of the most demanding off-piste slopes in the French Alps: in
Courchevel, Val d'Isere / Tignes, Argentiere and Chamonix.
And before dashing to Geneva for our flight to Delhi, we set off bright and
early on Wednesday morning for a 15km extravaganza down the Vallee Blanche,
to be followed almost immediately by helicopter skiing in Val Grisenche,
Italy, with Jean-Marie Olanti, our host in Chamonix.
There are more than 100 glaciers in the Mont Blanc massif. If your guide is
patient and lets you admire the view on the way down, you can see dozens
from the Vallee Blanche alone - and a myriad crevasses.
Our guide, Jean-Paul Balmat, knows his way around them as well as any man:
his great great great grandfather, was - with a Docteur Michel Paccard - the
first to set foot on the summit of Mont Blanc on August 8, 1786. During our
descent we also met Georges Payot, another guide, whose father was killed by
an avalanche during the attempted rescue of passengers from an air crash in
1950.
There are three main routes down the Vallee Blanche from Chamonix's
spectacular Aiguille du Midi (12,602ft). The main one, which most skiers
take, is fairly easy skiing but potentially dangerous because of the Glacier
du Geant, a huge serac and crevasse field below the Refuge du Requin (the
hut below the Shark's Tooth). The other two routes - the Vraie Vallee
Blanche and the Envers du Plan - are steeper and much more enjoyable for
stronger skiers, with plenty of genuine off-piste terrain.
Such runs are new to Lucy, who only a year ago could never have handled such
conditions. But during the past four months she has experienced just about
every kind of descent in very kind of snow. Her ski school report might
read: 'Enthusiastic, but Lucy still has a tendency to sit too far back when
turning in difficult terrain, with the result that she sometimes shoots out
of the turn too fast and loses a little control.'
This could be dangerous in glacier country, and indeed, on the one occasion
she fell during our descent of the Envers du Plan, close to a gaping
crevasse.
In Val d'Isere and Courchevel, Lucy and I stayed in chalets for the first
time during our expedition and found it hugely entertaining. I am not sure
that all the other guests shared our view.
There are definite pros and cons about chalets. The food at the Gros Caillou
was excellent, but the lock on the downstairs lavatory/bathroom did not work
easily, so one of the guests (a TV producer) was interrupted twice during
her bath.
Chalet staff are wonderful inventions, and we could have done with them down
the road in Champagny-en-Vanoise where the accommodation we were given was
grubby enough to prompt Lucy - dressed for skiing - to roll up her sleeves
and do some cleaning.
They would also have been invaluable when Margit Pfund, the director of
tourism at St Gallenkirch, Austria, who had with great pride taken us to
lunch at the Nova Stoba, the resort's top mountain restaurant, discovered
after a long wait that the waitress had forgotten her lunch (but
fortunately, not ours).
While we waited, Edwin Ganahl, the director of the Silvretta Nova lift
company quenched our thirst in the 220C heat with sparkling wine. This was
less lethal than the 'Black Widows' showered on us the following day by
Ganahl's opposite number Emil Isele in neighbouring Gargellen. This
concoction - kirsch-flavoured coffee with cream - was offered at every pit
stop until Lucy called a halt saying: 'Too many Black Widows for Arnie will
make me a real one.'
It was Emil who greeted the Prince of Wales during his last unofficial trek
across the Swiss border from Klosters. Uncertain as to whether Charles would
go for Black Widows, he settled for serving him a Schnapps.
Frontiers seem to have little relevance when one is on skis. Just as the
Prince was able to ski from Switzerland into Austria, on April 1 (when Lucy
fell for my April Fool's joke that I did not feel like skiing that day) we
did the reverse, from Ischgl to the duty-free Swiss resort of Samnaun, where
to our relief we were able to use a credit card for lunch.
Almost no one in the Austrian mountains accepts plastic which meant we were
forever having to try to extricate cash from automatic dispensers.
Centuries ago when Samnaun was cut off from the rest of Switzerland, the
villagers struck a deal allowing them huge tax concessions. This created a
smugglers' paradise, and the story goes that one villager from Ischgl, using
the common excuse of crossing into Switzerland for a 'day's hunting', bought
a consignment of cigarettes, went straight to Innsbruck without even
stopping to sleep, sold the cigarettes for five times what he paid for them,
and after further trade-offs, surprised his wife by returning to Ischgl from
his 'hunting trip' with a live Ox.
There is little scope for smuggling when crossing the border by chairlift,
and new lifts between the two resorts are being planned.
The Swiss can be odd about their lifts: in Leysin we found a chair (or
rather did not find it) which has been on the lift map for almost 10 years -
although it does not exist. It was planned for the winter of 1987/88, but
was never installed. Newcomers to the resort sometimes search in vain for
it, and have been known to become quite upset when they discover it simply
is not there.
In Flims most of the lifts have been upgraded, but one - the Stargels -
still judders and jolts its way to the top of the mountain as it has done
for years. Nursing a sore shoulder after a bumpy ride, I asked Shelly
Kuratli, the resort's marketing manager, when they were going to replace it.
'Soon,' she said, adding - with disarming honesty - that the lift was so
famous for its rough rides that it was known as the 'Tumble Dryer'.
One must not be too critical. We may encounter worse before the year is
over.
And so to India and Japan. As I gaze up directly at the vast white dome of
Mont Blanc, basking in the late afternoon sunshine, I find the unfortunate
link between Indian airliners and Mont Blanc playing slightly on my mind.
Two of them crashed on the summit of Mont Blanc - in 1950 and 1966 - and to
this day, climbers still find gruesome relics of the tragic events.
Looking up, it is not difficult to imagine how pilots would need to take
great care not to commence their descent into Geneva airport too early.
Luckily, we are flying in the opposite direction.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Fashion: A St Trinian's summer rampage - Fashion on a
shoestring is investigated by our writers. Here, Avril Groom visits the
jumble sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   I have just bought the rudiments of a summer wardrobe
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
two skirts and a jacket - for Pounds 27.95. Before you say that I must have
either special contacts or extraordinary luck, let me tell you that anyone
can do it. This is the summer when no one needs to spend much in order to
look thoroughly a la mode.
You must banish any residual belief that designer labels are good for you
and any reservations about wearing clothes that have seen better days. Then
you can join all the best people combing the rails of thrift shops, jumble
sales and school outfitters.
The ultimate in recession chic this summer is a clothing item that has been
shrunken, truncated, crushed, boiled to ribbons and squeezed to within an
inch of its life. You could pay a designer handsomely to put clothes through
all those processes. Or you could have fun - and save lots of money - and
find examples for yourself. As this odd little look is not a long-term
investment, it seems best to go for the second option.
This is how I did it. The skirts came from Jean Muir's sale. There you are,
designer labels after all - but these skirts cost only Pounds 3 each. They
are in her favourite, floppy, Hurel jersey and when I bought them they were
dowdily box-pleated to knee-level. Quite why Miss Muir did not see their
potential and price them accordingly I do not know, because with six inches
chopped off (this cost Pounds 5 each), hey presto they are the new flippy
skirt shape, in a fashionably school-uniformish maroon and a nice tan that
will liven all this spring's dreary beige.
The jacket was a bigger bargain. Doing my duty behind the counter at the
local scouts' jumble sale, I noted that elderly pinstriped jackets and
waistcoats were being snapped up - not by needy pensioners but by bright
young things.
Even better, from the pile, I unearthed an original early 1950s coat in the
black floppy, crepy wool currently beloved of avant-garde designers.
Trendily waisted and fluted, silk-lined, with small revers and unobtrusive
buttons, it cost me 20p. All it needed was a good clean and a foot off the
bottom (Pounds 11.75).
Also at the sale were plenty of shrunken, greyed, felted and crinkled
jumpers that had seen one hot wash too many. I did not need those because my
wardrobe contains several examples that have formed spontaneously in my
washing machine.
Now I know what to do with them: a fellow fashion writer tells me they look
seriously chic worn with grey polyester school trousers. She waxes lyrical
about the straight-legged John Lewis version of these.
Not having the washboard abdomen of the average 12-year-old schoolboy, I may
give them a miss, but Marks and Spencer has a pleat-topped version suited to
paunchier lads (and lasses). Add a plain white school T-shirt, approximately
for an age 10 size, vigorously scrunched in the wash and un-ironed, and no
one will know you have not spent serious money on Helmut Lang's neo-punk
look.
In fact, the school uniform department of the local chain store is the
fashion freak's best friend this summer, supplying all the necessary
ingredients for those who, unaccountably, have decided that St Trinian's
provides a valid fashion role model for grown women. The pleated games'
skirt, the too-small school shirt, even ankle socks sauntered down expensive
catwalks in the spring collections but the chain store version will do
sterling service for a look of such sublime frivolousness.
Far more practically, now that VAT has been removed on clothes intended for
children with up to a 37in chest, to allow for the generally baggy nature of
youth fashion, childrenswear departments open up all sorts of possibilities
for cheap casual dressing if you are less than generously proportioned. Why
use a so-called 'petites' department when you can get jeans, sweatshirts and
other basics in the same sizes but VAT-free?
Then there is lingerie. Ever since Jean-Paul Gaultier put Madonna on stage
in coned-off corsets we have adjusted to underwear as overwear, everywhere.
The latest twist is that the lingerie is pre-owned. The hot-fashion designer
slip dress has its origins in 1930s bias-cut nighties and these are what
thrifty fashion fans are buying, to cut short and plonk over a skinny white
T-shirt. The fastidious get theirs sorted, washed and mended from upmarket
second-hand shops: the less squeamish at jumble sales.
If you find all this a little seedy, there is always the chain store
version. This will, of course, look too new so you must give it a very hard
time in the wash. This process is known as 'distressing' which, unless you
are careful, might also describe the results.
A safer option may be pyjamas. Classic drawstring trousers and loose shirts
are this season's obverse of the fashion coin, the opposite of skinny and
short. As they look like pyjamas anyway, why not wear the real thing, often
cheaper and better quality? Put them over the ubiquitous fitted body, while
the enviable few with that washboard tum can buy a size too big so the
trousers drop trendily to navel level.
This theme goes further. Marks and Spencer's spring nightwear includes a
gracefully draped and pleated tunic and trousers that, with some metallic
ribbon added at under-bust level, could convincingly come from the
Grecian-inspired evening wear collections of Chloe or Romeo Gigli.
All these ideas are mere suggestions. The dedicated fashion money-saver will
doubtless think up far more inventive ways to sidestep designer bills this
summer. Think what you could do with all the money you are not spending on
clothes this summer. Personally, a classic investment that I can justify to
my bank manager might be in order. There is a wonderful suit in Armani's
window . . .

FT  07 MAY 94 / How to Spend It: Small and upwardly mobile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have always been ambivalent about mobile phones. Once thought of as
irredeemably naff, they are, I am forced to admit, terribly useful.
Never mind swanky conversations with stockbrokers or secretaries, it is when
one breaks down on a motorway at night, is late for a lunch-date or stuck in
a traffic jam, that the mobile phone takes much of the stress out of the
situation.
If you are not sold on the idea of the mobile, Cellnet (to which system the
phone is connected) offers another incentive to fibbers.
'A mobile,' Cellnet tells us in a little oeuvre dealing with the modern
etiquette problem of mobile manners, 'is genuinely mobile; subscribers get a
number which cannot be traced by its dialling code. The possibilities are
limitless: a schiatsu massage - coupled with a weekend at a country house
hotel - might easily pass for an afternoon of auditing at the family
accountant. With a mobile you are never out of touch.' So now you know.
The new Sony mobile telephone, the smallest yet devised, addresses my main
objection - their high visibility. The Sony version is smaller than a pack
of playing cards which means it will fit a shirt pocket or a woman's
handbag. It has a small earpiece (much like the Sony Walkman) so that the
booming tones that people on the other end of mobiles are prone to use are
inaudible to all except the user.
It also seems - at about Pounds 450 if you pay full retail price - to be
about the most expensive yet devised but if you shop around you can, I am
told, find it for Pounds 200.
It weighs just 185 grammes, the battery gives 60 minutes talking time and 14
hours of standby time. It takes about 50 minutes to recharge with a rapid
charger and it can be adapted for use in the car.

FT  07 MAY 94 / How to Spend It: Sunny thoughts for house and garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If last weekend's promise of summer raised your spirits and made you broach
the matter of outdoor life with some optimism, then you might like to know
of a new mail order operation called Crucial Trading.
The catalogue offers a small, edited collection of 'natural alternatives for
the house and garden'. Lurking behind that vague - and these days fairly
ubiquitous - claim are some attractive products.
There are simple wooden garden seats and planters, some covered almost like
gazebos. There are natural coir paths - ideal for conservatories - starting
at Pounds 10.95 and a marvellously capacious Crucial coir carry-all bag at
Pounds 14.95.
There are some sensibly sturdy garden essentials - aprons, kneelers,
holdalls and tool pouches in dark green and natural at prices ranging from
Pounds 7.95 to Pounds 14.95. The galvanised watering cans in dark green or
plain, range in price from Pounds 19.95 to Pounds 37.50. For lingering
summer days there are hammocks and picnic rugs and a small collection of
colonial country furniture from India - divans and carved cupboards.
Everything can be bought by mail, the catalogue costs Pounds 1 from The
Crucial Trading Post, The Market Hall, Craven Arms, Shropshire (tel:
0345-666660). Those who would like to browse can see much of the range at 79
Westbourne Park Road, London W2 5QH. Tel: 071-221 9000.
If your garden, or your tastes, run along grander lines, Sotheby's annual
sale of garden statuary and architectural items takes place at Summers
Place, Billinghurst, West Sussex, on Tuesday May 24. Although many of the
items are grand, the estimated prices seem reasonable - a pair of wrought
iron gates, French, second half of the 19th century, is estimated at between
Pounds 400 and Pounds 600, there are fountain heads at Pounds 200 to Pounds
300 and wrought iron garden seats at Pounds 300 to Pounds 500. There are
statues and fountains, stone troughs and urns - all the accessories the
grand garden requires.
A catalogue costs Pounds 12, (from Sotheby's, Sussex) and viewing days are
from Friday May 20 through to Monday May 23.
Finally, good news on the price front. About four years ago I mentioned Jane
Tennant's collection of colonial-style planter's chairs, which cost Pounds
285 each. Today she has a new collection, bought, as were the originals, in
Sri Lanka, but selling for Pounds 199 each. The quality is exactly the same
 -they are made in authentic planter's style from an indigenous wood (which
she tells me is carefully controlled and replanted) called Suriyamara, and
the cane-work is exceptionally fine. She sells them without cushions -
kelim-covered cushions look particularly good with them - and although she
will deliver it will cost extra. Most people she finds prefer to look first
and then buy.
Available from Market Trading, 44 Burlington Gardens, London W3 6BA. Ring
for an appointment (081-992 9255) as she operates from home.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Fashion: Re-make re-model - Lucia van der Post suggests
there is no need to spend at all this summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If, like me, you have been priced out of the designer label market, take
heart. There are bargains to be had on the secondhand front (see Avril
Groom, above) and I can add another suggestion - take the clothes you
already own and wear them differently.
For instance, it is perfectly possible to buy all of the items in the
accompanying photographs - but that is not the point of this article.
The point of the pictures is to show that this summer there is very little
need to buy anything at all.
The chap who is so artfully photographed here, by the Marks and Spencer
men's fashion team, is simply wearing a white shirt, a black waistcoat and
some black cotton trousers.
The trick that updates the look, and gives it a designer air, is that the
shirt is made of linen, the neck is grandad-style, it is over-sized and worn
outside his jeans. The waistcoat (high-necked is best) is, of course, this
year's really important accessory for men and women.
A careful look through any of the current fashion magazines will reveal that
most of this year's look can be achieved for minimal outlay. For summer, a
V-necked T-shirt (remember those years when nothing but simple round-necked
would do?) can be had from M&amp;S for Pounds 9.99, and could join the
over-sized linen shirt in the wardrobe.
T-shirts are also worn loose and outside the trousers. Men who want to
freshen their off-duty wardrobe should swap their docksiders for Puma suedes
(Pounds 49.99 from most good shoe shops) and that will do more for their
image than a fancy label shirt or trousers.
Sun-glasses are smaller, oval-shaped with thin metal rims and the denim
jacket has been replaced by a lightweight bomber jacket with a hood (anyone
visiting New York will find that Brooks Bros has a classic model).
Layer the clothes you already have and they will look absolutely brand-new -
shirts should hang out, shortish sweaters can be worn over them, waistcoats
can be worn loose and unbuttoned under jackets and the tout ensemble will
look as if it has just stepped off the catwalk.
Much the same message applies to women.
Most probably already own at least one big loose shirt - the trick this
summer is to wear it outside, with the cuffs undone, and either a small
high-necked waistcoat or your smallest sweater over it.
Put away your boxy jackets and blazers for another year and swap your stiff
handbags for something soft and pouchy.
Wear silky soft cardigans, softened even further by long drifty scarves.
If you buy nothing else this spring get some raised-sole trainers (Russell &amp;
Bromley has excellent No-Name versions in several colours at Pounds 35 a
pair) which, coupled with a loose, high-necked waistcoat, will up-date last
year's flared trousers quickly and cheaply.
Trade in your heavy-rimmed tortoise-shell sunglasses for little granny
shaped ones with fine metal rims.
Finally, this summer, faces are being worn Calvin Klein-style - that is to
say the pale, luminous, minimalist look is in. The art lies in looking as if
you are wearing almost no make-up while in reality goodly portions of it
have been most artfully applied.
This is far from easy and some of us are inclined to emerge looking wan and
ill so if you can afford it possibly the best investment this summer is an
hour or two at a good cosmetics counter or make-up artist.

at a company that has had to keep changing its tactics

John Litchfield and Debbie Goldsmith met on a battlefield eight years ago.
After that, they turned their shared interest into a joint venture and
founded Civil-Wardrobe, a company which supplies period clothes principally
for English civil war re-enactments, on January 1, 1990. Since then the
chief battle for them has been keeping the business afloat.
'We are both fanatical about civil war re-enactments,' said Litchfield, 38.
The two were confident of success when they started Civil-Wardrobe. They had
been successfully making, hiring and selling civil war costumes to
enthusiasts in the Sealed Knot, the English Civil War Society, and other
re-enactment groups for two years, and in 1990 they gained a contract to
supply, launder and maintain all the period costumes to the Littlecote
historical theme park at Hungerford.
'We thought we were made,' Litchfield said. 'The contract soon represented
half our income - it was for Pounds 35,000 over a six-month season. At that
time we were turning over Pounds 70,000, employing two other staff, and also
using a number of part-timers to run the medieval banquet costume hire
business, which was also doing well.'
The pair did not think twice about the repayments on a Pounds 5,000 loan
they had taken out from Barclays, even though a condition was insurance
cover that cost an additional Pounds 1,250, also to be repaid in
instalments.
The big blow came in the summer of 1991 when they learnt that Littlecote was
to close as a historical theme park. Within a few months the lease expired
on the small shop premises in Newbury that they had rented cheaply and
almost outgrown.
They managed to find a vastly bigger shop, with large workroom and
storerooms, in a small shopping parade on the southern fringe of the town.
The rent was a reasonable Pounds 10,000 a year, but a condition of the deal
was that they should renovate the premises. They were given the first year
rent free, but spent Pounds 15,000 on the restoration work. To fund it
Debbie took a Pounds 20,000 second mortgage on her house. The other Pounds
5,000 was spent stocking the shop downstairs, which sells novelties and
fancy dress equipment, as well as being a hire centre for fancy dress, hats,
and evening gowns largely made by Debbie and her team.
No sooner were they in full swing again than a second upheaval hit the
couple. A large hotel with which they had done Pounds 9,000-worth of
business showed a reluctance to pay. They recouped Pounds 5,500 but had to
sue for the rest, which they eventually regained in April 1992. By then they
faced a tax bill of Pounds 3,000 for their two good years, which they paid
with difficulty.
They had leased a computer, a copying machine and an electronic till for the
shop and had also bought a Pounds 10,500 new Renault high top van on hire
purchase.
'We were really caught in a classic credit trap,' Debbie said. To add to
their agony the trade they had tried to build up to plug the Littlecote gap
 -selling costumes to other fancy dress shops - proved a failure.
'So many fancy dress shops were closing down due to the recession that we
realised it was not going to work,' Litchfield said. 'Fortunately we didn't
lose a lot of money over this. We merely diverted the costumes to banqueting
hire sets. But I spent a lot of wasted time on the road trying to build up
custom.' In addition they saw a marked dip in the corporate events market -
another direct result of recession-led cutbacks.
'Although we were working desperately hard and earning quite good money we
were not turning over enough to cover our expenses. Our projections had been
based on the figures we were earning from Littlecote,' Debbie said.
They made two staff redundant but in the summer of 1993 the bailiffs
visited, sent by Newbury District Council to collect arrears of business
rates.
'Although we had run out of money, we escaped,' Debbie said. 'We were able
to show the council that we had written asking for relief on our business
rate and the council found that their reply to us had not been posted.
Despite this error, we were not granted any relief and still had to pay in
full.
'However, in the second half of last year things started to improve. We went
to a lot of re-enactment events with our van and our stall, and the medieval
banquets and corporate events started to pick up. In addition, we gained a
lot of work from museums, and the costumes we had begun to make for an
educational supplies company after the Littlecote disaster saw a good
expansion. We had an excellent Christmas, and by our year end on May 31 our
turnover should be back to Pounds 50,000. We are rapidly paying off our
arrears.'
The pair have escaped VAT liability by splitting the business into two. They
are thinking of selling the hire side and concentrating on manufacturing, as
they both enjoy this side of the business and have a successful team of
three outworkers.
Sales to schools are good, and they have plenty of orders for standard
domestic costumes of the civil war period, at Pounds 150 each, and top
quality authentic historical costumes for museums, at around Pounds 600
each. Sales from the shop cover the wages of the part-timers who run it. But
the operation would be sold off, together with banquet costume hire, as part
of the costume hire business, if they decide to go through with the sale
plan.
'We could always see how it was working out and start banquet costume hire
again somewhere else not too far away. It seems to be a growth market at
present,' Litchfield said.
For the rest of the year, the pair are concentrating on what they enjoy best
 -taking their van to historical re-enactments and joining in the fun.
'It is a very seasonal business. Although we are in a good patch at the
moment we shan't easily forget what we have been through in the past three
years,' Debbie said. 'But I have a feeling we're winning.'

Mike Stanley, 31, is works manager for Lynx Offset, a small printing
business based near Oxford, which he joined shortly after it was established
in 1988. He started as a printer, the trade he took up when he left school,
but his reliability and enthusiasm marked him for promotion.
He is now works manager of a company which employs 20 people and has a
turnover of Pounds 1.2m, mostly printing journals, catalogues and high
quality advertising material.
He is responsible for hiring, training and supervising six print workers and
for liaising with other supervisors to ensure that customers' orders are
handled promptly and cost-effectively. He reached his position with no
formal training or experience of supervisory work.
In 1992, Stanley's boss, Keith Nicholl, who founded Lynx, was contacted by
the Heart of England Training and Education Council, based in Abingdon,
which suggested that Nicholl might send one of his supervisors on a training
programme run in conjunction with Wolsey Hall, Oxford. This offered an NVQ
level four certificate in management.
The national network of Training and Enterprise Councils was established in
1989 with a particular responsibility to improve training in small firms
such as Lynx.
The NVQs, or National Vocational Qualifications, are part of the nationwide
system of qualifications designed to promote higher standards of training in
industry. Level four qualifications are intended for first line managers
who, like Stanley, are in their first supervisory jobs.
The course, which takes about a year, covers four areas of management:
people, finance, information and operations.
Stanley started with managing people, first assessing his own capabilities
against a checklist of items: minimising personal conflicts, remaining calm
in difficult situations and learning from mistakes.
At the same time, Nicholl provided his own assessment of Stanley, using the
same list.
A comparison of what he said about himself and what his boss said about him
was used to help draw up a 'development contract' which Stanley agreed with
his boss, emphasising those areas in which he needed most help.
The analysis had revealed that there were many activities which Stanley was
carrying out without appreciating their implications for others. For
example, he often interviewed staff without making any record of the outcome
of the interview so that the participants could have widely differing views
about what would happen as a result of the interview.
Stanley then attended a series of eight one-day programmes, on topics such
as recruiting and training staff, organising meetings and establishing
disciplinary procedures. Guidance was given by the trainers, and the
participants compared their experience. At the end of each session Stanley
agreed upon a programme to be completed before the next one. At work he
assembled evidence that he was using the techniques he had learned at the
workshops.
An assessor visited him to check his progress and to advise him whether the
'evidence' he was collecting would meet the requirements of the programme.
After six months he had completed his 'contract' for managing people. The
cost to the company was Pounds 50. The programme is subsidised by the
Department of Education.
Both Stanley and Nicholl agreed that the main benefit of the programme has
been to make both of them think about Stanley's responsibilities and the way
he carried them out. Stanley is, with Nicholl's encouragement, completing
the other three parts of the programme, covering finance, information and
operations which will lead to the NVQ in management.
Businesses interested in such programmes can contact their nearest TEC or
college through their local Jobcentre.
Stephen Halliday is Principal Lecturer in Small Business at Buckinghamshire
College Business School, a College of Brunel University.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: The wealth protector - Roger Harris
&amp; Company / 15th in a series on fee-based advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Roger Harris is quite clear about his role as an independent financial
adviser. He wants to help his clients solve their financial challenges,
minimise their tax bills and maximise their investment returns. Above all
else, he is there to help them protect their capital. 'That is paramount,'
he says.
Harris spent 15 years helping to build a broadly-based financial services
group before he founded his Leicester-based firm, Roger Harris &amp; Company, in
1988. He set up as a sole trader 'in order to spend more time doing a better
job'.
He felt that his previous firm was trying too hard to be all things to all
clients. As Harris explains: 'Because the majority of the business was
commission-based, you always had to say, right, I've dealt with that client,
now I must find another to sell products to.
'I was also convinced that the boom of the 1980s was coming to an end. It
was fairly obvious that it was a peak of a cycle and I felt that our
financial services group, which was surviving on commissions and mortgages,
would suffer.'
His solution was to specialise. He established a small financial planning
practice, aimed mainly at high-earning and high net worth people. The firm
has been fee-based since the start; any commissions received are placed
against the client's account and deducted from the fees, all of which are
time-based.
Hourly rates have been reduced recently to Pounds 20-Pounds 90 because
Harris cut his overheads when he moved his office out of Leicester's city
centre. 'There is a cost for taking advice and there is also a cost for not
taking advice,' Harris says. 'The sadness is that the majority of the
investing public, quite rightly, could not justify paying our sort of fee.'
His clients tend to live within 25 miles of Leicester and, collectively, his
25 largest have assets of Pounds 30m. But this evidence of wealth does not
mean new clients are in control of their financial affairs. Some have
arrived at his office with what Harris describes as 'a Marks and Spencer
shopping bag with 20 years' accumulation of endowment policies and unit
trusts which they bought because it seemed a good idea at the time. I get
great pleasure from clearing through this paperwork.'
This haphazard approach to investment is the antithesis of Harris's own
philosophy. He finds that many new clients have bought nearly all their
investments from off-the-page advertisements, mail shots, or from direct
salesman. 'In no case have they ever been advised to sell an investment and
secure a profit,' he says. 'I believe investment advice to sell is just as
important, if not more so, than when to buy.'
Harris feels investment management is the backbone of all financial
planning, although he will not reveal the size of the client funds he has
under management and says they are impossible to quantify. 'For instance, I
have introduced millions of pounds to building society postal accounts. Do
you include this?'
He is no believer in buying investments for the long term. 'Investment is
all about trends and cycles. Perfect investment is to buy lowish and sell
highish. Talking about paper profits is a pointless exercise. It is not a
profit until you sell it and put it on the table.'
He is particularly critical of the way life assurance managed funds are
presented to potential investors. 'I have never been able to understand why
companies are allowed to refer to what is, effectively, a fairly static
mixed fund as a 'managed' fund. I think the insurance industry is just
misleading customers.
'The public expects there to be a manager, who is watching over funds daily
and who will switch between different markets and sectors. A client close to
retirement, who came to me recently, was horrifed to find that his
substantial pension fund was in a managed fund that was 80 per cent exposed
to the market.'
Harris believes all investments need a pre-determined exit point. 'I put
stop losses on every investment that is asset-backed. This way, there is a
better chance that clients will not suffer if the next stock market fall is
similar to October 1987 or, worse, to the collapse in 1974.
'My overall exit point now for anyone in UK equities is a Footsie index of
3,000. We have already sold a lot of investments because we had a stop loss
on the Footsie at 3,200. So, the majority of clients are already out and
sitting on cash.
'Certainly, this is the case with the Peps we manage on a discretionary
basis. I think the only sensible Pep is the one you can move into cash. And
although we have done very well on zeros over the past couple of years, we
are very close to stop losses at the moment.'
Harris uses his first meeting with a prospective client to 'interrogate and
find out exactly what they want to achieve'. This results in a detailed
financial planning report, updated annually.
He considers empathy with clients to be crucial and says: 'Clients will
telephone me as their first port of call when they have a query on financial
matters, so there must be trust. If I think there isn't any chemistry at the
first meeting, I would rather say there and then that this isn't going to
work.'
Harris, who admits to being 'a bit of a loner', adds: 'I suspect the
majority of financial advisers obtain a lot of their views from seminars run
by unit trust groups. I don't have a very high opinion of the industry. It's
going to be a long time before this is a true profession.'

FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Offshore variable rates slip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BAYLISS, Moneyfacts
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many offshore rates remain competitive with the mainland market and, for
those seeking gross income, they are worth considering. But variable
offshore rates from building society subsidiaries have generally followed
the downward trend of mainland rates recently. Woolwich Guernsey has proved
the exception by increasing the rates on larger balances in its
International account.
As on the mainland, fixed rates have firmed slightly, with both the Halifax
International and Lombard Banking (Jersey) increasing their rates. New
accounts have been introduced for UK residents by N&amp;P Overseas, with a
90-day notice account, and Britannia International has opened up its new
Index-Linked account to both UK and overseas residents. But its
market-leading, five-year fixed-rate bond is available only to expatriates.
Onshore, the slide continues in variable rates. Small reductions are not
always advertised widely and investors should be aware that the return on
their savings could be eroded.
With investors chasing decent rates, smaller societies have been inundated
with inquiries. Being unable to cope, some have withdrawn accounts to new
money. Accounts now closed that have featured in our charts in recent weeks
are Bullion Share from Teachers, Quay Account from Tynemouth, and
Scarborough 94 by post from Scarborough.
The leapfrogging of fixed rates from building societies has stopped for the
moment, but guaranteed income bond rates go on rising. The top rate now is
from Eurolife at Pounds 10,000, paying 7.00 per cent net (9.33 per cent
gross equivalent) over five years.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Avoiding CGT on a house
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My husband and I live in Switzerland. In 1984, in order to give my mother an
increased income, I agreed to buy her house for Pounds 22,000, its
independent valuation.
The house was conveyed to me, subject to an interest-free mortgage in my
mother's favour of Pounds 22,000 (repayable at Pounds 150 a month) and a
tenancy for life agreement. To date, I have paid my mother Pounds 18,000 and
the approximate value of the house is now Pounds 55,000.
My husband and I will be returning to live in the UK permanently next month.
How should I deal with the house to avoid paying CGT when, eventually it is
sold?
We take it that the house in question is in England (or elsewhere in the
UK), and that the mortgage deed and the tenancy for life agreement are
subject to English (or Scots or Northern Irish ) law. That being so, the
solicitor who acted for you in 1984 (or his successor) is best placed to
advise you.
One possibility is that the tenancy-for-life agreement is a settlement to
which section 225 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 applies. This
was probably considered at the time the documentation was prepared in 1984
(the 1992 Act being merely a consolidation of existing law).
It seems clear that section 226 of the 1992 Act does not apply. One possible
course of action, if need be, would be for you and your husband to move into
the house for a short time, giving judiciously-timed notices under section
222(6)(a) of the 1992 Act beforehand and afterwards (with retrospective
effect from judiciously-chosen dates). But professional guidance through the
CGT and IHT minefield is essential.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Offshore worries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am South-African born and have been UK-resident for 15 consecutive years
although I do not have UK domicile. I have investments, accrued income and
gains held offshore. All originated offshore with no funds from the UK.
1. If, after 17 consecutive years' residence, the Inland Revenue declares me
to be UK-domiciled, what would be the tax position of my offshore holdings?
2. If I die before my domicile changes, what would be the tax position of
the holdings?
Your being born outside the UK is of no relevance to your domicile or origin
(although, presumably, you have established that you are, in fact, domiciled
overseas).
As you have been resident in the UK (for income tax purposes) since some
time in 1979-80, you will be treated (for inheritance tax purposes only) as
domiciled within the UK with effect from April 6 1995, by virtue of section
267(1)(b) of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984.
It is possible that the IHT consequences of that deemed domicile may be
modified by the terms of a double taxation agreement with your country of
actual domicile (but, as you do not wish to disclose the name of that
country, we cannot comment further).
Your UK income and capital gains tax liabilities will continue to be based
upon your actual domicile (under English law, so long as you remain in
England).
If you die before April 6 1995, your assets located outside the UK should
escape inheritance tax.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A will that isn't specific
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I would like to make a will along the following lines: My estate to be
disposed of by X (or by X and Y, if two are required) with the request (not
binding) that such disposal be made in accord with my known wishes and any
letters which I may leave.
I would want it drawn in such a way that any disposals to charity would be
IHT-exempt, just as they would be if made as direct bequests under the will.
Is it possible to do this? I have just been told by my local solicitor that
it isn't and that I must be specific regarding disposal of my estate.
I tend to agree with the local solicitor. It is always possible to leave
your estate in a discretionary trust with powers for the trustee and
executors to distribute it in accordance with a separate letter of wishes.
But I cannot see why, if you know already how you wish to leave your estate,
you should not write this into your will. This provides a lot more certainty
 -and you can always write a new will if you change your mind. (Barry
Stillerman).

FT  07 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Exercising an option
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As a member of an approved share option scheme, I will be exercising an
option later this year. As I have already exercised one in the past three
years, any difference between issue price and market value will be taxable.

In October 1967, I acquired 400 shares in a company called Lees, Thomas &amp;
Worsnop Ltd. In May 1971, an offer was made for these shares by the Aldgate
Investment Co. Ltd but I declined. Do these companies still exist and are
the shares of any value?
The Aldgate Investment Co. Ltd was dissolved on December 31 1977 and Lees,
Thomas &amp; Worsnop Ltd followed on December 31 1980. So, the shares would
appear to be valueless. (Murray Johnstone Limited).

FT  07 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Setting up a trust
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My husband and I are in our early 60s. We have two daughters, who are
married. One daughter has two young children. Our house, and the bulk of our
assets, are owned jointly. Each of us has a pension in our own right.
Our wills were made some years ago and leave all to the survivor. On the
survivor's death, the estate would be divided between our daughters or, if
they died first, to their children. But if things were to be left like that,
then, on the second death, our daughters would have a substantial
inheritance tax bill.
I am told it is possible to reduce IHT by each of us making a will in which
the first Pounds 150,000 is left to our children in a discretionary trust
that allows the income from this capital to be paid to the surviving spouse
until death. The remainder of each estate would otherwise pass directly to
the survivor.
The same source says that, for this to be permitted by the Inland Revenue,
each of us needs to hold assets of Pounds 150,000 in our own name, rather
than jointly, as now. Is this advice correct? If so, how do you go about
setting up such a trust?
It is possible for a husband and wife each to leave wills so that the first
Pounds 150,000 is left to the children upon discretionary trusts with the
balance being left to the surviving spouse. The trustees could exercise
their discretion in favour of the surviving spouse should the need arise.
You would need to ensure that the surviving spouse does not have a right to
the income as it arises as, in tax terms, this would effectively be treated
as an outright gift of the assets to that spouse. This would render nugatory
the planning undertaken.
It is also correct that, if you own assets jointly, then theywill pass to
the surviving spouse by law. To avoid this, it would be advisable for assets
to be owned in your individual names or jointly as tenants in common.
Given the care with which the trust needs to be drafted, I should advise
that you seek professional help. The fees incurred would be small relative
to the tax saved. (Reply by Barry Stillerman of Stoy Hayward).

Some time ago, an acquaintance took out a Small Business Development Loan.
When he came to clear this, his accountant estimated he still owed some
Pounds 9,000 interest. But the bank involved claimed that, because the 'Rule
of Three' applied, he owed more than Pounds 30,000 interest. Just what is
this Rule of Three?
Frustrating though it is to admit, we have drawn a blank on your query. No
one we have contacted has heard of any Rule of Three. This includes the
Department of Trade and Industry and several senior representatives of the
investment and banking world. Our only suggestion is that your acquaintance
returns to his lending bank for further clarification. (Reply by Murray

FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Poor relation bites back / A look at
a friendly society's unprecedented move to swallow a life office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Friendly societies are not usually associated with aggressive tactics. This
week, however, a friendly society announced plans to take over a life office
 -the first time this has happened.
Family Assurance, the third-largest friendly society in the UK, said it
intended to pay out Pounds 1.75m for Templeton Life Assurance, which is part
of the Templeton Marketing Group.
The society wants to expand its pensions business and Templeton Life, which
has Pounds 230m under management, markets and underwrites life assurance and
pension policies.
Members of Family Assurance are being called to a special general meeting on
May 26 and, if they agree to the takeover, the acquisition will take place
on July 1 so long as there is final approval from the Friendly Societies
Commission.
Friendly societies flourished in the 19th century, before the introduction
of state benefits. Their aim was to provide self-help and sickness aid to
artisans, workers and their families.
In recent decades, however, the societies have come to be regarded as poor
cousins of the large insurance companies. Their best-known product is the
10-year, tax-exempt savings plan where interest in the fund rolls up gross
of tax. But in return for tax exemption, the government has capped the
maximum contribution into these policies at Pounds 200 a year, or Pounds 18
a month.
Given the competition from unit and investment trusts and the life offices,
friendly societies looked like facing a slow death until the Friendly
Societies Act of 1992 threw them a lifeline.
This allowed them to incorporate - in other words, to set up subsidiaries
through which they could offer financial products such as personal equity
plans, unit trusts and general insurance.
It is this act which has made it possible for Family Assurance to launch its
take-over.
This might be good news for friendly societies but is it good for consumers?
What can the societies offer that organisations more experienced in
providing these financial products do not?
Societies argue that, since they are owned by their members, they can meet
the needs of their policyholders and remain efficient without having to
worry about profit-hungry shareholders.
Although they do not have the track record of established life and unit
trust companies, they say they can offer competition in a market which,
although well populated, still needs it.
Certainly, they do offer an alternative to those wishing to make small
regular savings. It would be difficult to find a unit or investment trust
allowing a minimum monthly payment of less than Pounds 20 - often it is
Pounds 50. But most friendly societies set a minimum of only Pounds 9.
You might expect the returns from the tax-exempt policies to be much higher
than the alternatives, but the costs of adminstering schemes with such low
premiums bites into the returns.
Tunbridge Wells Equitable - which came out well in a recent survey in Money
Management - the FT's sister publication - says the maturity value based on
Pounds 18 a month in its 10-year tax-exempt with-profits policies is Pounds
2,410 if the fund earns 6 per cent, and Pounds 3,220 if it earns 12 per
cent.
The corresponding figures for its taxable with-profits policies are only
slightly lower at Pounds 2,400 and Pounds 3,080. If you were to pay Pounds
18 a month into a Halifax account, you would get Pounds 2,626 after 10 years
at present interest rates.
The surrender value of the tax-exempt policy after five years would be
Pounds 980, whereas Pounds 18 a month into the government's five-year,
save-as-you earn scheme, described last week, would pay Pounds 1,332.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Making the most - Annuities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER QUINTON, Annuity Bureau
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If a couple retires, each spouse having accumulated their own pension funds,
the question always arises: should they buy a single or joint life annuity?
Take a couple with Pounds 100,000 each in their pension funds.
If the husband, aged 65, uses his Pounds 100,000 and buys a joint life
annuity from Canada Life (see table), his gross annual annuity will be
Pounds 9,234.48.
If the wife, aged 63, uses her Pounds 100,000 to do likewise, hers will be
Pounds 9,162.96.
Should both buy single annuities with the same benefits, however, the
husband would receive a gross annual income of Pounds 11,643.12 and the wife
Pounds 9,951.48.
So, the total gross annual income for the couple with a joint life scheme
would be Pounds 18,397.44. And should one die before the other, the income
would remain at this level until the survivor's death.
But if, on the other hand, each bought a single life annuity, they would get
an initial gross income of Pounds 21,594.60.
Of course, the death of either partner would mean their portion of the
income died with them. This means that if the husband died first, for
example, she would be left with an income of Pounds 9,951.48 for the rest of
her life.
Even when there is a big difference between spouse's fund values, couples
normally choose a combination of single and joint life annuities, with a
reduced spouse's pension.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Should you opt out? - In the first
of three articles / A look at the decision over whether to stay in a company
scheme or transfer to a personal plan - Your pension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   Bt ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Question: I am a member of my company's pension scheme but have been told I
would do better to leave and take out a personal pension from a life
company. Is that right?
Answer: First, you must consider and compare the benefits provided by the
company scheme with that provided by a personal pension.
Q. What benefits does each arrangement provide?
A. Benefits from a company scheme are set out in the booklet describing it.
These can be obtained from the company's pensions department. The benefits
from a personal pension are explained in the relevant brochures.
Q. What pension would I receive from the company scheme?
A. The company scheme provides a pension based on the number of years you
have been a member and your salary at or near retirement.
Say the scheme provides a pension of 1/60th of salary for each year of
membership and you would complete 30 years membership to retirement, your
pension would be 30/60ths (one-half) of your salary at retirement.
The pension is paid for the rest of your life, with a guaranteed minimum
(usually) of five years' payments. Alternatively, you have the option of
taking a cash sum (tax-free) together with a lower pension.
Under Inland Revenue rules, the maximum pension benefit is two-thirds final
salary or a cash sum of 1.5 times final salary and a pension of around half
salary.
In almost all public sector schemes, retirement benefits consist of an
automatic tax-free cash sum and reduced pension - a maximum of a cash sum of
1.5 times salary and a pension of half salary.
Q. How does this compare with the pension from a personal pension contract?
A. Under a personal pension, the contributions paid (less the expenses
deducted by the life company) are invested. The pension is provided by using
the accumulated cash sum to buy an annuity.
You have the option of taking up to 25 per cent of the accumulated value as
a tax-free cash sum and buying an annuity with the rest.
You can take the benefits at any time between your 50th and 75th birthday
(both dates inclusive).
So, your return from a personal pension depends on:
1. The amount accumulated under the contract which, in turn, depends on the
amount of your contributions less the charges deducted by the life company.
2. The investment return achieved by the life company until retirement.
3. Annuity rates at the time of retirement.
The more you contribute and the lower the charges imposed by the life
company, the better the investment performance. The higher the annuity
rates, the larger the pension. But at no time is there any guarantee about
its value.
In contrast, the pension provided by the company scheme is guaranteed as a
percentage of your salary at retirement and its value is not related
directly to the contributions paid by you into the scheme, nor to the
investment performance of the assets held in the scheme; nor to running
costs.
Q. Which is the better bet?
A. It depends. The fact that a personal pension carries no guarantees does
not invariably mean you will be worse off.
Q. What about increases in pensions to offset the effects of inflation?
A. Most company schemes provide guaranteed annual increases. In addition,
they usually make discretionary increases on top of these guaranteed
increases to offset, at least partially, the effects of inflation.
With a personal pension, if you want the payments to increase each year, you
must pay for them. Annuities provide a choice of:
1. Level payments with no increases.
2. Fixed guaranteed annual increases.
3. Increases based on the unit price of the underlying fund.
4. Guaranteed increases in line with the RPI.
The level pension with no increases provides the highest initial value. The
greater the rate of increase in payments, the lower is the starting value.
Q. Would my spouse receive a pension when I die?
A. With a company scheme, a spouse's pension is provided automatically. It
is usually around half the value of your pension and has similar annual
increases to your pension. So, the benefits under a company scheme are worth
more to a married employee than a single one.
With a personal pension, you must buy an annuity with a spouse's benefit.
The cost is in the form of a lower initial annuity payment.
Q. Suppose I retire early?
A. With a personal plan, you will get a lower pension. How much lower
depends on how early you retire. The accumulated value will be less because
you will have paid fewer contributions and there is less time for the fund
to grow, and annuity rates are lower.
With a company scheme, you would get a reduction. But many schemes impose
less stringent penalties than personal plans, especially if early retirement
is through redundancy.
Q. What happens if I die before retirement?
A. Company schemes provide generous benefits. There is a cash sum, free of
all taxes, of up to four times your salary at the time of death, plus a
spouse's pension based on your total period of membership had you reached
retirement, plus children's benefits.
Again, these are worth more to a married employee than to a single.
Under a personal pension, your dependents would receive the amount
accumulated under the contract at the time of death. Further cash benefits
would have to be paid for.
Q. What happens if I leave the company ?
A. If you have taken out a personal pension, then you simply carry it over
to your next job. If, however, you stayed in the company pension scheme,
then the position is more complex and will be dealt with in another article.
Q. What do I pay?
A. Under a company scheme, your contribution is pre-determined as a
percentage of your salary, with the company paying the balance of the costs.
Many schemes are non-contributory: that is, the employee pays nothing and
the whole cost is met by the employer.
With a personal pension, you pay what you like. But the employer is under no
obligation to contribute - and few do.
The employee usually has to pay out of his own pocket, and it needs a
significant contribution each year to get an adequate pension.
So, if the employer will not contribute and/or the company scheme is
non-contributory, an employee should not opt out of a company scheme. But if
the company contribution is high, a younger employee could do better with a
personal pension.
Q. What should younger employees do?
A. This depends on their contribution to the company scheme and whether they
can join the scheme at a later date.
If the employee's contribution is substantial - say, 5 per cent of salary or
more - usually they would achieve better returns with a personal pension, at
least in the early years.
But as time passes, each contribution to a personal pension becomes less
valuable because there is less time for contributions to accumulate to
retirement. At some point, around mid-40s, the employee would be better off
joining the company scheme and stop paying contributions into the personal
pension.
In this way, the combined pension from the personal and the company scheme
is likely to be higher than provided either by the personal pension on its
own or by the company scheme on its own.
You must, however, be careful that Inland Revenue limits are not breached.
Q. Where can I get advice?
A. The company pension department can advise you on all aspects of its
scheme, and its benefits are summarised in an annual statement.
A financial adviser can give a direct comparison between the benefits from a
personal pension and those from a company scheme - providing he has the
necessary information.
But you must make sure that the adviser provides full details of the
contracts, including the charges, the life company's investment record, and
his own commission/remuneration.
Above all, ensure that he gives, clearly, the reasons behind any
recommendations.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Drive safely on the Continent -
Bethan Hutton has some tips for drivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the Channel Tunnel opened for a very exclusive clientele this week,
it will be a while before British drivers start pouring through the Chunnel
en masse. But thousands of drivers will pile on to ferries and hovercraft
this summer.
In a continental Europe supposedly without borders, you might think driving
there should not require any more special planning than a long-distance trip
within the UK. Unfortunately, car insurance and breakdown cover which are
perfectly adequate in the UK can leave you exposed to all sorts of trouble a
few miles across the Channel.
Green proof-of-insurance cards were not consigned to the dustbin at the end
of 1992; French police have been known to fine foreign motorists caught
without one far more recently. And police in Spain can jail you after an
accident, so it is wise to travel with a bail bond.
Breaking down on the M25 is enough of a nightmare - but being stranded on
the hard shoulder of the Paris ring road could be 10 times worse. The
biggest selling point for the AA, RAC, Europ Assistance, National Breakdown
and the other rescue services is the promise of a friendly, English-speaking
voice on the other end of the emergency telephone who can summon help
anywhere in Europe.
Some of the services have their own rescue patrols, while others use a
network of local companies. All promise a speedy roadside response and will
tow your car to a service station - or, if necessary, return it to the UK.
Extras to look for are: emergency credit facilities; additional
accommodation costs; car hire or other onward travel costs; despatch of
spare parts from the UK; and provision of a driver if the only one in your
group is incapacitated.
The AA charges Pounds 30.50 for one week's car-only Five Star cover for
Europe while the RAC's equivalent Eurocover costs Pounds 40.95 for between
five and nine days (Pounds 3 off for existing RAC members). National
Breakdown's Blue Riband scheme would cost Pounds 31.25 for the same period
and Europ Assistance would charge Pounds 25.50 for seven days. If you just
want to go to Ireland, it could cost less. There are often supplements for
cars more than 10 years old, and caravans or trailers.
Carrying a green card is no longer a strict legal requirement (although this
message might not have filtered through to the more rural police forces),
but it is still sensible to take one in case you have an accident or are
stopped by police. You should always tell your insurance company before
taking the car abroad; otherwise, you could find your cover restricted to
the third party legal minimum.
If you have comprehensive cover in the UK, you will probably want to extend
this for overseas trips. Some insurers include European cover free while
others charge up to Pounds 50, according to brokers Telesure. A few, such as
General Accident, issue a European certificate automatically with policy
documents. Very frequent travellers or those spending extended periods
abroad - such as second-home owners - may have to make special arrangements
with their insurance company.
Most of the breakdown cover packages allow you free rein to wander as far
afield as Moscow or Morocco, but a few corners of Europe are out of bounds:
the former Yugoslavia and Albania are among likely exclusions. If you are
planning an adventurous itinerary, check before you go.
Insurers can be more restrictive, and some start charging more than their
standard European rates if you venture into, say, Turkey or Romania. As
usual, it is best to make inquiries before setting off if there is a chance
you could stray outside the European Union.
Some pieces of equipment, such as a warning triangle and in-car first aid
kit, are compulsory in many places and recommended in any case. There are
also a few quirks you should know about. It is illegal to carry spare fuel
in Italy, Luxembourg, Greece and Turkey, and you must carry spare headlamp
bulbs in Spain.
Motoring organisations such as the AA and RAC have leaflets on motoring
regulations, speed limits and equipment required by law in the countries
visited most often by UK tourists. On-the-spot fines for breaking the rules
could make a large dent in your holiday spending money - and traffic police
do not always accept credit cards.
Sales of unleaded petrol in the UK have overtaken the leaded variety but the
same is not true in all parts of Europe: unleaded can be hard to come by off
the beaten track in Spain, Italy and eastern Europe.
Leaded fuel can cause expensive damage to catalytic converters so it is a
wise move to fill up with unleaded before crossing borders and, indeed,
wherever it is available.
Travel insurance is also a must, particularly to cover medical and legal
expenses.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: C&amp;G's mortgage bait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society is offering as much as Pounds
3,000 to those taking out a variable-rate mortgage before July 31, writes
Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Borrowers with a 20 per cent deposit will, on
completion, receive 3 per cent of the amount they borrow, to a maximum of
Pounds 3,000. Those with a 5 per cent deposit or more receive 2 per cent,
capped at Pounds 2,000.
The cash payment is being offered as an alternative to the one-year discount
on the society's variable rate, now 7.64 per cent. The discount is 3
percentage points for borrowers with a 20 per cent deposit and 2 points for
those with a 5 per cent deposit.
If you borrow up to 80 per cent of the value of the property, the cash gift
is worth Pounds 180 more than the discounted rate. Larger borrowers will be
Pounds 120 better off with the cash gift.
If you have a 20 per cent deposit, monthly repayments on a Pounds 60,000
interest-only mortgage at the discounted rate of 4.64 per cent would be
Pounds 209. Alternatively, you can take the cash gift of Pounds 1,800 but
pay Pounds 344 a month.
If you redeem the mortgage within three years, however, you will have to pay
back the cash gift - or, if you had opted for the discounted rate, pay three
months' gross interest.
New borrowers before C&amp;G's proposed merger with Lloyds Bank next spring also
will get a one-off Pounds 500.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Capita Group is involved in various aspects of management consultancy.
Its recent final results showed some improvement in pre-tax profit and
chairman Rodney Aldridge made a broadly optimistic statement.
He and chief executive Paul Pindar (who combines the roles of managing and
finance director), plus Richard Benton and John Brameld all sold stock on
Friday April 29 at 223p.
Directors of Capita Group sell stock regularly at this time of year, but the
steady rise in the share price has meant that they have raised more money
this time than ever before.
Secure Retirement is a newcomer to the market. The company develops
sheltered housing - one of the sectors to gain more and more prominence in
recent years in light of the increasing longevity of the UK population.
Following an introduction to the market, all the directors have been dealing
apace, dipping repeatedly into the market. While the overall value of the
transactions is not enormous when divided by the number of those dealing,
the enthusiasm is certainly great.
Virtuality also is a recent arrival on the market. In its case, however, the
flotation has allowed managing director Dr Jonathan Waldren and chairman
David Payne to realise some cash by selling a proportion of their holdings.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Babcock sings the blues - The week
ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barring disasters, one of the least surprising results of the week should
come on Monday with full-year figures from Babcock International, the
engineering contracting and materials handling group.
Announcing a Pounds 78.6m rights issue last month, the group gave detailed
estimates of its figures for the year ended March 31 - a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 41.2m, which includes a Pounds 25m exceptional charge and compares
with profit of Pounds 21.1m in 1992/93.
Further evidence on the state of the UK grocery market will come on Tuesday
from Kwik Save, the UK's largest grocery discounter - one of those which is
putting pressure on J. Sainsbury (which announces annual results on
Wednesday) but also is facing competition on its own territory from
expanding continental discounters. Interim pre-tax profits are forecast to
increase from Pounds 61m to Pounds 62m-64m.
Scottish Power, the electricity generator and distributor, is expected to
reveal annual profits of between Pounds 340m and Pounds 350m pre-tax on
Wednesday. This compares with Pounds 308m last time. The dividend will
probably rise by 11 per cent to 12.4p via a final of 8.27p.
Three of the UK biggest insurance companies will next week report increases
in profitability in the first three months of 1994, confirming the recovery
in the general insurance market.
General Accident is expected to post pre-tax profits of about Pounds 60m,
compared with Pounds 42m to the same period of 1993.
Commercial Union, which reports on Wednesday, is tipped by analysts to
produce profits of between Pounds 38m and Pounds 80m, with an average of
about Pounds 50m.
Royal Insurance, also on Wednesday, is forecast to report pre-tax profits of
between Pounds 15m and Pounds 51m (Pounds 2m).
Each of the companies will benefit from the impact of past increases in
insurance rates and indications of an improvement in claims experience in
the UK.
Some analysts warn, however, that the profit levels now being achieved do
not represent any increase on the last quarter of 1993, and suggest that
competition is returning to some sectors of the market. Weather losses in
the US and Canada, where there have been long spells of sub-zero
temperatures, could also dampen some figures.
Guardian Royal Exchange and Sun Alliance, which have much smaller US
businesses, do not report on a quarterly basis.
J. Sainsbury's downbeat trading statement in January, when it announced a
fall in both underlying sales and gross margins, and a property write-down
of Pounds 365m, was one of the lowest points in a bleak year for UK food
retailers.
On Wednesday, the grocer is forecast to announce a fall in pre-tax profits
for the year to March from Pounds 735m to between Pounds 320m and Pounds
340m. That is after both a Pounds 365m non-recurring write-down on property,
reflecting the fall in value of many of Sainsbury's sites since it bought
them; and a Pounds 40m recurring depreciation charge resulting from the
group's decision to depreciate buildings by 2 per cent a year and a revised
depreciation policy on fixtures and equipment.
The key questions Sainsbury is expected to address on Wednesday is whether
trading has improved since January - and whether gross margins have
stabilised - plus the future of its 'Essential for essentials' campaign
launched last October. That marked a move away from periodic promotions
towards 'everyday low prices' on 300 own-label lines accounting for about 10
per cent of turnover.
Analysts are also keen to hear more about Sainsbury's plans for its other
businesses - the Savacentre hypermarkets, Homebase DIY superstores and US
supermarket chain Shaws - as well as planned trials of a city-centre format,
Sainsbury's Central.
Royal Bank of Scotland reports its interim results for the year to March 31
on Wednesday and is expected to double last year's pre-tax profits of Pounds
91.6m, as well as providing a good increase in the interim dividend.
The strategic question which the bank might try to answer at its results
presentation is whether it will spend its healthy capital on acquisition. It
was among those expressing interest in buying Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
building society.
The interim figures from Grand Metropolitan, due on Thursday, should show a
healthy increase of about 10 per cent on last year, to some Pounds 445m. The
Pillsbury Green Giant business in the US should do well, given the floods in
the mid-west last autumn and the resulting rise in vegetable prices. The
Burger King hamburger business, also part of Pillsbury, is likely to produce
a strong showing, too.
The interest charge will be reduced by the sale of the Chef &amp; Brewer chain
to Scottish &amp; Newcastle. But the really hot topic is whether GrandMet will
take the opportunity to unwind its unhappy Inntrepreneur pubs joint venture
with Courage. The betting appears to be against it - this soon, at any rate.
Unilever's first-quarter figures on Friday should show only modest
improvement, perhaps to Pounds 450m against Pounds 440m last year. The main
depressing factors should be in detergents. The recent rather nasty downturn
in the US started only in the second half of this year, and this quarter
should also start to show the costs of launching the new super-concentrated
detergent across Europe.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lombard Insurance has become the second small insurance company to push for
a flotation this year, and private investors can subscribe through a 5.15m
share intermediaries offer at 160p apiece, writes Simon Davies.
The company was bought out last year from Continental Inc and has an
indemnity against all claims arising from events before June 1993. It
focuses on provincial general insurance business, mainly in personal lines
such as private car and household cover at the low-risk end of the market.
Lombard reduced the issue price by almost 10 per cent, reflecting the
falling stock market, but institutions have still not been battling for the
placing shares. Concerns focused on increasing competition in Lombard's
sector of the market, compounded by the knock-on effect of falling bond and
equity prices on insurers' investment income.
In the short term, Lombard offers likely profits growth. And while the
shares may give back nothing to the stags, they do appear to offer
longer-term value. The offer is sponsored by Charterhouse Bank.
Healthcall, the UK's largest provider of duty doctor services, is floating
through a placing and intermediaries offer valuing the company at Pounds
58m, writes David Wighton. But the price is at least 10 per cent below
initial expectations, reflecting the more difficult conditions in the new
issue market.
Pitched at 14.9 times last year's earnings from its continuing businesses,
the shares have a notional yield of 4.8 per cent. That looks fairly
attractive given the group's growth record and the new opportunities being
thrown up by the trend towards community-based care. But there are some
question marks over the long-term growth prospects of the core business.
With 8,300 GP subscribers, Healthcall has almost half the potential duty
doctor market, which has generated good growth in recent years. But the
government is keen to stem the rising bill for out-of-hours calls, partly by
referring more patients to 24-hour health centres. The group has five such
centres already, but a major shift away from home visits could require
significant capital investment with uncertain returns.
Applications must reach broker James Capel by noon on Thursday, with
dealings due to start on May 18.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Investors face stern line on
settlements - Clients must pay more quickly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even before private investors feel the true impact of the new Crest system
for paperless share settlement, they are in for a minor revolution.
From July 18, the traditional two-week account settlement period will
disappear and all stocks will have to be paid for within 10 business days of
the transaction. For sellers, securities will have to be delivered within
that time.
Earlier this week, the Bank of England conceded that it had been too
ambitious with its original timetable to squeeze the settlement period to a
mere five days by January 1995.
But it says it continues to aim at five-day rolling settlement by the middle
of next year at the latest.
While the move to rolling settlement will ring in many changes for the
private investor - most notably, the need to consider the use of nominee
companies and to arrange for extended credit facilities - there are other
aspects of business which will need addressing as well.
For one thing, the way stockbrokers handle their clients' funds needs an
overhaul, according to the Securities and Futures Authority, the
self-regulatory body for stockbrokers.
At present, stockbrokers 'pool' client funds in between settlement periods,
and it is possible to use one client's funds to pay for another's stock.
Under the new system, however, stockbrokers will have to segregate each
client's account.
While the changes in client money rules will produce a far greater burden on
brokers than their clients, accountancy firm Touche Ross says there are
several things of which clients ought to be aware.
'The big problem is one of client education,' says Paul Leech, senior
manager at Touche Ross's securities and banking practice.
'Clients have to be taught to lick the stamp and sign the cheque as soon as
they put down the telephone receiver.'
Clients now can have from seven to 21 days in which to settle their
transactions, and many do not have the sense of immediacy needed to ensure
that they or their broker are not out of pocket on a bargain.
But there are other problems, according to Mike Jones, head of the
settlements committee at the Association of Private Client Stockbrokers and
Investment Managers (APCIMS), and technical services director at Capel-Cure
Myers Capital Management.
For one thing, the latest rule changes do not make clear if a broker whose
client has arranged a purchase of stock, but has not paid for it on time,
has a 'lien' over that stock.
Failure to clarify that issue will discourage brokers from moving swiftly to
register stock in their clients' names without cash in hand, says Jones.
Alternatively, it could encourage brokers to urge their clients either to
use nominee accounts or to put up a 'margin' of their personal assets
against which the broker could claim in the event of non-payment.
In Australia, which introduced a five-day rolling share settlement system
recently, rules allowing the broker to hold on to the stock, and even lend
it, have been introduced with great success, Jones adds. These rules allow
stock with a value of up to around Pounds 75,000 to be loaned under these
circumstances.
Jones says the rule has had the effect of giving comfort to brokers and
helping to increase liquidity in shares generally.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Merger splits investors - The latest
building society link-up plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's announcement of a proposed merger between the Northern Rock and
North of England building societies again throws the spotlight on the
financial sweeteners - societies prefer the word bonuses - which members may
be offered to support such deals.
Last month's announcement that Lloyds Bank wanted to take over the
Cheltenham and Gloucester increased the stakes. If that take-over overcomes
the regulatory hurdles, C&amp;G voting investors can expect an average payment
of Pounds 1,700, with the biggest savers getting a maximum Pounds 10,000.
In the Northern Rock/North of England merger, bonus payments will not be on
the C&amp;G scale, although their size has yet to be decided. For many members
of the two Tyne and Wear-based societies, however, the most interesting
point in this deal could be that, while the North of England's 272,500
investors and borrowers will be offered a sweetener, the Northern Rock's
1.3m will not.
The reason? Although North of England is much the smaller of the two, with
assets of Pounds 1.5bn against Northern Rock's Pounds 7.3bn, it has a larger
reserve ratio - 5.45 per cent against the Northern Rock's 4.3. Since the
merger will dilute the North of England's reserve ratio, members are to be
compensated.
Many Northern Rock members are not impressed with this argument, judging
from customers' reactions at one of its biggest Newcastle branches this
week. 'I think we should get something,' said Alistair Brown, of North
Shields, a Northern Rock saver and mortgage-holder. He warned that the
disparate treatment could affect the way he votes in August when both
societies' members will be balloted for their support.
Lynn Gatenby who, with her husband, has a mortgage at the North of England
and savings in the Northern Rock, was philosophical: 'You can't win all the
time.' She added: 'Together, they will be stronger.'
But graphic artist Robert Carr and his wife, Maureen, both of whom save with
Northern Rock, were less phlegmatic. 'We should get the same benefit,' Carr
said. 'And if they can afford to buy the North of England, they can afford
to give a lower interest rate on mortgages and higher interest on savings.'
At the North of England, there seemed less unease - and there was no sign
that the sums talked about in the Lloyds/C&amp;G deal had turned heads. 'I don't
think the bonus will come to very much,' said mortgage and account-holder
Jean Marron.
Butcher Phillip Spoors, a North of England saver, supported the merger. He
thought a bigger bonus coupled with loss of mutual status, on the lines of
Lloyds/C&amp;G, would be acceptable, too.
Janet Kean, a housewife who saves with the North of England, disagreed.
While likely to vote for the merger, she would not have welcomed a bigger
bonus and loss of mutual status. 'I prefer a building society to the banks.
I have more control over my money with a building society.'
Carr also felt building societies were 'far friendlier' than banks: he was
worried that the trend to bigger societies would lead to poorer service,
with machines replacing counter staff.
Fears about the seemingly relentless merger tide were voiced, too, by
Northern Rock current account-holder John Harrison, a legal executive. He
warned that bonus payments might be a short-term gain.
'It's very worrying - the number of building societies is getting smaller
and smaller,' he added. 'Eventually, there will be so few that there will be
a virtual monopoly among them and interest rates and investors will suffer.'

The Lloyd's insurance market this week published an exciting blueprint for
giving Names - individual underwriting members - 'sitting tenant' rights
which they may be able to sell eventually for cash or securities.
This is the first time Lloyd's has admitted that Names have built up any
right to a continuing stake in the enterprise. Assuming a series of complex
legal, regulatory and tax hurdles can be overcome, the proposal could mean
that:
Members who wanted to get out of the market could get some cash in return
for giving up their place.
They could swap their existing places in specialist syndicates for units in
a wider pooled scheme, or shares in a corporate syndicate.
Robert Hiscox, the market's deputy chairman, says: 'Nobody has ever said how
much a Lloyd's syndicate is worth. The whole objective is to unlock the
value we have in the business.'
The reforms could be far-reaching, although there is little comfort for
Names who have been forced out of the market already by their losses. And,
in order to benefit, even Names who continue to trade must be solvent and
have paid any outstanding cash calls by July 29 this year.
The basic idea behind the reform is simple. Theoretically, the 179
syndicates trading at Lloyd's are annual joint ventures. They are made up of
many individual Names, trade on the back of their guarantees, and dissolve
at the end of each year when they distribute the profits or call in the
losses relating to that year's trading. The interest of Names at present is
confined to these profits or losses.
In practice, though, Lloyd's syndicates are businesses which - like
insurance companies - have long-term plans and often insure many of the same
customers year after year. Good syndicates can command considerable customer
loyalty.
Like any continuing business enterprise, ownership of a syndicate is worth
money. The larger, more respected and more profitable it is, the greater its
value. Lloyd's is now trying to devise a system under which Names can
acquire a portion of this long-term value.
There are two stages to its plan. First, it must be sure that certain
syndicate rights, which turn Names into quasi-shareholders, are vested in
them. Then, it has to create a market in which those rights can be traded,
swapped or cashed in. But this will be a long-term process, and the outcome
is far from clear.
Creating value
This week, Lloyd's announced the first stage of its plan; the basic
measures, to be implemented in 1995, are pre-conditions for establishing a
market in membership rights. In essence, these reforms - which will be
introduced in 1995 and 1996 - make 'syndicate participation' more solid and
durable. So, it becomes a valuable asset to the Name.
Members would have far more security of tenure. If the agent running a
syndicate attempted to sack individual Names, they could appeal to Lloyd's
council. The plan would also give them pre-emption rights over their
syndicate participations.
This means that if a syndicate decided to increase its capacity (the amount
of business it underwrites), the Names would have the right to increase
their share of the extra business in proportion to their stake.
Take a Name underwriting a Pounds 10,000 share in a Pounds 1m syndicate: he
would be able to increase his share to Pounds 11,000 if the syndicate
increased its capacity by 10 per cent to Pounds 1.1m.
Names would also have more control over decisions by their syndicates to
increase capacity, and would have to approve any increase in capacity of
more than 15 per cent. This is important, because syndicates would find it
harder to dilute the stake of existing Names by increasing capacity so much
that the Names could not afford to take up their pre-emption rights.
Allocating capital
Lloyd's intends to play a more active role in making sure that capital is
allocated more efficiently. It will do this by introducing risk weighting so
that the amount of capital required to support a syndicate increases in line
with the riskiness of its underlying business.
Syndicates underwriting high-risk business (such as catastrophe
re-insurance) would need more capital; those writing relatively low-risk
business, such as motors, correspondingly less. So, individual Names would
not find themselves in syndicates where future claims might be beyond their
means.
Lloyd's is less definite, however, about a series of other measures which
are geared in one way or another to establish a market place in which
syndicate participations can be bought and sold.
Transferring value
The central issue here is whether Names can 'assign' their participations on
syndicates - effectively, transferring or selling them to another Name or to
a corporate investor.
Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, argues that assignment is 'likely
to be the fundamental building block for any system of value'. But Lloyd's
concedes that 'a number of important issues need to be resolved before
assignment can be brought into effect'.
Realising value
The report describes three possible mechanisms:
A market administered by Lloyd's. Options include a 'matched bargain system'
in which sellers are matched with buyers; or a fully fledged market-making
system in which a professional market-maker is required to quote prices for
all syndicates in which he deals.
The report concludes that a one-off, auction-based tender system, in which
all sellers of a particular syndicate get the same price, is the most likely
option in the short term. It says that the trading volumes would probably be
too low to support a cost-efficient market-making mechanism.
Corporate pooling in which Names would 'assign' their future syndicate
participations to a corporate member in exchange for shares, securities or
cash.
This type of arrangement would allow Names to spread their investments
across a number of syndicates, as they do now in members' agency pooling
arrangements, or Mapa - a kind of unit trust. With the new corporate
arrangements, though, Names would enjoy the additional advantage of having
limited liability.
Corporate syndicates in which members would assign future participations to
a corporate member, again in exchange for shares, other securities or cash.
Corporate Names account for about 15 per cent of Lloyd's capacity this year
following the successful introduction last year of corporate funds. But
corporate Names are restricted from providing any more than 25 per cent of a
syndicate's capacity, while syndicates can obtain no more than 50 per cent
of their capital from corporate Names. The new corporate syndicates would,
effectively, be insurance companies operating within a Lloyd's framework.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Markets: Democracy rears its head at Lloyd's - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Democracy at Lloyd's sounds like a contradiction in terms. But that does not
make it any the less welcome. This week's plan to first enfranchise the
Names, and then examine ways they can sell their membership rights, is long
overdue (see page III).
Previously, although the Names have put up the capital and shared the
underwriting profits - or, more recently, losses - they have had none of the
other rights of ownership. All the power has been with the agents who manage
the underwriting syndicates. Some have notoriously abused this power.
What is more, running an underwriting agency has created a valuable asset
for the managers; participating in the actual underwriting syndicates has
not. It is a rather neat inversion of the normal roles of capital and
labour.
The blueprint for change is designed to remedy this imbalance. The one
obvious objection so far is that it comes too late to be of any help to the
Names who have been ruined by their losses.
Other niggly problems are bound to arise as more detailed proposals are
hammered out. Names and managers alike will argue that they should have a
bigger slice of the cake, whatever that total cake might prove to be worth.
The Names will claim that it is their capital which is at risk. The managers
will argue that it is their skill that keeps the business going. The fact
that five syndicates already have sacked all their Names, while they still
had the power to do so, is hardly an encouraging portent.
Many individual Names are understandably embittered by now, and need
reassuring that they are not going to be eased gently out of their
syndicates in favour of corporate members, whom many agents prefer. That
would leave them unable to take advantage of a better underwriting climate
to earn back some of the money they lost in the bad times.
The latest proposals should go a long way to assuage their fears. Members
can appeal against being sacked by their syndicates and have pre-emptive
rights to their share of any increase in business.
Underwriting should also be a bit less hairy in future. The idea of
weighting capital requirements according to the riskiness of a syndicate's
business seems painfully elementary. The Financial Services Act has long
demanded that advisers know their clients and do not put vulnerable people
into unsuitably risky investments. Some Lloyd's agents appear to regard such
scruples as wimpish, but risk ratings should do the job for them.
If all goes well, being a Name at Lloyd's should be rather less of a white
knuckle ride in future. But much of the interest in the new blueprint
inevitably will focus on its suggestions for golden handshakes: selling
membership rights.
Some people are arguing already that this part of the proposal is just pie
in the sky - a cynically unrealistic bait designed to keep recalcitrant
Names aboard while they can be useful. But let us give Lloyd's the benefit
of the doubt just one more time.
What would membership be worth? The market's losses have been so monstrous,
and its reputation is so tarnished, that it is hard to imagine memberships
in even the more profitable and reputable syndicates fetching a price in
line with the size of their business. And anyone in a poor syndicate will
get only a pinchbeck handshake when he leaves.
But the biggest bugbear is likely to be the very limited market in which
members can sell their rights. Lloyd's itself says that it is unrealistic to
expect the amount of transfer business to justify a proper market-maker and
reckons that periodic auctions, in which all members get the same price,
look the best bet. Not a very alluring prospect.
But at least Lloyd's is heading in the right direction for a change.
Any building society member who was dreaming of a C&amp;G bonanza from one of
the other societies will have had a cold shower of reality this week. The
Northern Rock/North of England merger looks set to bring North of England
members an average of Pounds 50 apiece compared with the Pounds 650 they
might have got if there had been an outside bid for the society. Northern
Rock members get nothing.
The proposal is a useful reminder of two things. First, not all building
societies are equal - any more than all Lloyd's syndicates are equal.
Efficient and profitable societies, such as C&amp;G, may be able to find suitors
who will pay a handsome bride price. Less efficient, less profitable
societies will not. C&amp;G's expense ratio is well below average at 26 per
cent. North of England's is a lofty 54 per cent.
Second, building society members are unlikely to get the best price unless
their managements secure it for them. The idea of soliciting a bid does not
seem to have occurred to the managers of Northern Rock or North of England.
The two societies explain the deal as 'a traditional building society merger
about traditional building society values.'
True, many members do seem to value the societies' mutual status. But some
would have sold their birthright happily so long as the mess of pottage was
big enough. The concept of mutuality can no longer be taken for granted -
except by building society and life company managers.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Markets: Traders drop the baseball and hit the dollar - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been one of those rare weeks when traders and investors on Wall
Street have to turn away from the charts of bond yields and interest rates,
the tables of corporate earnings, and the latest baseball scores, and start
paying attention to something they spend most of the year happily ignoring:
the dollar.
Unlike in the UK, where the value of sterling is closely watched because the
economy is seen as vulnerable to imported inflation, in the US, currency
rates are rarely of interest to the stock market. Except, that is, when the
dollar moves in such a fashion that the Fed is forced to lead 17 other
central banks into the international foreign exchange markets to buy
dollars. When the Fed has to ask the Bank of Moldova for help in defending
the US currency, Wall Street sits up and takes notice.
Admittedly, investors are not so much worried about what the recent decline
in the value of the dollar against the D-Mark and the Yen might do to the
profits of companies with overseas earnings to repatriate, as they are
worried about what a desperate Fed might do to get the groggy dollar back on
its feet.
For if the concerted efforts of 18 central banks, and the application of
what one assumes must have been billions of dollars, could not stem the US
currency's decline, what can the Fed do to achieve its aim but raise US
interest rates one more time? And if the Fed is forced into raising rates to
defend the dollar, it must know that another quarter point on the federal
funds rate would not do the trick.
In all likelihood, the discount rate - untouched at 3 per cent during recent
monetary policy tightening - would have to go up, and probably by as much as
50 basis points. Anything less, and the foreign exchange markets are
unlikely to start taking the US government's talk of defending the dollar
seriously.
The only problem with this scenario is that a quick hike in the discount
rate could inflict another devastating blow on the still vulnerable US bond
market, and a fresh sell-off of bonds could trigger another sharp decline in
the equally vulnerable stock market. From the dollar to the discount rate to
bond prices to share prices, the dominos would tumble.
The great irony in all of this is that one of the reasons the US government
is unhappy about the dollar's fall is the impact it has had on the bond
market - foreign investors have been reluctant to buy Treasury bonds for
fear of seeing the value of their investment undermined by a depreciating
dollar. Yet, if the Fed raises rates to boost the value of the dollar, bond
prices will probably drop, which will only make the market more unattractive
to overseas investors.
No one, of course, ever suggested the job of a central banker was easy, but
the people at the Fed must be extremely unhappy that the delicate task of
holding off inflation without undermining the economic recovery has been
made that much harder by the dollar's travails.
However, if the Fed has been hesitating over a dollar- inspired rate
increase because of what it might do to the bond and stock markets, its hand
may be forced into another tightening once yesterday's April employment
report has been fully digested by the policy makers.
Anticipating a rise in non-farm payrolls during April of somewhere close to
195,000, Wall Street analysts were shocked yesterday when the Labor
department announced that payrolls had jumped by 267,000 last month. The
drop in the national unemployment rate from 6.5 per cent to 6.4 per cent
also caught the markets by surprise, as did the upward revision in the
already extremely strong March payroll numbers.
The reaction from the bond market was instantaneous - the price of the
benchmark 30-year bond dropped over 2 points, and the yield climbed to more
than 7.5 per cent - and indicated that investors believed the data would
push the Fed into another interest rate increase. Share prices quickly
followed bonds lower yesterday, and by midday it appeared likely that the
Fed would tighten policy again - if not immediately, then probably some time
around the May 17 meeting of the central bank's Open Market Committee.
If the employment report spooked the stock and bond markets, it at least
allowed traders and investors to forget temporarily their worries about the
dollar. After an initial burst of activity, following the release of the
jobs figures, trading on the currency markets in New York was relatively
quiet, with the dollar slipping slightly from its overnight levels. Any
support the currency might have received from the likelihood of an interest
rate increase was offset by the unwillingness of foreign investors to buy
dollar assets such as US stocks and bonds.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Markets: BP springs a pleasant surprise - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The big surprise this week came not in the ballot boxes - the Tory showing
in Thursday's local elections was expected to be pretty bad, and indeed it
was - but in the announcement of British Petroleum's first quarter dividend
payment, also on Thursday.
A rise of nearly a fifth, the first increase since BP cut its dividend two
years ago, came as a most pleasant surprise for a stock market which has
become bogged down in fears about the macro-economic picture.
The increase underlines the fact that dividends have gone up by more than
expected in the latest round of results. Mark Brown, equity strategist at
Hoare Govett, reckons that from the results seen so far from 80 large
industrial companies dividends have risen in aggregate by 10 per cent, which
compares to a forecast in January of 6 per cent.
This has persuaded investors to raise their expectations of dividend rises
in 1994. According to the monthly Gallup survey of institutional investors
views, predictions for 1994 dividend increases from all quoted UK companies,
have risen from 4.3 per cent in October last year to 7.4 per cent last
month.
Growth in dividends ought to support the stock market - after all the
fundamental purpose in holding shares is to receive a cash return. Brown
puts the corporate generosity down to companies not knowing what to do with
their mounting cash.
The corporate sector's financial position has improved markedly over the
last few years, partly because of rights issues, and now companies are
generating more cash than they know what to do with.
Companies are not, it seems, investing more, according to the latest CBI
survey on investment intentions. So cash is going into higher dividends and
takeover bids.
More bids appeared this week, with the emphasis again on buying outside the
UK. SmithKline Beecham is paying Dollars 2.3bn to buy a US drug wholesaler,
while Wassall, the conglomerate, is buying a US cable maker for Dollars
270m, partly financed by a rights issue.
However, the Footsie fell for the first half of this week to 3070.5 on
Wednesday, a low for the year and nearly 13 per cent off the peak at the
start of February. The main worry was the narrow money figure published on
Tuesday, which showed MO had risen by 6.2 per cent in the year to April.
This is well above the Government's target range of 0 to 4 per cent for the
indicator, and above market expectations. The gilt-edged market took the
news badly and between Tuesday morning and Wednesday evening the yield on
10-year gilts had risen from just under 8 per cent to 8.4 per cent.
Turmoil in the currency markets, with the dollar requiring concerted central
bank support did not help. The fear was that US rates could rise again to
hold up the dollar and this would mean UK interest rates rising again. Hopes
for one last quarter point cut in base rates were fading fast this week, and
money markets are now discounting a significant rise in rates by the year
end.
It is here that there is the biggest discrepancy between market watchers'
views. On the bearish side are the likes of Nick Knight, strategist at
Nomura International. Having been a superbull until the market turned,
Knight is now concerned that base rates could be rising sharply.
The stock market was largely ignoring the local government elections, rising
on both Thursday - thanks to BP - and Friday - until a weak opening on Wall
Street dragged it down to its opening level - although not sufficiently to
offset Tuesday and Wednesday's falls. But Knight took the results to mean
that the Tory government will now have to hold off a general election until
the last possible time, spring 1997.
If that is the case, he argues, the government needs to tighten policy now -
by marching interest rates up - so that there is scope to loosen again later
by marching rates down before the election.
Without higher interest rates, and possibly even with them, he says,
sterling will come under pressure. And that would push gilts and equities
lower. At best, he believes, the Footsie will be little changed over the
summer months, and it could go much lower. That being the case, his advice
is to sell and put the cash on deposit for a higher return.
An opposing view is taken by Michael Hughes, managing director of economics
and strategy at BZW. He sees the local elections as largely irrelevant,
unless they scare international investors. And he says there was a better
tone to the market this week with buyers coming in on weakness in the
Footsie.
He believes US interest rates will not rise beyond 5 per cent and UK
inflation will stay below the 6 per cent threshold at which it has, in the
past, got out of hand. With the earnings yield at 7 per cent and gilt yields
above 8 per cent - a growth rate actuaries often apply to pension fund
liabilities - he is comfortable with the level of the equity market now.
His concern is more that the economic recovery is already nearing its peak,
with growth in 1995 perhaps no stronger than in 1994. If there is a negative
for the market, he asserts, it is that growth might fail, not that interest
rates will rise.
There was no sign of a faltering of corporate profit recovery in this week's
results though. Aside from BP's healthy profit rise, Tate and Lyle, the
sugar and sweeteners group, increased profits over 20 per cent in its first
half year, while BAT Industries, the tobacco and insurance giant, lifted
first quarter profits by a fifth as well.
Even Body Shop International, the toiletries and cosmetics maker and
retailer, confounded its critics with an underlying rise of a third in
profits for the year.
But it will take more than one of Body Shop's potions to restore John
Major's fortunes.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Building societies disagree on house
prices - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The two largest building societies, while agreeing on the size of house
price movements in April compared to the previous month, disagreed on their
direction. Halifax's seasonally adjusted figures showed a drop of 0.2 of a
percentage point while Nationwide reported a 0.2 point rise. Halifax also
reported that prices paid by first time buyers were half a percentage point
higher last month, following sharper rises of 1.6 point and 1.3 point in
February and March.
Figures from the Lord Chancellor's Department showed that orders for
mortgage repossession have fallen to their lowest level since 1989. County
courts in England and Wales made 17,522 orders for possession in the first
quarter of the year compared with 23,646 in the last quarter of 1993. The
number of actions commenced also fell sharply.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Markets: Bank that stuck to banking - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are a widow or an orphan, the shares of most banks are not an obvious
thing to buy. Their cyclical swings in earnings and habit of wasting any
capital they manage to accumulate on disastrous purchases in far-flung parts
of the world do not help the cautious investor sleep soundly at night.
One bank in which the prudent orphan might invest slipped briefly into the
public eye this week. Bank of Scotland, the smallest and most discreet of
the clearing banks, published its annual results, more than doubling pre-tax
profits to Pounds 268.7m and raising its dividend by 10.5 per cent.
Bank of Scotland has been a connoisseurs' bank for about a decade, since its
senior directors decided to grow by lending money outside Scotland,
establishing 21 branches south of the border. They have since managed to
expand their market share of lending, even last year when loan demand was
slack.
Lending money does not sound too radical a strategy for a bank, but it has
become increasingly unusual as others have suffered from bad debts as a
result of the last recession. They have instead tried to raise income from
other sources such as selling insurance and savings products.
But in spite of suffering from some poor lending - notably to property
companies in the south-east - Bank of Scotland has retained its faith in
banking. It has steadily expanded its balance sheet - its lending rose by 8
per cent last year in contrast to other banks, which had tiny increases.
There have been sceptics about Bank of Scotland. Critics have accused it of
being capital-hungry as it ploughed the proceeds of three 1980s rights
issues into an expansion of lending. This meant that it did not accumulate
capital that could finance bumper dividend increases.
The bearish view of the bank has dominated from the start of this year when
its share price fell from a peak of 246p to yesterday's level of 185p. This
was because it was seen to have less spare capital than banks such as Abbey
National and Royal Bank of Scotland to give back in dividends.
Yet the bank's supporters argue that this argument misses the point. They
say that its management's ability to expand interest income steadily and
make fewer errors than others underpins Bank of Scotland's ability to
guarantee steady - although unexciting - long-term dividend growth.
'I quite like the stock as a long-term, very safe, source of dividends,'
says Hugh Pye, an analyst at BZW, Barclays' investment banking arm. He
argues that the bank's relative lack of capital is an advantage because it
is less likely to waste its money on a poor acquisition.
Pye points to Bank of Scotland's ability to carry on growing its loan book
in England, and benefit from further reductions in its bad debts. He also
says it has plenty of scope to raise income by selling customers other
products, which would help to boost staff productivity.
Yet reassuring as this may be, Bank of Scotland shares are not a cheap
source of dividends. The bank's gross yield was 3.4 per cent yesterday, a
slight discount to the FT-A All Share. The sceptical orphan might wonder why
he or she should trust any bank more than the average public company.
Terry Smith, a banking analyst at Collins Stewart, says that Bank of
Scotland has yet to prove that it can generate enough capital through
retained earnings to sustain growth both in assets and dividends. He
recommended his clients to sell Bank of Scotland shares when they were at
240p.
Yet in spite of some scepticism, Smith thinks that this could be the time to
reinvest. He says he feels uncomfortable not to have it among his
recommended shares. 'It is a well-managed bank, and its shares are never
going to fall to the point where they are screamingly cheap,' he says.
Even those who are not widows or orphans might think about Bank of Scotland
as part of an equity portfolio, according to Pye of BZW. 'It is the sort of
thing you should have as a long-term core hold. I see it as something to buy
for the kids so that they can keep it for 15 years,' he says.

FT  07 MAY 94 / The Long View: The neutral zone

Now the squeeze is on in earnest. Gilt-edged yields rose to 8 1/4 per cent
at one stage this week. This, if you believe in the government's central
inflation target of 2 1/2 per cent or less (apparently few do), implies a
real long-term interest rate of almost 6 per cent. UK equities yield only
around 3.7 per cent, and are wilting under the competition.
Domestically the local government elections have not helped, by providing a
reminder of John Major's frailty. With another month of Tory tensions to
come, ahead of the elections for the European Parliament, the political
background is not going to get any easier. Michael Portillo's sneers at the
single European currency have served to emphasise just why sterling tends to
move with the dollar rather than the D-Mark and the other continental
currencies. In the midst of a developing dollar crisis, sterling may be a
sideshow, but one where casual passers-by are tempted to knock off a coconut
or two.
New readers start here. Last year the Bank of England eagerly sold Pounds
14bn worth of gilts to foreigners as yields tumbled from 9 to 6 1/2 per
cent. Most of those foreigners were feeding off a bond market bubble created
by the US Federal Reserve which was pumping unlimited quantities of dollars
at 3 per cent into the global financial system. Now the Fed is cranking up
interest rates and the bubble has burst.
All bond markets around the world are in disarray but gilts have suffered
worse than any other major national market: yields on 10-year German bunds,
for instance, have only risen by 90 basis points (hundredths of a per cent)
since the beginning of the year against 210 basis points on 10-year gilts
(and 130 basis points on US Treasuries). An important reason is that after
years of relatively high inflation and much better equity returns there are
few substantial domestic buyers of sterling bonds: private individuals by
and large do not buy them, and nor do pension funds, which bought only
Pounds 2.7bn out of Pounds 50bn issued in 1993.
Memo to Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England: Urgent discussions
should be held with the Department of Social Security, now finalising a
White Paper embracing many of the recommendations of last year's Goode
Committee Report on pension law reform. This could be a heaven-sent
opportunity to impose a really tough minimum solvency standard on pension
funds, forcing them to buy more gilts.
Another reason for the colly-wobbles in the gilt market is that there are
ominous signs of the onset of an old-fashioned sterling crisis; already
sterling has softened by 3 per cent so far this year, in terms of its
trade-weighted index.
The UK is cyclically out of step with its main trading partners in
continental Europe, leading to strength in imports but weakness in exports,
and the monthly visible trade gap appears to be running at more than Pounds
1bn. Meanwhile three-month sterling interest rates offer no premium over
continental rates at about 5 1/4 per cent, and although there is still a
margin over three-month dollar rates of just under 4 1/2 per cent, this may
not last for long.
The dollar, after all, has its own big problems. Another rescue effort was
mounted by the mainr central banks this week as the beleaguered US currency
threatened to crash down through the 100 yen level. Whereas Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the US Federal Reserve, appears to have had in mind a leisurely
timetable for raising short-term interest rates a quarter of a percentage
point at a time, the recent pressure on the dollar must have added some
urgency to the promised transition from monetary permissiveness to what
Greenspan has unspecifically referred to as a 'neutral' stance.
What does neutrality mean here? Many economists believe that a 5 per cent
Federal funds rate would be a reasonable target (the current 3 3/4 per cent
rate is expected to rise at least to 4 per cent around the time of the Fed's
Open Market Committee meeting on May 17).
But according to David Shaw, investment strategist at Legal &amp; General, an
analysis of the last five US business cycles extending back to 1960 shows
that a neutral ratio for the growth rate of nominal GDP to the three-month
dollar interest rate has been 1.15.
Given that nominal GDP is likely to grow by about 7 per cent over the next
year, a three-month interest rate of 6 per cent is indicated by mid-1995
(equivalent to a Fed funds rate of perhaps 5 1/2 per cent). Moreover, later
in the economic cycle the Fed is likely to tighten its policy further.
Japan and Germany will be able to brush aside these coming rises in US
interest rates. Their recent common problem has been the excessive strength
of their currencies against the dollar. But the UK, unable to survive within
the European exchange rate mechanism, could be in a quite different
position.
Traditionally, sterling drifts somewhere in between the dollar and the
D-Mark, and the present cyclical position of the UK economy suggests that
the dollar will have a stronger pull in the near term. Only a sharp and
unexpected improvement in the UK's balance of payments would avoid the need
for some tough decisions on interest rates later this year.
Running deficits can be fun when they are easy to finance, but foreign
creditors tend to have their own agenda. While chancellor Kenneth Clarke was
trying to loosen monetary policy in February the turmoil in the gilt-edged
market was imposing a new squeeze which resulted, for instance, in a jump in
fixed mortgage rates.
John Major may want to reflect on the paradox that although Japanese
governments and prime ministers come and go the yen goes on strengthening
regardless. On the basis of the markets' reaction to the election results
yesterday, Major's fall would certainly not be viewed with any great alarm.

US President Bill Clinton came to power on the promise that he would
re-stitch America's badly-worn social fabric. Health, education, racial
tension, the under-class - just about any subject to do with the declining
quality of life in America draws fire. But none so excites the ire of the
average citizen as that of law and order and a problem that lies at the
heart of American street violence - drugs.
Since 1988, the US government has annually spent more than Dollars 10bn on
drug enforcement programmes. It sounds a lot, but it has done little to stem
America's appetite for snorting, injecting, smoking or ingesting illegal
substances imported from the four corners of the world. Today, America's 11m
users spend five times as much on drug consumption as the government spends
trying to stop them getting hold of drugs in the first place.
Bill Clinton has recognised that the real solution to the problem lies in
Americans themselves - more effort is now being put into rehabilitation,
education and community programmes aimed at reducing drug demand
domestically.
But at the same time, his administration has adopted new tactics in its war
against the global drug trade. Of the record Dollars 13bn requested for the
President's 1995 National Drug Control Strategy, 60 per cent is earmarked
for 'supply reduction programs' - instead of going after drugs and dealers
upon arrival in the US, the emphasis is now on suppressing the drugs trade
at source.
                         *      *      *
I had just left the Bolivian mountain capital of La Paz, where I had seen
something of the drug-trafficking life. I had had enough drug weirdness,
enough confusion, intrigue, paranoia, enough Bad Guy behavior. Here, in the
Chapare district of lowland Bolivia, I hoped things would be more
straightforward. I was going to go patrolling with Umopar, a para-military
jungle unit trained and equipped by the DEA, the US Drug Enforcement Agency,
to eliminate the Bolivian drug trade.
But nothing in Bolivia is as simple as it seems. Matters in Chapare seen
from the side of law and order turned out to be no less odd than seen in La
Paz from the point of view of the drug villains.
In fact things have gone so far awry in Bolivia that in popular opinion,
roles have become bizarrely reversed: the 35,000 Indian families who
cultivate coca in Chapare are innocent and downtrodden victims, while Umopar
and their foreign mentors, the DEA, are evil bullies bent on social
fragmentation.
From a desk in Washington, neat and innocuous-sounding policy initiatives
like 'supply reduction' may sound rational and entirely justifiable. When
issues have become as confused on the ground as this one, however, policy
execution is an entirely different matter. As a result of a forceful new
coca eradication campaign, Chapare erupted in bloody violence the day after
I arrived.
Sitting in the office of Commandante Luis Caballero, head of the Mobile
Rural Patrol Unit - or Umopar, as its Spanish acronym has it - I could see
why the Commandante was loath at present to let me accompany one of his
groups. Things were not going well.
Outside in the Umopar compound sat armoured cars with smashed windscreens
and burned-out military transport trucks dragged back from the day's action.
On one side of a quadrangle of barracks were piles of primary cocaine
processing material - sacks of lime, jerry cans of kerosene, bottles of
sulphuric acid. On the other, a large squad of soldiers was being issued
with riot gear - helmets, batons, shields and tear gas cannisters.
Flying low over the palm trees and jungle surrounding the base, helicopters
shuttled back and forth with men and material. All over Chapare roads were
blocked, goverment buildings were being destroyed, and spear-wielding,
dynamite-throwing peasants were clashing with Umopar troops.
The Commandante, though, was putting a positive face on it. A well-built,
thick-set man with a heavy moustache, he wore a black T-shirt and a pistol
at his belt. Emblazoned on his chest was the Umopar logo - a crossed dagger
and M-16 rifle, and the legend Leopardos.
'The new campaign is achieving results,' he asserted. 'In one month the
Leopards have destroyed 255 pozas - the coca leaf maceration pits in which
the cocaine refining process begins. Also 246 kilos of cocaine paste, and
755 litres of agua rica - liquid cocaine concentrate. It is the biggest
operation we have ever mounted.'
But, the Commandante assured me, now was no time to go out looking for pozas
 -the cocaleros, or coca leaf growers and processors, were on the war path.
To convince me, he led me across the heat-baked quadrangle to a room full of
objects seized from Chapare's 'ant army' - the hundreds of men, women and
children who surrepticiously carry cocaine out along trails and forest
tracks. There were narco-shoes with hollowed out-heels, narco-bibles with no
text between Genesis and Exodus, even stuffed and sewn-up narco-chickens.
But the Commandante wanted to show me a bomb, a five-gallon cooking-oil tin
filled with glass, stones and explosives, attached to 100 yards of wire with
a car battery at the other end.
'It is primitive but effective,' he said. The traffickers like to surprise
us on jungle paths. They are well organised, have better arms and better
communications than we. Worst of all, we do not know who they are - often
the little children sitting by the roadside are not as innocent as they look
 -they are narco-lookouts.'
Narco-politicians in La Paz, narco-children in Chapare . . . was there
nothing in this part of the world to which that prefix could not be
attached? The Commandante persuaded me to wait until things calmed down and
I went off to find out about Chapare's narco-economy with Jenny Ortiz of the
United Nations Drug Control Programme.
                         *      *      *
The UNDCP is the United Nations' biggest undertaking in Bolivia; it is
devoted not to drug enforcement and eradication, but to alternative
development - to creating economic opportunities other than coca cultivation
for the Indian families of Chapare.
In the last few years all sorts of occupational schemes, as well as road,
electricity and water supply networks, have been initiated by the UN.
Banana, citrus, tea, cassava, aromatic plant and dairy projects have all
been established. None have provided a real solution. The simple fact
remains that with four coca harvests a year bringing in between Dollars
1,200 and Dollars 1,500 a hectare, there is no peasant activity in Chapare
as profitable as coca cultivation. In spite of all eradication efforts, last
year saw a net increase in coca cultivation.
I had lunch with Jenny Ortiz at DoMa Gaetana's restaurant, a palm-frond
shack on the edge of the village of Chimore, headquarters for both Umopar
and the UN. DoMa Gaetana is an enormous Indian woman with long black braids,
gold-filigree teeth, and a liking for birds and flowers; two brilliant green
parrots sat in the orange trees beside the shack and watched us as we ate.
None of this exotic colour, though, did much to hide the surrounding
poverty. Chapare is the poorest region in the poorest country in Latin
America.
Jenny no more believes in the benefits of cocaine than does Bill Clinton,
but after years spent working in Chapare she understands the peasant point
of view.
'You don't pose moral questions on an empty stomach,' she said. 'There are
few genuine markets for most of the products we are trying to persuade the
peasants to grow. In Ibirgasama, where Umopar helicopters fired machine guns
over the heads of 40,000 demonstrating peasants yesterday, Scandinavian
Pentecostals built a 50,000 litre-a-day dairy - all we have to do now is
persuade Bolivians to keep cows and develop a taste for milk. We are trying
to offer a better life to peasants, but survival now means much more to them
than development over five years. The problem remains the high price offered
for coca.'
Down the road, 200 yards from DoMa Gaetana's, the focus of activity in the
centre of Chimore is the tin-covered coca market. Here coca leaves, piled in
great mounds or packed in 100 pound bags, are bought and sold daily under
the noses of passing Umopar patrols. Everywhere you drive in Chapare you
find vast stretches of roadside coca fields and harvested leaves being dried
outside village houses. There is not the slightest attempt at concealment.
If poverty gives impetus to the cocaine trade, so does the coca leaf's
confusing legal status. Coca has been chewed as a stimulant by Andean
Indians for thousands of years. Its use in Spanish colonial times was
encouraged in order to exact the maximum work possible in fields and mines.
Its use more recently has been vigorously defended by powerful domestic
interests seeking profit or political support. Most Bolivians regard coca as
a valued part of their cultural heritage; some still speak of the 'sacred
leaf'.
Today coca is both legal and illegal. In 1988 the Bolivian government, under
international pressure, passed a law setting aside 12,000 hectares of coca
for legal use - chewing, tea, and pharmaceutical production. All other
hectarage was defined as 'excedentary', and subject to phased, voluntary
eradication in return for cash payment. Any new, post-1988 cultivation was
declared illegal. Such a system, of course, is wide open to spectacular
abuse. Today, virtually all of Chapare's 28,000 hectares of coca go towards
the making of cocaine.
I left with an Umopar patrol at dawn three days later. I liked the 10
soldiers who made up the unit - they were uncomplicated boys from the
countryside. But I found pencil-moustached Teniente Avila, the officer in
charge of the patrol, an ominous character; anyone who wears black leather
gloves in the humidity of tropical jungle is, as far as I am concerned,
creepy.
Leaving behind a squad of muscle-bulging, crew-cut blond Americans doing
calesthenics in front of the esquela anti-narcotico, the DEA training
school, we drove off into the bush. Normally I would have been fascinated
with the discoveries that come with a tramp through the Amazon basin - thick
rain forests, groves of giant bamboo, strange flowers, spiders' webs
glinting with dew, blue butterflies as big as your hand.
I was more concerned, though, with what lay at the end of the narrow and
difficult paths we were following. On some of them I could barely the see
indications of human passage - the newly broken branch, the muddy footprint
 -that might or might not indicate the presence of a poza hidden deep in the
forest.
But these men were taking no chances. They studied the ground with great
attention, walked with automatic weapons at the ready, and communicated
silently with hand signals. Three times that morning we moved in cautiously
on clearings where through jungle growth they had spotted the wooden stakes,
the plastic sheeting, the discarded jerry cans and acid bottles that give
away a maceration pit.
Each time, though, we found the pozas abandoned and the cocaine processors
moved on. The entire area, in fact, seemed abandoned that day. The patrol
moved through hamlet after jungle hamlet, each as dirt-poor as any you might
find in Africa, rifling through huts and looking for locals who might be
paid or pressured to provide information.
Whole villages were empty. Teniente Avila's eyes glinted with anticipation
when once we came across a Baptist with a suitcase full of heavy books. But
they were only books. Waste-deep swamps, clouds of mosquitoes,
brain-deadening heat - by noon the thrill of the jungle had began to wane.
By late afternoon we were discouraged and worn out.
Had Umopar's anti-narcotics campaign scared the cocaleros away from the
region? Not at all. We ran into them on the drive back. Organised by
Chapare's powerful and militant coca-grower's federations, they were
gathered by the thousands at demonstrations along the highway. I was pushed
down to the floor of the truck so my white gringo face - easily mistaken for
a hated DEA face - could not be seen. With machetes banging angrily against
the side of the truck, we passed through a sea of jeering peasants.
                         *      *      *
Has Umopar's anti-narcotics campaign succeeded at all? Like many observers
Peter Shaw, my former drug-dealing acquaintance in La Paz, says that until
poverty disappears, the trade is likely to continue - there is just too much
pressure and too much corruption to wipe it out otherwise.
Shaw laughed when I mentioned finding individual pozas; the big refining
labs where the final refining process takes place, he said, are heavily
protected by pay-offs to government officials; so are the transportation
routes out of the country. Worse, the trade is spreading eastwards into
Brazil where a new cocaine theatre, as yet wholly uncontrolled, is rapidly
opening up.
A Dollars 13bn annual budget notwithstanding, America's drug war is likely
to continue for some time.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Civil war intensifies in Yemen: Port city targeted as Arab
League calls emergency meeting

Heavy ground fighting erupted throughout Yemen yesterday, with air attacks
launched against several cities, as the country entered its third day of an
intensifying civil war.
Military leaders in Sanaa, the capital, appear to have given up hope of a
negotiated end to the hostilities, and declared their aim was to capture the
southern port city of Aden and take control of the entire country.
The French navy evacuated some 400 Westerners yesterday from Aden. The
defence ministry in Paris said boats ferried the evacuees to the warship
Jules Verne, just outside Yemen's territorial waters. A spokesman said about
2,000 westerners lived in Yemen, and some 5,000 of dual nationality, mainly
American-Yemenis.
Fears about the escalating conflict in Yemen, a relatively small exporter of
oil, has coincided with increasing concerns about tight oil supplies,
pushing oil prices higher. The North Sea Brent crude oil price rose by 50
cents to Dollars 16.05 a barrel yesterday.
The north Yemeni leadership, headed by General Ali Abdullah Saleh, dismissed
the southern leader, Mr Ali Salem al-Biedh, from the government and ordered
its troops to capture him and other high-ranking officials, branding them
'war criminals'.
Yemen became a single country in 1990 when the north and south agreed to
merge after more than three years of negotiation. During the past year
political differences have deepened despite attempts by other Arab countries
to negotiate a solution. An emergency meeting of the Arab League has been
called by Egypt for today, and President Hafez al-Assad, of Syria, appealed
to Yemeni leaders for restraint.
North Yemeni military commanders said yesterday that the south had launched
a missile attack on Sanaa at 2.45am, hitting close to the presidential
palace. Western diplomats confirmed the report and identified the missile as
a Scud.
Northern defenders met attacking aircraft with anti-aircraft fire and sent
up two further barrages at 4.30am and 6am.
Sanaa radio reported further air raids on the northern region at Hodeida, a
main port city on the Red Sea; at Mareb, a key oil-producing region east of
Sanaa; and at Taiz, a major city some 250km south of Sanaa. There were no
immediate assessments of damage or casualties.
Ground fighting was reported in the border region between the former north
and south Yemen. Northern republican guards are said to have routed the
southern Basuhaib brigade in a tank battle on Wednesday night at Dhamar,
about 100km south of Sanaa.
Northern units were reported to be driving towards Mukayras, about 120km
north-east of Aden, in an effort to link with other units based at nearby
Laudar and at Shuqra, on the Gulf of Aden. Their aim is to isolate Aden,
which is already cut off from communications. A northern officer, dismissing
the old border, said: 'Our only frontier now is the sea.'
The northern leadership also cut most communication links with the outside
world. Airports in Sanaa and Aden have been closed indefinitely.

The Hang Seng index fell 31 per cent between its peak in January and its low
for the year on Wednesday. That fall seems to discount a lot of bad news,
some of which may not actually materialise. The market is assuming that the
US will renew China's most-favoured nation status. Its bigger local worry
has been the property market.
Since the government started trying to increase the supply of residential
property by increasing land sales and easing planning restrictions, prices
have fallen some 5 to 10 per cent. The commercial property market still
looks expensive. But in both cases there is still a good chance of a soft
landing. Hong Kong property tends to be in structurally short supply.
Although Unisys has decided to pull back from the territory on the grounds
that rents are too expensive, most companies seriously interested in trading
with China regard a Hong Kong presence as essential, and there is a
continuing dearth of prime quality office space. Moreover, Hong Kong's
currency peg to the US means monetary policy is likely to remain loose for
local conditions, even if real interest rates have become slightly less
negative.
The stock market's bounce yesterday suggests that Hong Kong equities have
become at least a trading buy, especially since there are signs of
constructive talks resuming on the airport project. Consensus forecasts for
earnings growth approaching 20 per cent this year put the market on a
prospective p/e of less than 12 times. And for Japanese buyers starting with
a strong Yen the market must look doubly cheap.

FT  07 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospects for Euro Disney shareholders go from bad to worse. Not only
were revenues for the half year to the end of March down 12 per cent on the
comparable period of last year, mainly as a result of a 6 per cent fall in
admissions. It also appears that shareholders are going to suffer even
heavier dilution than previously feared in the theme park's forthcoming
FFr6bn rights issue.
The new shares now seem likely to be sold at under the FFr10 price that the
market had been envisaging. The share par value is being cut from FFr10 to
FFr5, and it looks as if Euro Disney is proposing to offer the shares at the
deepest of discounts. If a price of FFr8 were chosen, 750m new shares would
be created - or more than four for every existing share. The potential
dilution is even greater when Euro Disney's plan to issue all shareholders
with warrants is taken into account.
Though the company's share price fell a further 2 per cent to FFr31.65
yesterday, it is hard to see why it should hold at even this shrunken level.
Euro Disney could move modestly into profit in 1996. But earnings growth
will be restrained as interest payments to banks and royalties to Walt
Disney, the 49 per cent shareholder, kick in again from 1998. Even if good
profits materialise at the start of the next century, they will have to be
shared between around 1bn shares.

FT  07 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: UK insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The falling rate of repossession is good news for hard pressed homeowners
and the insurance companies which sold them mortgage indemnity policies.
That will be a particular relief to Sun Alliance and Royal Insurance, which
reports first quarter figures next week. Even allowing that recent figures
have been flattered by changes in county court procedures, the trend of
repossessions is clearly downwards. Lower mortgage interest rates are the
main reason, although the first signs of rising house prices might also be
making lenders less inclined to step in.
Yet rising house prices may not be universally good news for the insurers.
With prices still 30 per cent below the peak in some areas - and repossessed
properties selling for less - lenders are not wholly protected from loss by
mortgage indemnity insurance. If prices rise to the point where insurance
companies are footing the whole bill, building societies and banks will have
a greater incentive to repossess. That trigger point may not be reached
until next year, by which time interest rates could again be rising.
Mortgage lenders have to consider the potential cost of damaging publicity.
Big lenders will not want to move the housing market against them by
releasing cheap stock. But it is too early to be sure that the problem is
over. Aggregate claims reserves of Pounds 1.75bn across the insurance
industry look adequate, but only if there is no marked deterioration in the
trend. At least with other lines of business now delivering exceptional
returns, insurers could afford quietly to top-up reserves without
disappointing the market on profits.

FT  07 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: A local difficulty
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since its first reaction was to rise, the UK equity market was evidently
unperturbed by the local election results. Its greater concern is the trend
in US markets where yesterday's jobless figures and worries about the dollar
suggest another round of monetary tightening is due. With long dated US
Treasury bonds trading at a yield as high as 7.5 per cent yesterday and Wall
Street equities heading lower, the short-term risk to the UK market looks
considerable. Perhaps because the political situation is so difficult to
fathom, investors may feel tempted to ignore the local election results. A
prolonged period of political uncertainty would be unhelpful just the same.
A successful challenge to Mr John Major need not change the basic thrust of
economic policy. The divisions within the party are more to do with Europe,
and the chances are that any new leader would have little choice but to
continue driving the borrowing requirement lower. The greater uncertainty
concerns monetary policy. If a leadership challenge in the autumn is
possible, there is very little chance of interest rates being raised before
then, even if M0 money supply growth continues to race ahead.
For the same reason, sterling is left unprotected. The currency has already
shown signs of weakness in the backwash of the dollar's troubles. Further
falls would inevitably upset the gilts market too. Gilts shed 1.5 points
yesterday, and the yield on index-linked paper is again uncomfortably close
to that on equities. Shares cannot ignore that indefinitely.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Coffee leads commodity prices surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES, KENNETH GOODING and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International coffee prices yesterday staged their highest daily rise for
nine years when benchmark futures contracts increased Dollars 91 a tonne.
The jump came as other commodity markets showed big gains. Copper prices
soared to their highest level in 10 months, helped by news that London Metal
Exchange stocks of the metal had fallen by 3.5 per cent to their lowest
level since July last year.
Oil prices rose by 50 cents to Dollars 16.05 a barrel for North Sea Brent
crude after the outbreak of fighting in Yemen. Cocoa and aluminium prices
also made modest gains on the back of the surge in the other markets.
'It's a classic commodity bull run, but it is still sporadic and it's too
soon to talk about commodity prices pushing up inflation,' said Mr Lawrence
Eagles, commodities analyst at GNI brokers in London.
The recent price surge, which has seen the London Commodity Exchange's July
coffee futures contracts rise 10 per cent this week to a five-year high of
Dollars 1,789 a tonne, has been exacerbated by speculative money pouring
into the commodity markets.
'The funds tend to treat commodities as a group and with one going up they
pile into them all,' Mr Eagles said.
The strength of the US economy has prompted rising demand for basic raw
materials such as oil, copper and coffee. Stocks of these commodities are
low after five years of depressed prices.
Stocks of LME copper are now 26 per cent below February's 16-year peak,
pushing the price of copper for delivery in three months up Dollars 52.75 to
Dollars 2.027.50 a tonne yesterday. The price has recovered by more than 25
per cent since it reached a six-year low of Dollars 1.613 in the autumn.
Oil prices have risen sharply in recent weeks from a low of Dollars 12.90 in
mid-February. Although Yemen is not a big oil exporter, the outbreak of
fighting coincided with a perception in the markets that supplies could
become tighter.
The oil price is also being sustained by a flurry of buying by refiners, who
until recently had delayed purchases of crude in the hope that prices might
weaken.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, said that its commodity index, which
tracks the prices of 20 commodities, rose 4.4 per cent in the first quarter
of the year and is forecast to increase by 2.5 per cent over the next year.
But producers say prices are only just beginning to return to levels at
which they can make a profit.
'Overall, producers' revenues have halved to Dollars 5bn a year in the past
five years and they cannot afford to fertilise their crops,' said Mr Nestor
Osorio, Colombian coffee representative in London.

FT  07 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow trims losses in face of
jobs data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks trimmed their losses yesterday afternoon even though bonds had
broken into full retreat in the face of strong employment data, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 26.47 lower at 3,669.50, after
battling back from a 54-point deficit in the final hour of trading. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 3.56 at 447.82, as declining
NYSE issues swamped advances, 1,685 to 546. In the secondary markets, the
American SE composite was off 1.97 at 439.73, and the Nasdaq dropped 7.64 to
732.91.
Keenly awaited data on April employment conditions proved to be a big
letdown for investors who were hoping for a signal that the Federal Reserve
would soon bring to an end a series of interest rate increases which began
three months ago. An hour before the session began, the Commerce Department
announced that US non-farm employers took on 267,000 more workers last
month, against forecasts of about 160,000.
Analysts said the sharp rise suggested an intensification of inflationary
pressures and raised the likelihood that the Fed would now move more
aggressively to slow the economy. Many were convinced the central bank would
soon boost the Federal Funds and discount rates by 50 basis points each.
At the opening the blue chips dropped nearly 35 points, but recovered to
trade about 20 points down within the first hour. Such resilience was
encouraging in view of the rout taking place in the bond market.
But near midday, it became apparent that the Fed would hold off until Monday
at the earliest. Its restraint blackened the already gloomy mood by
suggesting the central bank may not act decisively enough to quell
inflationary expectations. As a result, bond prices dropped further. Late in
the session, the price of benchmark 30-year security was down more than 2
points, with the yield jumping to 7.53 per cent, its highest level in 18
months.
With the Treasury market extending its losses, stocks began sliding for a
second time before touching bottom an hour before the close.
Stocks sensitive to economic trends were among the weakest. Caterpillar
closed down Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 108 1/8 , Deere lost Dollars 3 to
Dollars 72 7/8 and International Paper Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 62 7/8 .
Sears was down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 47 1/2 and McDonald's shed Dollars 1
1/8 to Dollars 57 3/4 .
Oil stocks, rising alongside crude prices, offset some of the losses. Arco,
up Dollars 4 5/8 at Dollars 104, was given an extra boost by an upgrading by
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Mobil gained Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 79 1/2
and Amoco Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 56 3/4 .
On the Nasdaq, Ben &amp; Jerry's, the Vermont ice cream maker, dropped Dollars 1
1/4 to Dollars 15 1/8 after reporting that frigid winter weather had held
its first-quarter earnings to 13 cents a share, after 21 cents a year
earlier.
Canada
Toronto stocks closed slightly lower in busy activity inflated by hectic
trading of PWA Corporation shares.
Almost all sectors were off, except for the precious metals group, up 5.5
per cent, higher on stronger gold prices. The TSE 300 composite index fell
5.75 to close at 4,254.06 in volume of 97.68m shares valued at CDollars
638.6m. The index dropped about 13 points on the week.
About 38.5m PWA shares were traded and the corporation, in the midst of a
restructuring, closed up 0.02 at 0.58.
Brazil
Brazil stock prices recovered from sharp losses to end up 4.3 per cent in a
highly volatile market that traders said will probably continue as the
October 3 presidential elections approach.
The Bovespa index ended at 15,103 points, up 624 on the day.

Golden Week

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A retreat in the yen against the dollar prompted small-lot buying and
equities rose 1.5 per cent in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 gained 292.26 to 19,862.47 after a low of 19,620.82 and a
high of 19,907.98. In a shortened week the index put on 0.7 per cent.
Volume was 170m shares, many investors remaining absent following the
market's holiday closure between Tuesday and Thursday.
Some dealers were heartened by the concerted round of dollar buying by
central banks over the past few days and supported the futures market. The
Topix index rose 22.21 to 1,615.69 and the Nikkei 300 by 4.35 to 295.60.
Gainers led losers by 827 to 174 with 124 unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.64 to 1311.26.
The low volumes helped to push up some speculative stocks on small-lot
buying by individuals: Wakachiku Construction rose Y15 to Y670 and Yamazaki
Baking by Y80 to Y2,090.
Banking stocks were supported by arbitrage buying. Industrial Bank of Japan
rose Y70 to Y3,220 and Sakura Bank gained Y10 to Y1,410.
Brokers, which were sold last Monday, were bought on bargain hunting, with
Nomura Securities rising Y40 to Y2,230 and Nikko Securities gaining Y30 to
Y1,230.
High-technology stocks improved following the slight fall in the yen, with
Hitachi putting on Y10 to Y961 and NEC adding Y30 to Y1,140. Car stocks were
also strong, with Toyota Motor up Y20 to Y1,980 and Honda Motor rising Y40
to Y1,710.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 204.31 to 22,096.86 in volume of 18.9m
shares. Export- oriented and retail stocks were bought, with Shima Seiki, an
industrial machine maker, up Y150 to Y7,000.
Roundup
Recovery in Hong Kong property stocks was matched by weakness in their
Singapore counterparts.
HONG KONG rebounded from a run of heavy losses, the Hang Seng index closing
207.39, or 2.5 per cent higher at 8,620.27, still 3.9 per cent lower on the
week. Once again, bargain-hunters snapped up properties, the sub-index
rising by 495.28, or 3.4 per cent to 14,900.99.
SHK Properties leapt HKDollars 2.25 to HKDollars 46.25, Cheung Kong jumped
HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 35.25 and Henderson Land rose HKDollars 0.75 to
HKDollars 37.
SYDNEY was lifted by selective bargain hunting after Thursday's sell-off and
the All Ordinaries index, ending a run of five consecutive losses, closed
16.2 higher at 2,004.3, 3 per cent down on the week.
SEOUL saw a late spurt of institutional, primary blue chip buying which took
the composite stock index up 5.51 to 927.84, 3.1 per cent higher on the
week. TAIPEI approached the 6,000 resistance level and turnover fell in
consequence, from TDollars 84.29bn to TDollars 70.47bn, as the weighted
index rose 36.50 to 5,953.27, off a high of 5,992.64 but 3.9 per cent up on
the week.
BOMBAY rose across a wide front on buying led by foreign and Indian mutual
funds, and on hopes that carry forward trading will be restored. The BSE 30
share index rose 91.4, or 2.5 per cent to 3,715.0, down 1.1 per cent on the
week.
COLOMBO put in a second day of recovery to end only fractionally down on the
week, the CSE all-share index closing 27.02 higher at 1,044.19.
WELLINGTON regained about half of Thursday's losses, aided mostly by partial
recoveries in Telecom and Fletcher Challenge. The NZSE-40 index rose 35.59
to 2,048.41, 2.9 per cent down on the week.
SINGAPORE reported weakness in property shares, following news of government
curbs on speculation in residential properties. The SES property index fell
1.7 per cent, as the Straits Times Industrial index closed 21.55 lower at
2,256.19.
MANILA was pulled back again by lower first quarter earnings from the
telephone company, PLDT. The composite index dipped 19.77 to 2,960.23, 4.1
per cent up on the week, as PLDT fell 65 pesos to 1,860.
BANGKOK fell on the day and the week, the SET index, at 1240.71, showing
falls of 11.66, and 2 per cent respectively.

FT  07 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Milan finds new focus in screen-based
trading - The market has further to go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Milan stock exchange building may now be silent, but the Italian stock
market is still in full cry.
Three weeks ago, the exchange moved to full on-screen trading, adding to its
computerised system the stocks still traded on the floor of the exchange by
open outcry. The impact of the change should have been limited - some 95 per
cent of trading was already carried out on-screen - but the transfer
coincided with the busiest week in the history of the exchange.
On several days in the preceding fortnight, more shares were traded in Milan
than on Wall Street. Two days before the scheduled changeover, record
volumes and the sheer quantity of small orders prevented the exchange
opening for normal business. The 'little bang' was postponed for 24 hours
while the exchange authorities put in place special measures to relieve
administrative pressure on the system.
'It was a development which was impossible to predict and unique in the
history of the stock exchange,' says Mr Attilio Ventura, the borsa's
chairman.
Mr Ventura need not be downcast: the market is a victim of its own success.
Since the beginning of the year, the Comit index has risen by nearly a
quarter. But the real surge in investors' interest began when it became
clear on March 28 that the right-wing alliance headed by the media magnate
Mr Silvio Berlusconi was heading for a convincing election victory. Before
the polls had closed the index had risen by 3.6 per cent to 693.52, and by
the middle of last week it had reached a record 813.63, provoking worries
that share prices might be losing touch with fundamental values.
Since then, delays in the formation of a Berlusconi government, and
profit-taking, took the edge off the post-electoral euphoria before the
index bounced back 3.5 per cent yesterday to 800.94 and analysts believe it
should top 900 within the next 12 months.
'The fact that the government is likely to be in place for more than six
months, with the possibility of implementing policy in the longer term, is
having a positive effect,' says Ms Paola Bergamaschi of Goldman Sachs in
London.
In addition, for the first time since the war, the Italian government will
be right of centre and keener to encourage business than its predecessors.
The political revolution is not the only reason for market optimism,
however.
The economy. Mr Berlusconi will inherit an economy emerging from a two-year
recession. Analysts are convinced that industrial company earnings, hit hard
by the downturn, should grow particularly strongly over the next two years.
The value of industrial stock rose 16 per cent in April.
Privatisation. The financial groups IMI, Credito Italiano and Banca
Commerciale Italiana have already come to the market. The next nine months
should see the sale of part of INA, the state-owned insurer, and the
privatisation of Stet, the state telecommunications group. The latter sale
is particularly keenly awaited.
Privatisation, apart from improving Milan's liquidity, is encouraging small
investors to switch their savings from government bonds to equities.
According to Mr Ventura, it could also persuade Italy's many family-owned
companies to consider a market listing.
Share and bond issues. Recent weeks have seen companies as diverse as
Olivetti, the computer group, and Mediobanca, the merchant bank, launching
plans to raise capital, mainly in the form of convertible bonds. Although
some observers blame the prospect of share issues for the small market
correction this week, this does not seem to have dented the enthusiasm of
large quoted companies to exploit a positive market. On Thursday, for
example, Cir, one of the De Benedetti family's two Italian holding
companies, profited from recent buoyancy to place a large stake in Sogefi,
the car components manufacturer, with institutional investors. The operation
was conceived and executed within the space of a week by Lehman Brothers.
The performance of the market in the next few months hinges on the
performance of an untested government. If the Berlusconi administration
departs from the relatively narrow path laid out by the Amato and Ciampi
governments and, in particular, if inflation begins to increase and the
trend for lower interest rates is reversed, then the equity market is likely
to suffer.
Meanwhile, in spite of technical hitches, the exchange is pressing ahead
with expansion plans. It is sometimes a thankless task: having taken action
to limit the number of very small orders which caused last month's overload,
the exchange authorities have found themselves under fire from small
investors, who claim they are being locked out.
But Mr Ventura shrugs off the problems and criticism and says that Milan
should move within a year to full cash settlement of trades. That should
provide a further incentive for non-Italian investors, especially if the
regulatory authorities also take much-needed action to improve the
transparency of public company accounts.
In the meantime, as Mr John Stewart of InterEuropa, the Milan broker, puts
it: 'The general feeling is so positive that it will override any technical
difficulties.'

FT  07 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sears sought
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was big turnover in Sears, with dealers reporting James Capel positive
and upgrading its forecast by Pounds 30m to Pounds 198m, easily the top of
the market range. The shares gained 4 1/2 to 126p in volume of 12m. Last
week the stores group reported a return to profits, recording Pounds 138.3m
against a Pounds 47.8m loss previously.
Shares in Thorn EMI reacted cautiously to a press report that the MMC
inquiry into compact disc prices had found no evidence of price-rigging by
the manufacturers. The official enquiry is one of the few remaining clouds
at present hanging over the stock - the others, including inquiries in the
US, also into CDs, and the company's Rent-a-Centre business have faded. If
yesterday's reports on the MMC move prove true, they are likely to boost
sentiment. The shares added 3 to 1166p.
Electrical retailer Dixons rounded off a hectic week which saw the stock
receive three profit downgrades and two upgrades as the market remained
deeply divided over the company's prospects. Yesterday it was the turn of
Lehman Brothers to shift its forecasts and stance, upgrading its 1994-95
prediction from Pounds 80m to Pounds 85m and moving the stock from a hold to
buy. The broker said the stock was only on a market rating and deserved a
higher one.
There was further speculation in the market that Grand Metropolitan would
use its results next week to announce its divestment from its Inntrepreneur
pubs business. However, the old rumour failed to generate much excitement in
the shares, which ended the day a penny firmer at 467p.
Confirmation of a FFr6bn rights issue from Euro Disney sent the shares down
15 to 363p.
Shares in GKN jumped 7 to 624p after S G Warburg, the company's broker,
issued a buy recommendation and made its first profits forecast since the
group's recent acquisition of the Westland helicopter company.
Warburg predicted profits of Pounds 165m this year and Pounds 220m in 1995
and said the new forecast reflected the consolidation of Westland. BBA Group
moved 5 ahead to 222p in sympathy with GKN with sentiment further boosted by
news of an increase in UK new car registrations.
The improved new car figures also helped Inchcape, a leading car
distributor, where the shares gained 10 to 548p. Engineering company IMI
advanced 4 to 364p, following a favourable statement at the company's annual
meeting.
Enterprise Oil bounced 10 to 431p on hopes that a rival group, Atlantic
Richfield, would launch a full-scale bid for Lasmo, down 2 1/2 at 147 1/2 p.
Chemicals group Courtaulds fell 12 to 549p as Kleinwort Benson
're-emphasised' its sell stance on the stock. Analyst Mr Jeremy Chantry said
the company's shares had outperformed the market strongly and there were
concerns over rising costs of raw materials. However, he maintained his
forecasts for the profit for the year to March 1994 at Pounds 170m.
Zeneca rose 8 to 705p after the chairman told the annual shareholders'
meeting that performance to date was in line with expectations.
A positive agm statement and similarly good investment note from Henderson
Crosthwaite, the stockbroker, helped Hillsdown, the food manufacturing
group, climb 9 to 176p. Chairman Sir John Nott said that the outlook was
encouraging and the company was confident about prospects for the year.
Henderson was apparently responding to a bullish trading statement earlier
this week from Bernard Matthews, the poultry producer, although other
analysts said only a small part of Hillsdown's profits were poultry-related.
Bernard Matthews slipped a penny to 106p.
Turnover in Glenchewton, the toys and houseware group, jumped to 11.03m amid
speculation that Wilton Group, a 34 per cent stake holder, had reduced its
holding. Shares in Glenchewton closed unchanged at 42p, while USM-listed
Wilton also remained unchanged at 3 1/2 p.
British Airways remained in the doldrums after Thursday's disappointing
passenger traffic figures for the month of April. The shares eased 3 to
416p.
Talk of a large US seller of PowerGen saw the shares slide back 16 to 470p
on turnover of 3.7m. National Power slipped 4 to 419p.
Electronics group Psion advanced following remarks from the chairman at the
agm. Sales in the first four months were said to be showing an advance of
over 50 per cent across the product range compared to the equivalent period
last year. The shares gained 12 to 296p.
Reuters Holdings remained weak following the sale of stock by the Abu Dhabi
Investment Authority. After the market closed the company announced that the
authority now holds just over 64m shares in the company or some 4 per cent.
Biotrace, the microbiological testing company, jumped 27 to 152p after a
positive announcement on its marketing agreement with Ecolab, the US
manufacturer of sanitising equipment.

FT  07 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shell and BP firm on oil price
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading oil stocks showed the way forward yesterday ahead of first quarter
figures from Shell Transport and in response to an unexpected surge in the
price of Brent crude.
The underlying oil price for May jumped a dollar to around Dollars 16.60
reflecting worries over fighting in Yemen and a raised forecast of world oil
demand from the International Energy Agency. Shell gained 11 to 732p and BP
improved 3 1/2 at 403p on exceptionally high turnover of 25m shares.
BP was further helped by an improved recommendation from Mr John Toalster of
SGST, a long-time seller of the stock who moved his stance from 'weak hold'
to 'hold'. Mr Toalster lifted his 1996 earnings estimate to Pounds 2.1bn
from about Pounds 1.5bn previously. BP's lead gave hope for Shell's first
quarter figures on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting the company to announce
a replacement cost figure of between Pounds 800m and Pounds 990m.

FT  07 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie closes unchanged after
erratic session - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's equity market survived the savage mauling of the Conservative party
in the countrywide local elections and put up an impressively robust
defensive performance in the face of a steep fall in US stocks and bonds.
The latter reacted to a much higher than expected increase in US non-farm
payrolls announced over the lunchtime period.
After moving in a near 30-point range, the FT-SE 100 index fought the
session to an honourable draw, closing exactly unchanged at 3,106.0. Even
more impressive was the performance of the market's second-liners, which
tended to ignore much of the anxiety surrounding bonds and the FT-SE 100
leaders. The FT-SE Mid 250 index closed a net 0.4 firmer at 3,771.0.
Gilt-edged stocks, on the other hand, were always in negative territory,
with the long-dated stocks down in the region of a half-point for much of
the morning, before retreating further in the afternoon, trailing in the
wake of marked weakness in US Treasury bonds. As London markets closed for
the day the US 30-year long bond was down almost two full points, dragging
long-dated gilts down by almost a point.
Worries that the wholesale losses by the Conservatives in the UK local
elections would trigger a big slide in the market proved unfounded. With no
sign of any institutional selling, the FT-SE 100 began the session around
five points higher and gradually improved to stand more than 15 points ahead
minutes before the US non-farm payroll number was announced.
The disclosure of an increase of 267,000 in the US employment numbers for
April, against an expected top figure of 250,000, affected markets very
quickly. Wall Street came in weak and quickly dropped more than 30 points on
the Dow Jones Average, trailing a sickly bond market, as dealers on both
sides of the Atlantic feared an imminent increase in US short term interest
rates.
Economists are said to have already factored in a further rise in US rates
but the pace of the expansion in US jobs was said to have provided further
evidence of a rapidly growing US economy with obvious implications of
inflationary pressures.
Although the Fed declined to increase rates yesterday observers said a rise
to 4 per cent and possibly to 4.25 per cent and possibly a half-point rise
in the Discount Rate is now viewed as almost a certainty some time next week
and certainly before the next Federal Open Market Meeting scheduled for May
17.
At its worst following the US news, the FT-SE 100-index dropped through the
3,100 level and showed a 13.7 decline at 3,092.2 before embarking on a slow
but determined climb back through 3,100 to end the day at 3,106. Turnover in
the market reached 657.8m shares.
Some marketmakers were heartened by the equity market's resilience in the
face of the two potentially depressing factors yesterday and forecast a
modest technical bounce next week. Others, however, remain extremely
cautious and expect further turbulence in international bonds, which they
said would inevitably bring pressure to bear on equities.
The oil sector delivered another exceptionally strong performance as crude
oil prices moved above the Dollars 16 a barrel level and institutions
responded to BP's scintillating profits and dividend news, announced on
Thursday.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Dollar steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchanges had their hopes dashed yesterday when the US Federal
Reserve failed to raise interest rates after a buoyant set of jobs data,
writes Philip Gawith.
Markets were expecting that the Fed might tighten policy as a follow up to
the concerted central bank intervention that took place on Wednesday to
support the dollar.
The US currency rose by nearly a pfennig when the April non-farm payroll
rose by 267,000, compared to a market forecast of 170,000, increasing the
prospects of higher rates.
With the Fed deciding to keep its powder dry, however, the dollar retreated
from earlier highs to close in London at DM1.6661 from DM1.6682 on Thursday.
Against the yen it closed at Y102.780 from Y102.695.
Sterling's initial response to the very poor showing of the ruling
Conservative Party in local elections was subdued, but it later lost ground
in afternoon trade to close at DM2.4859 from DM2.4969.
The market probably ran a little ahead of itself in expecting the Fed to
lift rates immediately. The central bank has recently been scrupulous in
separating rate moves from specific data.
But what the performance of the dollar did make clear is that the Fed will
have to act, either through intervention, higher rates, or both, if the
currency is not to test new lows. Once the initial flurry of enthusiasm
about the jobs data had dissipated, the downward trend reasserted itself.
Analysts yesterday were agreed on two points. First, the dollar's weakness
is linked to the general fragility of US asset markets, though there is
little clarity about which is the chicken and which the egg. Second, the Fed
will have to act decisively to calm the nerves of dollar and US asset
investors.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of global currency research at JP Morgan (Europe),
commented: It has got to make the markets think that it has knocked
inflation with a sledgehammer, and that nothing more is needed.'
Given current market sentiment, anything short of a 50 basis points rise in
the discount and federal funds rate - currently at 3 per cent and 3.75 per
cent respectively - is likely to disappoint and lead to a further sell-off
of the dollar.
An indication of prevailing sentiment is provided by SG Warburg, the UK
investment bank, which this week revised down its short-term dollar
forecasts, predicting that it will fall below DM1.60 and Y100 over the next
three months.
In Europe favourable political developments helped the Italian lira which
closed at L961 from L964.3 against the D-Mark. The Spanish peseta finished
slightly weaker at Pta82.49 from Pta82.25 against the D-Mark.
German call money traded easier at 5.35/5.40 per cent from 5.35/5.45 per
cent. There was very little movement in the futures market with the June
euromark contract closing at 95.04 from 95.05.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with late assistance of Pounds
15m. Earlier the Bank had put Pounds 771m into the market after forecasting
a liquidity shortage of Pounds 900m.
Activity in the sterling futures market was low. The June contract finished
unchanged at 94.59.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee shows the way with
Dollars 220 rise - Week in the Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barriers were down across the London commodity markets yesterday. Nearby
coffee futures raced past the Dollars 1,800-a-tonne mark to fresh five-year
highs; copper prices surged above Dollars 2,000 a tonne for the first time
in ten-months; and crude oil bettered Dollars 16 a barrel, in defiance of
bearish projections by most analysts.
Coffee's performance was easily the most impressive. Concern about nearby
supply tightness had already helped to extend last week's Dollars 90-a-tonne
gain in the July robusta position at the London Commodity Exchange by
Dollars 135 before yesterday's explosion of speculative buying took it up
another Dollars 182 to a peak of Dollars 1,880. It weakened in late trading,
but at Dollars 1,789 was still up Dollars 91 on the day and Dollars 226 on
the week.
Supply worries were already reflected in the premiums commanded for nearby
delivery positions before this week's upsurge. And that for prompt May
delivery over July widened to Dollars 100 a tonne at yesterday's close from
Dollars 52 a week earlier. But more significant, perhaps, was the increase
in the September/November spread from Dollars 6 to Dollars 35, suggesting
that availability problems were expected to continue.
Dealers were worried, however, that the preponderance of speculative funds
in the recent buying meant that the market was very vulnerable to
profit-taking. 'The rise is becoming blown out of proportion. . . the higher
it goes, the more vulnerable it becomes,' one told Reuter.
'There is sufficient coffee in the world, quite substantial stocks in
consuming countries and producer-retained coffee which will be released,'
said another. 'We are facing a low period of roastings, there is no drought,
no frost and no major interruption in supply.'
The London Metal Exchange copper market, buoyed by increased US physical
demand and falling stocks, had been bracing itself all week for an assault
on the mid-March peak of Dollars 1,983 a tonne for three months delivery.
And when that hurdle was cleared yesterday morning a flood of short-covering
and stop-loss buying quickly took the price to a high of Dollars 2,037. It
closed at Dollars 2,027.50 a tonne, up Dollars 52.75 on the day and Dollars
75 on the week.
The copper market's strength was fuelled by yesterday's announcement of a
17,025-tonne reduction in LME warehouse stocks, taking them to 456,425
tonnes, 26 per cent below February's 16-year high.
In contrast, a rise in the aluminium price came in spite of an equally
substantial rise in its LME stocks, which dashed traders hopes that recent
production cuts would begin to be reflected in the stocks total.
However, copper's performance ensured that the other LME market's were in no
mood to wallow in such disappointments. The aluminium price succeeded in
regaining its foothold above Dollars 1,330 a tonne to close at Dollars
1,332.50, up Dollars 5 on the day and Dollars 25.75 on the week.
The reversal of sentiment in the oil market that has surprised many analysts
was underlined yesterday when near delivery prices broke through the
psychological barrier at Dollars 16 a barrel.
The rise - which took the prompt June position at London's International
Petroleum Exchange to Dollars 16.10 in late trading, up 30 cents on the day
and 41 cents on the week - was attributed to news of North Sea shipment
cancellations, following Monday's platform shutdowns, and concern about the
civil war in Yemen.

2,600 a tonne and July/October shipment, ex-new crop, at Dollars 2,550, cif.
Black pepper prices could not be maintained either. Faq, spot, was at
Dollars 1,550 a tonne and Grade 1 at about Dollars 1,650. Prices on shipment
were about the same. Negative reports about the crops of countries like
Sarawak and Brazil have failed stimulate buyers so far.

FT  07 MAY 94 / International Company News: Asia's big spenders put luxury
back into shopping - Things are starting to look up in the world of
exclusive labels and goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

<TEXT>
Asprey, the exclusive London gift shop, recently sold a gold and lapis
lazuli nickelodeon for Pounds 300,000 (Dollars 447,000) to an Asian
businessman.
Now Pounds 300,000 objets are not sold by Asprey every day - but it has been
selling them more often since the start of this year. 'The market is still
very erratic,' says Mr Naim Attallah, chief executive, 'but business is
getting better. There's definitely something in the air.'
Asprey is not the only member of the luxury goods industry to have detected
signs of recovery. LVMH and Hermes, two of the most famous names in French
luxury goods, last week both reported sales growth of around 30 per cent for
the first quarter of this year.
This flurry of good news comes as a sorely-needed relief to the industry
after three gruelling years of economic recession and a spate of
distress-induced takeovers. Last year alone, Yves Saint-Laurent, the French
fashion house, was acquired by oil group Elf Aquitaine, and the Gucci family
lost control of its Italian leather business to Investcorp, the Arab
consortium.
However, thanks to improving demand, the industry now seems more stable.
Although some established markets, notably continental Europe and Japan,
remain depressed, there is evidence of recovery in others. 'There's
definitely a positive trend in North America,' said Mr Alain-Dominique
Perrin, chairman of Cartier, the French jewellery group, 'although some
European countries, such as Italy and Switzerland, are still weak.'
One compensation for the squeeze on the industry's established European
markets is the expansion of its business in eastern Europe. LVMH has already
opened a Christian Dior boutique in Moscow and plans soon to open another
for Louis Vuitton luxury luggage. Asprey this summer will open an outlet in
Prague for Mappin &amp; Webb, the silversmith.
The industry is also benefiting from the emergence of new markets in Asia.
One of its biggest problems in the early 1990s was the collapse of Japanese
demand, one of the chief catalysts of industry growth during the 1980s.
Japan is still fragile, but other Asian countries are expanding rapidly.
'The Japanese market has stabilised, but we'll have to wait until 1995 for
recovery to take off,' said LVMH chairman Mr Bernard Arnault. 'In the
meantime, we're already experiencing significant growth in other Asian
markets such as Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong.'
These new Asian markets have now replaced the Middle East as the main source
of 'high rollers,' the super-rich customers who are likely to treat
themselves to the extremely expensive one-off items - such as Asprey's
nickelodeon - that are often highly profitable for the luxury goods houses.
'Almost all our big punters come from Asia these days,' said Asprey's Mr
Attallah. 'In the old days, it was the Middle East, but that has slowed down
since the Gulf war. Even the wealthiest Europeans and Americans are
inhibited about spending money. But the Asians are the biggest gamblers and
the biggest spenders. If they like something they'll buy it, no matter how
much it costs.'
However, the market with the greatest potential is China. Until recently,
most companies operated there on an experimental basis in liaison with local
partners. They are now investing directly, as Cartier did last autumn when
it opened a shop in Shanghai. Mr Perrin sees China as 'unquestionably one of
our most promising markets for the future'.
The brighter outlook has already encouraged some luxury goods companies to
adopt a more expansionist stance. L'Oreal, the French cosmetics company
which owns Giorgio Armani perfume and Lancome skin products, last month
acquired full control of Cosmair, its US distribution business.
LVMH last week paid FFr1.96bn (Dollars 344m) for a majority stake in
Guerlain, the French fragrance house. Guerlain is expected to be the first
in a series of deals for LVMH, which has dramatically reduced its debt after
unravelling cross-shareholdings with Guinness, the UK drinks group.
Mr Arnault has already indicated interest in diversifying into jewellery.
Tiffany of the US and France's Van Clef &amp; Arpels are being talked about in
the trade as possible targets.
'We'll consider acquisitions, as we have in the past, if the right
opportunities arise at the right price,' said Mr Arnault. 'In principle,
jewellery is an area into which we might expand, but there are no specific
commitments at this point.'
LVMH is now free to commit itself, having last week finalised the Guinness
deal. The luxury industry is now waiting to see where Mr Arnault will strike
next - judging by his past form, it will not have long to wait.

FT  07 MAY 94 / International Company News: Japan workers co-operative
collapses with Y101bn debts

<TEXT>
A financial institution owned by employees of Japan's Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications filed for liquidation yesterday with debts of Y101bn
(Dollars 988m). It is Japan's third-largest bankruptcy this year.
Koshin Shoji, a wholly-owned subsidiary of a Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications' workers' co-operative based in Tokyo, filed for
liquidation with the Tokyo district court after a share-holders' meeting
found the company had no choice but to fold.
The failure is the largest among non-bank financial institutions since the
collapse of Osaka-based E. G. Capital and Consultants last year with debts
of Y230bn, according to Tokyo Shoko Research, a private research company. It
is also the third-largest bankruptcy this year after Sanwa Tatemono, with
debts of Y124.3bn, and Adoc with debts of Y110bn.
The collapse of Koshin is likely to raise criticism of the ministry's
relatively relaxed stance regarding the company's lending practices.
Koshin Shoji is a non-bank financial institution established by an MPT
employees' co-operative to invest the monthly contributions - 3 per cent of
salaries - made by its 250,000 members. Members receive a lump sum plus
investment returns upon retirement.
The company has lent to discount note brokers, which in turn on-lent funds
to consumer finance companies, according to Tokyo Shoko Research. With
tighter regulations on consumer finance companies and the collapse of
Japan's asset inflation bubble, a growing number of loans made by Koshin
went bad, the research company said.
The collapse of Koshin follows several years of financial difficulty,
beginning with a Y30.8bn write-off of loans made to five consumer finance
companies in 1986. Last year, Koshin made a loss of Y5.5bn on revenues of
Y8.3bn.
The posts and telecommunications ministry said the loss would be covered by
selling some of the co-operative's assets, which amounted to Y457.6bn at the
end of March last year. This would happen over a period of about 10 years,
so as not to affect payments to co-operative members.
The MPT employees' co-operative also owns other businesses, such as a hotel,
a construction subcontracting company and a golf course. All of those
businesses were sound, the ministry said.

FT  07 MAY 94 / International Company News: Further job cuts likely at
Digital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Digital Equipment, the loss-making US computer manufacturer, is likely to
cut at least a further 20,000 jobs, about half of them in Europe, as it
struggles to return to profit.
It is also looking at a range of other cost-cutting moves, including joint
ventures and the sale of some of its operating units.
The company said no firm decisions had been made about the closure of
European manufacturing centres. Digital manufactures the world's fastest
microprocessor, Alpha, at South Queensferry in Scotland.
Mr Robert Palmer, Digital chief executive, warned top managers this week
that the future of the company was at stake if the measures were not
successful.
He said: 'We must achieve a competitive cost structure as rapidly as
possible. And even if we are fortunate to achieve a reasonable growth in
revenues, we cannot escape the fact that significant additional downsizing
is unavoidable.'
'Failure to act promptly will result in a greater loss of employment. In
fact, the entire enterprise could be at risk,' he said.
Mr Palmer's anxieties came as no surprise to industry analysts, who have
been concerned that Digital's restructuring measures have so far failed to
improve performance.
Once the world's second-largest computer manufacturer, it has lost some
Dollars 3bn over the past few years. Its loss for the three months ended
March - its third quarter - was Dollars 183m, some three times greater than
the most pessimistic analysts had anticipated.
The loss seemed to surprise the company's top management, raising fresh
concerns about Mr Palmer's ability to manage a turnround at the company.
Analysts point out that at least 25,000 jobs will have to go simply to bring
Digital on a par, in terms of revenue generated per employee, with, say, IBM
or Hewlett-Packard.
Mr Palmer said: 'If you look at the implications of achieving a competitive
position at our current revenue levels, the metric of revenue per employee
suggests a company of 65,000, or fewer.' Digital currently employs about
85,000.
In Europe, some 6,000 of its 29,000 staff are already due to be made
redundant this year under a scheme set in place by new European president,
Mr Vincenzo Damiani.
Mr Palmer said the quality of Digital's products was not at issue. The
problems were account management, manufacturing and delivery.
He said the company's operations should be profitable by the end of calendar
1994.

FT  07 MAY 94 / International Company News: IBM to restructure marketing
operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines is realigning its worldwide marketing and
sales operations into 14 teams, each addressing a specific industry segment.
The change represents the most far-reaching reorganisation at IBM for
several decades.
IBM will 're-engineer the way we go to market,' said Mr Lou Gerstner, chief
executive, in a memo to employees. 'I believe we have to step up our ability
to help customers apply technology in their enterprises. Customers need it
and want it.'
The shift is a central part of Mr Gerstner's plan to return IBM to a
satisfactory level of profit, following heavy losses over the past three
years and slim profits in the first quarter of this year.
The reorganisation represents a fundamental change in IBM's marketing and
sales approach. Currently, the 40,000-strong salesforce (excluding an even
larger support staff) is organised along geographic lines, under country and
regional management.
Under the new plan, industry-specific marketing teams will be created to
report to worldwide or divisional managers.
However, regional sales managers will retain responsibility for product
marketing, IBM said. They will co-ordinate the local activities of the
industry teams.
Traditionally, IBM sales personnel have been generalists - selling
everything from typewriter ribbons to mainframe computers. Over recent
years, many have become product specialists. Some, within the Application
Solutions Division, have specialised in creating information-processing
systems for particular industry segments. ASD will play a leadership role in
the reorganisation, Mr Gerstner said.
With the revamp, IBM sales representatives will become industry experts, or
consultants, rather than product sellers. This will require extensive
retraining.

FT  07 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sweden launches record SKr10bn
Pharmacia sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Swedish government yesterday launched its biggest privatisation,
unveiling plans to sell a 32.5 per cent stake in Pharmacia, one of the
world's top 20 pharmaceuticals groups, for around SKr10bn (Dollars 1.3bn).
The take-up by foreign investors, to be promoted through a global offering,
is expected to be larger than in previous Swedish privatisation issues.
The government originally planned to sell its entire stake in Pharmacia,
equivalent to 45.4 per cent of the capital and 57.5 per cent of the votes.
It has, instead, decided to retain a 12.9 per cent capital stake and 10.1
per cent of the votes, to promote long-term ownership stability.
The move is a response to the uncertainty which Volvo, the Swedish motor
group, created last month when it said it would sell its 28 per cent stake
in Pharmacia. Volvo has agreed not to sell this holding before 1996.
This will be the last Swedish privatisation before the country's September
general election, and is in line with the government's ambition to broaden
Swedish companies' access to equity capital and widen domestic share
ownership.
The government has been encouraged by the need to resolve two years of
ownership uncertainty at Pharmacia, which was formerly part of Procordia,
and by the successful SKr7.6bn sale of a 49 per cent stake in forestry group
AssiDoman in March.
Analysts noted that pharmaceuticals had been out of fashion because of
government clampdowns on healthcare spending. However, they believe the
sell-off will have been helped by Roche's Dollars 5.3bn bid for Syntex and
SmithKline Beecham's Dollars 2.3bn offer for Diversified Pharmaceutical
Services. These have brought new focus to the sector.
Up to 82.2m A shares are to be sold. Half of these are being reserved for
the retail market, with the balance to be offered to institutions. Analysts
expect foreigners to subscribe for as much as 75 per cent of the
institutional offer.
The price will be fixed on June 17, following an institutional book-building
exercise. Institutions are expected to pay near the market price - yesterday
SKr126 per share - while individuals have been promised a discount.
Pharmacia, which has SKr27bn in annual sales, is one of Sweden's most
international companies, with more than half of its 19,000 employees based
abroad. Speciality areas include growth hormones, eye surgery and smoking
cessation. The company is looking to compensate for low volume growth with
vigorous cost-cutting.
Goldman Sachs International and S. G. Warburg Securities are the joint
global co-ordinators of the offer. Institutional sales in the Nordic region
will be lead-managed by Enskilda Corporate.

FT  07 MAY 94 / International Company News: Atlas Copco advances 21% in
first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Atlas Copco, the Swedish industrial components group, has reported a SKr380m
(Dollars 49.5m) profit after financial items for the first quarter, up 21
per cent from a year ago.
The group attributed the upturn mainly to the benefits from a SKr700m
investment programme at an Antwerp compressor plant.
A combination of acquisitions, currency effects, price rises and higher
volumes took sales up 13 per cent to SKr4.83bn. Operating profit climbed 34
per cent to SKr382m, helping to offset a SKr27m currency loss.
Orders were 12 per cent higher at SKr5.2bn. In Europe, orders rose in the
UK, Spain and France, although the German market continued to decline. In
many non-European markets, order levels were strong.
The group's biggest division, Compressor Technique, lifted operating profits
to SKr296m from SKr202m, due to better volumes and efficiency. This helped
offset a slight fall in profits in its other divisions.
Full-year profits are expected to exceed the 1993 SKr1.32bn level. Although
orders are expected to rise in most European markets in 1994, German demand
is likely to remain weak, the company said.
The group has decided to close a Canadian plant which manufactures
rock-drilling tools. Production will be switched to Sweden and Brazil.

speculation

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Generali, Italy's biggest insurance group, yesterday announced an 8 per cent
increase in parent company profits, to L420bn (Dollars 262m) for 1993
compared with the previous year. However, it confounded speculation that an
important strategic announcement would be made.
Following a board meeting, the company proposed a L10 increase in the
dividend, to L360 per share. However, instead of launching a rights issue -
as many commentators had predicted - Generali announced a bonus issue of
shares. The issue will be made on a one-for-10 basis.
Generali's stock rose by nearly 4 per cent yesterday, as speculation
continued about the possibility that it would buy Victoire, the French
insurer which has been put up for sale by its owner Suez, the French holding
company. Victoire is valued at FFr15bn (Dollars 2.6bn), and an announcement
about the successful bidder is expected soon.
The Italian company is also said to be interested in taking part in an
Austrian-led consortium to take a minority stake in Creditanstalt
Bankverein, Austria's second-biggest bank.
Last year, the Generali parent company increased gross premium income from
L8,804bn to L9,776bn. Life insurance premiums rose 12.8 per cent to
L3,850bn, a 9.3 per cent increase if exchange-rate fluctuations are ironed
out. Non-life premiums totalled L5,926bn, up 9.9 per cent, or 4.7 per cent
if adjusted.
The company also enjoyed a strong rise in net income from investments, from
L2,121bn to L2,482bn. The consolidated group results should be announced on
May 27, but Generali said yesterday gross premium income at group level
would reach some L25,000bn, against L22,423bn in 1992.
Toro Assicurazioni, the insurer which is part of the Fiat group, reported
that net profits increased to L153.2bn in 1993, up 10.1 per cent on 1992.

FT  07 MAY 94 / International Company News: Packer team loses bid for Sydney
casino
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman, and Circus Circus, the large US
gaming group, yesterday lost their joint bid to build the USDollars 1bn-plus
Sydney casino complex, which is forecast to have annual gaming revenues of
around ADollars 500m (USDollars 357.1m) when it comes on stream in 1997.
Instead, the New South Wales Casino Control Authority announced yesterday
the winning development proposal had been submitted by Leighton Holdings,
the stock market-listed Australian engineering and construction group in
which Hochtief, the German construction group, has a 48 per cent
shareholding.
Although the CCA stressed no one factor had influenced its decision, the
Leighton bid - made in conjunction with Showboat, a US casino group -
offered a much higher upfront payment to the NSW state in return for the
casino licence.
The consortium has promised to pay ADollars 441m over three years, or
ADollars 376m as a single upfront sum - a figure which even Mr Chris Cullen,
the CCA chairman, described as 'exceptional'.
Mr Packer - whose involvement in the rival consortium was through his Nine
Network and Consolidated Press companies - said his group had 'bid our
maximum price and came up over ADollars 80m short'. 'On that basis,
(Leighton/Showboat) deserved to win and good luck to them,' said the
businessman, known to be a keen gambler himself.
The Sydney casino is the last, and largest, in a string of such development
announcements in Australia. Growth in the industry is expected to explode
over the next three years. Casinos are due to come on stream in Cairns,
Brisbane and Melbourne during that time and - with Sydney included - the
country's total annual gross casino revenues could top ADollars 2bn by the
late-1990s. Mr Packer already has connections with - and a potential direct
interest in - the Melbourne property.
The Sydney casino has always been seen as a 'prize' because of the city's
strong Asian tourist trade. In addition to the upfront licence payment, the
state expects to get annual tax revenues of around ADollars 100m once it
starts operating.
The Leighton/Showboat proposal includes a five-star hotel, serviced
apartments, a floorshow theatre and a 2,000-seat lyric theatre, as well as
the 'themed' casino with its 170 gaming tables and 1,480 gaming machines.
Leighton said the consortium company, called Sydney Harbour Casino, would be
floated by 1995.

<TEXT>
Holderbank, a leading international cement and building materials group
controlled by Mr Thomas Schmidheiny, said net income rose 10 per cent last
year, to SFr287m (Dollars 205m), on sales up 7.6 per cent at SFr8.4bn.
The group said the sales rise was due to a widening of the consolidation,
plus higher volumes and prices. Deliveries of cement and clinker rose 7.2
per cent to 46.2m tonnes, and the volume of ready-mixed concrete was up 7.5
per cent, to 14.2m cubic metres.
The directors have proposed a 20 per cent rise in dividends, to SFr15 on
bearer shares and SFr3 on the registered shares.

FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Gowrings restates 1993 profits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gowrings, the motor trading and leisure company, is restating its 1993
accounts to take account of an exceptional charge resulting from the sale of
a mobile home park near Oxford.
The company also announced the sale of Gowrings Mobility, which converts
vehicles to enable them to carry wheelchair passengers, to its management
for a maximum Pounds 689,411 cash. The sale is at a premium to book cost but
the accounts are not be adjusted for this.
The effect is to cut Gowrings' pre-tax profit from Pounds 251,000 to Pounds
54,000 giving earnings per share of 0.12p, compared with 2.28p. The 2p total
dividend is now uncovered. The shares were unchanged yesterday at 75p.
Gowrings received Pounds 825,100 for the mobile home park against a book
value of Pounds 1.02m. Taking account of the loss caused the 1993
exceptional credit of Pounds 157,000 to change to a loss of Pounds 40,000.
The management of Mobility, led by Mr Gary Newton, a director of the
offshoot, is paying an initial Pounds 464,411 plus a sales-related sum up to
Pounds 225,000.

Ecolab, the company's new marketing partner. Sales to date were
'substantially ahead' of the original plan.

FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: IBM chief in UK moves to take over European
side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nick Temple, chief executive of International Business Machine's UK
subsidiary since early 1992, has moved up to a key European post.
IBM, the largest computer maker, is creating marketing teams in each of the
principal geographic areas, North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa
and Asia-Pacific.
The move is part of its recovery from three years of losses caused by a
sharp decline in the cost of computer hardware and a shift by customers away
from mainframe computers.
Mr Temple, 46, has been appointed general manager for the European finance
industry which is regarded as IBM's most important business area. The
majority of the world's leading banks and financial institutions use large
IBM computers for accounting and customer information.
His position as head of IBM (UK) will be taken by Mr Javaid Aziz, 41,
formerly general manager of marketing for the UK subsidiary.
Mr Aziz has worked closely with Mr Temple over the past two years in
restructuring and revitalising IBM (UK) and his promotion was no surprise to
the company's senior staff. He was closely identified with 'Galaxy,' a
scheme implemented last year through which the UK company was divided into
30 separate businesses, each with its own cost structure and profit and loss
responsibilities.
Mr Temple's new post is regarded as a promotion, recognising his work in
leading IBM (UK) back to growth after two years of heavy losses. He has
reduced cost structure, cut away layers of management and reorganised the
workforce.
Last year he was appointed an IBM vice-president, the first IBM (UK) chief
executive to be so rewarded. Mr Temple will take on the role of chairman of
IBM (UK) after the retirement of Sir Anthony Cleaver later this month.
Mr Aziz, a graduate of Loughborough University, joined IBM as a graduate
trainee in 1975. His appointments with the company have included director of
quality, Europe, and assistant general manager, European operations.

FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: QMH plans to prevent second restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers working on the Pounds 1.3bn Queens Moat Houses refinancing have
learnt the lesson of Heron International's recent difficulties and designed
proposals which should prevent the need for a second restructuring in short
order.
Heron completed a refinancing last September only to find that a crashing
Spanish property market has already made a second one necessary. Barclays
Bank is the lead bank on both Heron and QMH.
Proposals have been passed by the QMH banks' steering committee and have
this week been sent to the rest of the hotel group's 65 bank lenders.
The idea of the QMH restructuring plan is to convert an initial amount of
debt into equity, which will dilute current shareholders substantially but
not by as much as some have feared. If the company prospers and trading
conditions pick up, this limited conversion should be sufficient.
However, there is a back-up element in the proposals under which a further
tranche of debt could be converted into equity if trading conditions worsen
or the company fails to meet profit targets. This would involve diluting
existing shareholders to a small percentage of the total equity.
The plan is said by its proponents to be robust and prudent, and not
dependent on asset sales to succeed.
Holders of the group's two debenture stocks, which have a total nominal
value of Pounds 215m, stand in a strong bargaining position as they have
security over a list of QMH's hotels. They can expect their interest to be
paid, although they cannot escape sharing some of the pain.
Bank lenders will see some of their debt converted to equity now, some
earmarked for a later conversion if necessary, some remaining as debt but
not receiving interest in the short term, and a small proportion being
serviced.
The timetable for approval of the proposals is lengthy, although it is hoped
that meetings of shareholders, the final stage in the process, can be held
before the summer holidays.
If the plans are approved by shareholders the group's shares, which are
suspended, should be relisted.

FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Royal Bank fund management talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Bank of Scotland is thought to be in talks with Newton Investment
Management on plans to merge their fund management operations.
Royal Bank would take a stake in the enlarged group, which would be managed
by Newton.
The company said yesterday that it was in discussions over 'possibilities
for co-operation in fund management' with Newton, but had 'no current plans'
to acquire an investment management business.
Royal Bank, which is due to announce its interim results next week, would
not comment further.
Royal Bank's Capital House Investments arm has about Pounds 5bn in funds
under management. However, the bank is thought to believe that combining
operations with Newton would be a more effective way of expanding than
outright acquisition.
Newton Investment Management, based in London, is a growing fund management
company with Pounds 5.17bn under management. Roughly Pounds 4bn of that is
pension scheme assets with the remainder in unit trusts for retail clients.
Newton has distinguished itself by superior performance in recent years and
in 1993 was the top-ranked firm among pension managers with a median
in-house return of 37.4 per cent according to figures compiled by Combined
Actuarial Performance Services. Among fund managers measured by CAPS, the
median return was 29.2 per cent.
According to data compiled by the Financial Times, Newton is also the top
performer among leading pension fund managers over the past five years. It
is the 17th largest pension fund manager in the UK.
Although its services are frequently recommended by pension fund consultants
who advise schemes, Newton has only resumed accepting new clients in April
after a two-year hiatus.
Capital House, meanwhile, is ranked 25th largest pension fund manager
according to an FT survey, with Pounds 4.8bn under management.

FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: B&amp;J board agrees to Pounds 56m cash
injection from Pepkor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pepkor, South Africa's biggest retail group, last night clinched a deal to
inject up to Pounds 56m into Brown &amp; Jackson, which owns the lossmaking
Poundstretcher chain of discount retailers.
The recommended agreement gives the South Africans an option to take a 63
per cent stake in B&amp;J, if they put in the full amount. The chain of 230
Poundstretcher outlets would eventually be combined with the 45 clothing
outlets, Your More Stores, which Pepkor already owns in Scotland, creating
the UK's biggest discount retail chain.
The Pepkor offer is being recommended by B&amp;J's board, even although it last
month recommended a rescue offer from the Weisfelds, the millionaire couple
who created the What Everyone Wants discount clothing chain.
B&amp;J shareholders were due to vote at an EGM on Monday to approve the
Weisfeld plan. That meeting will go ahead, but the first item will be a
motion to adjourn until shareholders can consider the latest offer. Mr
Gerald and Mrs Vera Weisfeld had offered to injected an initial Pounds 6m to
meet B&amp;J's immediate working capital needs in return for a 19 per cent stake
and two seats on the board.
Pepkor will make no offer to existing shareholders. In exchange for their
cash, the South Africans will receive a mixture of new shares and loan
notes. They will inject an initial Pounds 20m to pay off trade creditors and
remove B&amp;J from the control of its banks.
The agreement was only reached after the market closed, following a day of
frantic negotiations in Guernsey, where the South Africans set up an
offshore holding company. B&amp;J's shares closed yesterday  1/4 p higher at 6
3/4 p, valuing the group at Pounds 43m.
Mr Christo Wiese, Pepkor's executive chairman, said the group owned 1,700
stores in southern Africa and employed 40,000 people. It wanted to diversify
internationally and had been keeping track of B&amp;J for several years.
He said: 'B&amp;J in its present state requires decisive and immediate action,
including the full initial injection of Pounds 20m contained in the Pepkor
proposal.
'Considerable work is required after that to return the business to
profitability.'
Of the Weisfelds' offer, Mr John Jackson, B&amp;J chairman, said that he
believed that Pepkor represented 'a better option to secure the long-term
future of the Brown &amp; Jackson group while providing value to existing
shareholders.'
Pepkor denied rumours that the deal involved Mr Philip Green, the
controversial former chairman of Amber Day, which bought WEW from the
Weisfelds in 1990. Mr Green is now running the privately-owned Xception
chain of discount stores.
Mr Wiese said: 'We have known Philip for years, working as we do in the same
business, but this is our deal - he's not involved.'

Shares in Spandex jumped 43p to 643p, after the annual meeting was told that
the first four months of 1994 had shown strong sales growth, with turnover
of the USM-quoted distributor of sign-making equipment being some 13.6 per
cent ahead of the same period last year.
Mr Charles Dobson, chairman, said the UK side continued to recover strongly
and the initial performance of the new French subsidiary, Spandex France,
was very encouraging.
Net debt had risen during the first four months of this year, as a result of
the French acquisition.
Mr Dobson said Spandex would continue to introduce new product developments
into its markets. It would also endeavour to further penetrate existing
markets, he added.

FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Denby Pounds 40m placing on table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Denby Group, the pottery company famous for its informal tableware, is being
reborn as a quoted company with the promise to investors of a 52 per cent
jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.1m for 1994.
The company published the profits forecast and first half results to March
31 in the pathfinder prospectus sent to shareholders yesterday. Denby
recorded pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.03m for the first six months on sales
32 per cent higher at Pounds 11.4m.
Denby, which was rescued from the receivers of Coloroll - which bought Denby
in 1987 - via a management buy-out in July 1990, is coming to the market
through a placing and public offer this month with a value of more than
Pounds 40m.
The company is due to publish the flotation share price on May 19 and
dealings will begin on June 2.
Denby intends to use the Pounds 10m in proceeds which it will retain to pay
net debt of Pounds 7m and fund capital expenditure estimated at roughly
Pounds 4m a year.
Mr Stephen Riley, managing director, said Denby had enjoyed better margins
in the first half. The higher-priced new designs were selling more rapidly
than the less expensive, but older, products.
Denby had also shown significant progress in boosting exports, an area on
which it aims to focus post-flotation. Sales abroad represented some 20 per
cent of turnover in the first half, compared with 13 per cent.
Mr Riley said Denby now operated out of 10 department stores across the US,
including Macy's, the worlds biggest department store.
Mr Riley said there was substantial room to increase Denby's share of the
export market, given the performance of other tableware manufacturers which
sold between 50 and 60 per cent of their products abroad.

FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Yates Bros Wine Lodges lines up summer
flotation
</HEADLINE>

   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yates Brothers Wine Lodges, the independent northern-based drinks group
whose Blackpool outlet is a favourite watering hole for politicians and
journalists at conference time, is planning a full listing this summer.
The group was founded in 1884 by Mr Peter Yates, who was fired by a
philanthropic desire to sell quality wine at reasonable prices to the
northern working man.
Mr Peter Dickson, his great-grandson and the group's current managing
director, said the founder built the business quickly by the simple
expedient of cutting out the middle men. In the mid-1980s Mr Dickson started
to rationalise and expand the group, raising money by coming to the market
under the matched bargain Rule 535. About 75 per cent of the shares are
currently in family hands.
Last December Yates reported a 13 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds
1.41m for the six months to September 26, on turnover 34 per cent ahead at
Pounds 22m. It reported buoyant sales across retail and wholesale
activities. Full-year results are expected in early June.
Yates's Wine Lodges, the main subsidiary, has 46 outlets concentrated in the
north of England. Group policy is to concentrate on town and city centres,
with ground floor retail space of between 2,000 and 2,500 sq ft.
Mr Dickson said the group had a market capitalisation of Pounds 47m. The
flotation would aim to raise new money while leaving the family in control.
On Thursday the group opened in Leigh, Lancashire, the first outlet of
Watling Street Inns - a joint venture company launched last year with Mr
Steven Kalton, of Kalton Inns and Leisure, another northern company. Yates
owns 75 per cent of the venture, which is aiming at a more family-orientated
market outside town and city centres.
The group also has a wholesale business, and is supplier of drinks to more
than 30 airlines. Its sponsor is Panmure Gordon.

FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: TI offering 5p cash for each outstanding
Usborne share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TI, a private food and commodity company, yesterday offered 5p in cash for
the shares it does not already own in Usborne, the grain trading and pig
production concern.
Shares in Usborne were suspended on April 18 at 19 1/2 p after the group had
warned of substantial interim losses following pig production problems.
The offer values Usborne at about Pounds 4.59m.
Last week Usborne said that Mr David Frame, its chief executive, had agreed
to sell a 36 per cent stake in the company for 5p a share to Mr David
Thompson, a shareholder.
As a result TI, owned by Mr Thompson and members of his immediate family,
now has just under 36 per cent of the shares, while Mr Thompson has a
further 14.09 per cent.
If acceptance of the offer prejudices Usborne's listing, TI aims to place
enough shares with third parties to retain the listing.
Usborne has told TI that it will publish the results for the six months to
end-December as soon as practicable.
TI had net assets of Pounds 24.5m as at March 31 1993.

FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Company News: New issues return to old basics / Examining
the recent falling interest in flotations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new issue market has gone off the boil over the last month and judging
by the reception to some of this week's debutantes it is cooling rapidly.
Healthcall and Lombard Insurance were both forced to cut their flotation
price by more than 10 per cent this week as institutions showed symptoms of
new issue indigestion.
Private investors look equally sated. The offer of shares in the
International Biotechnology Trust, backed by the heavyweight team of
Rothschild Asset Management and Robert Fleming, attracted just Pounds 2.67m.
In total it raised only Pounds 37.8m, compared with the target of Pounds
100m.
Yet few significant issues have been pulled, though one large demerger is
said to have been put on hold, and the pipeline is full of new hopefuls.
'There is a whole pack to get through before the summer and they are
queueing up round the block for the autumn,' said one adviser. 'If they all
come, prices are going to come under a lot of pressure.'
That pressure was seen clearly with Redrow, Britain's biggest private
housebuilder, whose issue size was scaled back and the price cut by more
than 20 per cent. The House of Fraser price was also trimmed and the
heavily-promoted issue was only twice subscribed.
Mr Christopher Knight, who handled Healthcall's flotation at Morgan
Grenfell, the merchant bank, blames the volume of new issues over the last
few months. 'That inevitably leads to new issue fatigue among investors who
are now being rather more sceptical.'
Yet in many cases prices are holding up. Vymura, the wallcoverings group,
was priced this week at exactly the level planned when the flotation was
announced six weeks ago.
Mr David Simpson, a director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Vymura's sponsor,
said: 'There is still an appetite for quality new issues but the market is
now pretty price sensitive. The key is not to over price in the first
place.'
He points to the disappointing performance of some recent new issues. The
most spectacular flop has been Maid, the on-line business information group
which was to be valued at more than 100 times its profits. Although the
offer price was cut back the shares are now trading at a 40 per cent
discount. In contrast another fledgling company, Unipalm, the computer
network specialist, has gone to a healthy premium. But many advisers believe
such companies are going to find it harder going from here.
Mr Pat O'Reilly, head of corporate finance at Panmure Gordon, the broker,
said: 'The wildly esoteric new issues are now out of the question unless
they have a very good story.'
Some observers believe the problem is that institutions, or more
particularly funds specialising in smaller companies, are running out of
money.
'They are just not as liquid as they were six to twelve months ago when
institutions were pushing more money into their smaller company funds,' said
one smaller companies analyst. 'They now don't have the resources to go for
all the new issues and if they want to they will have to sell something.'
If true, this might mean that a continued stream of small new issues may
start to undermine the share prices of companies which have recently
floated.
However Mr O'Reilly discounts the weight of money argument. 'Institutions
are merely getting fed up with the sheer number of small new issues. It had
reached the point where fund managers were having to go to two or three new
issue meetings a day.' Investors are getting more sceptical about some
vendors' motives for coming to the market. 'Institutions are beginning to
say to themselves 'if this guy just wants to buy a new swimming pool I don't
see why we should pay for it',' commented one fund manager.
One large institution is said to have stopped looking at any flotations on
the grounds that there is better value to be had in shares already on the
market.
Whether pressure on prices reduces the flow of new issues may depend on the
requirements of the large shareholders.
'Some vendors may be happy to postpone flotation in the hope that prices
pick up again. But venture capital backers of some management buy-outs may
want to get their money out to invest elsewhere and be prepared to take a
lower price,' said one broker.
There appear to be particular problems in some sectors, notably
biotechnology, where many of the recent new issues are trading at a
discount. The proposed flotation of Pharmakopius has been postponed
indefinitely and the Cortecs issue pushed back by at least a month.
The market also seems to be suffering from a surfeit of investment trust
launches which may partly explain the reception to Rothschild's
biotechnology trust.
All is not gloom. One adviser argues that sentiment has actually improved
recently. 'A couple of weeks ago two of our flotations were put on hold but
are now back on track,' he said. But investors are clearly becoming more
discriminating, and with good reason.
Last week's profit warning from Canadian Pizza, which drove its shares 40
per cent below the November flotation price, underlined the risk of
investing in new issues.
Backers of International Food Machinery's flotation have fared worse still.
The receivers, who were called in three months ago, have given up attempts
to sell the business as a going concern and this week told creditors there
was a total deficiency of Pounds 6.5m. Only 18 months after its flotation
the shares are worthless.

FT  07 MAY 94 / On the ropes but still fighting: The Tories' dire election
result may spell ruin for Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's simple, explained one of Mr John Major's erstwhile supporters at
Westminster. Conservative MPs had only to decide whether the prime minister
could lead them to victory in another general election. If, once the votes
had been counted for the June 9 European elections, the answer was No (and
he fully expected it would be), they would replace him. Ruthless maybe, but
then the Tory party had never worried too much about spilling its leaders'
blood.
Politics, of course, is never that simple. As they surveyed the devastation
wrought by Thursday's local elections, some in Mr Major's embattled
government were drawing an altogether more sombre conclusion. The question
was not whether the prime minister could recover, but whether a divided and
embittered Conservative party could sustain any leader in office.
Nobody in the Tory party expected good results this week. But the scale of
the defeat blacked out any remaining shafts of light. The 100 or so
Conservative MPs who regard their seats as marginals did not need a
calculator to work out that a much smaller swing against the government in a
general election would pitch them into the dole queues.
It was an across-the-board revolt. Middle-class disgust in Tunbridge Wells
was mirrored by working-class anger in Croydon and Basildon. The
Conservative share of the vote, put by the BBC at 27 per cent, was the
lowest this century, leaving the government alongside the Liberal Democrats.
There were no doubts at Westminster as to why. Badly bruised by recession
and angered by a broken promise over taxes, the voters took their revenge on
a party which prefers to devote its energies to faction-fighting over Europe
than to offering competent government.
So the election saw tactical voting on a massive scale. In those areas where
Labour had the best chance of defeating the Conservatives, people put their
crosses against Mr John Smith's red rose. Where the electorate judged the
Liberal Democrats could best deliver the requisite bloody nose, Mr Paddy
Ashdown triumphed.
The result, taken with last year's devastation in shire counties' elections,
has been to wipe the Conservatives off the local government map.
There were scattered crumbs of comfort. The voters of Wandsworth and
Westminster kept faith. More importantly, Labour did far less well
nationally than suggested by its high-profile successes in London's suburbs.
Winning 42 per cent of the vote nationwide at this stage of the electoral
cycle does not point to a resounding Labour victory in a general election.
Mr Smith has been complacent. His strategy has rested on the premise that
the Conservatives will do his job for him.
But what the results demonstrated is that a Tory defeat does not translate
automatically into a Labour victory. Labour needs to score 45 per cent or
more of the vote in such mid-term elections if it wants to secure an overall
majority in parliament.
The Liberal Democrats, by contrast, could be forgiven their
self-congratulation. Their 27 per cent share of the total was better than at
any time since the halycon days of the old SDP/Alliance in the early 1980s.
The party took swathes of seats off Labour as well as the Conservatives. If
the Liberal Democrats still struggle to be heard on the national stage,
their credentials as a party of local government can no longer be disputed.
But for the next five weeks - perhaps the next five months until a formal
leadership contest in November - politics will be overwhelmingly a story
about the Conservatives. The elections to the European parliament threaten
further catastrophe. So, too, does the Eastleigh by-election in which Mr
Ashdown is now set fair for a spectacular victory.
If Conservatives were prepared to rebel or stay at home in such numbers this
week, how much easier it will be for them to exact further revenge on June
9. Some Tory voters demonstrated that they still care about who runs their
local town hall; they are likely to be far less concerned about who
represents them in the more remote Strasbourg assembly.
The Conservative manifesto sidesteps the irreconcilable divide in the party
over Europe. It manages to wave the Union Jack for the Eurosceptics while
appeasing the pro-Europeans by sounding positive about Britain's agenda for
the Union.
But Mr Douglas Hurd's elegant prose provides the appearance rather than the
substance of unity. After Mr Michael Portillo's ill-judged remarks this week
about the dangers of a single currency, it is hard to imagine that the rift
will not reopen during the European campaign.
A few weeks ago senior Conservatives were encouraging speculation that the
party might see its representation in the European parliament fall from the
present 32 seats to fewer than a dozen. The actual outcome - perhaps 20
seats - would then be treated as a pleasant surprise. Now they have started
to believe their direst predictions.
Mr Major knows the European election will be treated as a more telling
referendum on his premiership. His combative comments on the steps of 10
Downing Street were explicit confirmation that he expects a formal challenge
to his leadership in the autumn.
But his strongest enemies - a motley but daily more powerful bunch of
right-wing malcontents, passionate anti-Europeans, and anonymous figures
from marginal seats - want to precipitate the crisis well before then. If
the European results are as bad as they fear, they want Mr Major out by the
end of June.
The prime minister still has cards to play. The pretenders in his cabinet -
Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr Kenneth Clarke and the youthful Mr Portillo -
cannot precipitate a crisis without wrecking their own chances.
A post-election cabinet reshuffle might buy him more time. For different
reasons, all in the cabinet but Mr Heseltine, the near-certain winner in any
leadership contest, may well judge that their personal political fortunes
are best served by sustaining Mr Major rather than by removing him.
The Eurosceptics are divided as to the wisdom of swapping Mr Major for Mr
Heseltine. Some are naive enough to believe that Mr Heseltine's pro-European
instincts can be reined in. Others will never forgive him for destroying
Margaret Thatcher's premiership.
The outcome may depend on Mr Major's pyschological make-up. His strongest
card is the threat not to go quietly: to fight to the end whatever the
consequences for the party. The calculation his enemies would then have to
make would be whether removing him would be more damaging than keeping him.
A close friend insisted that, if necessary, the prime minister would play
that card. Mr Major was convinced that he had a better chance than any rival
of holding together his party. He had grown more resilient than anybody
realised.
Another confidant took an entirely different view. If the anti-Tory tide had
not receded by June 9, he judged, Mr Major would 'walk'. The unthinkable
alternative would be a 'bloodbath'. It may be, though, that this week the
Tories passed the point of no return.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Central banks defending the
indefensible by supporting currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr ROSALIND M ALTMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Do the central banks never learn? Costly currency interventions were to
no avail in saving sterling, the French franc or other minor Euro
currencies. Now we see the US Federal Reserve and others trying to stop the
dealers from driving the dollar down ('Central banks step in to defend
Dollars ', May 5).
On past evidence it is hard to see why the central banks should be
successful in fighting the trend this time. The foreign exchange markets
have just become too large to be defeated.
In a world of floating exchange rates, currency overshooting is inevitable.
'Fundamentals' are irrelevant to short-term speculators. They see quick
profits based on market psychology, not economic logic.
The problem is that the speculators - or rather the attempts to fight them -
can force a change in the fundamentals themselves. For example, at the
moment US authorities fear that dollar depreciation will deter foreign
buyers of US bonds, causing a rise in US long rates and inhibiting economic
recovery.
But, by trying to fight a falling currency, they may force short rates to
rise too much. This in itself, could produce the very rise in long rates and
weaker growth which they want to avoid]
If central banks could just accept that they cannot fight these short-term
trends and let the speculation fizzle out the traders will eventually move
on to a new game.
The 'fundamentals' clearly favour a stronger dollar and, by accepting that
fighting the contrary currency movements short-term could be
counter-productive, the central banks may have better success in managing
their economies in the long term.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Mercy mission for money trouble / Assessing the first round
in defence of the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world peered into a currency abyss for a brief period this week.
Until 17 central banks came charging to the rescue on Wednesday, the dollar,
the world's most important trading and investment currency, appeared
threatened with free fall.
It was heading towards record low levels against the Japanese yen and
appeared well on course to go below the psychologically important Y100
barrier. Piercing such a 'big number' would have pushed the greenback into
uncharted territory. It would have been easy to imagine large investors
unloading their dollar holdings in panic-stricken trading conditions in an
attempt to stem ever-greater losses.
In the event, an estimated Dollars 3bn of concerted central bank
intervention at the behest of the US Treasury, and yesterday's announcement
of stronger than expected US employment growth in April, stopped the rot. By
yesterday evening the immediate threat of a dollar crisis had receded.
But the dollar could easily test the nerves of traders and policymakers in
the days and weeks to come. Measured against the currencies of America's
leading trading partners it is not far from its all-time low of August 1992.
Its sharp decline against the yen since President Bill Clinton took power in
January 1992 has unsettled currency watchers. For some, the dollar's recent
performance has brought back uncomfortable memories of the term of President
Jimmy Carter, the previous Democrat to occupy the White House, when the
dollar weakened so much as to require a large-scale international rescue.
The widespread and ostentatious nature of Wednesday's central bank purchases
of dollars for D-Marks and yen testified to the concern of a possible dollar
free fall in central banks and finance ministries around the globe.
A slumping dollar would be bad news for the US and Japan, the two main
protagonists in the currency's recent drama, and pose serious problems for
Britain. Although the Bundesbank and other continental European central
banks joined in the intervention, the dollar's weakness appears to be less
of a threat to Germany and the economies closely linked to Germany through
the European exchange rate mechanism.
A sharply lower dollar would hit an already weak US bond market. The
accompanying chart shows how US bond yields have soared since the beginning
of this year. Suggestions were circulating in the financial markets this
week that a dollar free fall would prompt Japanese holders of US Treasury
bonds to start liquidating their investments, forcing long-term interest
rates even higher.
A further sharp rise in the yen against the dollar would cause serious
problems for the Japanese economy by weakening its international
competitiveness. Japan's recovery from its most serious postwar downturn is
still far from assured. In contrast to previous periods of yen strength,
Japan faces increasingly tough competition from the countries of south-east
Asia.
Britain, like the US, would have cause to worry about the impact of dollar
weakness on its bond market. As the chart shows, the yields for government
gilt-edged stock have risen even more sharply than those for comparable US
Treasury bonds this year. Anxiety about the effects of a dollar collapse on
the gilt-edged market was an important reason for the Bank of England
decision to join in dollar support.
Even before the central banks had started to intervene, the Bundesbank had
declared that too strong an appreciation of the D-Mark against the dollar
was 'not in the interests' of the German economy. Although there is growing
optimism that Germany is starting to recover from recession, the economy is
still fragile and any increase in competitive pressures on export markets
would be unwelcome.
However, in some respects the Bundesbank and other continental central banks
have less cause to worry about the dollar than the Bank of England.
Continental interest rates are less entwined than UK rates with those of the
US. A series of small cuts in official rates this week showed that
continental interest rates are still heading downwards in recognition of the
more depressed state of the region's economies.
The dollar's decline so far this year has been as much a surprise as a worry
for policymakers and pundits. At new year, the general expectation was that
it would appreciate in value to reflect the stronger growth performance of
the US vis-a-vis its trading partners and the near certainty that US
interest rates would rise.
Consensus Economics, a London-based company that regularly polls forecasters
in more than 30 countries, reported the general expectation that the dollar
would be valued at Y112.1 and DM1.75 around Easter and Y114.2 and DM1.78 by
the end of the year. When the central banks bought dollars this week the US
currency was at DM1.6570 and Y101.2.
Since January the US has continued to register strong growth and the
authorities have pushed interest rates higher, lifting the federal funds
rate to 3.75 per cent from 3 per cent between the beginning of February and
April 18.
But as the chart shows, this period of Fed tightening has coincided with a
considerable dollar depreciation against the yen while it has also weakened
against the D-Mark.
According to Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at Union
Bank of Switzerland, this decline can be traced to the impact on speculative
investors of the Clinton administration's tough trade policy against Japan.
These investors, which included lightly regulated 'hedge funds', had built
up speculative positions in the dollar in anticipation of it rising against
the yen.
When President Clinton and the former Japanese prime minister Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa failed to settle US-Japanese trade disputes in Washington at a
meeting on February 11, the markets sold the dollar in the belief that the
US wanted to force Japanese concessions through a higher yen. Their
interpretation was supported by President Clinton's statement that the US
was seeking 'objective criteria' to judge progress on trade which might
encompass exchange rate variables.
More recently, the markets were confronted with the government of Mr Tsutomu
Hata, Mr Hosokawa's successor. This is so weak that it cannot be relied upon
to meet US demands to open its markets or boost its economy. The natural
instinct of traders and investors has been to sell the dollar and bid up the
yen.
The events of the past week and the declaration of Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US
Treasury Secretary, that the US sees 'no advantage in an undervalued
currency' could mark a turn of the tide. If investors believe the US
administration has experienced a change of heart, the dollar may yet be
saved.
But that is a big 'if'. According to economists at S G Warburg, the UK
investment bank, there are signs that the one-time bullish consensus about
the dollar is cracking. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of global research at Swiss
Bank Corporation in London and a long-time dollar bear, points out that the
US current account balance of payments is moving deeper into the red as the
economy recovers. The overall US deficit between 1984 and 1993 was Dollars
1,025bn. 'There is no historical experience of a country continuously
running current account balance of payments deficits without ultimately
rather negative results for the currency,' he says.
At the end of a turbulent week, the world's central banks appear to have won
the first round in defence of the dollar. But they only have to think back
to the crises of 1992 and 1993 in the European exchange rate mechanism to
recall that there is a big difference between winning a battle and winning
the war.

FT  07 MAY 94 / China's walls weaken: The Hong Kong visit of a top Beijing
official
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lu Ping, China's urbane official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, has not had
an easy week.
On his first visit to Hong Kong in nearly two-and-a-half years, Mr Lu, 67,
has been pilloried by the colony's press for his refusal to meet Governor
Chris Patten. To add insult to injury, he has had to use tradesmen's
entrances to avoid the media. This is not the way a full member of the
Chinese Communist party's central committee would expect to conduct himself
when inspecting his area of responsibility.
Mr Patten, for his part, has not missed an opportunity to take the moral
high ground - even though Mr Lu's decision not to pay him a call still
amounted to a snub. 'We would like Director Lu's visit to Hong Kong to be so
enjoyable and successful that he comes back many times,' Mr Patten said
yesterday.
Mr Lu's visit was ostensibly to attend a ceremony marking the Bank of
China's first issue of bank notes in the colony, and for meetings of the
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), a group of mainly Hong Kong businessmen
and mainland officials, set up to discuss post-1997 issues.
But Mr Lu's journey to Hong Kong is also meant to reassert his authority
over China's Hong Kong policy - undermined by his long absence - and to
signal an important shift in attitude. Beijing is shelving its policy of
non-co-operation with Britain on Hong Kong affairs, which reached its height
last year during talks on the colony's political development, and
substituting a policy of selective co-operation. As Mr Tsang Yok-sing,
chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, a
pro-Beijing political party, puts it: 'Beijing realises that they can't cut
all contacts with the UK and Hong Kong governments and achieve a smooth
transfer of sovereignty in 1997.' Mr Tsang, also a leading member of the
PWC, believes China has also given up hope of seeing Mr Patten recalled to
London.
This reasoning seems to strike a chord with the British Foreign Office.
'We have made more progress on practical issues in the past six weeks than
we have in the past two years,' says one official.
Illustrating this improvement in relations are the current talks about
financing Hong Kong's new airport. Hopes have risen within the Hong Kong
government that a workable agreement on financing the multi-billion-dollar
project can be worked out before the Legislative Council (LegCo) rises for
the summer recess in early July.
On Wednesday - a day after Mr Lu said: 'I believe that we can reach an
agreement on the airport acceptable to both sides' - China requested a
formal meeting of the Joint Liaison Group's Airport Committee, the body
charged with resolving the differences between the UK and China over airport
finances.
Further underlining China's interest in Hong Kong's continuing prosperity,
Mr Lu found time to dine with some of the wealthiest local businessmen: Mr
Li Ka-shing, chairman of two of Hong Kong's biggest companies; Mr David Li,
chief executive of the Bank of East Asia; Mr Stanley Ho, Macao's casino
tycoon; and Mr Cheng Yu-tong, chairman of New World, the property and
construction company. 'Mr Lu is confident and in good spirits. It seems to
me that he's enjoying all the trapings which go with his office - the police
outriders and the reporters chasing him,' says one businessman who dined
with the Chinese visitor.
In terms of concrete achievements, Mr David Chu, a property developer who
sits on the PWC, indicated that some previously intractable subjects might
now be easier to resolve. He cited plans for a new Court of Final Appeal,
the future use of military territory in the colony, and some civil service
matters as examples of where co-operation may now be possible.
But in spite of the new pragmatism, PWC members are adamant that the UK has
lost influence by pursuing what they describe as a path of confrontation
over Hong Kong's political development. Mr Chu says Britain's view will not
now be sought on who should be the colony's first post-1997 'chief
executive'; nor will China consult the UK on the appointment of the top 20
or so senior mandarins.
Nevertheless Mr Lu, addressing businessmen yesterday, stressed that China
would act in accordance with the Basic Law - its mini-constitution for Hong
Kong, drawn up in consultation with the UK - when it resumes sovereignty.
This suggests that fears of China taking a still tougher stance post-1997
are unfounded.
From Mr Patten's point of view, the resumption of Sino-British co-operation
may appear a vindication of his stance on political development, for which
Britain's lack of involvement in the choice of his succesor - never likely
to have been great - is a small price to pay.
For their part, however, the Chinese remain sensitive to the idea that Mr
Lu's visit is a tactical victory for Britain - and Mr Patten was careful to
avoid public triumphalism.
He is confident of meeting Mr Lu later this year. But that may be wishful
thinking by a governor feeling the strains of China's boycott. Mr Patten may
remain beyond the pale for the next three years.

<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Taylor ('Pounds, pioneers and more pounds', May 3) gives some
interesting examples of capital cost growth.
The Rand Corporation of the US carried out a report for the US department of
energy on final cost against first detailed estimate for a variety of large
pioneer construction projects. On average it was more than two times higher.
Further effort was applied to analysing cost growth and performance
shortfall for energy plants in terms of the amount of new technology,
complexity, state of process development and the thoroughness of scope of
the initial estimate. In the third part of the work, a systematic method was
developed to enable application of the technique to future examples, to
predict a final cost ratio together with a standard deviation.
We used this method for process plants quite successfully in my previous
company. The problem, however, always remains that, when asked to make a
judgment, people tend to gravitate towards their optimistic notions and the
results of these careful calculations are not always well received.

Sir, Your leader, 'Europe's parliament' (May 3) drew attention to some of
the procedural reforms necessary within the European Parliament if it is
going to earn greater credibility.
Surprisingly, you made no mention of the huge cost of multilingualism within
that institution.
When Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway become full members of the European
Union, three further working languages will be added, increasing even
further the cost of translating and interpreting.
Surely a case for Esperanto?

Sir, We hear that fewer women than ever are numbered among senior British
managers.
Recently, while awaiting a delayed flight from Edinburgh to Heathrow, I sat
near the telephones in the Shuttle lounge. Over the next two hours a stream
of businessmen phoned their wives/secretaries/girlfriends to rearrange what
time they were to be collected, postpone dinner appointments, and 'be taken
straight to the opera house'. One man spoke to his child. A similar
procession of businesswomen phoned their nannies/childminders and mothers to
re-arrange children's tea, bath and bedtime. Most of the women talked to the
children, explained why they were going to be late and offered reassurance
and comfort.
This is hardly a random sample but on reflection I pity the men - no wonder
we women start our own businesses.

<TEXT>
Sir, The results of the Institute of Management's survey showing a reduction
in the number of women in management are not entirely surprising ('Women
turn away from careers in management', May 3). The message from female
managers is clear: unless companies shape up and change typical,
male-dominated working practices and environments, women will vote with
their feet and opt for more flexible, family-friendly working environments.
Two hundred and forty organisations, representing more than a quarter of the
British workforce, are currently members of Opportunity 2000, the
business-led campaign to help companies maximise women's skills and avoid
wasting resource and ability. While they realise there is still a great deal
to be done, these organisations are recognising the true business value of
their female employees. They are implementing a number of measures to
increase the quality and quantity of their participation in the workforce,
including job-sharing schemes, part-time work and providing assistance with
childcare, either through voucher schemes or on-site facilities.
Unless more companies follow this example, British business will continue to
lose money, time, efficiency and the skills and resources of half its
workforce.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Man in the News: Cool, calm and selected - Thabo Mbeki
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To be a heartbeat away from the presidency is seldom a position of real
prominence. But it carries a special, even awesome, significance when the
president is 75 and the country in question is South Africa.
Mr Thabo Mbeki is now in the limelight, though not yet centre stage. As
first executive vice-president and deputy to Mr Nelson Mandela, the leader
of the African National Congress who becomes South Africa's president on
Tuesday, it is not surprising that he now attracts more scrutiny.
Given the stature of Mr Mandela, the job of filling his shoes is well nigh
impossible. But if anyone can provide the reassurance and continuity that
his demise would require, it is this urbane 53 year old.
For nearly 20 years, the soft-spoken Mr Mbeki, with grizzled grey beard and
pipe to hand, has been, for many in the west, the acceptable face of South
African black nationalism. Well before it was respectable to be seen in
public with the ANC, some South African businessmen and Western diplomats
established private links with a man who clearly would make his mark in a
post-apartheid South Africa.
His credentials are impeccable. The son of the revered ANC patriarch Mr
Govan Mbeki, fellow prisoner of Mr Mandela, he won his political spurs in
the ANC Youth League, which he joined in 1956. During a short period
underground after the ANC was outlawed in 1960, he was national secretary of
the African Students Association.
In exile from the early 1960s, he put the ANC's case during postings in
London, Botswana, Swaziland, Nigeria and Zambia. Between deployments, he got
his MA in economics from Sussex University and underwent military training
in the Soviet Union in 1970.
None of this extraordinary and sometimes dangerous past shows. Mbeki, whose
demeanour might suit the senior common room of an Oxbridge college, for
years quietly defended the legitimacy of the ANC's armed struggle against
white rule and pressed eloquently for the imposition of sanctions.
Appointed to the ANC's national executive in 1977, he climbed steadily in
the liberation movement's hierarchy. In 1978 he became political secretary
in the office of the then-president, Oliver Tambo, who died last year. He
added the post of ANC director for information to his responsibilities
shortly afterwards. In 1985 he advanced his standing in the party after the
ANC's congress in the northern Zambian town of Kabwe, becoming secretary for
presidential affairs and winning a place on the ANC organ overseeing its
underground activities, the politico-military council.
But it was as head of the ANC's department of international affairs, which
he took up in 1989, that he made his mark. In his dealings with foreign
governments he avoided the revolutionary rhetoric of some colleagues and
remained firm in the belief that a negotiated settlement was possible. He
set out to promote the ANC, often seen in the west as a 'terrorist' movement
to use the phrase of former British prime minister Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher,
as a pragmatic movement. A senior western diplomat dispenses high praise:
'Whenever the ANC put its foot in it, which was often, Thabo was on hand to
extract it.'
This experience served him well in what was to be his key role in South
Africa's transition to democracy. The talks which brought this about can be
traced back to a meeting in a Zambian game park in 1985. It was then that,
with the backing of former Zambian president, Mr Kenneth Kaunda, a
delegation of top South African businessmen, led by the ex-chairman of the
Anglo American Corporation, Mr Gavin Relly, flew to Zambia for discussions
with the ANC.
Within a short time the visitors had concluded that Mr Mbeki and his
colleagues, including the late Mr Chris Hani, were politicians with whom
they could do business.
Further meetings followed in other centres from Senegal to London. They
involved not only South African businessmen but academics, journalists,
church leaders and pillars of the Afrikaner community. The latter risked,
and in some cases received, a public denunciation from South Africa's
then-president, the cantankerous Mr P W Botha. The composition of the ANC
delegations would change, but the figure almost always at the heart of the
talks was Mr Mbeki.
On his return to South Africa after Mr Mandela's release in 1990, he was
first contrasted with Hani, the former leader of the South African Communist
party who had a powerful constituency among the country's alienated youth.
Following Hani's assassination Mr Mbeki's main rival became Mr Cyril
Ramaphosa, the ANC secretary general who had a cut his political teeth in
the rough and tough environment of strikes and stayaways when he led the
National Union of Mineworkers.
No less eloquent than Mr Mbeki, it seemed Mr Ramaphosa's role as the ANC's
prime negotiator in the constitutional talks, and his talent as a hard-nosed
political infighter, would make him a strong candidate for the number two
job.
Mr Mbeki, who sometimes appeared more comfortable in boardrooms than at
political rallies, was criticised in some quarters for his apparent
reluctance to involve himself in grassroots politics. Yet to the surprise of
many, Mr Mbeki was endorsed by the ANC Youth League when he made his
successful bid for chairmanship of the ANC in 1993. This support may well
have swung the balance in his favour in the contest for the deputy
presidentship, while Mr Ramaphosa decided to decline a cabinet post and
concentrate on strengthening the ANC's organisation.
One of Mr Mbeki's erstwhile adversaries in the De Klerk government, now an
admirer who sat opposite him in the delicate behind-the-scenes encounters
which opened the way to formal talks, remarks: 'He is one of the toughest,
most able negotiators I have dealt with.'
Says another government negotiator: 'His ability to maintain his ANC
credentials while accommodating white fears was a key factor in the whole
process.'

FT  07 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Still in a deep hole
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a year since Mr Kenneth Clarke confessed that the government was in a
'dreadful hole'. The chancellor, who was home secretary at the time, was
reflecting on the dismal Conservative performance at last May's local
elections. Those contests enabled the electorate to express an opinion on
the ejection of sterling from the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992.
Voters indicated their deep dissatisfaction with the performance of the
administration that was elected in April 1992. Labour did well, but the most
significant beneficiaries were the Liberal Democrats.
Following this year's local elections, all the change - from the
government's point of view - is for the worse. The hole that threatens to
engulf the prime minister and perhaps his party with him is deeper. On
Thursday the Tories came fourth in Scotland, and only just matched the
Liberal Democrats in the rest of the country. They were trounced in and
around London. Their estimated share of the total popular vote, at some 27
per cent, reflects recent opinion poll results. This is the most unpopular
Conservative government in post-1945 history.
The expectation is that there are worse shocks to come. The Liberal
Democrats are favourites to take Eastleigh from the Conservatives in a
forthcoming by-election. If this week's performance in the local contests is
repeated at next month's European elections, the Tories could face a
wipe-out of Canadian proportions, with Labour winning a preponderance of
seats and the Liberal Democrats mopping up most of the rest. Since the
Conservatives remain deeply divided about Britain's proper place in the
European Community, this is possible.
British sovereignty
There are in effect two Conservative parties. One believes that Britain
must, in the last resort, adapt to the continental consensus. The other
regards such a strategy as surrendering British sovereignty. These
convictions are ultimately irreconcilable. For the moment the Conservative
coalition is being held together by thin rhetoric. Decisions on intractable
matters such as a single currency are postponed, while on everyday affairs
the governmment asserts that it will 'stand up for Britain' while remaining
'at the heart of Europe'.
In short, today's party may be unleadable. Yet Mr John Major's leadership is
once again under question. If it could be demonstrated that the prime
minister was personally responsible for the loss of public support for the
Conservatives, and that one of his colleagues could do the job better, he
might reasonably conclude that he should step down. This is not, however,
the case. None of the contenders for the job - not Mr Michael Heseltine, nor
Mr Michael Portillo, nor Mr Kenneth Clarke, would guarantee a permanent end
to internecine strife. The government is out of favour for a variety of
reasons, only one of which is the well-known list of misfortunes and inept
decisions for which Mr Major alone may be said to be responsible.
Prolonged recession
The Tories' counter-inflation strategy, which has been effective, brought
about a prolonged recession. Recovery is slow. The statistics are pointing
to better times, but the resurgence of growth is not being felt by a
sufficient number of people to make a difference. The housing market is
recovering, but only gradually. Real incomes, net of tax, are rising
imperceptibly, if at all. Taxation, which Mr Major promised in 1992 would
not be increased, has been raised by the largest amount in peacetime memory.
Yet the performance of the opposition is not quite as threatening as it
looks. The Liberal Democrats will have to be taken more seriously if they
win in Eastleigh and do well in the European elections, but they have a long
way to go. Labour's tally on Thursday, at about 41 per cent of the vote,
fell short of its opinion poll ratings of 47 and 48 per cent. The party's
leader, Mr John Smith, is apparently content to watch the Conservatives tear
themselves apart. This could be a fatal error. On Thursday it worked in
places like Croydon, but not everywhere. When the next general election
comes, southern voters will want a reason, and one they can believe, for
trusting Labour.
Meanwhile, Mr Major should slow down. If he reshuffles his cabinet in July
he should do so without appearing to panic. Competence should be preferred
to party balance. Mr John Patten has run out of rope at education, and may
not be suitable for any other department. Mr Michael Howard has not been a
successful home secretary, but he is too big a player to be relegated. Mrs
Virginia Bottomley is no longer useful at health. Mr Portillo should be
tried out in a department, while Mr Stephen Dorrell, Mr Brian Mawhinney, Mr
David Davis, and Mr Jonathan Aitken should be brought in to the cabinet.
Beyond that, the government would do best to try a period of quiet,
competent, administration. It is counter-productive to invent a new wheeze
every other Tuesday. When in a hole, it is advisable to stop digging.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Struggle to keep the lid on: As the temperature rises over
Spain's corruption scandal, David White asks how many lives Gonzalez has
left
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former central bank governor and a former head of the stock exchange are
remanded in a common jail. The ex-chief of paramilitary police is on the
run. Two ministers and the ruling party's parliamentary leader have felt
obliged to resign, joined yesterday by the head of the country's anti-drug
programme. This week the whole of Spain has been gripped by the spectacle of
a political crisis spinning vertiginously out of control.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, returned last night to his home town
of Seville to try to stir up his alarmed Socialist troops to face European
and regional elections just five weeks away.
The day before, in a televised press conference, he made a belated effort to
put a lid on the crisis, doing his best to project the customary confidence
and serenity, talking frankly of 'mistakes' and 'difficult days', saying he
had no intention of quitting or dissolving parliament. But his nervous smile
betrayed the traumatic experience he and his government have been going
through in the past few days.
Mr Gonzalez is not to be easily written off. He has come back and fought his
way out of tight situations before. Eight years ago he came close to being
unsaddled in a referendum on Nato membership. He won it against the odds
after a debilitating campaign in which he was accused of being a turncoat.
Last year, facing a likely general election defeat and widespread
disillusion, he managed to rally more votes than the Socialists had obtained
since their first landslide win in 1982.
But how many lives does Mr Gonzalez have? His government's credibility was
already low before the scandals surfaced, having presided over Spain's worst
economic slump for 30 years and an official unemployment rate now nearing
one in four. The party which gave stability to Spain's post-Franco democracy
by securing an absolute majority in parliament is now a minority government.
The only solid backing for Mr Gonzalez now comes mainly from pensioners,
women and countryfolk. He has lost support among the young and in the cities
and industrial centres.
Even before this week's resignations, which have brought a distinct whiff of
governmental decomposition, there was an aura of fin de regime. The
Socialists probably expected to be beaten in last summer's general election.
Their surprise win now looks increasingly likely to be a limited extension,
like a football match playing into extra time.
This does not mean the government has been inactive. A new economic team is
pressing ahead with deregulation. A cautious reform of the country's
notoriously inflexible labour laws - long talked about as a necessary
prerequisite for job creation, but never acted on until now - is in its
final stages of parliamentary approval, overriding objections from the
once-powerful trade unions. A rescue for Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto),
one of the traditional pillars of the banking system, has been carried out
with conspicuous success.
The fruits of what is now a tentative economic recovery should become
apparent next year, when most observers expect the employment figures to
start improving. But few would bet on the current administration lasting
long enough to benefit from it.
The political discussion in Spain is not about whether the Gonzalez era is
coming an end, but about when and how. Will Mr Gonzalez - who less than
three months ago was turning down approaches to be put forward as the next
president of the European Commission - end up like Mr Bettino Craxi, the
disgraced former socialist prime minister of Italy, who was caught up in
bribery scandals? Will the Spanish Socialists, the oldest political party in
the country, cave in like their Italian partners or collapse electorally
like the French Socialists on whose campaign they modelled their own when
they came to power? Could they just implode, following the example of
Spain's previous governing party, the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD)
in 1982?
For now, Mr Gonzalez has shored up his position by securing pledges of
support from Catalan and Basque nationalists who lead governments in their
respective regions and form minority groups in the national parliament. The
Catalan party Convergencia i Unio alone has enough seats - 17 - to provide a
narrow combined majority with the Socialists.
Its leader, the Catalan president Mr Jordi Pujol, has come to the conclusion
that no other government is possible in the current parliament. The
conservative Popular Party (PP) has 141 seats, not far behind the
Socialists' 159 but not enough to create an absolute majority even if both
the Catalans and Basques switched camp. Mr Pujol, who broadly supports the
government's policies, is therefore considering only two options: stick with
Mr Gonzalez or force new elections.
In the coming months he will be able to call the shots. He flew to Madrid on
Thursday morning to make it clear to Mr Gonzalez that his support depended
on the government's performance in economic policy and dealing with
corruption. This understanding still leaves Mr Gonzalez in a far from safe
position. If more cases of serious financial wrongdoing involving senior
figures emerge, the Catalans could take fright, not wanting to be seen in
the eyes of their own electorate to be propping up a disreputable government
in Madrid.
Equally, the alliance with the Socialists could well come under strain later
this year when the Catalans press for concessions in next year's budget. Mr
Jose Maria Aznar, the PP leader, is reckoning on a general election between
the autumn and next spring and would be the favourite to win it.
For all Mr Gonzalez's assurances, therefore, the climate of uncertainty is
sure to remain. Economic planners and business leaders are worried about the
possible impact on investment, which would be serious if the political
crisis reached a peak before enactment of the labour market reform.
What is puzzling is the lateness of Mr Gonzalez's response to the growing
evidence of corrupt practices and illicit gains. The past three years have
seen a succession of embarrassing affairs. The brother of Mr Alfonso Guerra,
then deputy prime minister, was accused of using his connections as well as
a government office to further his business interests. The next year, after
Mr Guerra resigned from the government, a scandal broke over clandestine
funds being paid to the Socialist party by banks and companies through a
bogus consultancy. In 1992 Mr Mariano Rubio, then still Bank of Spain
governor, was already involved in controversy over his links with a failed
bank run by his stockbroker friend Mr Manuel de la Concha - a prelude to the
present case involving charges of tax fraud and falsification.
The lack of firm action then, and seemingly slow reaction to the
implications of the latest allegations have done no good to Mr Gonzalez's
image. Increasingly reclusive, shielded by an inner circle of courtiers, he
has appeared paralysed, trying to play for time, resisting the pressure for
heads to roll, wanting to wait for the European election. But the heads have
rolled anyway.
More emblematic figures than those at the centre of the latest scandals
would be hard to imagine. Mr Mariano Rubio served as vice-governor, then
from 1984-92 as governor of the Bank of Spain, the ultimate guarantor of
financial probity. The Pta2,000 (Pounds 10) banknotes that bear Mr Rubio's
signature are now subjects for mockery. The case is all the more poignant
because Mr Rubio was a highly effective and respected governor.
When he was reappointed in 1988, a column in the independent newspaper
Diario 16 spoke effusively of Mr Rubio as being 'endowed with an innate
sense of rectitude, oblivious to any petty political ambition, impermeable
to the siren-songs of the private sector'. He was 'a great public servant in
the best sense of such a bastardised word'. Trusting him was one thing Mr
Gonzalez had done well. How ironic that the author was Pedro J Ramirez, now
editor of El Mundo, the paper that led the latest allegations about Mr
Rubio's undeclared investments.
And then there is Mr Luis Roldan, first civilian chief of the Civil Guard,
the ultimate symbol of authority in Spain, renowned for its acute sense of
honour, in the front-line of the fight against Basque terrorism and
extortion.
This is not the first time the force has made headlines in an unfortunate
way. In the attempted military coup of 1981, the image of a handle-bar
moustached lieutenant-colonel in a tricorn hat brandishing a gun in
parliament reflected a comic-opera version of Spain. The preposterous saga
of Mr Roldan and his property purchases, the allegations about bundles of
cash being carried in and out of his office, his extravagant gifts to a
woman friend, and his unimpeded getaway have provided a mix of farce and
melodrama.
Corruption is nothing new in Spain, however. Although Mr Gonzalez elegantly
focused on present and future cases rather than digging up the past, it was
definitely widespread in the Franco regime. But corruption certainly also
flourished in the boom period of the late 1980s, when Socialist politicians
had become entrenched in positions of power at local, regional and national
levels.
The recent disclosures have provoked a flood of public venom. At a time of
continuing economic hardship, the jokes are mixed with fierce resentment, in
which sheer envy of wealth is a strong element. Spaniards are not bothered
about sexual peccadilloes like the British, but they are bothered about
other people's money. Reaction to the Rubio affair has come close to that of
a lynch-mob. When the 62-year-old former governor turned up to answer
questions at a prosecutor's office, he was greeted by shouts of 'cad'.
However, he may have done nothing that was not common practice a few years
ago, and the rules at the time did not stop a Bank of Spain governor from
investing in stocks. Mr Rubio believes he is being made a scapegoat.
The most positive construction that can be put on these tumultuous events in
Spain is that they may help to instil more morality into public life. They
could have a cathartic effect. But whether there is any salvation in this
for Mr Gonzalez is more doubtful.

FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Labour demands talks on London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday woke up to sweeping new opportunities to co-ordinate policy
across London.
For the first time since the abolition of the Greater London Council in
1986, the party has overall control of a majority of the London boroughs -
17 out of 32.
This will allow it to chair all the joint co-ordinating committees formed in
the wake of the GLC's abolition. These control fire, civil defence, planning
advice to government (although not planning itself), grants to voluntary
organisations, research (mainly into the environment), and concessionary
fares for pensioners, along with some transport functions such as parking
and the committee to ban lorries.
Mr Toby Harris, leader of Haringey borough council, where Labour gained 14
seats from the Conservatives, and of the Labour-controlled Association of
London Authorities, signalled that the party's ambitions go beyond this. It
wants to concentrate on urban regeneration and partnerships with the private
sector, rather than the confrontational politics for which the old GLC is
remembered.
He said he was seeking an immediate meeting with Mr John Gummer, the
environment secretary, to discuss a new initiative for the future of the
city - establishing a 'Regeneration Partnership for London'.
He added: 'Based upon a partnership between central government, the London
boroughs and the private sector, this new initiative will harness public and
private-sector resources and will require proper direction.'
Labour also intends to use its extra strength to lobby for more European
funds and to try to end the division of London authorities into two
representative associations.
The ALA was intended to provide an easy vehicle for re-establishing a
London-wide authority once Labour was returned to government. This remains a
central Labour aim, as Mr Harris stated yesterday. All its members are
Labour-controlled, and the organisation concentrates on campaigning.
It broke away from the London Boroughs Association, whose remaining members
are predominantly Conservative, and the two organisations have lobbied in
different directions, weakening attempts to create a cohesive 'London
voice'.
The ALA claimed that several councils had already contacted it yesterday,
asking to join, while the LBA was non-committal about its future.
An alternative, which would do away with division altogether, would see all
17 Labour councils joining the LBA. Both organisations are due to have
meetings at the beginning of June.
Labour cannot wield as much power as it did by controlling the GLC. Several
joint committees, including the grants committee for voluntary
organisations, require a two-thirds majority to agree a new budget. Also,
several GLC functions, such as transport, have been removed from local
government.

FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Council leaders blame ministers for
heavy losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Defeated Tory council leaders yesterday cast aside their loyalty to the
Conservative leadership and blamed ministers for the party's disastrous
performance in the local elections.
Outgoing council leaders claimed that cabinet disunity had badly dented
their local support. One said that the strong reputation of his council had
been undermined by an 'appalling' campaign from Conservative Central Office,
which failed to emphasise that the election should be on local issues.
Mr Donald Abbott, the outgoing Tory leader of Harrow council, said Mr John
Major's poor leadership was the principal reason why the Tories had lost
control of the borough for the first time in 21 years.
'There is a grave danger that John Major is becoming an electoral
liability,' he said. 'If you are going to be the leader, you must be seen
and recognised as the leader. The prime minister should have put an end to
cabinet disunity, but it is probably too late now.'
Mr Ronnie Barden, whose Tory group's loss of the north London borough of
Redbridge saw it pass out of Tory hands for the first time, also claimed
that Mr Major's public image had been a 'hindrance'. But he blamed Mr
Michael Portillo, the cabinet minister in charge of the London campaign, for
making mistakes.
'Michael Portillo's original message was that it was better for the
government to stay out of the London campaign,' he said. 'But then they
didn't stick to that message, and ministers started to get involved. That
just wasn't helpful to us.'
Even in Brent, where Conservatives retained a narrow hold on the council,
there was criticism of the way Tory managers had run the elections.
'There simply was no campaign from Michael Portillo or from Central Office,'
said Mr Leslie Winters, who helped to mastermind the local Tory campaign.
Mr Paul Cloakie, whose Tory group was resoundingly beaten by the Liberal
Democrats in Kingston upon Thames, said government failure to stop
overcrowding in schools had brought about his defeat.
'John Patten lost it for us in Kingston,' he said, accusing the education
secretary of failing to reverse rules which allow children from neighbouring
boroughs to attend Kingston's highly successful schools.

FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Tower Hamlets loss fails to crush BNP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour, back in power at Tower Hamlets after eight years, rejoiced yesterday
over the double defeat of the Liberal Democrats and the far-right British
National party.
The east London borough, where the number of Liberal Democrat councillors
dwindled from 29 to seven, had been the only big inner-city authority run by
the party.
But Labour's joy at humiliating the Liberal Democrats will be tempered by an
assessment of the performance of the BNP, which campaigned under the slogan
Rights for Whites.
An intensive Labour campaign involving national political figures and a
special manifesto succeeded in unseating Mr Derek Beackon, who became the
BNP's first councillor in a by-election in the Millwall ward in September.
But Mr Beackon and other two other Millwall BNP candidates polled more votes
than at the by-election. Compared with the 1990 elections, the improvement
in the BNP's vote was dramatic.
Mr Beackon stood as a BNP candidate in Tower Hamlets' Redcoat ward in 1990
and received just 93 votes. He won last year's by-election in Millwall with
1,480 and polled 2,041 there yesterday. BNP candidates in other parts of the
borough showed similar growth in support - the party's vote in St James
ward, for example, rose from 93 in 1990 to 653.
Last night anti-racism campaigners urged the main parties to continue the
fight against racism in spite of Mr Beackon losing his seat.
The BNP, on the strength of its results in Tower Hamlets, is likely to
conclude that although it lost its only council seat it is worth maintaining
a high level of activity in the borough.
But one unique attraction of the borough - its decentralised structure,
under which the BNP would have needed only three seats to gain control of
the Isle of Dogs neighbourhood - will disappear with the transfer of power
from Liberal Democrat to Labour.
The Liberal Democrat majority group had devolved budgets and decision-making
to seven neighbourhoods. Mr John Biggs, Labour leader, said yesterday the
system had created 'intense parochialism' and had undoubtedly been a factor
in the rise of the BNP. Labour would retain local offices and encourage a
sense of local identity within the borough, but would not maintain the
Liberal Democrat structure of devolved decision-making.
'The Liberal Democrat party nationally has commended the Tower Hamlets
decentralisation as a model for other councils it controls,' said Mr Biggs.
'I think experience here shows that they should go back to the drawing
board.'
The BNP, too, can claim to have played a part in the Liberal Democrat
demise. Mr Beackon's by-election win prompted an inquiry by the national
Liberal Democrat party which found that some Tower Hamlets members had
pandered to racism.
This caused divisions within the local party, and tensions with the national
one, from which Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrats never recovered.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's election co-ordinator in London, said: 'The first
question Paddy Ashdown has to answer is how does he explain the disaster in
Tower Hamlets? Losing 22 seats to Labour was the worst result in any council
in England.'

FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Ashdown's army advances outside its
heartlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If it was difficult for Conservative Central Office to dismiss the view of
one backbencher that the government suffered its 'nightmare scenario' in the
local elections, it was harder to work out who was the clear winner.
Both Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, and Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the
Liberal Democrats, claimed that mantle. Labour saw its share of the vote
rise from 40 per cent to 42 per cent while the Liberal Democrats increased
their vote from 18 per cent to 27 per cent.
Mr Smith dismissed suggestions that there had been significant tactical
voting. 'Apart from a bit here and bit there, there was not much,' he said.
As the Liberal Democrats took control of Eastleigh council - taking two
seats from Labour - Mr Smith's comments on the relative absence of tactical
voting might suggest that he should now run up the white flag in the
Eastleigh by-election.
But the Labour leader said he would do no such thing, promising to redouble
the party's efforts to win the parliamentary contest.
Professor Anthony King, professor of government at the University of Essex,
says the lack of tactical voting was one of the more interesting features of
the local elections.
He argues that the trend in national and local elections over the past 10
years has been the establishment of two zones: Labour versus Conservative in
the inner cities and in northern England while Liberal Democrats battle with
Conservatives in the suburbs and south.
The local election results appear to confirm this trend. Outside London, the
Liberal Democrats' share of the vote in the south was about 40 per cent
compared with their national share of 27 per cent. Many of their biggest
gains, from Bath to St Albans, were in their southern stronghold.
But Professor King asks how then can the result in Sheffield, where Labour
lost eight council seats to the Liberal Democrats, or Bromley where the
Liberal Democrats gained 14 seats while Labour lost four, be explained?
Mr David Butler, a fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, says the key point
arising from the elections is how the Liberal Democrats won a toehold - 'no
matter how small' - in almost all the councils.
Mr Ashdown claims to have taken on, and in many significant areas defeated,
'municipal socialism' in Sheffield, Liverpool and Southwark.
Mr Butler believes many defecting Labour voters may return to the fold in
the general election.
It was perhaps the forgotten parliamentary by-election at Rotherham that
underlines the argument that tactical voting played only a small part in the
elections.
Labour, which easily held the seat, polled its second-worst share of the
vote in more than 30 years. Mr Denis MacShane, the Labour candidate, saw the
majority fall by more than 8 percentage points from 63.9 per cent to 55.6
per cent. The party only did worse in the 1983 election.
In contrast the Liberal Democrats made significant headway, pushing into
second place with 29.7 per cent of the vote, against 12.3 per cent two years
ago.
Mr Ashdown's claim to be an established party of government and the main
challenger to both 'old parties in their heartlands' is borne out by the
results. In scores of councils the Liberal Democrats are no longer the
'third party', but one of three parties.
Tower Hamlets appears to be the exception. The Liberal Democrats lost 22
seats, the biggest single defeat for any party in any council in England.
Labour declared that they had 'trounced' their competitor in the only
straight fight between Labour and Liberal Democrats.
But Mr Ashdown's explanation that his party has paid the price for 'the
ill-judged actions' of two or three of his activists was nearer the truth.
Similarly, Labour's loss of Lambeth had more to do with the behaviour of
leftwing councillors expelled from the Labour party as the council was
accused of more than Pounds 20m of unlawful expenditure by the district
auditor.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Leon Brittan, the UK's senior European commissioner, has entered the
Tory factional fight over Europe by attacking the 'ludicrous caricature' of
the Maastricht treaty put forward by Conservative Europhobes.
In a speech today he will say: 'Scaremongers would have us believe Britain
has sat idly by as its more experienced European neighbours are twisting the
European Union into an opaque and centralist bureaucracy, undermining the
principles most cherished by the British. Don't believe it.'
The speech in Stockton-on-Tees in support of Mr Robert Goodwill, Tory
candidate for the European parliament for Cleveland and Yorkshire North,
will assert forcibly that 'in the areas that matter most, Europe is going
Britain's way'.
Sir Leon will say he is astonished anyone should attempt to reopen the
question of EU membership. 'The government has made it absolutely clear that
it does not for a moment contemplate leaving the union and has no plans for
a referendum on the question.'

FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Disgusted voters of Tunbridge revolt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pantiles, a street of elegant shops, antique dealers and fine tea rooms,
exemplifies the aristocratic, old world charm of Tunbridge Wells.
But even here, in the centre of this Tory heartland town in Kent, signs of
the recession are apparent. A wide, dusty window advertises a lease for the
empty shop behind. Next door, the Stamp Shop is holding a 'closing down'
sale.
On Thursday night in Tunbridge Wells local voters wrested control of the
local council from the Conservatives and handed the Liberal Democrats a gain
of five seats.
Many voters saw this upset as a referendum of discontent with national
issues. 'I think Major and his government got a kick in the pants,' said Mr
John Hopkinson, membership secretary for the Tunbridge Wells Chamber of
Commerce. 'People are facing the recession. Small businesses especially are
feeling the pressure and the pinch, and I hope the vote will make the
government more aware of that.'
Mrs Elizabeth Elliot, a customer at Gemini Cards on the Pantiles and a
worker in an antique shop there, warmed to the subject. 'We are letting the
government know what we think, even if we would prefer a Conservative
council,' she said hotly.
Pensioners who felt bitter with the government were jubilant at the results.
'I am well pleased,' said Mrs Joyce Churcher. 'We have just about had enough
of this government, what with closing down hospitals and VAT on fuel.'
The 'protest vote' seems to have put the nail in the Tories' coffin. Mr
Hopkinson, a former Tory councillor in the north of England, said he had
voted for a Labour candidate to register his own protest vote.
Some electors said that local issues, rather than national policy, guided
their vote. Mrs Debbie Millar, who works in the family-owned Breeds the
Cutler on the High Street, the oldest store in Tunbridge Wells, said that
she had not voted Tory, for the first time in her life, because she was so
upset with the local authority. 'This council has ruined the town for
retailers,' she said. 'They have cut our turnover by half.'
She said the council had voted to build a shopping centre with chain stores,
such as Boots and Marks and Spencer, which draw a large portion of her local
business away.
Upon reflection, she admitted that national policy had influenced her
decision. 'The general attitude of government to small family businesses is
appalling,' she said. 'I probably won't vote Tory in the general election.'
In spite of the town's anger with the Tories, voters are reluctant to start
shedding Tunbridge Wells' image as the Tory heartland. 'This was a classic
case of the voters delivering a bloody nose to the government,' said Mr
Steve Smith, an advertising account manager, who was posting a letter in the
busy Pantiles post office. 'But I think come a national election, people
will go back to 'true-blue'.'

FT  07 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Hurd seeks to unite party before Euro
poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union must find ways for member states to be comfortable about
their European identity without feeling that their national interests are
being undermined, Mr Douglas Hurd said yesterday.
The foreign secretary used a speech in Warsaw to try to stake out common
Conservative ground ahead of next month's European elections, in which the
party hopes to avoid a second humiliation.
Addressing the Polish parliament, Mr Hurd spoke of a 'strong Europe of
self-confident nation states' and said that a 'multi-speed, multi-track,
even multi-faceted Europe' was taking shape.
The foreign secretary's remarks came against a backdrop of growing alarm in
Tory ranks about the implications of Thursday night's local election results
for next month's European elections and Mr Major's premiership.
It is widely thought that the Tories need to hold at least half their 32
European seats to give the prime minister a decent chance of survival.
The blunt message from the local elections is that this could well be a tall
order.
The Conservatives' 27 per cent share of the vote on Thursday night was only
the same as that obtained by the Liberal Democrats, and is far below the
34.7 per cent they secured in the 1989 European elections.
To make matters worse, the local electorate showed a tendency to vote for
the candidates who appeared to stand the best chance of kicking - or keeping
 -the Tories out.
If this inclination is repeated next month, it could be decisive in the
crucial battle in the Conservative heartland of southern England where the
party is fighting tooth and nail to stop a widely predicted Liberal Democrat
surge in the south-west from spreading east to the Cotswolds, Hampshire and
beyond.
Early projections suggest the Liberal Democrats may have taken as much as 40
per cent of Thursday night's vote in southern England excluding London.
It would now require a remarkable reversal of fortunes to prevent Tory-held
European seats in Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Dorset from falling.
But it is the results farther east - where the Liberal Democrats swept to
victories in Bath, Eastleigh and Winchester, gained seats in Stroud and
Portsmouth, held Cheltenham with ease and frustrated Labour's expectations
of winning control of Gloucester - that will have been more disquieting for
the Conservatives.
The Liberal Democrats can now have realistic hopes of breaking out of the
south-west into the neighbouring counties of Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and
Hampshire. They believe several gains are possible on swings of 10 per cent
or less.
Further east again, the Liberal Democrats won control of councils such as
Mole Valley, St Albans and Worthing, deprived the Tories of control in
true-blue Tunbridge Wells and made sweeping gains in the London suburb of
Bromley. This suggests they could be a force to be reckoned with next month
even in the Home Counties, where the party estimates it needs a swing of
about 12 per cent before it begins to make headway.
Tory strategists will also be noting nervously that the Greens - in their
brief spell in the electoral limelight five years ago - took a quarter of
the vote in 1989 in Sussex West and 23 per cent in both Cotswolds and
Hereford &amp; Worcester.
Precious little of that surprisingly heavy environmental protest vote is
likely to come the Conservatives' way five years later.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Curbs on night flights criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Night flying restrictions for London aimed at reducing noise levels while
allowing more flights were announced yesterday by Mr John MacGregor, the
transport secretary.
Two constraints will operate, based on noise levels and numbers of flights,
and airlines will not be allowed to breach either. Mr MacGregor said in a
written Commons answer that quotas on noise levels together with higher
limits on the number of night flights - as proposed last November - would
apply for four years from October 24.
Anti-noise campaigners reacted angrily to the news. Mr John Boulton, of the
Heathrow Association for the Containment of Air Noise (Hacan), described the
limits as 'disastrous'.
'The sleep of up to 1m people in west London is being disturbed night after
night, and yet the government just steamrolls through with this bad news,'
he said.
The government's initial proposal to abandon limits on the number of
take-offs and landings at Gatwick and Heathrow in favour of noise quotas was
overturned by the High Court. The court ruled that the noise quota was
outside Mr MacGregor's powers under the 1982 Civil Aviation Act to curb
noise.
The noise quota was based on a points system, but the government judged some
aircraft so quiet that they could not be counted. Five councils in Surrey,
Berkshire and London argued in the High Court that this could mean a rise in
night flights from 5,750 a year to about 24,000.
The government responded to the High Court ruling by reintroducing a limit
on the number of flights.
It also reclassified aircraft so that even the quietest would count as 0.5
of a point towards the parallel noise quota.
The transport department yesterday described the new system as 'providing a
double safeguard for residents while also acting as an incentive to airlines
to use quieter aircraft'.
In an effort to satisfy airlines' demands for extra capacity, the government
has also reduced the hours of night restrictions by 30 minutes so that they
will run from 2330 until 0600.
Airlines have since lobbied for further rises in the limits and quotas and
were yesterday disappointed at the government's decision to stick with last
year's proposals.
Mr Richard Hedges, of Britannia Airways, said: 'It is going to be very tight
operating the flights we had planned.'

FT  07 MAY 94 / Treasury veto axes 'charterline'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has scrapped plans for a national telephone helpline on the
public services after the Treasury refused cash for advertising.
The 'charterline' was meant to give callers information about the Citizen's
Charter and tell them who to contact in order to find out more about
particular services.
It also offered advice on how to complain about a wide range of local and
national services including government departments, health service
organisations, local authorities and utilities.
The service is to be abandoned, however, after incurring costs of more than
Pounds 70 a call during a 10-month pilot study in three Midlands counties.
Demand in the pilot area averaged 25 calls a day compared with forecasts of
30,000 a month.
Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister, has rejected a
recommendation from consultants who reported on the pilot to extend the
service nationally. There would be minimal additional set-up costs, since
'charterline' could already handle the calls expected from the whole country
at the current low level of usage.
A poll carried out for the Cabinet Office last year found that 92 per cent
of those asked wanted a telephone helpline to be introduced.
But an evaluation of the pilot by consultants from Price Waterhouse, the
accountants, found that awareness of the 'charterline' was low.
The service was publicised only through posters, leaflets and local radio.
Plans to use television advertising were shelved.
In a change of tack, the Cabinet Office is asking publishers of directories
distributed to homes in the UK to include information about the Citizen's
Charter and contact details for individual services.
Thomson Directories, which distributes 135 directories containing telephone
numbers and other local information, will include details of government
agency helplines for organisations such as the Benefits Agency and the
health service. Talks are under way with BT about including similar
information in its telephone directories.
Details of public services and local helplines would also be included in the
new postcodes directories planned by Royal Mail, the letters division of the
Post Office. Royal Mail intends to send 2m businesses free directories
listing the address and postcode for business and residential addresses in
each of 11 regions.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Tories set for gruelling infighting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party was bracing itself yesterday for a damaging
leadership battle after Mr John Major warned that he would fight a
threatened challenge from the right.
Tired but defiant in the face of disastrous council results, Mr Major said
he would be 'standing there waiting' if dissident MPs tried to force him
from Downing Street.
But Mr Tony Marlow, who last month urged Mr Major's resignation, said his
'credibility and authority are not going to be restored until there is a
contest'.
Some rightwingers also saw the poor election results as an opportunity for
the right to increase its influence over the prime minister, particularly on
European issues.
A leadership challenge appeared almost certain after Mr John Carlisle,
rightwing MP for Luton North, said he would 'reluctantly' stand against Mr
Major if no one else did. Mr Carlisle's comments - the first public threat
to force a leadership election - prompted outrage in his constituency, where
two senior officials immediately resigned.
'If he wants to make a fool of himself, let him,' said Mr Joe O'Neill,
chairman of the constituency association. 'We want nothing to do with it.'
Rightwing MPs said they were certain that at least 34 Conservative MPs - the
minimum required - were ready to call for a contest this autumn.
'Nothing is going to happen until after the European elections in June, but
we have got the critical mass and we will force an election,' a leading
rightwinger said.
Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the 92 Group of rightwing MPs, said the
Conservatives would be 'wiped off the map' in the Euro-elections if party
support slid further.
He urged a 'radical' reshuffle before the elections to 'cut out the dead
wood' and increase the number of rightwingers in the cabinet.
Several rightwingers said there was 'no point' in trying to dislodge Mr
Major because the only credible alternative candidates - Mr Kenneth Clarke
and Mr Michael Heseltine - were on the pro-European left of the party.
The three ministers likely to emerge as top candidates in any leadership
battle all rallied to support the prime minister.
Mr Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said Mr Carlisle's threat to
stand against Mr Major was 'deplorable'. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor,
warned against treating Mr Major as a 'scapegoat'. Mr Michael Portillo,
Treasury chief secretary, and the leading rightwinger in the cabinet, said
the prime minister had his full support.
Mr Major put part of the blame for the 'poor' election results on rightwing
MPs who have been sniping at his leadership.
Admitting that Tory voters had abstained because of the government's
unpopularity, Mr Major said Conservative supporters were 'distressed when
they see discordancy in the party'.

British Coal yesterday presented its 10,000 miners with an ultimatum to
accept a new deal on working conditions and redundancy arrangements within
the next two weeks or risk losing a Pounds 6,000 sweetener.
The lump sum is for agreeing to flexible con-ditions including weekend work
and extending the maximum rostered shift from 7 1/2 to 12 hours.
Miners must accept the deal by May 20 or lose the offer, leaving them with
maximum redundancy payouts of Pounds 6,150, British Coal said yesterday.
Mr Kevan Hunt, British Coal's employee relations director said: 'Everyone
must understand this is not only the best offer in town, it's the only
offer.'
The Union of Democratic Mineworkers opposes the offer but the British
Association of Colliery Management has accepted it. Nacods, the pit deputies
union, is considering its response. British Coal said talks are planned at
local level at non-UDM pits.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Scott warned on Whitehall secrecy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prosecuting agencies must be given increased access to highly sensitive
documents held by other government departments, Mr Sandy Russell, deputy
chairman of Customs &amp; Excise, warned yesterday.
Giving evidence to the Scott inquiry into sales of defence equipment to
Iraq, Mr Russell said the Matrix Churchill trial had been a catalyst for
improving the ability of investigators to see such material. However, he
warned that the nature of the 'government machine' meant further efforts to
improve access were still urgently required.
Mr Russell said retrieving documents for the Matrix Churchill trial from
different government departments had proved immensely difficult. Even
investigators with security clearance to read sensitive documents found the
rules on access very tight. He agreed with Lord Justice Scott that Customs
needed good access to sensitive papers to prevent breaches of the law and to
enable both prosecutors and defendants to present their cases properly.
Earlier, Mr Russell told the inquiry how Customs had been reluctant to
abandon its prosecutions of two businessmen over the 'supergun' affair, when
UK engineering firms made parts of a large gun destined for Iraq.
Although lawyers had advised that the prosecution would probably be rejected
by a jury, Customs officials sought further clarification from Sir Patrick
Mayhew, then attorney-general. Customs felt that failure to prosecute would
be a heavy blow to effective enforcement of export regulations while the
'supergun' affair had also caused considerable public concern.
The prosecution was abandoned only after Sir Patrick told Customs its
evidence was clearly inadequate, he said.

A Birmingham industrial tribunal yesterday awarded what are believed to be
the highest compensation awards in Britain to workers sacked because of
their age.
Mr Ray Walker, Mr Larry Nolan, and Mr Peter Kiddy have been awarded,
respectively, Pounds 12,348, Pounds 16,047 and Pounds 12,767, following
their dismissal by Carbodies in Coventry, makers of the black cab.
The three workers were dismissed in September 1992 when the company decreed
that all workers over the age of 60 had to go.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Teachers hostile to sex guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Instructions from Mr John Patten, the education secretary, to set sex
education in a 'clear framework of values' met a hostile response from
teachers yesterday.
The guidelines say that giving an under-age pupil advice on contraception
without parental knowledge or consent would be inappropriate, even if this
is against the wishes of the child.
All state-maintained schools in England and Wales will be required to
publish their formal policy on sex education, in line with Mr Patten's
guidelines, by September this year.
Teachers are alarmed that they could face prosecution if they give advice on
contraception to pupils aged under 16.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said: 'It is difficult to see how this guidance document will make
a significant contribution to the government's policy of reducing the number
of teenage pregnancies by 50 per cent by the year 2000.'

FT  07 MAY 94 / Regulator turns up heat in gas row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, will next week carry out its threat to
publish a controversial consultation document on competition in the industry
if the government continues to delay its publication, Robert Corzine writes.
Ofgas yesterday said it saw no reason to delay publication further. Ms Clare
Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, could reach a point next week where
she would release the report 'regardless of the politicians'.
The document, which sets out in detail how the domestic gas market will be
open to competition beginning in 1996, is awaiting approval by Mr John
Major, the prime minister.
The proposals have proved politically sensitive because of fears that
de-regulation would lead to wide price variations, with possible increases
for consumers who use relatively small amounts of gas.
Last month Ms Spottiswoode, who helped to write the report, threatened to
publish it unilaterally if the government failed to do so by yesterday.
Earlier this week Ofgas and the government agreed on a compromise date of
May 9. But yesterday it appeared that the government would miss the Monday
deadline.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Company failures reduced by 3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fewer companies foundered in the first quarter of this year, providing an
indication that the economy is emerging from recession, official figures
showed yesterday.
Seasonally adjusted figures for failures in England and Wales were down 3
per cent to 4,513 for the three months to the end of March compared with
4,634 in the last three months of last year.
The figures, prepared for the British Chambers of Commerce by the government
statistical service, were down 22 per cent on the same quarter of 1993.
Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the chambers, said the figures
were 'an indication that we are heading in the right direction'.
There were 2.2 per cent of active companies which became insolvent in the 12
months to March this year against 2.3 per cent in the year to last December.
Separate statistics yesterday from the government's Insolvency Service
showed that the total number of company insolvencies in England and Wales
last year was 20,825, down from a record 24,425 in 1992.
This included 8,361 compulsory liquidations, 12,464 creditors' voluntary
liquidations, 5,362 receiverships, 2,962 members' voluntary liquidations,
134 voluntary arrangements and 112 administrator appointments.
In Scotland there were 551 company insolvencies including 286 compulsory
liquidations and 265 creditors' voluntary liquidations.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Tory MPs attack ministers over bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday came under fire from its own backbenchers for using
delaying tactics in the Commons to kill a private member's bill that would
end discrimination against disabled people in the workplace.
Tory and Labour MPs accused ministers of orchestrating a series of
amendments which ensured that legislation proposed by Mr Roger Berry, Labour
MP for Kingswood, was abandoned before concluding its report stage.
Mr Nicholas Scott, the social security minister, assured MPs that the
government would launch a consultation process which would seek to combat
discrimination against disabled people at work.
But his announcement failed to appease Tory backbenchers such as Mr Alan
Howarth, a former Conservative education minister. 'There are 6m disabled
people in this country and they and their families will deeply resent
attempts to scupper this bill,' he said.
Mr Scott told MPs that the government's principal concern was that the
legislation would impose significant costs on businesses, forcing them to
provide goods, services and access to public places.
He claimed that the measures would cost industry up to Pounds 17bn, with
annual running costs of about Pounds 1bn a year.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Societies consider loyalty bonuses for savers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building society savers could be given loyalty bonuses or a share of the
profits under schemes being considered by some of the larger societies.
The aim would be to underline to members their ownership of the society and
the advantages of mutuality, encouraging them to look on their membership as
a continuing benefit rather than an asset which they should sell for a
one-off payment.
Such schemes might have the added benefit for societies of attracting retail
deposits. Societies have suffered a net outflow of retail deposits in each
of the last five months for which figures are available.
Since Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn offer for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building
society last month, societies have become more conscious that their members
might want to 'unlock' some of the value of their ownership. C&amp;G members
will receive cash payments of up to Pounds 10,000 each if the deal goes
ahead.
The schemes being considered fall into two forms. One would involve handing
a share of profits to members as a 'dividend'. The other would give savers a
bonus after, for example, five or 10 years.
Among the traditional arguments in favour of mutuality has been that
societies are able to offer more competitive rates to both saving and
borrowing members than banks are able to do, because they do not have to
divert any income to pay dividends to shareholders.
Some of the more innovative societies, however, now believe that they should
seek to provide benefits with a higher profile.
The sector as a whole is better-placed to consider payouts than it has been
in recent years. The 1993 results for 19 of the 20 largest societies show an
average increase in pre-tax profits of 53 per cent over 1992, and a fall of
18 per cent in provisions for bad debts.
Schemes are being considered both by societies that are determined to remain
independent mutual institutions, and by those that would be ready to convert
to plc status, but which do not wish to come under pressure from their
members to do so immediately.
The Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, said
yesterday that there was no legislation preventing societies from paying out
cash to their members.
It added, however, that it would expect to be informed in advance of any
scheme in order to satisfy itself that planned payments would not damage a
society's underlying strength.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Tax rises depress sales of new cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Registrations of new cars in the UK rose by 4.8 per cent in April, the
smallest year-on-year increase this year, as the recovery in new-car demand
faltered under the impact of recent tax increases.
Sales of new cars in April rose to 142,009 from 135,469 in the same month a
year ago, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders showed
yesterday.
In the first four months of the year registrations of new cars, at 671,445,
were 14.1 per cent higher than a year before.
'The April tax increases have clearly slowed the rate of market recovery,'
said Mr Ernie Thompson, SMMT chief executive.
Sales of new cars in the full year, however, were still on course for an
increase of at least 7 per cent to more than 1.9m, Mr Thompson said.
Ford, the leader of the UK market for new cars, has recently revised upwards
its sales forecast for the full year to 1.95m. It said the slowdown in the
rate of growth in April was 'partially due to the tax increases', but it was
leaving its forecast for the whole of 1994 unchanged.
The recovery slowed in April chiefly in the retail sector of the market,
including small businesses, with registrations rising by only 2 per cent.
Sales to fleets (operators of 25 or more cars) rose by 8.1 per cent
year-on-year in April and accounted for 48.2 per cent of the total market.
In the first four months fleet sales rose 16.9 per cent year-on-year
compared with an increase of 11.8 per cent in retail sales. Fleet sales
accounted for 44.6 per cent of the total market compared with 43.5 per cent
a year before.
Imported cars, taking an increasing share of the UK market, captured 56.7
per cent of new-car sales in April compared with 53.7 per cent a year
before. French carmakers Renault and the PSA Peugeot Citroen group both
performed strongly last month.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Cut lace binds two countries closer together
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ribbon of Calais lace stretched between two high-speed trains was cut by
the heads of state of Britain and France yesterday to mark the official
opening of the Channel tunnel.
The Queen and President Francois Mitterrand stepped off the trains which had
brought them to Calais from their respective capitals to mark the end of 200
years of on-off plans and seven years of tough and often dangerous
tunnelling.
The Pounds 10bn project forms the first man-made link between the two
nations. The cost of the project, one of the largest and most ambitious
engineering feats undertaken, has risen to double the original estimates.
In Britain the day had begun with the official opening by the Queen of the
Waterloo international terminal. The Queen then boarded a train for the
32-mile trip through the tunnel. The Eurostar train also carried Mr John
Major, a host of other ministers and rail officials.
The whole journey including the start through Kent took 1 hr 45 mins. The
train increased its speed as it swooped into the tunnel at Folkestone. Apart
from the darkened tunnel walls flashing past at up to 100mph, the 30-minute
journey through the tunnel itself was marked only by a slight increase in
noise from the air conditioning system.
On arrival at the Calais terminal, the Eurostar train nosed up to its
counterpart which had brought President Mitterrand and French dignitaries. A
French military band struck up before the ribbon cutting.
President Mitterrand had set off from Paris for the ceremony after
inaugurating a new rail terminal at Gare du Nord Station. The train carrying
him and prime minister Edouard Balladur was decked with French and British
flags.
The French president, the son of a railway stationmaster, said in a
newspaper interview that the tunnel helped 'anchor the construction of
Europe', bringing it forward 'more than any speeches'.
Speaking at Calais, President Mitterrand said he felt 'very emotional and
proud'. He added: 'After two centuries of dreams, today is the conclusion.'
He said the tunnel was one of the century's most prestigious endeavours. Its
opening would strengthen the European Union and the creation of a single
market.
President Mitterrand praised Lady Thatcher for her part in sanctioning the
building of the tunnel when prime minister. Lady Thatcher, sitting in the
front row among hundreds of dignitaries, smiled as she was singled out.
The Queen, noting that yesterday was the first time that British and French
heads of state had met without travelling by boat or aircraft, said the
tunnel demonstrated the strength of relations between the two countries.
Speaking in French to an audience of more than 1,000 guests, the Queen
referred to the 'violent fluctuations' in Anglo-French relations through the
ages. But the tunnel, she said, was an example of 'a successful combination
of French elan and British pragmatism'.
She congratulated the engineers and entrepreneurs who had built it, saying
that they had 'rejoined what nature had separated for some 40m years'.
After lunch, the Queen travelled back through the tunnel on board Le
Shuttle, one of the trains that will carry cars between Paris and London in
three hours. She was joined in her Rolls Royce Phantom VI by the French
president.
At Folkestone, Eurotunnel co-chairman Sir Alastair Morton told the two heads
of state: 'It is my proud honour and privilege to confirm that the Channel
tunnel is built and ready for service.
'In a year or two the journey you have both just made will be an everyday
experience for millions of people.'
But Sir Alastair said people must not forget the 10 people who had died
working on the project.
Mr Denis Filer, president of the Engineering Council, said: 'Our
congratulations go to the engineers of all disciplines who have accomplished
what must be rated as one of the world's greatest engineering achievements.
It is a proud day for British engineering.'
The tunnel system was today closed to the public - once again returned its
recent ritual of continuous safety testing.
A start-up date for passenger services has yet to be set. Freight trains may
start using the tunnel as early as next week if safety clearance is obtained
 -but passenger services will probably have to wait until July.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Indicators suggest upturn may falter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hints that the economic recovery may falter towards the end of the year came
yesterday with the publication of Central Statistical Office figures showing
a fall in its economic cyclical indicators.
The shorter leading index, which predicts economic turning points about five
months in advance, fell for the third month in a row after rising
continuously in 1993. The CSO said the fall was caused by a drop in share
prices and weak results from a recent consumer confidence survey.
The index, calculated from a basket of economic indicators including
consumer credit figures, registrations of new cars, share prices and
business surveys, has proved only partially accurate in the past. But
yesterday's figures were consistent with trends in the other CSO indices.
The longer leading index, which attempts to predict turning points 13 months
in advance, fell for the third month in a row after remaining broadly flat
in the second half of last year.
The main reason for the fall was a decline in business optimism found by the
Confederation of British Industry's April survey, the CSO said. The longer
leading index is compiled from economic indicators which include interest
rate levels, housing figures, yield curves and financial deficit figures.
The coincident index, which measures current turning points, also fell
fractionally in March after rising steadily during the previous 18 months.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Clinton sued over Arkansas sex claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton was yesterday sued for damages by a former Arkansas
state employee who alleged that three years ago tomorrow he pressed her to
engage in sexual relations.
The suit by Ms Paula Corbin Jones, now 29, seeks an apology and Dollars
750,000 (Pounds 514,000) in damages from Mr Clinton and from an Arkansas
state trooper who, she alleges, summoned her to the then governor's hotel
room in Little Rock.
The civil action against an incumbent president, filed in federal court in
the Arkansas capital on the day before the statute of limitations expired,
appears without precedent in American history. It was not clear when the
case would come to trial.
Mr Robert Bennett, the Washington 'superlawyer' hired by Mr Clinton for the
defence, dismissed the charges as 'tabloid trash with a legal caption on
it'. Affirming his client's innocence, he said, 'This is about money and
book contracts, and radio and television appearances, as will become very
clear before this litigation is over.'
Ms Jones's motives were questioned in an Arkansas TV interview by her older
sister, Charlotte Brown, who reported that Ms Jones had told her earlier
this year, before she first went public with her charges that 'whichever way
it went, it smelled money.'
It is difficult to ascertain how much the suit may harm Mr Clinton. There is
a high level of public sensitivity to accusations of sexual harassment,
especially since the Anita Hill accusations against Judge Clarence Thomas.
Even women's groups suspicious of the Jones case have felt obliged to be
critical of a president whose promiscuous tendencies are widely believed.
But some of Mr Clinton's fiercest critics have distanced themselves from the
conservative pack. Two columnists - William Safire of the New York Times and
Paul Gigot of the Wall Street Journal - were suspicious of the suit and said
Mr Clinton must be 'presumed innocent'.
Mr Safire wrote: 'I mistrust sudden memories and late hits and lucrative
victimhood.'

FT  07 MAY 94 / South African Elections: Spirit of conciliation sweeps aside
letter of vote - The election was deeply flawed, but nearly everyone likes
the outcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa has delivered what one political analyst yesterday described as
a 'designer outcome': a political settlement which binds in all the
significant parties, and leaves only the tiniest fractions to the far left
and right out in the cold of extra-parliamentary opposition. Even Inkatha,
most reluctant participant in the process, now has a vested interest in
success.
The outcome, reached after 10 days of electoral bungling and administrative
farce, might have been designed by a higher power to bring long-term
stability in the new South Africa.
The African National Congress is strong, but not overwhelmingly dominant: it
did not gain the two thirds of the national vote which would have made it
simpler to force through its ideas on a new constitution in the constituent
assembly. And crucially, it did not gain control of two important provinces,
KwaZulu Natal, with a fifth of the population, and the Western Cape.
The National party did not fare as well as outgoing President FW de Klerk
had hoped, but it did scrape past the 20 per cent psychological barrier
needed to give the party a substantial power base from which to argue the
interests of minorities within the government of national unity. Mr de Klerk
will be one of two deputy presidents; and the party's support within the
civil service, the security forces and the business community will give it
added clout.
Even more important, the Inkatha Freedom party won the province of KwaZulu
Natal with a fraction over 50 per cent of the vote, giving the party a
one-seat majority in the 81-member provincial assembly. Local ANC officials
are screaming foul play, and they are almost certainly right: there were no
doubt many petty frauds, and perhaps some grand ones committed in the
province. But the ANC's national leadership has either decided to accept
that its hands, too, were not clean; or more plausibly, the ANC simply
accepted that it had to concede the province to Inkatha, or jeopardise the
whole election.
The ANC paid a high price for ensuring that the election outcome was
accepted by Inkatha: it surrendered Natal, where 15,000 people have died in
the past decade in fighting which the ANC blames on the IFP. But this was
almost certainly the wisest course: for with Inkatha running well ahead in
the polls (however crooked the results may have been), the party of Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi would never have accepted defeat. And it is likely to
prove much less belligerent within government than without.
ANC supporters on the ground are unlikely to concur: they will find it hard
to swallow an electoral result which they fervently believe is based on
fraud. But the ANC leadership, even on the local level, has made clear that
it will preach acceptance of the outcome. ANC southern Natal regional
secretary Jeff Radebe, yesterday named a minister in the new national
government, fumes and complains but concludes that the ANC must accept the
result. 'We have no alternative,' he says, but adds that provincial
realities will force the two parties to work together even so.
'The IFP knows in its own heart of hearts that even if they win this
election, there is just no way that they can rule this province without us.
We are the power in the Durban area: there is just no way they can be a bull
in the kraal.' IFP leaders agree: under the constitution, the two parties
must share power in the 10-member regional executive, along with the
outgoing National party. (The IFP is likely to have five executive seats,
the NP one and the ANC three or four).
Both sides agree that the two top leaders in the province, the ANC's Jacob
Zuma and the IFP's Frank Mdladlose, get on extremely well. 'It's a love
relationship - to the annoyance of both sides,' says a senior IFP leader. He
holds out high hopes that the two men, both moderates, can help bring peace
to Natal.
So, four years after Mr Nelson Mandela was released from jail, South Africa
has delivered a political settlement that could bring lasting stability.
But not all was perfection: the liberal Democratic party was nearly wiped
from the national slate, gaining only 1.73 per cent of the national vote,
casting doubt over the future of liberalism in Africa and substantially
reducing its role in writing the new constitution (though it has more
support in provincial parliaments). The right-wing Freedom Front fell far
short of its goal of 800,000 votes, the total demanded by the ANC in
exchange for taking the Front's demands for an Afrikaner homeland seriously.
The ANC could, on this basis, decide to refuse the Front's demands; but it
knows it cannot do so without provoking further right wing violence.
And the poor showing of the black-supremacist Pan Africanist Congress, with
only 1.25 per cent of the vote, will enrage its supporters. But the PAC's
defeat reflects a welcome rejection of black-on-white racism. South Africans
did vote racially: 85 per cent of blacks and almost no whites for the ANC,
almost no blacks but the bulk of other races for the NP. But they did not
vote for racism; and that must be good for South Africa.
No one will ever know if the result is an accurate reflection of the will of
the South African people; indeed, if it is so, it is probably by accident.
'Both sides crooked like hell and it requires the wisdom of Solomon to sort
out who crooked more,' says one political insider.
Perhaps, fortuitously, the manifold irregularities experienced in polling
and counting truly cancelled each other out; perhaps more overt manipulation
was applied to the result. For there is such a neat parallel between what
was supposed to happen, and what did happen, that one can be forgiven for
wondering whether it is not the result of a serious intervention.
But South Africans do not seem to care. The political parties have decided
that it does not matter 'who crooked more'; the consensus view is that the
South African people have spoken, and none dare gainsay that accepted truth.
For, after all, things could have been so much worse.

FT  07 MAY 94 / China tries to reassure nervous Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lu Ping, China's top official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, yesterday
sought to reassure the colony that it would not be overrun when Chinese
sovereignty is resumed in 1997.
Mr Lu delivered a stern warning to Hong Kong about involving itself in
China's political affairs, and told the colony to concentrate on its role as
a bridge between China and the world.
Mr Lu, on his first visit to Hong Kong since January 1992, stressed the 'one
country, two systems' concept formulated by Deng Xiaoping, China's senior
leader, more than a decade ago which provides for the maintenance of Hong
Kong's way of life for 50 years after China's resumption of sovereignty in
1997.
Mr Lu's comments appeared to be directed towards his Communist party
colleagues as much as Hong Kong and international opinion. The New China
news agency, China's unofficial embassy in the colony, has been associated
with a tougher line on Hong Kong, advocating that because political talks
with Britain had collapsed all previous agreements with the UK could be
overturned.
Mr Lu emphasised that Hong Kong under Chinese sovereignty would be ruled
according to the law. He said the Basic Law for Hong Kong would be obeyed to
the letter.
The central government would also closely regulate the activities of
mainland entities in Hong Kong. 'No department or province will be allowed
to interfere in the internal affairs of Hong Kong and this should be made
known to everybody, starting from now,' he said.
Mr Lu also had some tough words for the 'handful' who thought they could
turn Hong Kong into a 'political city' in order to influence politics on the
mainland. This would be disastrous for Hong Kong, he said.

FT  07 MAY 94 / South African Elections: Newly-formed regions prepare to
flex their muscles - Mark Suzman predicts tussles for power with the
national government as regional administrations try to assert themselves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Estate agents are warning that house prices in Cape Town are about to
rocket. The reason? The National party scored its one election triumph in
the Western Cape and the view is that whites fleeing black rule elsewhere
will boost the region's property sector.
Such a response is one indication of the way the country's new regional
structures might affect the shape of national policy.
The nine new regional parliaments, which sit for the first time today, mark
as big a change from the past as the new national order. They replace four
old provinces - the former Afrikaner republics and British colonies which
became the Union of South Africa. .
Now, the new regions are striving to create a distinctive identity while
portraying themselves as dynamic, stable growth spots that are well
positioned to attract foreign investment and government resources.
This is where the Western Cape, under the premiership of Mr Hernus Kriel, is
likely to try to flex its muscles. The National party will be hoping to make
the Cape - one of two regions without a black African majority - a showcase
of economic growth and stability.
The region has a diverse economic base and strong growth potential in its
big industries of agriculture and tourism. Cape Town's proposed facelift in
preparation for a bid to become South Africa's candidate for the 2004
Olympics will also strengthen its hand, although a housing shortage and
infrastructural problems may restrain real growth.
But as the regions prepare for a new era, it is unclear just how much power
they will have.
In four years of tortuous negotiations leading to all-race elections, the
most contentious issue was federalism. The final constitution allowed each
region significant powers including authority over health, education and
limited tax-raising powers.
The central government reserves the right to intervene on almost any issue -
but the terms are vague. Its rights will almost certainly be tested in the
new constitutional court. Although final power resides in the national
assembly, some strong local governments might swing the balance the other
way.
In the likely tussles between central and regional government, it is
possible that Mr Kriel and Mr Frank Mdlalose, the Inkatha Freedom party
premier of KwaZulu/Natal - the only other province without an ANC majority -
might find an unlikely ally in Mr Tokyo Sexwale. Mr Sexwale is the
charismatic ANC leader of the region of Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging.
Mr Sexwale, a former guerrilla leader who enjoys widespread support among
the radical youth, will assume control over the wealthiest and most densely
populated of the nine provinces. Containing the cities of Pretoria and
Johannesburg and a string of other industrial towns, the region generates
about 39 per cent of South Africa's gross domestic product and an even
larger proportion of its tax base.
The province fears being treated as the country's milch cow to fund
development projects in other regions. Mr Sexwale has only a slim majority
in the regional assembly and he may feel compelled to resist government
attempts to take funds from the region in favour of addressing local needs.
He has acknowledged that central government should exercise 'critical
powers', but Mr Sexwale has also indicated a willingness to protect local
interests if necessary - a stand that the ANC's national leadership would
find difficult to overrule.
Mr Patrick 'Terror' Lekota, the articulate ANC premier of the Orange Free
State, is likely to test the limits of his power, and he will be hoping to
use the post as a vehicle to higher office.
The desperately poor Eastern Cape is also a potential source of friction. As
the former home region of both Mr Nelson Mandela and Mr Thabo Mbeki it will
be expecting tangible rewards for its position in the forefront of the
struggle against apartheid. If they are not forthcoming, regional leader Mr
Raymond Mhlaba will have a hard task juggling his local and national
responsibilities.
The other regions are unlikely to spring any surprises. In the poor
provinces of the north-west, the Northern Transvaal, and the Eastern
Transvaal, the ANC has an overwhelming majority and local leadership will
cheerfully submit to national policy in the hope of gaining development aid.
But an outstanding problem for the regions is that none of their borders has
yet been finalised. There is even speculation that Eastern Cape may be
divided in two. In the sparsely populated Northern Cape, the ANC has
narrowly failed to secure a majorty, gaining 50 per cent of the vote.
Outstanding disputes, which will be adjudicated over the next few months,
will be further complicated by the proposed negotiations for an undefined
white homeland that could include portions of several regions.

FT  07 MAY 94 / South African Elections: Mandela delights whites and
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nelson Mandela does not miss a trick. Despite opposition from within his
own African National Congress, he yesterday delighted investors, businessmen
and white South Africans by retaining Mr Derek Keys as the finance minister.
Nothing else would have persuaded the outside world - not to mention
sceptical South Africans - of his commitment to free market economics and
political moderation. Again and again, Mr Mandela has stressed the need to
restore business confidence and attract foreign investment. Yesterday he
took the most concrete step possible toward achieving those goals.
In the two years since he was appointed finance minister by outgoing
President F W de Klerk, Mr Keys has proved a tough fiscal disciplinarian. He
has halted the rise in government spending, and reined in the budget
deficit. And best of all, he has amply demonstrated that he is his own man,
and no politician's fool. He would not have accepted the post of finance
minister in an ANC-led government without assurances from Mr Mandela that
economic discipline would be maintained.
He realises the importance of leaving the department, the portfolio, of
finance as it is - without interference,' said the pragmatic Mr Mandela in
Cape Town, flanked by his two new deputy presidents, Mr Thabo Mbeki of the
ANC and Mr De Klerk.
The other central economic post, governor of the Reserve Bank or central
bank, will also be unchanged: monetary disciplinarian Mr Chris Stals will
remain as governor when his term ends in July.
The moderate tone established with the re-appointment of Mr Keys will be
further strengthened by the news that Mr Thabo Mbeki is to be first deputy
president, effectively Mr Mandela's prime minister and probably his
political heir. Mr Mbeki has long represented the acceptable face of the ANC
to the business community, at home and abroad; he has served as unofficial
ambassador to white South Africa since the early 1980s, when secret contacts
began between the ANC and liberal Afrikaners.
Whites know and like him; articulate, well educated, urbane and charming, he
soothes their fears.
Few other candidates could have put such a conciliatory stamp on the
cabinet. Mr Mbeki's chief rival for the post of deputy president, Cyril
Ramaphosa, is a brilliant strategist and fearsome political negotiator. He
would have been tougher, but perhaps not better. Mr Ramaphosa has opted to
remain outside the cabinet, working to strengthen the ANC as party secretary
general. This is exactly the post he always said he wanted; but no one
believed him, suspecting he had higher political ambitions.
Apart from these certainties, some posts remain unfilled. The ANC has said
there will be six National Party ministers, but has named only one (Mr
Keys); and it has not named the three Inkatha Freedom Party ministers due to
be appointed to the government of national unity. Somehow, Inkatha Freedom
Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi must be accommodated in a post which
acknowledges his surprisingly strong electoral showing: 10.5 per cent of the
national vote. Easily offended, his pride must be assuaged; this will not be
an easy task.
There are also some wildcards, and some weaknesses, in the remaining ANC
appointments. Mr Jay Naidoo, appointed minister without portfolio, is
expected to oversee the ANC's reconstruction and development programme,
though it is not clear how much power he will have over finance minister Mr
Keys. Mr Mandela has made abundantly clear that he will brook no opposition
from anyone on implementing the programme - apparently including Mr Keys.
There could yet be conflict, when the programme's goal of black uplift
inevitably clashes with the need for fiscal discipline.
One notable weakness is foreign minister Alfred Nzo, former ANC secretary
general, who was replaced three years ago, partly because of poor
performance. He will do little to raise South Africa's international
profile.
Both police and defence have gone to the ANC, leaving the National Party
with no important security portfolio, although Mr Mandela has said he is
prepared to amend the cabinet list after consultation with Mr De Klerk.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norway announced yesterday it would formally adopt a floating rate currency
policy, marking a shift from a long held target of re-establishing a fixed
rate for the domestic currency, Karen Fossli reports from Oslo. The krone
was de-linked from the European Currency Unit on December 10 1992.
The aim of the move is to stabilise the krone against European currencies at
around current levels and is a formalisation of practices undertaken since
last spring.
The krone yesterday traded about 5 per cent below its former central rate
against the Ecu.
Should Norway join the European Union, however, it intends to take part in
European monetary arrangements and the parity grid. Norway will hold a
referendum in November on membership of the EU.

<TEXT>
Turkey's economic prospects brightened yesterday after parliament passed
passing laws on tax and privatisation, the twin pillars of the government's
bid to cut its deficit, John Murray Brown writes from Istanbul.
The privatisation law, passed late on Thursday, gives the cabinet powers for
three months to sell off state companies by decree. The austerity programme
unveiled by Prime Minister Mrs Tansu Ciller envisages revenues of Dollars
3.5bn in 1994 from state asset sales.
The new tax charges, which have still to be approved by President Suleyman
Demirel, comprise a one-off wealth tax based on net assets of companies and
individuals. Officials estimate the tax will realise revenues of TL70,000bn.

Colombia's constitutional court has overturned existing legislation and
decriminalised the use of some drugs, including marijuana and cocaine,
Sarita Kendall reports from Bogota. Despite strong criticism from the
government and many sectors of society, the decision is expected to become
official next week. The production, distribution and sale of drugs remains
illegal.
President Cesar Gaviria warned that the decision could lead to worse
violence and said he hoped the court would leave room for congress to limit
drug consumption in schools and public places.
Horrified parents and teachers have been calling in to local radios to
protest.

response to the FFr18.5bn (Pounds 2.2bn) sale of the state's stake in Union
des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the insurance group, Alice Rawsthorn writes
from Paris.
The public part of the privatisation of UAP, the biggest insurer in France
and the second largest in Europe, attracted applications from 1.9m
individuals for 2.5 times the number of shares available, according to the
economy ministry.
Paribas, the bank in charge of the institutional part of the issue, said
that tranche had been four times subscribed.

The United Nations Security Council yesterday unanimously ordered a
near-total blockade of Haiti in a renewed bid to oust the country's military
leaders and restore president Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power, Michael
Littlejohns reports from the United Nations in New York.
But the Council also gave members of the junta 15 days to avoid the measures
by observing last summer's Governors' Island Agreement, on which they
reneged. Lieutenant-General Raoul Cedras had agreed to step down as
commander-in-chief last October 15 in preparation for Mr Aristide's return.
The new embargo would extend an existing ban on oil and arms shipments to
include all trade except food and medicines. It would also freeze Haitian
assets abroad.

<TEXT>
Russia is to present an alternative 'Partnership for Peace' plan at a
meeting on May 24 in Brussels between General Pavel Grachev, the Russian
defence minister, and Nato leaders.
The move threatens to create a rift between the Nato alliance and Russia.
The former has made clear that the partnership, aimed at bringing former
Communist states into association with Nato, is open to all on equal terms
only, while Russia wants a special status.
Gen Grachev said yesterday that 'none of the (Nato) structures have the
right to subordinate those of the Conference of Security and Co-operation in
Europe. None can avoid taking Russia's interests into account - as the case
of Bosnia showed. What is being presented (in the partnership) is not quite
acceptable to us. We came to the conclusion - why shouldn't we present our
own proposal?'
A draft of the Russian version of the partnership is to be ready in a week
for approval by President Boris Yeltsin before being unveiled in Brussels.
Gen Grachev said the Russian version could be called the 'Pragmatic
Partnership' - echoing the phrase used by Mr William Perry, the US defence
secretary, of the US-Russian relationship.
However, Mr Ashton Carter, assistant US defence secretary, said in Moscow on
Thursday: 'There is no room for a special mechanism. I hope Gen Grachev will
not bring with him such conditions.'
The defence minister sounded a more threatening note on negotiations on
troop withdrawals from Estonia, the latest round of which are now going on.
In a clear hint that the 2,500 troops in the country could be augmented, he
said: 'The problem is reliable guarantees to provide normal human rights to
the Russian-speaking population there. If the talks continue to drag on
without results,the 2,500 troops we have there will stay. And if
circumstances should change it won't take long for us to provide reliable
security for Russian military bases in Estonia.'
The withdrawal date for all Russian troops has been set at August 31.
Russian troops have already withdrawn from Lithuania and an agreement to
withdraw those based in Latvia was signed last month.
Gen Grachev's comments revealed both the opportunities and the tensions in
the Russian military's relationship with the west - a relationship deepened
by two days of talks between senior Russian and US officials in Moscow on
Wednesday and Thursday.
Following the talks, Mr Carter, who led the US side, said that the two
former adversaries had informed each other of strategic and other issues
with an unprecedented degree of openness - and that they would now extend
this policy of glasnost into hitherto forbidden zones such as the number of
warheads and the storage of fissile materials.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Debate over arrest of paradoxical Spaniard: Can the austere
Mariano Rubio really be a fraudster?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A scapegoat or the most prominent fraudster in the country? Thursday's dawn
arrest of Mr Mariano Rubio, the former governor of the Bank of Spain and now
an inmate of Madrid's sprawling Carabanchel prison, has unleashed a heated
national debate.
The arrest, the first in connection with the spate of scandals that has
engulfed the Spanish government, took place hours before Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez dismissed calls for his resignation and promised in a press
conference to root out corruption.
The arguments reflect the contradictions that surround the haughty and
academic Mr Rubio. Not least among the paradoxes is the fact that the
63-year-old, who is formally accused of tax evasion and falsifying public
documents, is already familiar with the ritual of checking into Carabanchel.
He went through the routine of strip body search, head shot photographs,
finger printing, removal of trouser belt and shoe laces in 1956, when he was
he was linked to a clandestine socialist group at Madrid University's
economics faculty and sentenced to two years' jail by the Franco
dictatorship.
The security police who arrested him nearly 40 years ago, and severely beat
him up, were commanded by his own father, who was an army colonel. It was
just as ironic that, although an atheist as well as a left-winger, he was
subsequently released when General Franco marked the accession of Pope John
XXIII with a partial amnesty.
But the main contradiction about the disgraced Mr Rubio is that he was a
role model for those committed to professionalism, austerity, decency and
democracy. Mr Juan Tomas de Salas, who faced similar reprisals under
Francoism and went on to become a campaigning newspaper editor, recalls that
Mr Rubio even refused to take up soft mortgage loans offered by the Bank of
Spain when he started work in the institution's research department.
It is alleged that at the very time Mr Rubio consolidated his reputation as
an outstanding public servant he was allegedly keeping from the taxman a
Pta130m (Pounds 644,000) share portfolio that was managed by his lifelong
friend and broker Mr Manuel de la Concha.
A one-time chairman of Madrid's stock exchange, Mr de la Concha was arrested
along with Mr Rubio and the two now share a cell.
As deputy governor of the Bank of Spain between 1977 and 1984 and then
governor until 1992, Mr Rubio steered the financial system though a banking
crisis, subtly encouraged banking mergers and consolidated a renewed
financial sector by demanding strict solvency ratios and ordering regular
inspections.
A paragon of economic orthodoxy, he regularly chastised the government for
its spending and successfully lobbied for the peseta's 1989 entry into the
exchange rate mechanism of the EMS, to force budgetary discipline on his
political masters.
'Whatever his private dealings were, Rubio was one of the greatest governors
the Bank of Spain has ever had,' says Mr Jorge Hay, a senior executive at
Banco Central Hispano and a student colleague of the former governor.
In an interview published by ABC newspaper yesterday Mr Rubio insisted he
was unaware of having evaded taxes.
His lawyers, petitioning for his release, say he is the victim of
discrimination because the tax he is alleged to have evaded - Pta6.1m - is
well below a revised Pta15m level which the authorities plan to establish as
the threshold for pressing criminal charges.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Israeli right-wing backlash spreads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An Israeli backlash against the Palestinian self-rule accord intensified
yesterday as right-wing politicians denounced the possible return of
hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees and farmers complained about
the costs of the economic agreement.
Right-wing members of the Knesset (parliament) criticised the government
after Israeli and Palestine Liberation Organisation officials said they
would start negotiating the first significant right of return for
Palestinians who fled in the 1967 Six Day War. Israel says up to 200,000
could be eligible to return but the PLO says the figure is much higher.
The right-wing opposition Likud party said the return of Palestinian
refugees would lead to a demographic disaster. The Tsomet party called for
new elections.
Mr Rehavam Zeevi, leader of the Moledet opposition party, said: 'After the
return of the 1967 refugees there will be a return of the 1948 refugees and
later the return of Jews to their countries of origin.'
The Israeli right wing, marginalised by the self-rule agreement, wants to
mobilise a sceptical public to prevent the government from making further
concessions to the PLO.
On the economic front, protected Israeli farmers who will face competition
from cheaper Palestinian producers for the first time since 1948 called for
urgent talks with the Finance Ministry. Israeli manufacturers also warned
that they would lose Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 960m) in sales over three years
as a result of losing market share in the self-rule areas. The association
said 9,000 jobs would be lost.
The PLO continues to make plans for its delayed deployment of Palestinian
police in the Gaza Strip and West Bank enclave of Jericho. In Tunis Mr
Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, was also trying to finalise his list of
appointments for the 24-man national authority which will govern
Gaza-Jericho.
The delay in appointing the national authority is slowing the transfer of
power from Israeli to Palestinians hands, but is likely to be extremely
controversial in the occupied territories, where a power struggle for
positions is already under way.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Japan withdraws atrocity claim

<TEXT>
Mr Shigeto Nagano, Japan's justice minister, yesterday withdrew his claim
that an infamous Japanese atrocity never happened. But his unconvincing
retraction prompted fresh calls for his resignation.
Mr Nagano's claim, that the 1937 massacre of Nanking was a fabrication, has
angered China, South Korea, and other neighbours, throwing a shadow over
Japan's recent statements of regret for the war. The massacre was an
'undeniable fact' said Mr Nagano yesterday, in a stilted apology, restricted
to the wording of an earlier government statement.
He even failed to impress his own coalition ally, Komeito, the clean
government party. Mr Yuichi Ichikawa, Komeito's secretary general, said this
'does not release him from the need to take the responsibility as a cabinet
minister'. The Social Democratic party, Japan's second largest opposition
group, said the retraction did not end the matter and he should step down.
China yesterday sought to calm the row when President Jiang Zemin told a
visiting Japanese politician that he wanted to develop friendship with Tokyo
'while keeping in mind the past as an admonition for the future', said
officials.
However, the South Korean foreign ministry summoned the Japanese ambassador,
to ask Tokyo to explain its position on Japan's war record. A war victims'
association burned an effigy of Mr Nagano outside Japan's Seoul embassy, and
demanded his resignation.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the new prime minister, is understood to be furious over Mr
Nagano's remarks and the diplomatic damage they have caused.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Civil war threatens to redivide Yemen: Eric Watkins in Sanaa
explains why politics and religion have torn the recently united country
apart
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The outbreak of civil war in Yemen has all but put paid to the country's
aspirations to become a unified, democratic and modern state. Instead, there
are fears that prolonged fighting between rival northern and southern
factions could lead to the establishment of two or more Yemens, or to
complete fragmentation.
This week's fighting is primarily the outcome of growing economic disarray,
and of irreconcilable political aims which have marred the union of north
and south contrived nearly four years ago.
The leaders of the two Yemens, General Ali Abdullah Saleh for the north and
Mr Ali Salem al-Beidh for the south, each had good reason to enter the
union.
With the collapse of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, Mr Beidh and his
Yemen Socialist party were in a highly exposed position.
Having supported Marxist incursions into Afghanistan, Ethiopia and
neighbouring Oman, Mr Beidh and his political partners were isolated from
the rest of the Arab community and, with the example of the Ceausescu regime
in Romania before them, faced a sudden end to their political careers.
Foreign debts of some Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.4bn) and few sources of revenue
added to the southerners' precarious position.
In the north, Gen Saleh was also having problems. Although he had provided a
stable regime for some 10 years, the parliament elected in 1988 was already
beginning to launch investigations into his government and, not least, was
demanding greater democratic freedom for itself and the people in general.
The north's debts were lower and its assets greater, especially because of
oil production begun under Gen Saleh, but its economy was beginning to
falter from high imports and a drop in remittances from expatriate workers
in the Gulf.
The union of south and north Yemen on May 22 1990 was thus a marriage of
convenience involving two sickly economies, dressed up for popular appeal
with promises of democracy.
Yemen's Gulf war stance contributed to its descent into civil war. While
condemning the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Yemen likewise condemned the US-led
coalition and called for negotiations within a purely Arab context.
Stung by such lacklustre support from their impoverished neighbours, Saudi
Arabia quickly changed its residency rules in September 1990, forcing nearly
1m Yemenis to leave the country.
The sudden decline in remittances and the simultaneous needs of so many
extra people were disastrous for Yemen's economy. A year later, the Yemeni
riyal was trading at 37 to Dollars 1, a drop of nearly 200 per cent over its
pre-war value. Today it trades at 78 to Dollars 1.
Political in-fighting has been the chief cause of Yemen's conflict. Almost
from the outset of unification, Yemen found itself plagued by a series of
unexplained assassinations and attempted murders. Ominously, most of the
targets were Mr Beidh's political associates. Repeatedly, the socialists
demanded stronger security measures and determined efforts to catch and
punish the assassins. The Saleh regime turned a blind eye to the problem
and, as it did so, the southerners became increasingly convinced of its
determination to see them liquidated.
Elections on April 27 1993 also convinced Mr Beidh and his party of Gen
Saleh's intentions to marginalise them in the government. Within days the
fundamentalist Islah party began to demand a greater role in government
because of its performance at the election. The socialists grudgingly
yielded and, together with Gen Saleh's General Peoples' Congress, entered
into a coalition with Islah.
The new coalition had no sooner been formed than Islah leaders, with the
apparent approval of Gen Saleh, began to demand a repeal of
socialist-sponsored legislation. Fearing the gradual erosion of his party's
position and the potential annexation of the entire south as a result, Mr
Beidh left Sanaa in August 1993, vowing not to return.
In September 1993 he issued an 18-point programme of national reform as a
condition of his return to Sanaa. Though Gen Saleh and Mr Beidh eventually
signed the agreement last February the document has never been implemented,
nor is it ever likely to be.
The crisis turns on many factors, not least last year's parliamentary
elections. Few in Yemen accept the results as genuine, citing many abuses in
the electoral proceedings before, during and after the vote. As the editor
of one newspaper recently wrote, they were 'make-believe elections'.
But Gen Saleh and his political allies claim to have won a legitimate
mandate and, with it, the right to use military force to preserve the unity
forged four years ago.
Mr Beidh does not accept Gen Saleh's claim to legitimacy, seeing it as a
ploy to annex the south and to impose his will by force over the entire
nation.

FT  07 MAY 94 / W Europe new car sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
West European new car sales fell in April by 1.2 per cent to 1.08m according
to provisional figures released yesterday by the European Automobile
Manufacturers Association (Acea) and the Spanish motor industry federation,
writes Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent.
The fall was the first year-on-year decline this year and has halted, at
least temporarily, the fragile recovery in west European new car demand,
which started in the first quarter.
In the first four months of the year new car sales in west Europe of around
4.29m were 2.7 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year ago.
The fall in registrations last month was caused chiefly by a sharp drop of
around 12.4 per cent year-on-year in new car sales in Germany, which fell to
an estimated 298,000 according to Acea.

Mr Nagano's claim, that the 1937 massacre of Nanking was a fabrication, has

The massacre of Nanking was an 'undeniable fact' said Mr Nagano yesterday,
in a stilted apology, restricted to the wording of an earlier government
statement.
He even failed to impress his own coalition ally, Komeito, the clean
government party. Mr Yuichi Ichikawa, Komeito's secretary general, said this
'does not release him from the need to take the responsibility as a cabinet
minister.' The Social Democratic Party, Japan's second largest opposition
group, said Mr Nagano's retraction did not end the matter and he should step
down.
China yesterday sought to calm the row when president Jiang Zemin told a
visiting Japanese politician that he wanted to develop friendship with Tokyo
'while keeping in mind the past as an admonishment for the future,' said
officials.
However, the South Korean foreign ministry summoned the Japanese ambassador,
to ask the Tokyo government to explain its position on Japan's war record. A
war victims' association staged a demonstration outside Japan's Seoul
embassy, in which they burned an effigy of Mr Nagano and demanded his
resignation.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the new prime minister, is understood to be furious over Mr
Nagano's remarks and the diplomatic damage they have caused. He is expected
to discuss with cabinet colleagues how to respond after his return from a
European tour on Sunday.
The row shows the difficulties Japan faces in trying to confront its wartime
responsibilities, where it lags far behind Germany in voicing official
regret for the past.
This accounts for one of the largest cracks in Japan's national consensus.
Reform-minded politicians on left and right, including the conservative Mr
Hata, believe that heartfelt apologies for the war are a key to improving
Japan's international credibility.
The traditionalist right wing does not accept Chinese accounts of the war
and believes former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa went too far, last
year, in making the most explicit apologies to date.

Hungary's governing conservatives are resorting to increasingly desperate
measures to ward off the widely predicted return to power of the former
communists - now the Hungarian Socialist party - in parliamentary elections
tomorrow, Nicholas Denton and Chrystia Freeland write from Budapest.
A leading conservative official warned of a far-right backlash if the
Socialists dominate the next government and, as the conservatives fear,
impose controls on the media.
'If the Socialists establish a monopoly, there would be a civil war,' Mr
Ferenc Kulin, leader of the parliamentary group of the governing Hungarian
Democratic Forum, said.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Mandela creates cabinet for unity: Thabo Mbeki chosen as
first deputy but finance ministry left unchanged as ANC fails to win
two-thirds majority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nelson Mandela yesterday appointed South Africa's first government of
national unity within hours of final figures confirming that his African
National Congress had won 62.65 per cent of votes cast in last week's
general election.
Mr Thabo Mbeki, widely admired as a pragmatic politician and an experienced
diplomat, was chosen as the country's first deputy president, making him the
likely successor to the 75-year-old Mr Mandela. Mr F W de Klerk, the
National party president, will be the second deputy president.
And in a powerful message to the business community and to foreign
investors, Mr Mandela said he would retain Mr Derek Keys, a member of the
National party, in his post as finance minister, despite opposition from
within the ANC.
Speaking in Cape Town, a conciliatory Mr Mandela who will be installed as
South Africa's first black president on Tuesday, acknowledged the need to
reassure both business and the white community. 'We realise the importance
of leaving the portfolio of finance as it is - without interference,' he
said.
The ANC emerged as overwhelming victor in the national vote, but fell short
of the two-thirds of the popular vote it needed to write a constitution
without the agreement of other parties.
It also failed to win in KwaZulu Natal province, where the Inkatha Freedom
party gained 50.32 per cent of the vote, and a one-seat majority in the
81-member provincial assembly.
Inkatha's victory in Natal, which local ANC officials have blamed on fraud,
will help counterbalance the ANC's power at national level.
The ANC's victory was also tempered by failure to emerge as the largest
party in the Western Cape, where the National party was the winner.
However, Mr Mandela said he was relieved that his party's runaway win
stopped short of the two-thirds majority 'because already tensions were
building up that we were now going to write our own constitution.'
The election was certified free and fair by the body charged with conducting
the poll, the Independent Electoral Commission, despite widespread evidence
of irregularities. Judge Johann Kriegler, IEC chairman, said the election
had been 'flawed' but added: 'The heart of the matter is that we were able
to establish the expressed will of the people with reasonable accuracy'.
Nationally, the National party won 20.39 per cent of the vote, lower than
expected but above the psychological threshold of 20 per cent needed to
establish the party as a substantial force in the government. It is likely
to have six ministers in the 27-member cabinet. Inkatha will have three.
However, the crucial question of which cabinet portfolio would be allocated
to Inkatha leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, remained unanswered last
night.
Most of the remaining cabinet posts are expected to be filled by members of
the ANC although last week Mr Mandela hinted that he would include
representatives of the radical Pan Africanist Congress, and the liberal,
mainly white Democratic party which won 1.25 per cent and 1.73 per cent of
the vote respectively.
The choice of Mr Mbeki as first deputy president came after Mr Cyril
Ramaphosa, the former trade union leader who played a vital role in last
year's constitutional talks, declined a cabinet post. He had been tipped for
the post but opted to work to strengthen the ANC as party general secretary.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Surge in mortgage lending lifts housing recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A steep increase in the number and amount of mortgage loans approved in
March gave the most significant boost yet to signs of a recovery in the UK
housing market.
That growth should feed through into an increase in mortgage lending
actually undertaken, when the figures for lending by banks and building
societies in April are released later this month.
According to statistics published by the Bank of England yesterday, the
number of loans approved in March was 99,000, with a total value of Pounds
5.2bn. For the first quarter of this year, 260,000 loans worth Pounds
13.81bn were approved - a return to levels not seen since late 1991.
Total net mortgage lending in March amounted to Pounds 1.84bn, compared with
Pounds 1.51bn in February. Net lending in the first quarter of 1994 came to
Pounds 5bn - the highest since the first quarter of 1992.
Mr Adrian Coles, director general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML),
said the figures for net advances - 22 per cent higher in March than in
February - made it clear the housing market was genuinely recovering. 'Only
a reversal of the downward trend in interest rates or a major change in the
provision of income support for mortgage interest would be likely to
undermine this recovery,' he said.
The CML is concerned that the government is looking at further restricting
mortgage support, which currently costs Pounds 1.2bn.
Mr Philip Jenks, controller of mortgage lending at Halifax Building Society,
the UK's largest, said that the increase in activity had been spread pretty
evenly across the UK, but had been particularly encouraging in the
south-east of England.
He added that while a similarly sharp increase in mortgage loans approved
was unlikely in April, he expected the levels recorded in March to be
broadly sustained.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at stockbrokers UBS, said
the figures showed that the housing recovery had definitely arrived, but
that they could have been distorted somewhat by buyers' desire to take
advantage of the low fixed-rate mortgages.

FT  07 MAY 94 / US bonds hit by interest rate fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Signs yesterday that US economic growth is surging prompted heavy selling of
bonds and shares on Wall Street as analysts bet that the Federal Reserve
would shortly signal another interest rate rise.
In a turbulent market, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped more than
2 points, pushing the yield above 7.5 per cent to its highest level since
late 1992. Share prices also fell sharply, with the Dow Jones Industrial
Average closing down 26.47 at 3,669.50.
The trigger for heavy selling was a Labour Department report showing
employment had risen 267,000 in April and about 1m since the beginning of
the year - a much faster pace than expected in financial markets. But for
the distortions caused by a strike by the Teamsters' union, the April
increase would have been about 337,000. Revised figures showed a 464,000
gain in March.
The jobless rate was also down sharply - at 6.4 per cent last month against
6.7 per cent in January.
The figures suggest the economy this quarter may be growing at an annualised
rate of 4 to 5 per cent - faster than it can sustain in the long run. This
follows a temporary slowing to 2.6 per cent in the first quarter, reflecting
bad weather and other distortions.
Many analysts now regard an early increase in short-term interest rates as
all but inevitable. The betting is that the Fed will raise the federal funds
rate - the cost of overnight money for banks - by half a point to 4.25 per
cent. It may also raise the discount rate, the rate at which the Fed lends
to banks, by half a point to 3.5 per cent.
A half-point increase in rates after a series of quarter-point moves would
signal the Fed's resolve to prevent the economy from overheating.
It would also reinforce the Clinton administration's attempts to bolster the
dollar on foreign exchange markets. In a notable shift of emphasis, Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, Treasury secretary, said this week the administration saw 'no
advantage in a devalued currency'. Previously he had spoken only of the need
to calm disorderly markets.
The Fed had been expected to delay a rate increase until May 17, the next
scheduled meeting of its policy-making open market committee. But following
the jobs report and other stron-ger than expected economic data, an
announcement could come as early as next week.
On Wall Street, many traders were disappointed that the Fed had not acted
immediately in response to the April jobs figures. The selling of bonds
intensified after midday when it became clear that the Fed would not be
raising rates during that session.
The dollar rose during the morning in expectation of an interest rate rise,
but fell back later as the heavy losses on Wall Street stifled foreign
demand for dollar assets such as US stocks and Treasury bonds. In late New
York trading the dollar was down almost half a pfennig at DM1.6620 and
virtually unchanged against the yen at Y102.43.
Gains in employment in April were concentrated in construction, retail trade
and services - sectors depressed by bad weather at the beginning of the
year.

FT  07 MAY 94 / Major to fight any challenge to his leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major confronted head-on yesterday the growing threat to his
leadership as a shell-shocked Conservative party digested its worst
performance for more than 50 years in a nationwide election.
Confirmation of the government's rout in Thursday's local elections
intensified speculation at Westminster that a similar defeat in the June 9
European elections would spell the end of his premiership.
Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats celebrated the biggest gains in the
battle for 5,000 council seats contested across the country, adding 388 to
their previous total and claiming the party was now winning positive, rather
than protest, votes.
But Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said his party's strong showing in
once-Tory strongholds around London confirmed it was now poised to win the
next general election. The government held its flagship Wandsworth and
Westminster councils, but Labour now controls 17 of the capital's 32
boroughs against the Conservatives' four. Defeated in such bastions as
Tunbridge Wells, Basildon and Woking, the Conservatives had nationwide
losses of 429 seats.
The result in Scotland was still more damaging. The Conservatives were
driven into fourth place behind Labour, the Scottish National party and the
Liberal Democrats.
As the final results indicated the Tory share of the overall vote had
slumped to 27 per cent - the same as the Liberal Democrats - Mr John
Carlisle, a maverick Tory MP, said he was ready to stand in an autumn
leadership contest.
Other rightwing Conservatives said they had already collected the necessary
34 pledges from backbench colleagues to trigger such a contest.
But in a blunt warning that he would not be driven from office by opponents
in his own party, Mr Major said he would fight off any challenge. Speaking
outside 10 Downing Street before joining the Queen for the formal opening of
the Channel tunnel, he dismissed Mr Carlisle's threat.
The prime minister pledged a Conservative fightback in the poll for the
European Parliament and Mr Major predicted a backlash against his party's
dissidents during the campaign. It would not forgive 'anyone who stands on
the sidelines or utters a discordant note'.
Asked how he would respond to any challenge Mr Major responded briskly: 'If
anybody chooses to engage in that fight, they will find me standing there
waiting for them.' He added: 'I will meet a challenge whenever it comes.'
Cabinet colleagues sought to shore up the prime minister's position with
pledges to unite around the the Tory manifesto for the June 9 election.
Mr Michael Portillo, the rightwing Treasury minister at the centre of a
cabinet row this week over Europe, insisted there was no question of a drive
to oust Mr Major. Mr Michael Heseltine, regarded as the most likely
successor if Mr Major fell, also urged an end to leadership speculation.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 64% increase at Forward
Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forward Group, the specialist circuit board and chemicals manufacturer,
raised annual profits by 64 per cent, helped by the first contribution from
Central Circuits, a Telford-based company purchased from the receiver in
February 1993.
Over the 12 months to January 31, pre-tax profits improved from Pounds 1.23m
to Pounds 2.02m. Acquisitions contributed Pounds 5.6m to turnover which
jumped to Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 12.5m), and Pounds 595,000 to operating
profits of Pounds 2.23m (Pounds 1.44m).
The purchase of Central Circuits widened Forward's manufacturing base,
although it has temporarily taken the group closer to the mass market for
circuit boards and diluted turnover of its usual specialist low volume, high
value business.
Looking at the group's main markets, Mr Ray Chamberlain, chairman, said
there had been some improvement in the electronics industry, but that
telecommunications was more of a growth area than military business. The
group's business with medical customers was also growing.
Earnings per share rose from 11.06p to 16.71p. The proposed final dividend
is 3p, bringing the total to 5p (3.3p).

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Opposition parties vie for top battle
honours - Lib Dems see biggest net gain of seats / Labour does well in
London and holds firm in regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Both of the main opposition parties were entitled to wear a broad smile last
night in the aftermath of a result universally seen as a disaster for the
Conservatives.
The Liberal Democrats made by far the biggest number of net gains on the
night - more than 300.
But Labour did well in London - the key area for the party in terms of
demonstrating its ability to win the prize that really matters: the next
general election in 1996 or 1997.
Labour will also have been buoyed by the remarkable extent to which its
share of the vote outside London held up in comparison with the
exceptionally high level of 43.8 per cent the party attained in 1990.
All of this will have given chastened Conservative strategists plenty to
think about. But the most immediate concern to Tories will be the
unexpectedly strong Liberal Democrat showing - particularly in southern
England.
This augurs badly for the next electoral hurdle that the Conservatives must
somehow try to stumble across - June's elections to the European parliament
which will have a significant bearing on Mr John Major's prospects of
remaining party leader.
In this contest, the Liberal Democrats have high hopes of winning a swathe
of Tory-held seats in the south-west and central southern England. Last
night's results will have done nothing to dent their confidence - in spite
of the fact that relatively few councils in south-west England held
elections.
Where elections were held in the region - such as in Mr Chris Patten's
former parliamentary constituency of Bath - the Liberal Democrats performed
outstandingly.
While the Liberal Democrats had hoped to win control of the ancient city -
which they had never previously controlled - their success surpassed all
their expectations. They took seven seats from the Conservatives -
previously the largest party - but also all five seats being defended by
Labour, which now has an insignificant presence on the council.
For Labour, Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said that
last night's message was that Mr Major was presiding over a government that
was 'even more unpopular' than that of the Thatcher administration at the
height of the poll tax debacle.
'It looks as if outside London we are going to maintain our best result
ever,' he added. The country was sending the Tories a message that they
'have had enough'.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, focused on the party's success
in holding Birmingham, a prime Conservative target.
'The Tories told us to judge tonight's elections by whether or not they took
control of Birmingham,' she said. 'By those standards alone, tonight has
been a failure for the Tories.'
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr Charles Kennedy, the party president,
characterised the result as 'a big thumbs-up' for the party.
'This proves we have established our position as a national party, retaining
and winning control of councils and becoming the main challengers both to
the Conservatives and Labour in their heartlands,' he said.
Mr Archy Kirkwood, the Liberal Democrat chief whip, said that his party had
'replaced the Tories as the second party in local government'.
Last night, both main opposition parties could be forgiven their
self-congratulation.
If in the European elections the Liberal Democrats inflict a further mauling
on the Conservatives in their south-west English heartlands, they will seem
to be making the running.
But if Labour can resist the temptation to put the Liberal Democrats in its
sights, it may ultimately win the larger prize.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Jailed Nissan UK chief loses appeal plea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Hunt, the former Nissan UK managing director jailed for eight
years after being convicted of the largest corporation tax fraud in UK
history, yesterday lost his appeal against both conviction and sentence.
Three Court of Appeal judges upheld the majority verdict reached by the
trial jury last June convicting Mr Hunt of conspiring to cheat the Inland
Revenue of Pounds 55m.
The fraud involved Nissan UK, former importers of the Japanese cars, using
an intermediary company and false invoices to artificially increase freight
charges and so avoid corporation tax over a nine-year period.
The total loss to the Revenue, including interest, was Pounds 85m, making
the case the largest ever brought by the organisation.
The Court of Appeal rejected all arguments by Mr Hunt's lawyers against
conviction and refused to reduce his sentence. Giving judgment, Lord Justice
Stuart Smith said the eight-year sentence was 'not a day too long'.
He told Mr Hunt's lawyers: 'Those who indulge in fraud on anything like this
scale are playing for very high stakes. The potential profit is enormous,
the punishment if they are caught must be condign. It is inevitable that
those who are brought to justice face deterrent sentences.'
The judge said that Mr Frank Shannon, the former Nissan UK finance director
jailed for three years for cheating the Revenue, had been entitled to a
substantial discount to his sentence because he had admitted the charge
before the trial.
The failure of Mr Hunt's appeal opens the way for the Revenue to resume its
efforts to gain repayment of unpaid taxes from Nissan UK.
It is seeking repayment of up to Pounds 238m, which it claims is the
company's tax liability for a period of 17 years in which the company's
profits were understated.
The company has appealed against the Revenue's tax assessment, and this
appeal may be heard by the Special Commissioners of the Inland Revenue in
the second half of the year.

Shoppers may face further coffee price rises because of a surge on the
international market. A supply squeeze pushed prices up on the London
Commodity Exchange yesterday.
Prices on the July futures contract rose a further Dollars 17 a tonne to a
five-year high of Dollars 1,700. The increase this week alone is Dollars
134. The benchmark price has risen by more than 40 per cent so far this
year.

<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday closed WorldWide Theme
Travel, a tour operator that traded as WTT Flights and Leisure.
The company, based in the City of London, was expelled from the Association
of British Travel Agents last year. It specialised in travel to Spain,
Portugal and Malta. Customers now abroad will be able to continue their
holidays and passengers planning to fly abroad after midnight tomorrow will
be given refunds, the Civil Aviation Authority said.
Mr Keith Betton, Abta's head of corporate affairs, said it had received
hundreds of complaints from customers alleging irregular withdrawals from
credit cards, refunds which never arrived and pressure selling.
'They were a company that brought our industry and our association into
disrepute and we were not prepared for them to remain in membership any
longer,' he said.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Go-ahead likely soon for Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A government go-ahead within the next few weeks for a new television channel
for the UK looks increasingly likely, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The Independent Television Commission hopes to be able to take the decision
on Channel 5 at its meeting on May 16.
The government is pursuing what it sees as the ideal solution - setting up
Channel 5 using existing analogue technology without prejudicing in any
significant way the future of digital television.
Following a ministerial meeting last week, the Radio Regulatory Agency has
been asked to carry out further work to ensure that this is practicable. The
agency is being helped by NTL, the privatised former transmission and
engineering arm of the old Independent Broadcasting Authority.
It is believed NTL will report that a middle way is possible, although
compromises may be needed.
Three potential bidders have declared an interest in Channel 5 - NBC, the US
network, Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group and a consortium linking Time
Warner, MAI and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Building workers 'were cheated in Germany'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of British construction workers lured to German building sites by
promises of high wages have been left destitute after being cheated by
unscrupulous labour agencies and employers, the UK Building Employers
Confederation said yesterday.
In a single month this year, British consulates in Germany made arrangements
to ship home 150 construction workers in distress, the Foreign Office said.
The confederation claims many more workers are still stranded or trying to
make their way home unaided. Consulates will make travel arrangements and
help individuals trace friends and relatives who might pay for fares, but
they do not provide money. One 19-year-old Londoner was paid the equivalent
of Pounds 10 for four weeks grinding the surface of bricks in a German car
park before being dismissed for allegedly poor work, according to the
confederation. Conditions on the site were very poor.
A big rise in eastern German construction following the unification of the
country has increased demand for cheap labour, sucking in thousands of
temporary workers from eastern Europe, Turkey and Britain.
German construction workers, under the country's strict labour laws, are
much more costly than foreign workers, many of whom are uneducated or do not
speak German.
Mrs Elizabeth Bridge, the building confederation's director of taxation
services, said she was alerted to the scale of the problem after UK
construction workers requested information on how to reclaim German tax paid
on wages. They had been duped into accepting lower wages on the false
grounds that British authorities would repay the tax.
Many of the labour agencies advertising for bricklayers, plasterers and
scaffolders in British national newspapers are based in Belgium or the
Netherlands. Job seekers mostly are interviewed in bars or public places.
The agencies cannot operate legally in Germany itself.
Two brothers from Glasgow told how they were expected to live with nine
other workers in a hut on a building site without sanitation or electricity.

FT  06 MAY 94 / BZW to sue over collapsed group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BZW, the investment banking arm of Barclays, is likely to sue several other
parties over the collapse of the financial services group British &amp;
Commonwealth in 1990, Sir Peter Middleton, BZW chairman, said yesterday.
Sir Peter told Barclays annual general meeting that BZW would respond to
being sued by Ernst &amp; Young, administrators to B&amp;C, by issuing its own
writs. 'By the end of the process, quite a lot of people are going to be
sued,' he said.
Sir Peter said that BZW had received writs from Ernst &amp; Young because the
six-year limit on liability was about to expire. He said that the writs were
'completely unspecified' and BZW was unsure of what was being claimed.
He declined to say which companies BZW would sue, but it is thought that
other corporate advisers involved in B&amp;C's purchase of Atlantic Computers in
1988 - such as NM Rothschild, the merchant bank - could be sued.
The collapse of Atlantic in 1990 was one of the main factors which led to
the closure of its parent company. B&amp;C bought Atlantic for Pounds 407m but
was then forced to write off Pounds 550m against the investment.
Barclays, which was B&amp;C's biggest lender, wrote off Pounds 100m against
expected losses from its loans to B&amp;C in its 1990 accounts.
Sir Peter told the meeting that corporate advice was an area in which there
was an increasing amount of litigation but that BZW had controls to limit
the risk of losses from being sued.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Tories accused of delaying gas report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, yesterday accused the government of
delaying publication of a consultative report on the UK gas market for
electoral reasons.
The highly technical Department of Trade and Industry report was sent
yesterday to Mr John Major, the prime minister, and is expected to be
published on Monday.
In an indication of its political sensitivity, the report has been
circulated to senior cabinet ministers for comments on its attempts to
spread the benefits of de-regulation among consumers.
However, industry experts say it will be difficult to ensure that price cuts
are shared equally between large and small residential customers.
Mr Smith signalled that Labour would seek to make maxiumum political capital
out of the report by claiming at Commons question time that 12m people would
face higher gas bills as a result of de-regulation.
In angry exchanges, Mr Smith told the prime minister that 'delaying bad news
until after elections is the sort of behaviour which is bringing the
Conservative party into disrepute'.
Mr Major said there was no evidence to back forecasts of higher prices. He
said the Gas Consumers' Council had accused British Gas of 'scaremongering'
on the issue.
Mr Major said the consultative document would be published shortly and told
Mr Smith: 'You are taking a story and attempting to erect a scare to
frighten vulnerable people.'
He added: 'I suggest you have the grace to wait for that document.' He said
gas prices had fallen by more than 4 per cent in cash terms and 6.5 per cent
in real terms during the past year.
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the gas industry
regulator, warned last month that she would publish a revised version of the
consultative document if it was not released by today.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, originally promised
publication early this year.
Issues canvassed in the document include whether prices will rise and how
the poor and elderly will be assured continuing supplies.

FT  06 MAY 94 / CBI warns on pension reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry has warned that employers may abandon
salary schemes that link benefits to leaving salaries if the government
insists on implementing some of the main safeguards for occupational
pensions.
Mr Robbie Gilbert, director of employment affairs at the CBI, yesterday told
a pensions seminar that rules recommended by the Goode committee on
occupational pension law reform would raise costs significantly for
employers. He complained specifically of requirements for minimum member
representation on boards of trustees, an industry-funded compensation scheme
and most importantly, minimum solvency standards for schemes.
However, Mr Gilbert conceded that only 20 per cent of chief executives
surveyed by the CBI said they intended to switch to money purchase from
final-salary schemes if they 'looked likely to fall foul of a minimum
solvency standard'.
In money purchase schemes employers and employees contribute a set amount by
contractual arrangement and all funds are deemed to belong to the employee.
About 33 per cent of executives surveyed would increase scheme funding while
another 33 per cent said they would alter their investment strategy.
Because UK pension schemes invest an average of 80 per cent of assets in
equities,the introduction of a minimum solvency standard might prompt some
schemes to shift investment into lower-yielding gilts, increasing funding
costs.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Insurers face Dollars 16m claims on Senna's death
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Underwriters at the troubled Lloyd's of London and other insurers face
claims of at least Dollars 16m (Pounds 11m) following the death last weekend
of Ayrton Senna, the racing driver.
Increasing fears about the safety of some professional sports are also
expected to force up premiums for specialised personal accident cover.
Senna, a three-times Formula One world champion, died from injuries
sustained during the San Marino Grand Prix on May 1. He was covered against
death and injury by a personal accident policy, underwritten by insurance
companies and Lloyd's syndicates. Typically, policies cover annual income
and medical and other expenses.
Additional multi-million dollar insurance claims are also expected to emerge
on so-called 'death and disgrace' policies, which at least some of Senna's
sponsors are understood to have taken out to cover any loss of advertising
revenue and extra expenses resulting from his death or injury.
One of these policies is thought to provide cover of at least Dollars 5m. A
range of other companies also insured the value of endorsements - given by
Senna in return for a fee - to their products.
The personal accident payout looks likely to be the highest ever by insurers
for a sportsman and is expected to lead to a contraction in this highly
specialised corner of the insurance market.
Senna's death came just a day after that of fellow grand prix driver Roland
Ratzenberger at San Marino, and only a week after the death of another
sportsman, the boxer Bradley Stone. Stone collapsed last week hours after an
unsuccessful challenge for the British super bantamweight title.
Annual premium income from sports professionals' personal accident premiums
is estimated to amount to about Pounds 20m, of which between 10 per cent and
15 per cent is generated by racing drivers. Professional soccer players
account for up to 40 per cent of the total.
Previous heavy claims include Dollars 14m paid to an American footballer
paralysed after sustaining critical injuries.
'This is one of the largest personal accident losses of any sportsman,' one
broker said, predicting that rates could rise by up to 20 per cent.
Senna, who was widely regarded as one of the best and safest grand prix
drivers, is understood to have paid about Dollars 500,000 for a policy which
covered accident and medical expenses. For the personal accident element of
the policy, the basic rate of 0.75 per cent (of the sum insured) was at the
lower end of the range of rates charged to racing drivers.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Computer group bids to run Crest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoskyns, one of the UK's leading computer services companies, is to compete
with the London Stock Exchange to become the independent supplier of full
operational facilities for the Crest paperless share settlement system.
The Bank of England, which is overseeing the development phase of Crest, has
said there will be a role for an operator of the system. But it has not
spelt out whether that role is technological, administrative or both. The
Stock Exchange was rebuffed this week in its request for a significant
minority stake in Crest, but the Bank said there was a good case for
awarding it the operator's contract.
However, several groups of prospective Crest users have expressed concern
about appointing the exchange as operator, saying it may use its role to the
advantage of its own members.
It is thought that, in addition to Hoskyns and the exchange, potential
competitors for the Crest contract include American Telephone and Telegraph,
British Telecommunications and EDS.
Yesterday Hoskyns released results of a survey of 27 prospective Crest
shareholders showing that 19 of them preferred an independent operator or
staff of a newly formed CrestCo.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Russians taken for Dollars 5m ride: John Mason describes how
three businessmen, who were found guilty yesterday, set up a car fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three British businessmen were convicted yesterday of a multi-million dollar
fraud on a Russian automotive company which was trying to set up a
large-scale kit car assembly operation after the collapse of the Soviet
command economy.
The fraud, centred on the non-delivery of goods paid for in advance by the
Russian Autokam company, is seen by UK police and prosecutors as a prime
example of the vulnerability of emerging eastern bloc entrepreneurs to
outside exploitation.
At Portsmouth Crown Court Mr Alexander Mullins, a commodity broker, from
Chandler's Ford, Hampshire; Mr Malcolm Jennings, a motor dealer from
Bethersden, Kent; and Mr Charles Johnson, from Brentford, west London, were
all convicted of conspiring to defraud Autokam.
Mr Mullins was also convicted on five charges of stealing almost Dollars 5m
from the company. All three will be sentenced on May 27.
In 1990, Autokam, based 100 miles outside Moscow, was seeking to break into
the automotive market by assembling cars from parts imported from the west.
With strong political backing from the then Gorbachev-led government, the
company planned to build a large plant employing 740 people and using
western production techniques.
It intended importing parts from an established western manufacturer and
assembling them into complete vehicles. The bulk of the cars would then be
exported back to the west to earn hard currency.
Its directors had experience in tank and truck manufacture under the old
Soviet regime but little experience of operating in a market economy.
They also lacked the support previously offered by the Soviet state.
The Autokam directors also demonstrated considerable trust that a British
businessman's word was always his bond. This proved to be sadly misplaced.
Autokam's plans had begun to falter when their negotiations with western
manufacturers such as BMW foundered. The company's lack of production
experience meant no deal could be agreed.
Instead, in summer 1990, it turned to Mr Mullins, who was looking for
business opportunities in the emerging Russian market economy. He persuaded
Autokam to agree to purchase the parts for 1,000 kit cars for Dollars 5m.
The design of these cars had been carried out by the respected
Hampshire-based Rickman Brothers motor engineers. However, their cars were
hardly high-quality concepts. Their design involved grafting a glass-fibre
body on to a steel chassis with the engine and other mechanical parts
coming, second-hand, from obsolete Ford Escorts.
The Rickmans doubted the suitability of their car for such an enterprise but
Mr Mullins insisted the project was viable and bought their factory. He then
agreed a second contract with Autokam - to supply 100,000 car kits at a
price of Dollars 5,000 each.
Mr Mullins was the main perpetrator of the fraud. He was supported by Mr
Jennings, who became his technical adviser, and Mr Johnson, who was brought
in to provide financial advice.
The Russians paid the Dollars 5m for the first contract but their concerns
mounted. To allay these fears, the three men used a variety of fraudulent
devices, such as false accountancy reports and warranties, to persuade the
Russians they were complying with the contract.
All the Russians received for their Dollars 5m were 47 vehicles containing
second hand parts, such as wiring looms, bought from Belgian scrapyards and
passed off as new.
Increasingly suspicious, the Russians contacted a British solicitor who
contacted the police. The police handed the case over to the Serious Fraud
Office.
The experience left Autokam directors chastened, but not deterred, according
to the company's UK solicitor Mr Andrew Stacey. 'They lacked commercial
experience and perhaps had too much trust in those they were dealing with.
They have now learnt some valuable lessons,' he said.
In spite of the fraud, the company now assembles cars from parts
manufactured by Ford and has taken a substantial interest in Reliant, the
British motor manufacturer.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Supertram plan relaunched: Promoters seek government funding
for Pounds 112m west Midlands line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Promoters of a Pounds 112m plan for a 'supertram' in the west Midlands
yesterday relaunched their appeal for government funding.
Approval in next November's Budget, however, would still mean a delay of
four years in starting the service.
Centro, the west Midlands passenger transport executive, has formed a joint
venture with two private-sector companies to build a 13-mile tram link
between Wolverhampton and central Birmingham. This would form the first line
in a light rail network eventually expected to cover 125 miles.
The Midland Metro would be the third modern light rail system to be built in
the UK after similar projects in Manchester and Sheffield.
It has been delayed by pressure on government finances which have meant that
the Pounds 102m of public-sector funding has not been sanctioned. Approval
in November would means services could start in 1998, four years later than
originally planned.
The Midlands proposal is not only the furthest advanced of light projects in
the UK; it also involves the greatest transfer of risk to the private sector
and the largest private-sector contribution to a light rail project, said Mr
Bob Tarr, Centro director-general.
Centro's two private-sector partners, the John Laing construction group and
the Italian supplier of rail systems, Ansaldo Trasporti, would put Pounds
9.2m into the project in return for a 23-year operating concession including
a three-year construction period.
Centro is seeking a further Pounds 80m in UK public-sector finance and
Pounds 22m of European Union funds. The UK public-sector contribution will
comprise Pounds 40m of government grant and Pounds 40m raised by local
authority borrowing, though this also requires Treasury approval.
The line between Wolverhampton and Birmingham is expected to carry 15m
passengers in its first year, eventually rising to 18m. Mr Tarr claimed it
would prove 'a gold mine' for the operators.
Trams would run every six minutes and take 35 minutes to travel the complete
line at up to 47mph.
All the operating risks have been transferred to Laing and Ansaldo, the two
companies said. If the project does badly and they pull out, they forfeit a
Pounds 5m deposit to Centro. If 'super profits' are made on the line, a
share will also have to be paid to Centro.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Kenya eager to trumpet its economic reforms: Nairobi wants
to start a much-needed dialogue with private enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a year of dismantling state controls and untangling red tape, the
government of Kenya is hosting an investment conference in Nairobi today to
trumpet its economic reforms.
Mr Musalia Mudavadi, finance minister, does not anticipate a stampede of
foreign investors, but the conference might accomplish something more
useful: the start of a much-needed dialogue between businessmen and
government mandarins.
'We want to project Kenya's new image, but we also want to listen to the
needs of investors and their suggestions for further reforms,' Mr Mudavadi
says.
The liberalisation measures of the past year have radically changed the
operating environment for private enterprise.
Import licences have been scrapped. Almost all government controls on
foreign exchange transactions are gone. Exporters can keep their dollars and
multinationals can repatriate profits without restrictions. All price
controls, except those on petroleum products, have been dismantled.
As a result, business confidence in Kenya is returning. A majority of
multinationals polled by the East Africa Association say they have
significant investment plans. Exporters and bankers are thriving in the
newly deregulated environment, while local manufacturers have also taken
advantage of the devaluation of the shilling to export to neighbouring
countries. Kenya's exports rose by 15 per cent last year to Dollars 1.1bn
(Pounds 733m).
After two years in the doldrums, the Kenyan economy may show some stirrings
of growth in 1994. With Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya adopting converging
economic policies, central bankers are now discussing the convertibility of
their currencies to boost regional trade.
Mr Mudavadi is guaranteed an enthusiastic reception at the investors'
conference, if only because local businessmen know he needs all the support
he can get.
Inside government, the 33-year-old finance minister is fighting a formidable
coalition of anti-reformers who resent the loss of patronage and
opportunities for corruption his market-based reforms will fight.
'My fear is that the anti-reformers have so much to lose that they may go to
any lengths to sabotage Mudavadi and his plans,' says a foreign executive in
Nairobi. Having survived 18 difficult months in office, the young minister
faces challenges far greater than economic deregulation.
He must impose financial discipline on free-spending government ministries
and a bankrupt parastatal sector which are fuelling inflation and creating a
mountain of public debt. Kenya's annual inflation rate has risen above 50
per cent, while debt-servicing consumes 42 per cent of government
expenditures. This leaves little room for paying salaries, let alone
investing in Kenya's dilapidated infrastructure and social services.
Politically unpalatable choices lie ahead, including the firing of thousands
of civil servants in cities where one in three adults does not have a job.
Mr Mudavadi plans to raise government revenues by improving the collection
of import duties in the customs department. He is also trying to impose
'performance targets' on state corporations. But across the state sector,
managerial skills are in short supply.
Businessmen are advising Mr Mudavadi to tread cautiously: the scales are
still too finely balanced between progress and a political backlash against
reform. Mr Mudavadi, conscious of the fragility of his achievements, is not
crying victory yet.

Clinton would attend the inauguration on Tuesday of Mr Nelson Mandela as its
first black president, Reuter reports from Washington.
'Today I am announcing a substantial increase in our efforts to promote
trade, aid and investment in South Africa. Over the next three years, we
will provide and leverage about Dollars 600m,' Mr Clinton said. At a White
House ceremony attended by many prominent anti-apartheid activists,

FT  06 MAY 94 / Palestinians wait for taste of freedom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE GAZA STRIP
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The self-rule agreement has been signed and sealed, but for the 800,000
Palestinians in Gaza it will be several weeks before they get the first real
taste of freedom after more than 25 years of Israeli occupation.
As the second day of self-rule passed, Palestinians and Israelis woke up to
the fact that the Palestine Liberation Organisation is hopelessly
ill-prepared to take over the complex administrative and security functions
of running the townships of the Strip. Self-rule is more likely to trickle
than flood into Gaza.
According to Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, PLO chairman Yassir
Arafat has asked that Israel 'drag out' its withdrawal from Gaza and the
West Bank enclave of Jericho for at least three or four weeks while he
prepares details of the take-over. The PLO denied Mr Rabin's statement and
said it was ready to take over at once.
But it is clear the PLO is far away from being ready. Yesterday's expected
deployment of 1,000 Palestinian police in Gaza-Jericho has been postponed by
the PLO until next week.
The lack of planning on a more serious policy level was confirmed yesterday
by Mr Hassan Abu Libdeh, PLO official in charge of the 'Technical
Committees' supposed to have in place a full scheme for Palestinian control
over all services.
'We are not ready to receive authority,' he said yesterday. 'For example,
environmental questions are really new to us. It may take 3-6 months before
we are really ready.' Another official said the PLO was only really ready to
assume control over health.
Mr Arafat has yet to name the 24-member national authority which will govern
Gaza-Jericho as a de facto cabinet, let alone the key officials who will
move in and take over the 34 departments and 24,000 employees of the Israeli
military-run civil administration.
Many Palestinians said the problem lay with Mr Arafat's authoritarian style
of leadership, his inability to delegate and the tension between the
leadership in exile and Palestinian leaders who have emerged during the
seven-year uprising against Israeli rule. Institutions created at PLO
headquarters in Tunis and in the territories did not co-ordinate their
activities.
Delay in implementing the agreement will further erode Mr Arafat's fragile
support base. In Gaza, many Palestinians seemed disappointed and frustrated
at the few signs of immediate change in their lives.
'Are they here to take over or just to talk to the Israelis?' shouted one
man.
'We expected much bigger things to happen,' said another. Nobody knows if
things are really going to change or if the Israelis are really going to
leave.'
Israel continued yesterday to wind down its occupation in Gaza, completely
emptying the city's central prison and dismantling radio antennae. Some
prisoners were freed after they signed a document saying they supported the
peace process, while others were transferred to another prison in the Negev
desert.
But despite the snail's pace of implementing self-rule, many people in Gaza
still had hopes for the future. Low-key celebrations have been going on
since Wednesday's signing of the self-rule agreement, for the deportees and
Palestinian prisoners allowed home.
New graffiti painted overnight said: 'Our return to Palestine was a dream
and now it is the truth.'

FT  06 MAY 94 / Swedes 'vital to larger EU'
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HELSINKI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Enlargement of the European Union could be jeopardised if Swedes vote No in
their referendum, Mr Esko Aho, Finnish prime minister, warned yesterday.
His warning introduced fresh uncertainty into plans to admit Austria,
Finland, Sweden and Norway into the Union by January 1 1995. The Finnish
premier suggested that some of the existing 12 member states might refuse to
ratify the accession treaties for Austria, Finland and Norway if Sweden,
which will be a net contributor to the EU budget, declined to join. The
treaties must be ratified by all 12 EU member states.
Polls show solid support for EU membership in Austria and Finland, though
many remain undecided. In Sweden a well funded campaign coupled with an
unpopular government has left the outcome of the referendum in doubt.
Norwegians are seen as the most resistant to membership.
The Finnish government is in the middle of difficult internal negotiations
on the size of compensation to be paid to Finnish farmers who must
drastically reduce their producer prices to EU levels once Finland joins the
Union. The cost to the national budget is likely to be 10 billion markkaa
(Dollars 1.8bn), Mr Aho said.
Mr Aho's centre party is split over membership, because of its ties to the
farming lobby. But behind his remarks lies a broad concern about Finland
joining a future Union without Sweden, its large and wealthy neighbour. This
has led to divisions within the government about the timing of the Finnish
referendum.
Mr Aho said he favoured holding a referendum on the same day as Sweden, that
is some time after the Swedish general election in September.
But president Martti Ahtisaari said he supported an early Finnish referendum
before the Swedes vote. 'There is no question that our vote will have an
effect on others. If we vote Yes, we can do a favour for ourselves and a
service for Europe as well.'

FT  06 MAY 94 / Mitterrand rules out nuclear tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Mitterrand forecast yesterday that France would never again set
off test explosions of nuclear weapons, unless another major atomic power
broke the test moratorium which the French leader set in train two years
ago.
Mr Mitterrand reaffirmed that he would not allow nuclear tests during his
remaining year in the Elysee, and predicted that his successors would not
dare resume testing for fear of 'offending the whole world by relaunching
the nuclear arms race'.
Delivering a 90-minute discourse on his nuclear policy to France's military
establishment, Mr Mitterrand's statement was as much a challenge as
prediction to Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister who sat poker-faced
in front of him. Like most in the conservative government, Mr Leotard is
committed to at least re-examining the nuclear test issue once the socialist
president leaves office next May.
Indeed the president challenged the French military establishment to have
the 'talent and imagination' to keep France's atomic arsenal up to date by
simulating tests in laboratories rather than by setting off more explosions
in or under its Mururoa atoll in the south Pacific. The FFr10bn set aside
for nuclear test simulation in the defence spending programme for 1995-2000
gave it sufficient resources, Mr Mitterrand claimed.
Most French conservative defence experts believe that France still needs a
few more live tests, if only to calibrate laser, radiographic, and computer
techniques used in laboratory simulation.
But the president claimed France need not fear 'any nasty surprise' by
renouncing testing, and so setting an example to other near-nuclear
countries in the renegotation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty next year. The
US was the only nuclear power which could make gains relative to France,
because Washington had been working on simulating tests since the early
1960s, and Franco-American relations were sufficiently good that France had
nothing to fear from that quarter.
However, Mr Mitterrand yesterday showed himself a traditional gaullist in
every other aspect of nuclear power. A French president could not share the
decision to use nuclear weapons 'with any foreign authority', he said, and
that was why France had been right to leave Nato's integrated command in
1966 and to stay out. Eventually, Europe might be sufficiently united
politically for France to consider its vital national interests synonymous
with those of its European Union partners. But the pro-European president
implied that day was still distant.

FT  06 MAY 94 / PLO takes first steps in self-rule: Palestinian police tour
Gaza Strip as Israel vows never to return
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An advance team of Palestinian policemen toured police stations in the Gaza
Strip yesterday amid growing fears that the Palestine Liberation
Organisation (PLO) would not be able to implement swiftly the self-rule
agreement signed with Israel in Cairo on Wednesday.
Officials from the PLO yesterday denied that it was not ready to assume its
new powers under the Gaza-Jericho agreement, as suggested by Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, Israel's prime minister. But they said the full deployment of
Palestinian police would take at least a week longer than expected.
A party of 17 senior Palestinian police officers were escorted around the
coastal Strip in a convoy of heavily-armed Israeli police and army jeeps.
Israel also completed its evacuation of the Gaza central prison and
continued releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
The PLO said arrival of the first 1,000 police, who should have been in
place today, had run into 'technical problems' and they would not arrive
until next week.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, seeking to bolster Israeli
support for the peace process, vowed that the Jewish state would never
return to the Strip, packed with refugee camps and squalid townships which
have been in open revolt against Israel for the past seven years.
'There is no going back. We won't go back to Gaza, Gaza won't come back to
us,' he said.
However, instead of euphoria the mood of most Palestinians was
disappointment and suspicion of Israel's real motives. Three of the
best-known Palestinian leaders from the West Bank and Gaza - Mr Haidar
Abdel-Shafi, Mr Faisal Husseini and Mrs Hanan Ashrawi - expressed deep
reservations. Mr Husseini, PLO boss in the West Bank, said the agreement
should not have been signed until all remaining issues were finalised, and
Mrs Ashrawi said the accord fell short of Palestinian demands.
Israelis remained as sceptical as the Palestinians about the peace
prospects. An opinion poll published in Yediot Ahronot, the tabloid Hebrew
newspaper, showed that only 7 per cent of Israelis believed there was a very
high chance for peace. Sixty-two per cent said the chances for peace were
low or non-existent.
Two radical PLO faction leaders and Syria attacked the agreement as an
obstacle to Middle East peace. Mr George Habash, leader of the Marxist
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and Mr Nayef Hawatmeh, leader
of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said their fighters
would step up attacks against Israel but would initially exclude areas under
Palestinian self-rule.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (23): Much more than a physical
union - Maurice Druon, veteran French writer and politician, calls for a new
intimacy in UK-French relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAURICE DRUON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Nero began digging the Corinth Canal with a golden spade and Napoleon
the Third, in a silken tent, inaugurated the Suez Canal, they opened new
avenues between nations. Their feat went beyond the mere shortening of trade
routes; they narrowed the gulf between cultures.
In presiding over the opening of the Tunnel, Queen Elizabeth II and
President Francois Mitterrand will perform an act of parallel significance.
Now it is not two seas which are being connected but two land masses, two
countries.
This is a brilliant example of mankind's power over the elements. Equally
remarkable is political will power that brought it about.
The idea of uniting French and British soil has a long history. The two
lands were not always geographically separate. Some 10,000-12,000 years ago,
there was no sea between them. People could walk across, although with
frozen feet since this was the end of the last Ice Age.
Ten thousand years is an eternity in human terms, but a very short time in
the earth's history. Much nearer our time, some 3,000 years ago, France was
already a transit route for commodities from Britain. Cornish tin was
carried through Burgundy and down the Rhone Valley to be mingled with copper
from Cyprus in the bronze foundries of Crete. What a feat of haulage] I am
struck by it whenever I see a piece of ancient bronze.
The EU is not the first community to which we have belonged. Caesar and
Claudius shackled us with a first Treaty of Rome. It left us with our
straight highways, our French legal system and the small red bricks of
English villages.
The battle of Hastings was really only a family afffair between Norman
cousins. Had it not been for Joan of Arc, Henry VI would have ruled from
Paris and Britain would have been a French province.
For four and a half centuries France and England have quarreled like two
country landowners. Our fence was a wall of water. We carried on our
vendetta far and wide. We strove for mastery of Europe; we battled for our
rival empires.
At the same time, we never ceased wooing and seducing each other, of
dreaming about marriage, or at least of having an affair.
Montesquieu lectured us about the political virtues of England. Hogarth's
uncouth squires eventually became refined by contact with French manners.
Good British families ordered French governesses for their children. French
families employed English nurses.
The French imported golf and whisky. The English imported the jeu de paume,
and then re-exported it to France as tennis. The English taste for claret
started with the Black Prince. It was followed by a weakness for champagne
and cognac.
That cautious betrothal, the Entente Cordiale, was arranged 90 years ago,
just in time for the two families to bear the burden of 1914-1918 together.
Trafalgar still stuck in the throats of the French and the Royal navies,
with disastrous and tragic consequences in 1940. But there was also Free
France and the Free French, and the debt they incurred to Britain, together
with all Europe's Resistance fighters, for its stubborn, unflagging and
matchless heroism.
It was indeed Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle, those arrogant,
argumentative father figures, who arranged the marriage through their
stormy, grudging respect for each other. Weddings between nations are not
floral occasions. The contracts are sealed only after bitter discussions.
And the honeymoons are spoiled by clouds and storms. But Churchill and de
Gaulle contributed their lucid visions of the future.
Europe was beginning to take shape. The fixed link will be one of the jewels
in Europe's crown, uniting its north and its south.
The idea of the Tunnel is two centuries old. Dozens of separate schemes have
been proposed. Borings have been sunk and abandoned. But it proved harder to
drill through psychological barriers than through the hardest rock strata.
A key date was November 17, 1973, when Georges Pompidou and Edward Heath
signed the first treaty on the Tunnel. The mental gulf had been spanned -
the land route between Great Britain and Europe had been agreed. The next
milestone was July 29, 1987, when the final accord was ratified by the
leaders of Britain and France.
One of the most important elements in this gigantic enterprise is that, over
the years, so many individuals in France and Britain were committed to its
fulfilment. Diplomats, financiers, industrialists, administrators,
engineers, experts, technicians of all kinds, foremen and workmen - all
pulled together to remove the obstacles encountered on their long road
beneath the waves.
They exchanged their skills and their know-how; they became accustomed to
each other's behaviour; they pooled their national assets.
I regret the choice of 'Le Shuttle' as the official name of this new mode of
transport. I would have preferred the words 'shuttle' and 'navette' to sit
side by side like the heraldic arms of two families united by marriage.
I am told that 'shuttle' was adopted to please the English. Is that true?
Our cross-Channel cousins also collect foreign words. Fowler's Modern
English Usage shows that, like us, they sometimes overdo it. Yet good and
correct use of our languages is the best way to safeguard our joint
civilisation.
The fixed link will encourage an exchange of lifestyle and patterns of
thinking even more than the transfer of goods. In recent decades the French
have adopted Le weekend, in deed as well as verbally. We used to attend Mass
in our Sunday best. But the term s'endimancher has disappeared. Nowadays, a
French middle class family spends Sunday in tweeds and corduroys and the Day
of Rest goes on for two or even three days.
I would like the British to acquire some of our French attitudes towards
intellectual pursuits, and to stop fighting shy of showing a little culture,
since generally they are much more cultured and erudite than they pretend to
be. Do they give this impression because of embarrassment - or mere
stinginess? After all, it is by sharing one's own knowledge that one
enriches others.
For their part, the French need to emulate English people's innate feeling
of superiority at simply being English and subjects of Her Majesty. What an
asset in coping with life's surprises. 'I did not fulfil my life's
ambitions; I have a humdrum job; but yes I am English, a privilege which
nothing can take from me ..'
We should all have some of that pride and self-assurance, that certainty of
one's own identity. Because, wherever we turn, the outlook is worrying. To
the south of the Mediterranean, where we have some influence, we see
unchecked population growth and seething hatreds. Africa, scourged by
massacres, is disintegrating. Asia has become conscious of its size.
Germany is swelling and rediscovering its instinct for hegemony: it has
discarded the pointed helmet but now wields the mighty Deutsche Mark. The
Balkans are ablaze. Russia will somehow regain its power: in her
tribulations she needs it, and hankers for it. And the United States,
despite all its appearance of power, has become a riven society.
France and Britain must be sure of themselves and their priorities. We must
ensure that we are the vanguard of a Europe of Nations and that we are not
submerged by it. Together we must weather the storms, of which we know
nothing except that they are inevitable.
In this spirit, let us salute the fixed link as one of the greatest
accomplishments of our age, as a bulwark and beacon of hope.

 -UK regions / Wales and the west

Travellers emerging in England from the Channel tunnel will be greeted by a
billboard extolling, in three languages, the virtues of holidays in Wales.
'We are seeing the tunnel as an opportunity,' says Wales Tourist Board,
which has booked the billboard for three years.
The board's direct response to the tunnel's opening is unusual in Wales and
south-west England, where in general there is a 'wait and see' attitude. As
with tourism, it is hard to quantify in advance whether business will gain
from the tunnel or lose because other regions have better links.
For its part, West Country Tourist Board believes its greatest risk is the
potential loss of short-break holidays by people in south-east England for
whom the tunnel will have novelty value.
'We hope they realise that they will arrive in a particularly unattractive
part of northern France,' says the board, optimistically. It has stepped up
its own promotion in northern European markets.
Despite concern that inadequacies in the transport infrastructure could put
the regions at a disadvantage, the tunnel is expected to have little
immediate impact on commercial activity. Mr Pat Lee, vice-chairman of the
south-west Confederation of British Industry and a director of Wincanton
Distribution Services in Wiltshire, says: 'I believe most truck companies
here will continue to use the ferries, although it could be attractive to
time-critical freight such as food.'
Mr John Savage, chief executive of Bristol Chamber of Commerce and
Initiative, says: 'I believe the potential for the tunnel to greatly affect
local business is very limited.' And Mr Graham Hall, director of Wales
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, comments: 'We're waiting and watching - no
one is intending to leap into contractual arrangements simply because the
tunnel is open. If and when there are straight through rail services, it may
make a difference.'
British Rail's only European intermodal terminal in the two regions will be
at Cardiff, one of nine in the UK which will be able to transfer containers
and swap bodies between road and rail. But freight services will be demand
driven.
The south-west believes the lack of its own freight terminal places it at a
disadvantage, although rail only accounts for 3 per cent of freight
movements in the region. There is little incentive to use the Cardiff
terminal: apart from the long distances to it from much of the south-west,
hauliers face high bridge tolls to cross the Severn.
For these hauliers, a better location would be Avonmouth near Bristol, next
to a thriving port, the M4 and M5 motorways and the new Severn crossing
under construction. RTZ, the mining group, has made a planning application
for a private intermodal rail terminal on its land there and is forming a
consortium with potential users. For passenger rail services, Cardiff will
be linked from October via Bristol Parkway to London's Waterloo station to
connect with the tunnel. A new regional service will run from Carmarthen in
west Wales via Bristol Temple Meads and Bath to Waterloo.
The tunnel has increased the pressure for the main lines to south Wales and
the south-west to be electrified, although there is little prospect of this
for many years. 'Business believes the electrification of at least one route
to the far south-west must be a priority, if full value is to be obtained
from the Channel tunnel and in particular if the region is to attract inward
investment,' the south-west CBI said in response to the Department of the
Environment's draft planning guidance for the region.
The South West Regional Planning Conference is also pressing for the
electrification of the main routes, and for investment in the road network.
Like the CBI, it wants an upgraded south coast road to provide a choice of
routes for the south-west. The CBI consider this 'essential' to west country
business in view of the likely additional traffic generated by the tunnel on
the M4 and M5.
The Road Haulage Association in Bristol agrees on the need to upgrade roads
 -'our problems are getting out of the district, rather than to the Channel
tunnel.' In particular, better north-south roads are wanted to the expanding
port of Poole in Dorset, although plans are meeting environmental
objections.
From Poole, Brittany Ferries starts a new service to St Malo on May 13 - 'we
think our west channel routes offer the only real alternative to the
tunnel,' says the company, which is carrying annually 2.8m passengers,
746,000 cars and 177,000 trucks on its routes from Poole, Portsmouth and
Plymouth.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (21): A different perspective -
Northern England views Humber ports as more important
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is marked ambivalence about the Channel Tunnel in northern England. At
best it is seen as an additional and complementary piece of infrastructure
for industry and commerce, but not as a substitute because it will be
inconvenient for much existing trade - and too small.
Mr Peter Lee, one of a long line of Sheffield steelmakers and this year's
chairman of the Yorkshire and Humberside CBI regional council, says the
Channel Tunnel is 'very exciting', but is not as important to the north as
the Humber estuary.
'The Channel Tunnel will actually handle only about one-tenth of the freight
which passes through the Humber ports and their volume is growing by more
than that every year,' he told the regional CBI's annual dinner last month.
Mr Lee sees Humberside - which the CBI wants retained as a single economic
unit, not split into two in local government reorganisation - as a 'vital
component' in northern Europe's east-west corridor.
Goods move along this corridor between North America, Ireland, north-west
England and Yorkshire and Humberside, while industry in the conurbations
clustered around the M62 - the main transport artery - has increasingly been
growing stronger because of it, driving the northern England economy.
Manchester Airport - which is now challenging Copenhagen for seventh place
in the European size league - is another central element in the existing
infrastructure. Mr Jim McInstry, shortly before retiring as chief executive
of Blackburn chamber of commerce, said its proposed second runway is more
important to the regional economy than the Channel Tunnel. Many northern
business leaders share his view.
In all the arguments about the Tunnel's potential, however, it is important
not to compare apples with pears. The critical factors are which goods are
being shifted and how far they are going.
The old argument about road versus rail is that rail carries things from
point to point, while road carries them where people want them to go. Rail
is fine for bulk items assembled or broken up at nodal points which are far
apart, but road is best for single loads where delivery distances are under
400 miles.
The growth of the Humber ports has been partly on the back of road haulage.
The UK motorway network puts the bulk of Britain from the Midlands
northwards within half a day's tachograph limits.
A similar argument applies across the North Sea at the Humber's main trading
port of Rotterdam, with the Ruhr little more than three hours distant.
Last year, the Humber's ports and river wharves shifted more than 60m tonnes
of cargo. This was more than the Thames and made the Humber Britain's
busiest estuary. While only about a quarter of this was the sort of unitised
freight the Tunnel will carry, 15m tonnes will be Tunnel's eventual maximum
 -and that not for several years.
Nevertheless, regional Britain is largely ready for the Tunnel in terminals,
of which 11 have been constructed or are planned. The north has four ready:
Liverpool docks, Trafford Park and Guide Bridge - one each side of Greater
Manchester - and Doncaster in South Yorkshire. Another is planned for
Wakefield in West Yorkshire.
These promise to get freight to Brussels or Paris in 15 hours, Stuttgart in
28, Bordeaux in 29, Milan in 36, Vienna in 38 and Madrid in 65 hours.
However, these times are from terminal to terminal, not from door to door.
This is where road hauliers believe they will always score, say, shifting
single loads regularly by Humber ferry between Bradford to Wuppertal between
6pm one day and 11am the next. New high-speed ferries and a floating ro-ro
landing stage in the Humber have started operating this year to develop the
market faster.
They believe the Tunnel stands to score on regular shipments of such things
as large numbers of engineering components, or long distance regular bulk
shipments of high value added goods such as whisky, or perishable products
such as chilled convenience food.
It should also do well out of the only fully inter-modal regional terminal,
which is in Liverpool docks. This already shifts containers straight off
ships to trains. The Tunnel should make trade between southern Europe and
North America - and intra-European trade with Ireland north and south -
easier, with England forming a railway land-bridge between Liverpool and the
Tunnel.
Mersey Docks and Harbour Company already runs a railway land-bridge
operation from the terminal, via Harwich in East Anglia and Zeebrugge in
Belgium. It expects the terminal's throughput to rise from its present
35,000 units a year to 60,000 by the end of 1996 because of the Tunnel.
There remains one difficult problem for all the northern terminals, however
 -the state of Britain's railway lines. The west coast main line, which will
serve the terminals in Manchester, Merseyside and Lanarkshire is in urgent
need of modernisation, with no sign yet of how and when the work will be
done.
The government hopes it will be through its private sector initiative in
partnership with civil engineering and construction companies, but this is
years away - and there are no offers yet from the private sector.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (19): Japan plays biggest
financial role - The search for loans for the project is an unfinished
struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Eurotunnel embarks on its fifth fund-raising exercise since the company
was created in 1986, its bankers and advisers are wondering whether the
group's Japanese bank lenders will once again have to be 'handbagged' into
supporting the refinancing.
Japanese banks have contributed more of Eurotunnel's loan finance - some 23
per cent - than those from any other country. But on a famous occasion in
the summer of 1990, Eurotunnel was kept out of receivership by the
intervention of the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, when
she wrote a letter - famous in Eurotunnel as the 'handbag letter' - to the
then Japanese premier, Mr Toshiki Kaifu, urging him to persuade Japanese
banks not to block a much needed injection of new bank loans. In the past
two weeks, Eurotunnel and its bank advisers have been wondering whether they
might need the persuasive powers of Mrs Thatcher's successor in their
attempt to raise Pounds 1.3bn of new debt and equity.
If the company succeeds, it will have raised more than Pounds 10bn in loans
and equity since it was created in 1986, far more than has ever been raised
by any other private sector infrastructure project.
Funds started to disappear into the black hole under the channel in
September 1986, when Pounds 46m of seedcorn equity was provided by five
banks - Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Lyonnais, Banque Indosuez,
National Westminster and Midland - and the Transmanche Link Anglo-French
construction consortium.
The following month, a further Pounds 206m came from a placing of new shares
with investment institutions. But the big fund-raising exercise was in the
the following year, when a Pounds 5bn loan facility was raised from more
than 200 international banks and Pounds 770m in equity came from a share
sale involving public offers in the UK and France and placings elsewhere.
However, not long after the money was raised, the company became aware that
construction costs were spiralling out of control - and that the
construction contract was far too kind to TML, the contractors. Under the
contract, the lion's share of the cost increases fell on Eurotunnel rather
than on TML. Eurotunnel needed to enlarge its banking facilities and raise
additional equity. But the banks would not even let it continue drawing on
the original Pounds 5bn facility without a renegotiation of the TML
contract, to ensure a more equable distribution of the cost over-runs
between the company and its contractors.
The new contract with TML was finally signed on February 22, 1990, only
hours before the receivers would have needed to be called in. But though
Eurotunnel was given permission by its banks to continue drawing on its loan
facilities, its financial problems were only just beginning.
Its estimate of the construction costs it had to carry - as opposed to those
faced by TML - had increased 46 per cent since 1987. Including financing
charges and central overheads, it now estimated it needed Pounds 7.6bn in
cash resources to finish the tunnel and operate shuttle and train services
till they started to break even.
However, it only had Pounds 6bn in loans and equity. So it spent most of
1990, trying to persuade banks to provide Pounds 2bn of additional
facilities, prior to obtaining Pounds 566m from a rights issue. Though this
appeared to be more than it needed, the company wanted a cushion to prevent
any further cash crises from any future cost over-runs.
The banks were not enthusiastic to provide more. There was a worldwide
recession in the banking industry. Big international banks were short of
capital and were reluctant to make substantial new loans to any customer,
however strong - and Eurotunnel was not at the time an unblemished credit.
Eurotunnel had by that time only drawn around a fifth of the Pounds 5bn
original facility. So some banks argued that if it was put into receivership
at this stage, their losses would be limited. On the other hand, they argued
that the losses could be huge if Eurotunnel was allowed to continue drawing
on this original facility and was also given Pounds 2bn more but
subsequently ran into further difficulties.
In the face of such hostility, the group's four leading or agent banks -
National Westminster and Midland of the UK, Credit Lyonnais and Banque
Nationale de Paris of France - agreed to try to raise the money from the
syndicate.
In mid-August, perilously close to a deadline which had been fixed so that
the crucial rights issue could go ahead in the autumn, 93 banks were still
declining to provide their share of the new money.
Most reluctant were the Japanese banks, some of which had backed Eurotunnel
in the mistaken belief that the British and French government would bail it
out if it ran into difficulties.
However, after Mrs Thatcher's letter to Mr Kaifu, the Japanese Ministry of
Finance summoned the main Japanese bank lenders to a meeting. In the end,
they agreed to provide their share of the new funds.
The final amount of the increase in the facility was Pounds 1.8bn, or Pounds
200m less than Eurotunnel wanted. But the company secured a further Pounds
300m loan from the European Investment Bank.
However, since then Eurotunnel's need for capital has increased yet again.
Part of the reason is that construction costs have risen even more. But the
requirement for new loans and equity stems mainly from the delays in the
opening schedule and the slow build-up of passenger services - which means
that Eurotunnel will start to generate revenues far later than it originally
hoped.
It is now trying to persuade its banks to provide around Pounds 650m from a
new class of senior bank debt, prior to a Pounds 650m rights issue in late
May.
The new debt would rank ahead of the existing bank loans in a winding up. It
is also scheduled to be repaid in approximately 10 years, compared with the
2010 repayment date of the existing debt.
But unlike the 1990 refinancing, the company has recognised that it will not
be able to persuade all its banks to contribute to the new loan. In
particular, it is not expecting the Japanese banks to participate fully in
the new loan. Banks' participation in the new credit line will be at their
discretion and not a fixed proportion of their existing exposure, as was the
case in 1990.
Nonetheless, Eurotunnel needs the Japanese banks to vote in favour of the
reconstruction proposal, because 90 per cent approval of bank creditors is
required for it to go ahead.
Bankers say that some banks - including the Japanese - may be reluctant to
back the plan, since their existing debt would be placed second in the
creditors' rankings by the issue of new senior debt.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (20): A financial bed of nails
 -Profile / Graham Corbett, Eurotunnel's finance director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Joining Eurotunnel in 1987 was supposed to represent a prestigious but not
too onerous denouement to a distinguished accountancy career for Graham
Corbett, the channel tunnel group's chief financial officer.
Only a year earlier, as senior partner of Peat Marwick's continental
European firm based in Paris, he had been musing to his wife that a move to
Eurotunnel, then in its infancy, would represent his ideal career move -
'the project (of building a tunnel link between England and France) was
always something I had believed in passionately,' he says.
So it seemed too good to be true when Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's
co-chairman, offered him the position, following up a suggestion from the
Bank of England. After a morning of negotiations Mr Corbett agreed to take a
four-day-per-week contract lasting 18 months.
In the event, his working week has typically been 80 hours or more -
including a regular Sunday afternoon brainstorming session with Sir Alastair
 -as Mr Corbett has played the vital though exhausting role of protecting
the interests of the group's shareholders while the company has lurched from
one financial crisis to the next.
'I suspect my contract still says four days a week', he says nostalgically.
'I haven't had the time to examine it for some while.'
He is an avid city-hopper, going from emergency bank meeting to emergency
bank meeting, propelling himself phlegmatically on crutches and seemingly
untroubled by leg braces which resemble Victorian instruments of torture.
When representatives of the group's 200 banks are asked who have played
important roles in keeping the group afloat despite its remarkable
vicissitudes, Mr Corbett is almost always cited.
'He has been a rock,' comments a banker, who recalls ruefully that Mr
Corbett has not given an inch when convinced that banks have demanded too
high a price for supplying new funds - 'no, we have not always seen eye to
eye,' the banker says. However, the job almost became one of the shortest on
record - 'I arrived a week after Black Monday' (in October 1987, when the
stock market crashed), Mr Corbett recalls. 'That was two weeks before
'equity three,' (Eurotunnel's code name for its third share sale, to raise
Pounds 770m needed before tunnelling could start).'
In the light of the stock market's volatility - and the enormous losses made
by underwriters on the British Petroleum share sale - there was concern that
Eurotunnel would be unable to underwrite its share issue and thus that the
project would be stillborn.
However, the company just succeeded, thanks to the combined marketing skills
of 13 French and British securities houses. For the first and last time, Mr
Corbett had to sit on the sidelines and watch while the City decided
Eurotunnel's fate. However, in Eurotunnel's two subsequent refinancings, Mr
Corbett has been a leading protagonist. In the first refinancing, Mr Corbett
knows better than anyone how close the group came to bankruptcy.
'In early 1990 we were down to our last Pounds 1m,' he says. For a group
which will have consumed Pounds 10bn in debt and equity by the time normal
passenger services are being provided, that was tantamount to insolvency.
The costs of building the tunnel had been escalating sharply. However,
Eurotunnel had thought in early January 1990 that it had persuaded
Transmanche Link, the consortium of contractors working on the project, to
take a greater share of the cost over-runs.
But until this new contract with TML was signed, Eurotunnel's banks refused
to allow the company to draw any further funds. Giving no explanation, TML
simply refused to sign. By February 20, Mr Corbett was forced to contemplate
calling in the receivers.
In due course, however - and following the intervention of the Governor of
the Bank of England, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, now Lord Kingsdown - TML signed
and Eurotunnel was given access to its bank facilities again.
After a nerve-wracking summer of that year - during which it appeared that
some banks would block a much-needed increase in its banking facilities -
Eurotunnel secured access to a further Pounds 1.8bn of commercial bank
loans, a Pounds 300m loan from the European Investment Bank and Pounds 566m
from a rights issue.
Having pulled that one off, Eurotunnel and Mr Corbett are hopeful they can
raise Pounds 1.3bn in debt and equity in a second refinancing taking place
at the moment.
However, being Eurotunnel's finance director is probably the corporate
equivalent of appearing on Friday the Thirteenth - just as one horror is
out-manoeuvred, another pops out of the black hole.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (17): It's that D-Day spirit -
Ferries launch an all-out war for passengers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Channel ports owe a vote of thanks to a legendary British Lions rugby
captain. Asked many years ago how he would combat a frighteningly tough
South African team, he said: 'Simple. We will get our retaliation in first.'
Every ferry operator and harbour owner threatened with losing business to
the Channel Tunnel has taken this philosophy to heart.
Millions of pounds have been invested in new or upgraded terminals and
ships, and costs are being cut to the bone, mainly through staff lay-offs.
Passengers and freight hauliers are already feeling the benefit of cheaper,
faster services. EuroTunnel can, therefore, see the scale of competition
even before services are properly under way.
'But no-one knows who will win the battle,' says John Gutteridge of the
Freight Transport Association. 'Time-saving will be unimportant to
long-distance hauliers. Everything depends on services and costs, and we are
still not certain how they will pan out.'
Opening delays have helped the ports immeasurably. They all planned
retaliation to strike last year, when the tunnel was due to open. Further
postponement has provided extra time to fine-tune the blows.
Dover, which overshadows every other port for passenger traffic, may have
the most to lose. It has already lost 4,000 jobs as ferry-related employment
crashed to 8,000 in four years.
But that is due to greater efficiency, says Keith Southey at the Dover
Harbour Board - 'we are handling more passengers and freight with fewer
people,' he says.
Throughput has risen from 14.4m passengers and 858,000 lorries in 1986 when
the tunnel was given the go-ahead to 18.5m and more than 1.1m respectively
last year. This comes partly from natural growth but also in response to
investment averaging Pounds 1m a month, including a new Pounds 11.5m ferry
berth.
The board, which collects around 85p for each passenger, has cut charges to
shippers by 25 per cent in real terms over the last three years through
increasing efficiency and economies. But a strong attack has also been made
on EuroTunnel's offer of a faster trip. P&amp;O European Ferries has
computerised its check-in to whisk people through in 20 minutes. This helped
the group to a fourth consecutive record year in 1993, shipping 8m
passengers and more than 250,000 lorries.
Stena Sealink, which carried 6m passengers and 312,000 lorries last year,
has increased the number of sailings and simplified fares. But both
companies are banking more on quality than price and speed to compete with
the tunnel. P&amp;O has invested more than 400m in ships and training while
Stena has put 250m into four new ferries. They are aiming to attract
passengers with boutiques, restaurants and comfort in both terminals and on
board, claiming the crossing will be a welcome break for travellers.
Real competition to EuroTunnel, however, seems likely to come from a merger
of eastern Channel operators. Dover risks crippling loss of ferries unless
the big operators combine, says PA Cambridge Economic Consultants in a
review of the Kent Impact Study, commissioned to assess the effect of the
tunnel. But the Monopolies and Mergers Commission has put everything on the
back-burner until it sees what happens to traffic patterns.
Meanwhile, Folkestone is fighting its own battle for survival. Too small for
the new super-ferries, it lost 700 jobs when services were cut and faced
destruction in the crossfire between Dover and the tunnel.
Sea Containers, the harbour owner, is fighting Eurotunnel with its own
weapons - speed and price. Around Pounds 1m has gone into facilities such as
shopping and fast check-in services, while the Seacat service to Boulogne
will offer extra sailings and greater capacity on each vessel.
Hoverspeed, which claims 16 per cent of the short-haul market after carrying
2m passengers last year, is guaranteeing that fares will be 10 per cent
below any to Calais.
Newhaven, another Sea Containers port, is in the longer-haul market via the
Stena crossing to Dieppe. It could find help from the other side of the
Channel through European Union grants to help expansion.
Sally Lines has a slightly different line of attack. Its four-hour services
between Ramsgate, Dunkerque and Ostend are promoted as a leisurely break for
weary passengers. And in a pre-emptive strike to double last year's 2m
passengers, the group has stepped in to replace P&amp;O in partnership with
Ostend Lines.
Competition for potential tunnel traffic extends to the west as well.
Operators at Portsmouth and Poole, for instance, are making great play about
access to the holiday hotspots of north-western France, and freight markets
in the Iberian peninsula.
'Going on holiday through the tunnel would be like a French visitor
travelling via Middlesbrough to Cornwall,' according to Ian Carruthers,
managing director of Brittany Ferries. He has a rich market to protect.
Since 1985 motorised tourist traffic west of Le Havre has grown by 15.5 per
cent a year compared with 10.6 per cent on the short crossings. The company
claims to have tightened its grip on this area, claiming almost half the
passenger and freight traffic west of Dover.
But it is not relying merely on geographical logic to ward off the tunnel
influence. Some Pounds 350m has gone into new ships over the last five years
and a ninth route, between Poole and St Malo, opens this month. Southampton
is remarkably sanguine about the tunnel. 'Overall, it could be potentially
beneficial,' says Patrick Bowyer, the port's marketing manager.
The owner, Associated British Ports, has invested heavily to maintain a huge
lead in freight, although it will not reveal details. Some 30m tonnes flowed
through the docks last year, far ahead of any other UK Channel port and a
big buffer against any leakage to the tunnel.
But a residual bitterness remains over the flight of ferry companies to
Portsmouth. Stena has returned with a Cherbourg service, pushing passenger
figures to more than 480,000 last year compared with 145,000 in 1990.
Around 150m cross-Channel passengers a year are expected within a decade
compared with less than 65m in 1990. Freight traffic is likely to grow even
faster. Few will predict today how this growing pie will be split.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (16): Big potential benefits -
Belgium looks for economic spin-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The official opening of the Channel Tunnel later this year promises to help
revitalise the north-west regions of Belgium, even though the country's
biggest ports will suffer a loss of traffic.
The chambers of commerce in Veurne and Courtrai, along with the West
Flanders Regional Development Authority in Bruges, are gearing up to become
part of what they refer to as the 'new European Metropolitan Area.'
This takes in the Nord-Pas de Calais in France, Western Flanders and Hainaut
in Belgium, and Kent in the UK.
The potential for this region is enormous. According to Mr Anthony Vande
Candelare, an urban planner who made a study of the influence of the Channel
Tunnel on the west of Belgium and the North of France: 'Overnight, the
Belgian coast and the North of France will become the centre of Europe.'
Mr Jo Libeer, managing director of the Courtrai chamber of commerce, is
equally optimistic about the likely impact on the area of the tunnel.
'With the TGV and the chunnel this region, which was sort of in the corner
of Europe, will now be in the middle of a new developing area,' he says.
This is no bad thing for Belgium. In its last economic survey of the
country, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said the
Belgian economy had deteriorated 'progressively' since the 1980s. 'And over
the last 10 to 12 months it has taken a distinct turn for the worse.'
Furthermore, Flanders, the area most likely to benefit from the arrival of
the tunnel, has recently suffered more rapid increases in unemployment than
in Wallonia and the Brussels region. The unemployment rate, which in 1990
was 9.5 per cent in Flanders has risen to 13 per cent.
The Belgian chambers in the regions most directly affected believe there are
two main areas for development: firstly, increasing traffic through western
Flanders as holidaymakers and freight carriers head towards the
tunnel-opening in Calais; and secondly tourism. To benefit fully, however, a
crucial 7km stretch of the E40 European motorway between Veurne and the
French border has yet to be completed.
Once this is done it will be possible to drive from Russia to England
without leaving a motorway, says Mr Philippe Claerhout, chairman of the
Veurne chamber of commerce and industry. Fortunately, plans to complete the
stretch have been agreed and it should be open some time next year.
On the downside, the Westhoek region is badly placed to benefit from rail
transport.
'Even after the doubling of the tracks and electrification of the railway
line between Ghent and De Panne, we will still be a remote corner,' says Mr
Claerhout.
Furthermore, Belgium's biggest ports are expecting traffic loads to fall, as
freight and passengers are directed towards Calais. Worst affected will be
Ostend and Zeebrugge, two ports hoping to hold their own by concentrating on
links with ports in the north of England.
Nonetheless, the improved, if imperfect, transport communications of the
West Flanders region are apparently paying off. Mr Geert Sanders, who works
for the Regional Development Authority of West Flanders, says there is
already evidence that the region's enhanced communications are attracting
new businesses. For example, Baronie, a Dutch chocolate company, is opening
a new base in the southern part of West Flanders.
There is, however, a danger that Belgium will not make the most of the
commercial opportunities - 'we will try to attract new industry, but our
region is very small and our industrial zones are full,' says Mr Ludo
Verstraete, of the Veurne chamber of commerce. The Belgian authorities have
dragged their feet over decisions to dedicate new areas, he says.
The other main focus for development is tourism. As Mr Claerhout says: 'We
need to convince people from other countries that it is worth their while to
stop in Westhoek at the time of their journey through the North of Europe to
England.'
The potential is there. West Flanders is home to some of the best-known
World War One battlefields, and promoters of the region insist that its
large, open green spaces will, when properly developed, attract foreign
visitors. But once again, there is a danger that Belgium will miss out. It
has been slower to develop the tourist potential of the Channel Tunnel than
France.
Around Calais, a commercial and leisure centre, hotels and activity parks,
known as 'La Cite de L'Europe', are springing up while Lille is home to
Euralille, a similar development. As Mr Verstraete of the Veurne chamber of
commerce says: 'Tourism is very important . . . we really have to develop
our hotels and tourist infrastructure.'
But the biggest advantages for Belgium will come from close co-operation
between the national and federal authorities and their French and UK
counterparts. In a Europe without frontiers, this will be the most effective
way of benefiting from the the Channel Tunnel.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (18): Many unanswered queries -
Regions / Kent waits in hope and foreboding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kent is looking forward to the opening and full operation of the tunnel with
a curious mix of fear and hope, foreboding and enthusiasm.
The contrasting views come from different parts of the county and are based
on the varying impact the project will have on local jobs and economic
prospects.
The days when the opening of the tunnel was regarded locally as an automatic
boost to jobs and a panacea for many of the county's problems have long
disappeared. The last few years have been too painful, particularly in north
and east Kent, and too many unanswered questions were raised during the
tunnel's construction.
In 1987, the first estimates of the Kent Impact Study suggested that an
additional 9,600 to 12,900 jobs might be created by the tunnel and its
related infrastructure, but following the impact of recession this was
revised sharply down in 1991 to 2,000.
There were several contributory reasons for this dramatic decline apart from
the recession, including much greater job losses than expected among the
ferry operators at Dover, Folkestone and Ramsgate, and among customs
officers and freight forwarding agents following the introduction of the
European single market.
Even these modest benefits are likely to be concentrated of specific areas
such as Ashford and not on more peripheral areas of north and east Kent like
Swale (Sheppey and Sittingbourne) and Thanet (Margate and Broadstairs),
where additional employment is most needed. There remains a view that the
tunnel could create a corridor of affluence from the coast to London,
leaving the remaining areas out in the cold.
The extended recession has also meant that few developments have been made
before the opening. It was only when the initial breakthrough of the service
tunnel was achieved in December, 1990, that completion became accepted as
certain, but economic circumstances then delayed many of the necessary
infrastructure improvements.
The three areas with a good supply of development sites are Dartford,
Maidstone/Malling and Ashford. These straddle the main tunnel transport
corridor and are potentially the most attractive locations for new economic
activity.
Ashford, an historic market town, has been earmarked as a growth centre and
a great deal of infrastructure including new roads and business parks has
been put in place, but even here the situation remains blurred and progress
has been frustratingly slow.
Potential inward investors have been reluctant to commit themselves until a
decision is reached by the government and British Rail on the line of the
fast rail link serving the tunnel. There are three possible routes at
Ashford under discussion, central and southern ones that would go through
the Pounds 50m international passenger station under construction in the
town centre, and a northerly one that would bypass it.
Choice of the northerly route parallel to the M20 motorway would be a big
economic blow according to local civic leaders as it would mean fewer trains
would stop at the station. A decision is imminent and the outcome is
regarded as crucial to the full development of Ashford as a growth centre
with its spin-off effects for the rest of east Kent.
Outside the affluent corridor occupied by Canterbury, with its tourism and
retailing strengths, Maidstone, the county's administrative centre, and
Ashford, the impact of the tunnel remains problematic, certainly in the next
year or two. The 1991 impact study suggested that new employment
opportunities would be generated from 1996, including in areas like east
Kent, and that these would be enhanced by the construction of the
international rail link by the turn of the century.
In the meantime, the most deprived parts of east and north Kent have banded
together to form the east Kent initiative to push for help. The first key
objective was achieved last year with the granting of assisted area status
and the acknowledgment by government of the area's problems. Aid from both
Whitehall and from Brussels, particularly for Thanet which has full
development area status, should ensure that training and infrastructure
grants are forthcoming to attract more inward investment.
Hardest hit of all by the completion of the tunnel has been Dover, by far
the biggest cross-channel ferry port. The combination of the tunnel and the
single European market has led to the loss of around 6,000 jobs in the
district.
There is an assumption that when the tunnel is fully operational it might
attract up to 50 per cent of the tourist car business and perhaps 25 per
cent of the freight business. Nevertheless, ferry operators and the Dover
harbour authorities remain bullish about long term prospects, but they admit
that the ferries will have to continue to slim down in order to remain fully
competitive.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (15): A French city blessed by
geography - Lille hopes for an economic rebirth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We would never have built this on the same scale, if there had been no
Channel tunnel,' says Mr Jean-Paul Baietto, general manager of Euralille.
The project, which occupies nearly 70 hectares in the centre of Lille, is
linked intimately with the Channel Tunnel as the city, in north eastern
France, will be the first continental stop for rail passengers from England.
Costing FFr5.3bn, it is the biggest construction development on the European
continent - apart from the rebuilding of unified Berlin. It will comprise a
space-age station for the Eurostar TGV trains, a conference centre, office
towers and residential blocks covering some 300,000 square metres.
The Tunnel should eventually put Lille within two hours of London, and the
subsequent decision to build the northern Europe TGV system means that Lille
will eventually be only half an hour from Brussels, two hours from
Amsterdam, and two hours ten minutes from Cologne. It is already only one
hour from Paris.
A spin-off of all these TGV decisions, Euralille was only started in 1991,
and since then has been a 'projet a grande vitesse.' Indeed, 'if the tunnel
had been on time, we would have been late,' admits Mr Baietto. As it is, the
year's delay has meant that Euralille will be ready this month to receive
its first Eurostar train, even though regular service will only begin later.
By chance Euralille was able to take over 70 empty hectares in the city
centre, which had belonged to the French army since the 17th century days,
and to be able to draw lessons from other projects - 'we have tried to learn
both from the Docklands' lack of transport connections and from La Defense
in Paris which is busy with office workers during the day, but dead at
night,' says a Euralille executive.
Euralille's TGV station is being linked with the local metro, bus and tram
systems. It will have two large office blocks, the Credit Lyonnais tower
after the bank which is reinforcing its presence in Lille, and the
Lilleurope tower. The new conference centre will be called the Lille-Grand
Palais. There will also be a mixed leisure and residential centre to keep
the area alive outside working hours.
'With the frequency of TGVs - up to 100 a day by 1996 - it should provide a
very convenient base for anyone with constant travel around northern Europe,
such as lawyers, bankers, logistics specialists,' says Mr Baietto. He has
been visited by the mayors of Ashford and Dartford in Kent keen to learn how
Lille is capitalising on the TGV.
The Tunnel is helping the Lille region to shed its image as a grimy 19th
mining and textiles centre. That is how it is seen by Mr Bruno Bonduelle,
head of the world's largest vegetable canning business and president of the
city's APIM development agency - 'for a long time, Lille seemed a
cul-de-sac, with everything centralised on Paris. Now it is re-finding
itself as a centre of trade between the north and south of Europe, the role
it had in the Middle Ages,' he says.
Within a 250 km radius of Lille, 'you have nearly 80m of the richest people
on earth,' says Mr Bonduelle. His total includes 20m people in Greater
London, 15m in the Paris region, 20m Belgians and Dutch and 20m Germans in
the Ruhr. They, rather than the Tunnel alone, are the reason why the
Nord-Pas de Calais region has been winning French and foreign investment.
Mr Philip Ulyett, head of the Lille British Chamber of Commerce, says there
is a great questionmark over how rapidly the Tunnel traffic will develop.
But there are still sound commercial reasons why nearly 250 UK companies
have set up, or bought into, the region, he says. Mr Michel Maton of the
Nord-Pas de Calais development agency makes the same point  - 'a transport
axis is an opportunity but not a guarantee of jobs and investment - a
necessary but not sufficient condition.' But the region's strategic
position, combined with French labour costs (pay plus social charges) that
are 15-20 per cent lower than in Germany, Belgium or the Netherlands, have
drawn foreign firms in; even lower labour costs in Britain are offset, for
some industries, by the fact that nuclear-generated electricity ischeaper in
France.'
Recent arrivals include the US-Japanese joint venture of Ajinomoto and
Nutrasweet at Gravelines; Haagan-Dazs ice cream (now owned by Grand Met of
the UK) at Arras; Ingram Micro (a US computer maker) in Lille;
Worthington-Armstrong, makers of metal grids at Valenciennes; Pittsburgh
Plate Glass near Douai; and Coca-Cola at Dunkerque. A new enticement is a 22
per cent tax break for investments on sites totalling 600 hectares in the
Valenciennes, Maubege, Cambrai and Bethune areas.
Because of the region's good communications it is now home to 75 per cent of
France's mail order business, a trend started by local textile companies but
now spread to many sectors.
The area also includes Euroteleport, a new satellite-based telecoms
operation in Roubaix. Financed partly with European Union money as a step
towards liberalising the EU's telecommunications, Euroteleport enables
French companies to bypass France Telecom's existing monopoly when
communicating with their subsidiaries, firstly inside France and eventually
abroad.
The nearer a company is to the Tunnel, the more it can benefit. For example,
TIM, belonging to the German group of Fritz Meier, exports 30-35 per cent of
the tractor cabins it makes at Dunkerque to the UK. 'This works alright,'
says Mr Regis Verhaege, TIM's finance director, 'but using the Tunnel will
mean we won't be delayed by storms or the dockers' strikes which are more
frequent on the French side.'
The greatest economic impact will be felt at Calais. At the French end of
the Tunnel, Eurotunnel has set aside 100 hectares for its Cite de l'Europe.
Some 90,000 square metres - nearly a third of the total development - will
be a commercial centre, ready by next March and to be managed by
Espace-Expansion which runs the Forum des Halles in Paris. With Carrefour
and Tesco supermarkets, shops such as Toys 'R US and a Gaumont cinema
complex, 'the idea is that the Cite de l'Europe will draw in tourists who
can then go on trips to the Cote d'Opal, from Le Touquet to Dunkerque,' says
Mr Georges Saury, Eurotunnel's development director.
As for jobs, Eurotunnel already has 1,400 employees on the French side, with
another 600 jobs in various forms of subcontract work, and a further 400
jobs for French police, customs and firemen. If the Cite de l'Europe
realises Mr Saury's hopes, it will employ some 1,500 people.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (10): The periphery draws
nearer to the centre - Charles Batchelor looks at Europe's changing map
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The opening of the Channel Tunnel and a fixed rail link between Britain and
the Continent will provide a welcome boost for the European Union's
transport policy.
Previously fragmented programmes were brought together in a white paper
published in 1992 which set out proposals to promote the use of rail and sea
and canal shipping transport and to rein in the rapid growth of road and air
journeys.
In physical terms the Channel tunnel represents a further link in the
transport chain which seeks to connect peripheral regions with the centre
and reduce geographical barriers to travel.
Elsewhere in Europe road and rail links are being established between
Denmark and Sweden, additional rail tunnels are planned to link northern and
southern Europe through the Swiss Alps and Spain and France through the
Pyrenees.
After many years during which planning for road, rail, air and sea transport
took place in isolation, the European Commission produced its outline of a
common transport policy in December 1992. The creation of the single
European market on January 1, 1993 had given additional impetus to the
project.
One of the main problems it sought to overcome was the imbalance between the
different means of transport. The rapid growth of road transport, in
particular, had led to a decline in the use of other networks, notably rail,
increasing congestion and damage to the environment.
Passenger travel within the EU has risen by 85 per cent over the past 20
years, mostly in the form of private car journeys, which account for 79 per
cent of all travel. Freight shipments have increased by half but road
transport now accounts for 70 per cent of goods transported while rail and
inland waterway transport have declined in relative terms.
One way of encouraging the use of rail, particularly for freight purposes,
is to encourage the development of integrated transport systems so that
goods can be moved by road for part of the journey and then transferred to
rail, ship or barge for the long-haul section of the route. This requires
investment in special rail wagons to carry trucks and trailers and in
terminals for handling the transhipment of containers and the like.
Speeding up journeys can also make rail attractive to both passengers and
freight. High-speed trains running on dedicated or upgraded tracks are
reducing inter-city times for business and leisure travellers while improved
track and handling facilities can speed up freight shipments.
At the same time the commission is keen for travellers to bear the full cost
of their journey through the use of road tolls and the harmonisation of
duties on the different types of fuel. Car travellers are rarely made aware
of the cost of their journey at the point of use while rail travellers are
very aware of the price of their ticket.
The International Union of Railways (UIC), which groups railway
organisations from around the world, believes that the active promotion of
rail transport and substantial investments to modernise the network would
result in a healthier transport balance. It believes the growth in rail
travel in western Europe could increase to 3 per cent a year compared with a
l per cent rise in road transport and a 4 per cent rise in air traffic.
If nothing is done rail travel growth would remain stuck at l per cent a
year while road transport would grow by just over 2 per cent and air by 6
per cent, a recent report by the UIC's strategic planning committee
calculated.
Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU, has increased the pressure for
a shift towards rail freight. A referendum last March produced a vote in
favour of a complete ban on transit lorry traffic through the Alps to take
effect in 2004.
This added urgency to plans already under consideration to build two new
high-speed north-south rail lines through the Alps connecting Basle with
Milan. Two new tunnels would be drilled at a low altitude so that trains
would not have a steep gradient to climb and could maintain speeds of up to
125 miles an hour.
One line would go under the Gotthard pass, the most highly travelled transit
route today, while the other would go through the Lotschberg south of Bern
and continue on the existing rail tunnel under the Simplon pass. Work is
expected to start in 1996 for completion in 2007. The Swiss believe that
existing tunnels will be able to cope with traffic displaced by the lorry
ban from 2004.
Despite attempts by the EU and neighbouring countries to shift traffic off
the roads the transport white paper recognises the important role of an
efficient road network. As part of its transport planning the EU has drawn
up a blueprint for a Trans European Road Network (TERN) to be completed by
2002.
This is a network of high-speed roads, motorways or four-lane dual
carriageways, linking the main ports and cities of Europe and tying
peripheral regions more closely into the centre. Cities of 500,000
inhabitants and more would have external ring roads.
The announcement of this programme has caused concern in parts of the UK
where local communities fear that all roads on the TERN system will be
upgraded to motorways, though this has been denied by the UK department of
transport. The EU plans to devote additional resources to creating this
network but it will be expected to fit into national road building
programmes.
An important gap in European road and rail networks which will shortly be
closed is the sea barrier between the islands of Denmark and between Denmark
and Sweden.
A combined tunnel-bridge taking both rail and road traffic between the
Danish islands of Funen and Zealand is due to be completed within the next
year or so while plans are also far advanced for a 10 mile-long crossing of
the Oresund between Copenhagen and Malmo. The crossing, also a combined
bridge/tunnel, could be completed by about 2000.
The highly visible physical links between the different parts of Europe such
as the Channel Tunnel and the Oresund crossing are finally being completed.
But it will take far longer and cost even more to create a healthy balance
between the established transport networks in Europe.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (12): On guard against
accidents and terror - Security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The financial pressures on the tunnel to open on schedule have taken second
place to the key commercial imperative of ensuring - to the maximum extent
possible - that it cannot permanently be crippled by an accident or
terrorist attack.
Among the numerous security staff, intelligence officers, police, fire
brigade, ambulance, and army personnel on both sides of the Channel engaged
in the project is Tony Blyth, a former British Rail operations manager who
is the tunnel's safety director. 'If we have a major accident, we are dead
as a company,' he says.
Two other key people are Detective Superintendent Cliff Grieve, the UK head
of ports and tunnel policing, and Commissaire Principal Marc Haem of
France's Police de l'Air et des Frontieres. They share responsibility for
security of the tunnel itself and of the shuttle terminals at Folkestone and
Coquelles.
Together they claim to have developed a culture of transnational police
cooperation to try and ensure, says Grieve, 'that people on a daily basis do
not escape justice through the Chunnel'.
In aiming for maximum efficiency, Blyth, Grieve, and Haem have had to
grapple with a complex mixture of private and government personnel,
binational agreements and internal committees developed in the run-up to the
opening of the tunnel.
The structure includes an Anglo-French Safety Authority set up for the
tunnel project and the existing official safety watchdogs in both countries,
the UK's Health and Safety Commission, and France's Inspecteur du Travail.
The operation of safety and security comes under the political umbrella of a
lengthy protocol agreement. This was initialled at Sangatte by the UK and
French governments in November 1991 and technically came into force in
August last year.
The Sangatte Protocol takes its cue from the Schengen trans-European
policing agreement, of which France but not the UK is a signatory. It thus
represents a totally new experience for the British police who have tended
to resist encroachment on to their territory by any of their European
counterparts.
The Protocol gives extraterritorial powers to British and French police
officers in specially designated control zones at the international
terminals in London and Paris, and in the shuttle terminals at Cheriton and
Coquelles. The through trains are also control zones where both police
forces will have powers of arrest.
Article 10 of the Protocol states: 'The officers of the adjoining State
shall, in exercise of their national powers, be permitted in the control
zone situated in the host State to detain or arrest persons in accordance
with the laws and regulations relating to frontier controls of the adjoining
state or persons sought by the authorities of the adjoining state.'
In spirit the Protocol, as defined in Article 5, aims to simplify and speed
up the formalities which normal law abiding passengers either travelling by
train or the Shuttle will have comply with when using the tunnel.
At the same time, it aims to harmonise security and safety arrangements so
as to ensure that any emergency or threat is reacted to speedily and
effectively without getting bogged down in disputes over sovereignty.
In the run-up to the opening of the tunnel, the application of the Protocol
has been put through a trial run in joint exercises and interminable
meetings.
The exercises have shown up failures in a number of areas including
fire-fighting equipment and communications. The meetings have produced some
stormy sessions in which British and French officials have argued over
issues ranging from whether some dangerous goods vehicles should be allowed
through the tunnel to the use by French police of small arms in and around
Waterloo station.
Eurotunnel says the set-backs form part of the inevitable teething problems
of any engineering project of such a size and complexity.
'We want to get it right before letting the general public in,' insists Tony
Blyth.
On the policing side, Kent officers and their counterparts in and around
Coquelles say they have developed a good working relationship over a number
of years.
But they are only cogs in the large security and judicial machinery which
will be truly tested only when the tunnel is fully operational.
A recent risk assessment commissioned by the London based Research Institute
for the Study of Conflict and Terrorism concluded that the Channel Tunnel
was probably the least vulnerable to major damage of any under-sea tunnel in
the world.
However, several experts believe that the biggest threat to the tunnel stems
from its being a prestige target for terrorists.
Much of the burden of responsibility will lie with Eurotunnel, however, in
ensuring that the commercial pressures do not lead to greater laxity over
security and safety checks.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (11): Europe wheels out its
best - Andrew Baxter studies the special rolling stock and who has built it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The supply of trains for the Channel Tunnel - locomotives, rolling stock,
wagons for cars, coaches and freight - has been a remarkable pan-European
effort, even if there have been plenty of delays and arguments along the
track.
Technical challenges and the sheer scale of the project - and hence the size
of the contracts - are partly to blame for timetables slipping.
On top of that, however, the contracts were awarded, and are on their way to
completion, during a period of intense upheaval in the railway equipment
industry, whose overcapacity problems are forcing it to consolidate across
Europe.
In summary, the main contracts are as follows:
Eurostar trains. Transmanche Super Train Group, led by GEC Alsthom, is
building the 31 Eurostar trains for the inter-capitals day service - London
to Brussels and Paris - at approximately Pounds 24m apiece.
Eurostar trains beyond London. The same consortium is building seven
slightly shorter Eurostar trains for the daytime services from Scotland and
from Manchester to Paris and Brussels.
European night services. Metro-Cammell in Birmingham, which is part of GEC
Alsthom, is building the 139 units of rolling stock for these services,
which will go from Glasgow, Plymouth and Swansea to Paris or Brussels, and
from London to Amsterdam, Dortmund or Frankfurt.
Nine of the 46 Class 92 locomotives being built by Brush Traction, part of
BTR, for British Rail and SNCF, the French railways, will be used to haul
these services, at least as far as Calais.
Freight services. The remaining 37 Class 92s will be used by BR's Rail
Freight Distribution, and SNCF's freight service, to carry freight through
the tunnel and beyond. Arbel Fauvet Rail, based at Douai in northern France,
is building low-platform intermodal wagons - which can carry freight in
containers and 'swapbodies' - and fully-enclosed wagons for shipping new
cars.
Le Shuttle. Thirty-eight locomotives for the cross-Channel car, coach and
truck service are being built by Brush Traction in Loughborough and Asea
Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group.
ESC Wagons, a consortium created by Bombardier of Canada and its subsidiary
Bombardier Eurorail, is responsible for building 254 double- and single-deck
wagons for Le Shuttle. The single-deck vehicle carriers were assembled at BN
in Bruges and the double-deckers at ANF-Industrie at Valenciennes, France.
The manufacture of 19 single-deck loaders, included in the total of 254
wagons, was subcontracted to Fiat Ferroviaria in Turin.
The Italian company, in consortium with Breda Construzioni Ferroviare, also
won the contract for the design and construction of 270 wagons to carry
heavy goods vehicles and their crews.
The delays and controversy have centred on Le Shuttle railcars and Eurostar
trains. In December, Bombardier said it expected to make a loss on its
CDollars 820m contract to supply railcars, signed in 1989, and said a
CDollars 450m cost overrun was almost entirely due to design changes imposed
by French and British government safety inspectors.
ESC is to receive FFr700m in phased payments while Bombardier will receive
up to 25m Eurotunnel shares in settlement of its claim against Transmanche
Link, the main contractor for the tunnel, for costs arising from changes in
the rolling stock design. So far, at least 202 wagons have been delivered
and the order is expected to be completed this year.
The Bombardier order had been awarded in July 1989 by TML after an
international call for tenders, but the genesis of the Eurostar trains was
rather different.
Because of the technical challenges - the need for the train to run on all
three networks and cope with different power and signalling systems  - and
the many special safety features, 'we did not want everything new - we were
looking for proven high-speed train technology,' says Mr Malcolm Southgate,
deputy managing director of European Passenger Services.
In the mid to late 1980s, the only European contender was therefore Alsthom
 -later to become GEC Alsthom - which has built the French TGV trains. The
German ICE trains had yet to start operating, and as the UK, French and
Belgian governments all wanted some manufacturing in their countries, the
Japanese Shinkansen trains did not appear to get a look in.
The original date for delivery of at least the first Eurostar trains was May
1993, in line with the tunnel's scheduled opening.
Safety requirements, in particular the need for fire protection including a
30-minute inbuilt resistance to fire to protect passengers - generated a lot
of detailed design work, but did not hold work up, says Mr Southgate.
Instead, he lists a number of reasons why the initial Eurostar 'Discovery
Programme' service is due to start only in July, building up to hourly
services in the autumn. The first was the choice of power drives. The French
TGV trains had used so-called synchronous power drives, but GEC had
developed asynchronous drives which were seen as a better bet for the
Eurostar trains because they are lighter.
The maximum load on each axle allowed by SNCF is 17.5 tonnes, and the
Eurostar trains have to carry power equipment for three networks too. But
developing the asynchronous power drives for the trains took longer than was
originally foreseen, says Mr Southgate.
There were also arguments for two years on what sort of signalling system to
use. A cab-based, rather than line-side signalling was necessary for safety
reasons - drivers would not have enough time to react to lineside signals.
Eventually a French system was chosen from a number available on the
continent, and adapted to deal with the variety of trains using the tunnel.
A more sensitive reason for the delays revolves around the method of
manufacture. Mr Southgate says the decision to build different parts of the
trains at plants in the UK, France and Belgium caused big logistical
problems, which took some time to be recognised.
It may also be relevant that the early stages of the contract came very soon
after the creation of GEC Alsthom from the merger of GEC and Alsthom's power
engineering and transportation equipment interests. The difficulties in
merging a UK and a French company loomed large in the early days of GEC
Alsthom.
In the past few months, what is hoped will be the final problem has emerged.
A complex monitoring unit designed to prevent the electrical currents
generated by the train itself from interfering with the signalling was
activated by the frequent gaps in the third, conducting rail on the UK leg
of the Eurostar train's journey. The solution, replacing about 3,000 track
circuits between London and the Channel Tunnel, is now underway.
The good news, however, is that deliveries of trains have kept pace with the
revised deadlines, and delivery of the final capital cities trains is now
scheduled for early 1995. Mr Southgate believes the capital cities service
will be up to full steam, at least for a winter service, by January or
February next year.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (14): Inter-City and coast to
coast - A basic guide to the system and how it works
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAURICE SAMUELSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Eurotunnel system consists of three parallel tunnels: two single-track
tunnels and a smaller service tunnel. They run for 38km under the Channel.
The rail tunnels will be used by Eurotunnel shuttle trains carrying road
vehicles, and by through-trains operated by the British, French and Belgian
national railways.
The service tunnel, which is linked to the rail tunnels by cross passages
every 375 metres, will be used for maintenance and also for evacuation in
case of emergency.
There are two undersea crossover caverns where the rail tunnels are brought
together, making it possible for trains to cross from one track to the
other. The crossovers divide the length of the rail tunnels into three equal
sections, any of which can be closed off in an emergency or for maintenance.
The two rail tunnels were excavated 30 metres apart and no closer than 8
metres to the walls of the service tunnel.
When it opens for business later this year:
Eurotunnel will operate a rail shuttle service for passenger and
road-freight vehicles on a rail loop between terminals at Folkestone and
Calais;
the national rail companies of Britain, France and Belgium - BR, SNCF and
SNCB - will operate through-train services. High speed passenger services,
using specially built Eurostar rolling stock, will link London with Paris,
Brussels and beyond. Rail freight services will also serve UK regional
centres.
In both Britain and France, vehicles will turn off the motorway directly on
to the terminal approach roads. After passing the toll booths, frontier
controls and security checks, they will be directed to an allocation area
before boarding the shuttles.
Vehicles will pass through both French and British frontier controls before
departure and there will be no further checks on arrival. Amenity buildings
at both terminals will offer a range of services to travellers.
Most drivers and passengeers will remain with their vehicles during the
shuttle journey, which will take about 35 minutes. The total transit time
from motorway to motorway is expected to be just over an hour.
Motorcyclists will also travel in passenger vehicle shuttles, but will park
their machines in a special section of the shuttle and travel in separate
passenger compartments. Cars and other vehicles less than 1.85m high will
travel in double-deck carriages. Coaches and vehicles more than 1.85m high
will travel in single-deck carriages.
Eurotunnel describes the passenger vehicle shuttles as well-lit
airconditioned and sound-proofed. During the journey each carriage will be
divided off from the next by sliding fire shutters. Passenger access doors
will allow free movement on either side of these fire barriers and there are
toilet facilities in every third wagon.
Cars will board the shuttle through wide access doors in a loading wagon at
the rear of each section, moving forward through the carriages until
instructed to stop. On arrival cars will leave the shuttle through an
unloading wagon at the front of each section.
The service will operate day and night throughout the year. Tickets may be
bought at the toll or in advance, but will not involve a reservation for a
specific shuttle departure. When a vehicle arrives at the terminal it will
be put on the first available shuttle.
In the early years, passenger vehicle shuttles will run at about 15 minute
intervals during peak periods and 20 minute intervals during the day. The
minimum service, at night, will be one passenger vehicle shuttle per hour.
Freight vehicles will be separated from cars before the toll booths and
follow different routes through the frontier controls and security.
The shuttle wagons for freight vehicles are not air conditioned or sound
proofed. Lorry drivers will travel in a special coach, the Club car, at the
front of the shuttle, where refreshments are served.
Initially freight shuttles are to run up to three times an hour; the overall
motorway to motorway transit time is expected to be about 80 minutes. In
addition to the rolling motorway shuttle serivce, half the tunnel capacity
has been leased to national railway companies who will operate conventional
freight and passenger through services.
Passenger through trains will link London Waterloo with Paris Gare du Nord
and Brussels Midi. Intermediate stations are at Lille and Frethun near
Calais and a third is planned at Ashford in Kent. Later there will be day
and night 'sleeper' services running beyond the three capitals.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (13): Pioneers in the chalk -
Maurice Samuelson recalls earlier attempts to burrow to France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAURICE SAMUELSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first attempt to bore a tunnel under the English Channel was made in
1880, using a machine designed by Colonel Frederick Beaumont, a retired
Royal Engineers officer with a wide experience in military tunneling.
His machine, operated by compressed air, had at its head two revolving arms
fitted with 14 cutting blades. As the chalk was cut away it fell on to a
conveyor belt to be loaded on to skips.
The tunnel, which was about 2.4m in diameter, started from an access shaft
and reached 2km in length when the project was halted. A similar tunnel was
started in France from near Sangatte. The work at Dover was stopped in 1883
when the Government obtained a High Court order to prohibit further
activity.
In 1922, a trial bore 3 metres in diameter was made at Folkestone using a
Whitaker machine. The steam-powered, electrically driven machine had
originally been developed by the Royal Engineers for mining under the German
lines in the Great War.
It was left on the site when boring ended and part of it has been recovered
and restored for display at the Eurotunnel exhibition centre in Folkestone.
In 1974, work began on a much larger tunnelling system, similar in size and
configuration to that used to complete the present tunnel. In the UK an
access tunnel was made at Shakespeare cliff near Dover and a rail access
tunnel bored to the level of the present rail tunnels.
Some 400m of service tunnel were bored before the work was abandoned in
1975. During these works the 1880 Beaumont tunnel and shaft were found to be
in good condition. They have now been sealed off.
However, the 1974 tunnelling at Shakespeare Cliff has been incorporated into
the Eurotunnel system.

Interview / Pierre Mauroy on the wooing of Mrs T
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Pierre Mauroy, the mayor of Lille, is a man whose large unflappable
features remain undented by his trouble-torn spell in 1981-83 as the first
Socialist prime minister of France's Fifth Republic, writes DAVID MARSH.
In his splendid office in Lille's belfryed town hall, Mr Mauroy recalls with
considerable pleasure his part in ensuring the tunnel's construction.
'With coal, textiles and steel, we were a traditional industrial region, a
subcontractor for the Paris region. I said you need something to strike the
imagination - above all to spur the service sector and create additional
employment.'
He says he brought up the subject of the tunnel with Mrs Margaret Thatcher,
then British prime minister, at an Anglo-French meeting in 1982.
'It was me who spoke to her about it for the first time. We were at a
Scottish castle, near the loch where the monster is found. She arrived
early. She didn't want to be too disagreeable. But she said, 'I'm not giving
you a penny.' I wanted to talk to her about the tunnel, and she kept
insisting on Britain's rebate (from the European Community budget). But I
pushed her: tunnel, tunnel, tunnel, tunnel.' At the EC summit in
Fontainebleau in 1985, Mr Mauroy says proudly, 'We came to agreement.'
Mr Mauroy sees Lille's new links to northern Europe as a vital means of
giving the region new life. Unemployment, around 12 per cent in Lille, is
however a black spot. He points out that the region's electorate voted by a
majority of 56 per cent against the Maastricht treaty in the referendum in
September 1992. 'The region is European. But the people are starting to lose
hope.'
'There is a link between development of the region and the idea of Europe.
If Europe is able to offer them a perspective for improving their situation,
they are European. If unemployment rises, and they see no way out, they
become anti-European.'
A great supporter of European economic and monetary union, Mr Mauroy says,
'If developments in Europe continue as they have done during the past few
years, it will lose the support of its citizens.' The tunnel is Mr Mauroy's
strongest hope for keeping the people of Lille on the main line to Europe.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (6): The longest subsea tunnel
 -It's a roll-call of engineering achievements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French, with their natural panache, describe it as the project of the
century. History will recall that they were correct. The Channel tunnel by
any measure ranks as one of the world's great engineering feats.
The success in completing the 50km (32 miles) crossing beneath the sea bed,
in three tunnels, under one of the world's busiest waterways compares with
the construction of the Suez and Panama canals.
Memories of the bitter squabbles over costs and delays punctuating more than
six years of construction will dim as future generations take pride in
achievements of the British and French builders.
It has been a massive feat: 150km of tunnels have been bored and lined with
more than 800,000 concrete segments weighing anything up to nine tonnes
each.
Into these have been installed more than 22,000 tonnes of railway track,
accompanied by more than 1,000 km of power cables and for signalling and
communications.
Jack Lemley, chief executive of Transmanche Link, a consortium of five
French and five British construction companies which designed and built the
project, says: 'In six and a half years we have created Europe's longest
tunnel, the longest under-sea tunnel and the world's most advanced
transportation system.'
Rail traffic and engineering management constantly monitor 30,000 separate
locations in the network - one of the largest systems of its kind outside of
the space programme. Information is relayed through these fibre optic cables
carrying 700m bits of data every second.
At either end of the tunnels are electricity sub-stations each of which is
capable of powering a city the size of Lille. Fifteen thousand supports had
to be installed inside the tunnels to carry the catenary powering the
trains. This involved the handling of about 1m separate components.
Michel Barbier, responsible for the early stages of the installation of
mechanical and electrical equipment from France, described the process of
transporting such a vast quantity of equipment and personnel through the
narrow aperture of the tunnel mouth as like 'force-feeding a goose in a very
short space of time to produce the best ever pate de foie gras'.
The goose has now been stuffed and Transmanche says the volume of mechanical
electrical equipment installed is equivalent to building 10 cement works, 20
sugar refineries or two large nuclear power stations.
The concrete linings of the tunnel have a crushing strength approaching
twice that of concrete used in pressure vessels of nuclear power stations.
They were manufactured at two purpose built factories, one at the French
terminal and the other on the Isle of Grain in the Medway and Thames
estuaries.
All of this is a long way from where the consortium started in the summer of
1987 when the British and French parliaments approved legislation allowing
construction to commence.
On the site of the completed terminals near Folkestone, Kent and at
Coquelles near Calais in northern France it is difficult to remember that
this was once open countryside. The French site now contains a development
the size of Heathrow airport. It was previously a marsh which had to be
drained before work could start. The terminal now has its own water
treatment plant capable of serving a town with a population of 20,000.
The ground of the Folkestone terminal, the size of Heathrow's Terminal Four,
had to be raised by up to 12 metres. This involved pumping 2.6m cubic metres
of sand dredged from the Goodwin Sands, thereby avoiding half a million
lorry movements.
Construction of such a vast venture had many problems. Ten lives were lost
during the building - eight on the British side and two in France  -
requiring Transmanche to improve its health and safety standards,
particularly training for tunnel workers.
Tunneling initially was very slow and cost more than planned. Ground
conditions under the British coast were much worse than expected. Salt
water, percolating through fissures in the rock, affected the delicate
controls on the 200 metre-long tunnel-boring machines.
Attempts to insulate equipment caused overheating, periodic engine fires and
many breakdowns. At one stage progress under the Kent coast was less than 20
metres a week, compared with more than 300 metres a week later.
Mr John King, director responsible for the British tunnelling, later
admitted: 'There were several times when I thought we might not make it. One
of the worst moments was when, with water still pouring through tiny
fissures in the roof of the tunnel, we had to decide whether the
modifications we had made to the machines would be sufficient to let us
proceed. If they had not worked I do not know what we would have done;
fortunately, they worked.'
At peak production, 2,000 tonnes of chalk marl an hour were be taken out of
the British end of the tunnel alone to be deposited into lagoons at the base
of Shakespeare Cliff, between Folkestone and Dover. The spoil contained
within a purpose-built sea wall added 73 acres to Britain's land mass.
In total more than 20m tonnes of spoil were removed from the tunnels along a
narrow gauge construction railway totalling more than 300km. At the same
time as spoil was being removed, concrete linings and equipment were being
brought into the tunnels.
The biggest problem facing contractors was that work was taking place before
detailed designs for many parts of the project could be completed. It was
not until plans started to emerge for the trains and transport system that
it became apparent that a cooling system, which had not been included in the
original proposal, would need to be installed. Friction caused by the
passage of some of the largest trains in the world together with heat
generated by the sophisticated signalling, communications and other
installed equipment would have increased the temperature inside the tunnels
to 50degC.
To compensate, a cooling system was installed, involving pumping 220 litres
of water a second chilled to 3degC through several hundred kilometres of
pipes. The capacity of the cooling plants is equivalent to 25,000 domestic
refrigerators.
Design changes, imposed by the Inter-Governmental Commission established by
the two Governments and responsible for granting Eurotunnel an operating
licence, also have added to delays and increased costs. In one instance, the
commission demanded that fire doors connecting the shuttle wagons be widened
by just 10cm requiring substantial re-engineering of the wagons.
The enormous air pressure created by large trains travelling through the
tunnel at up to 160km per hour meant that every component installed in the
tunnel had to be designed within specific aerodynamic coefficients creating
additional problems for designers and contractors. Supports for pipework
caused serious problems because they were too fragile even though they
satisfied aerodynamic standards.
In total, 20,000 light fittings have been installed in the tunnels, each of
which has to be taken into consideration in terms of their effect on the
temperature and aerodynamic efficiency of the system as a whole. Given the
problems that have had to be overcome it is a wonder that the project did
not take even longer and cost more to complete.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (9): Mission, start making
money - Profile / Georges-Christian Chazot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The past four months have been a baptism of fire for Mr Georges-Christian
Chazot, Eurotunnel's chief executive. Appointed in January to turn a large
construction project into a profitable transport undertaking, he has been
faced with a succession of postponements to the start of commercial
operations.
As passenger and freight services on both tunnel shuttles and the
long-distance through trains come on stream, revenues will start to flow but
up to Pounds 100m of fares have been lost.
Steering the Pounds 10bn project into profitability represents an enormous
challenge. Covering interest charges alone will cost about Pounds 650m a
year and the success of the whole venture depends on Eurotunnel both
appealing to existing travellers and persuading new ones to cross the
Channel.
At the time of Mr Chazot's appointment Eurotunnel said it did not want him
to be overwhelmed by the problems of the past but inevitably they have cast
a long shadow.
The move to Eurotunnel represented a high-profile move for a manager, who,
for all his long experience of both industry and the service sector, was
little known outside his native France. Nevertheless, Mr Chazot's career in
international companies makes him well suited to handle the challenges
facing Eurotunnel, commented one French banker.
Educated at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris and at the University of
Florida, Mr Chazot acquired a degree in electrical engineering and a diploma
in marketing.
He then spent 14 years each at Schlumberger, the international engineering
group, and CGE (now Alcatel Alsthom), the telecommunications company.
Although both are large industrial concerns, Mr Chazot counts as one of his
achievements the transformation of Saft, Alcatel's battery subsidiary, from
a company with 'a culture of high-tech arrogance to a service-minded
corporation'.
From Alcatel Mr Chazot went to Adia, a Swiss temporary employment agency,
running its French subsidiary for 18 months. This, he says, broadened his
experience of working in the service sector.
It also exposed him to a market place where price and margins were
particularly important. Eurotunnel and the ferry companies say they are keen
to avoid a price war but the huge increase in cross-Channel capacity
represented by the tunnel makes fierce tariff competition almost inevitable.
Mr Chazot's recruitment, at the age of 54, to Eurotunnel followed a search
by teams of headhunters in London and Paris. Nationality was not a factor,
according to Eurotunnel, which says it was looking for the best person for
the job regardless of origin.
Mr Chazot denies that he regards himself as particularly French. 'My basic
business education was in the US for the first three years of my business
life,' he says.
Mr Chazot has not only had to cope with the problems of commissioning the
tunnel's systems and its rolling stock. He has also had to make a mark for
himself in a post previously filled by Sir Alastair Morton. Sir Alastair it
was who brought a project riven by conflicts between contractors and
customer back on course.
He has stayed on as co-chairman, alongside his French counterpart, Mr Andre
Benard, to resolve outstanding disputes and to prepare for the raising of
another Pounds 1bn-Pounds 1.5bn of equity and loan finance.
Professionally, Mr Chazot is devoting his time to a project which may put
some ferry operators out of business. At the very least the tunnel will
capture a large part of the ferry's market share.
There is a certain irony therefore in the fact that Mr Chazot is a keen
amateur sailor, though he has never sailed his 35-foot racing yacht, Eloisa,
across the Channel. His present job has involved more journeys under the
Channel than over it.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (7): Fierce clashes all the way
 -Bronwen Maddox describes the environmentalist backlash in England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'When they came to build the Channel Tunnel they told us they didn't need
the line. So we let them build the Channel Tunnel. Surprise, surprise - this
is what we find.'
Those are the opening lyrics of Joan of Kent, a new musical now touring Kent
and London which protests against the construction of railway links to the
tunnel.
The environmental impact of the tunnel has caused some of the fiercest
debates during its planning. Most of that heat has been focused on the size
of the terminals, and the route and design of the new rail lines between
London and the tunnel mouth in Kent.
While the tunnel debate has been underway for years, in recent months the
government has shown itself to be worried about public opposition to the
encroachment of development on the countryside. It has announced a
scaling-back of road building, partly on environmental grounds.
Conservative backbenchers suggest that the desire for more conservation may
play a part in the forthcoming local and European elections, particularly in
the Conservative strongholds in the south of England. However, in the case
of the Channel Tunnel, the consortium argues that it has gone to great
lengths to minimise the impact on the environment. In building the
Folkestone terminal the construction companies transplanted a 12-acre of
woodland called Biggin's Wood, the size of Heathrow's Terminal 4, to a site
nearby when it was clear that the trees were at risk.
Environmentalists have also welcomed some features of the railway route that
has eventually been chosen. It avoids the marshes near the estuaries of the
Thames and Medway, which are rich in wildlife, particularly migratory birds.
They have also supported the decision to lay much of the new track alongside
existing road and rail routes, thus minimising the impact on previously
unspoiled countryside.
But some campaigners are disappointed that more of the lines are not buried
in tunnels, and accuse the government of underfunding the project.
Mr Robert Baxter, chairman of the transport group in the Kent branch of the
Council for the Protection of Rural England, says that part of the line will
pass through sensitive downland on either side of the Medway river, and
ancient woodland near Cobham.
Local pressure groups are also concerned about development, as yet
unplanned, which will be precipitated by the tunnel. In particular, the
mooted construction of another passenger station in Kent 'will mean large
amounts of carparks and infrastructure', Mr Baxter says. 'Those will bring
more commuters into Kent and increase the pressure on its environment.'
Environmentalists also point out that the rail lines may have difficulty in
carrying large volumes of freight because the gradients on several stretches
are steep. Freight trains may need two locomotives to overcome the gradient,
they suggest. Freight traffic, they fear, may continue to use the roads,
thereby increasing air pollution.
Further concern about the tunnel's impact centres around the problem of
disposing of the spoil from the tunnel borings.
The solution has been to deposit the rock and sand at the foot of the White
Cliffs of Dover. A platform, reinforced with concrete, has been built from
the waste, extending 1km along the cliffs and a third of a kilometre out to
sea. The top of the platform has been made into a picnic area.
However local conservationists have been concerned that the platforms, which
are about a quarter of the height of the cliffs, spoil the view of
Shakespeare Cliff which was named after a scene in King Lear.
They also fear that the platform could alter tidal flows and affect the
wildlife on the site of special scientific interest at the head of the
cliffs.
Despite these concerns, many environmentalists acknowledge that the impact
of the tunnel is considerably less than was first feared.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (10): Reid's provides oasis of luxury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINICK COYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What have the following in common: Lord Birkenhead, George Bernard Shaw, Sir
Winston Churchill, Gregory Peck, Amy Mollison (nee Johnson), King Umberto of
Italy, Sir Ernest Shackleton and the composer Pedro de Freitas Branco?
The answer is that all, at one time or another, were guests of Reid's Hotel
in Madeira.
Even its commercial competitors speak of it with awe. Said one hotelier: 'In
Madeira we have five de luxe hotels, and then there is Reid's]'
Reid's is not just an hotel; it is a luxurious tourist institution
frequented by the world's great and good. It was opened in 1891 by Willy and
Alfred Reid, three years after the death of their father, who was one of 12
children born to a Kilmarnock (Scotland) farmer in 1822. Fourteen years
later, the family doctor recommended a warmer climate for the ailing son,
William.
Now owned by the Blandy family, Reid's is unquestionably one of the world's
leading hotels, perched on a rocky cliff point on the outskirts of Funchal
and enclosed in an extensive garden which rivals the city's Botanical
Gardens where William Reid lived in a quinta (large house).
Reid's today with its 152 luxury bedrooms, 21 suites, poolside restaurants,
two dining rooms and adjacent Villa Cliff restaurant (soon to be converted
into a high-class Italian trattoria) represents tourist living on a very
grand scale. Here everyone still dresses for dinner, and in black tie. Your
daily FT, or indeed any of the world's leading newspapers, doesn't quite
come gift-wrapped, but it is hung on your bedroom door in a white linen bag.
Presiding over this expensive oasis is the Swiss-born Kurt Schmid, formerly
of the Hotel Le Plaze in Basle, the Drake in New York and the Arthur's Seat
in Cape Town. As Reid's general manager since the spring of last year, he
gives the impression of appreciating that his hotel's clientele is ageing
and that there is a need to go for new business, mainly in Germany and North
America. If tourists from there can pay for luxury, Reid's is still one of
the world's unique havens. The golf, tennis, swimming and fishing for
250-kilograms marlin are simply an add-on.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (8): The late starter has an advantage -
The island's offshore facilities cater mainly for serious investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Words like 'haven' and 'paradise' trip readily off the tongues of Madeira's
tourism promoters but are strictly taboo to the advertisers of the island's
offshore facilities. Madeira offers an international business centre with a
special fiscal regime, they make clear, not any kind of refuge or sanctuary
from the taxman.
Madeira's concern not to be dubbed a tax haven or a fiscal paradise is part
of a wider effort to promote the offshore centre as being in the top tier of
what officials prefer to call the world's fiscally privileged locations,
attracting the serious, financially-aware investor rather than the
lightweight, fly-by-night operator.
Born after a gestation period of almost a decade, the island's offshore
financial and services centre offers some premium qualifications. Membership
of the European Union provides both regulatory guarantees and full
integration with a pre-eminent market, including free circulation of goods
and services and the right of establishment.
Madeira shares this status with only Ireland and Luxembourg, given that
offshore centres in the Isle of Man, Gibraltar and the Channel Islands hang
more tenuously to the EU by various differently-defined threads.
Secondly, Madeira's offshore centre forms an integral part of Portugal.
Companies setting up on the island are governed by the same corporate law
and central bank regulations as their counterparts on the mainland and
consequently enjoy the same guarantees of legal credibility and economic
soundness.
'Companies in Madeira have to operate within an EU-wide regulatory and
reporting framework,' says Mr William Cunningham, a Lisbon-based partner
with consultants Arthur Andersen. 'Companies that don't like disclosing
their accounts will not be attracted there. The island is developing as a
base for legitimate international tax planning that can stand up to
scrutiny.'
The scope for such planning is considerable. Offshore service companies and
financial institutions in Madeira enjoy total exemption from taxes on
profits and capital gains until the end of 2011. Investors also benefit from
total exchange freedom, including free repatriation of capital and profits,
free transfers of funds used in commercial operations and complete freedom
to import capital.
This looks attractive compared with a leading EU competitor for offshore
banking operations such as Ireland. The corporate tax rate in Dublin's
offshore centre is 10 per cent, a partial tax holiday that runs out in 2005.
Furthermore, new companies will not be allowed to set up there beyond the
end of 1994. 'Being a late starter is an advantage for Madeira in this
respect,' says Mr Cunningham, 'if only because many companies will be shut
out of Dublin.'
But analysts consider it unlikely that Brussels will allow one EU offshore
zone to benefit from significantly greater tax advantages than another for
any considerable period. This means that the main competitive advantages of
such centres will be weighed in terms of costs, efficiency, accessibility,
target markets including the applicability of bilateral tax treaties,
language and quality of life.
Madeira scores high in terms of operating costs. Salaries, rents and real
estate prices compare favourably with other European locations. The island
will become within easier reach after the airport runway is extended and is
an inviting place to live. The question of target markets largely explains
why all but one of the 27 banks and two insurance companies that have set up
offshore operations in Madeira are Portuguese or branches of Portuguese
subsidiaries of foreign institutions. The only exception is ABN-Amro Bank,
which is nevertheless targeting onshore Portuguese clients.
'From Madeira we can provide all the services of an overseas branch without
the heavy costs of establishing a network abroad,' says Mr Pedro Libano
Monteiro, of Banco Comercial Portugues, the first bank to set up an offshore
branch in Madeira in 1989. Banks made good use of the island by lending to
onshore Portuguese companies at competitive rates, made possible because
they did not have to pay withholding tax on the interest. But the Lisbon
authorities wrapped them across the knuckles in March 1993 by abolishing the
exemption.
The central bank clarified the issue in January 1994 by creating two types
of offshore banking branches. Exterior offshore branches (SFEs) can deal
only with non-residents in Portugal and enjoy full tax exemption.
International offshore branches (SFIs) can deal with residents in Portugal.
They have to pay the same tax as an onshore branch except that they can
accept deposits from individuals non-resident in Portugal without having to
withhold a 20 per cent tax on the interest.
Mr David Caldeira, head of the Madeira operations of Caixa Geral de
Depositos, the only bank so far to open an SFI, says this can mean savings
of 50 to 100 basis points on the cost of financing a foreign exchange loan
to an onshore Portuguese company. Much of the private funding for offshore
bank branches comes from Brazilians who like to keep part of their savings
abroad and are drawn to Madeira by the affinities of language and culture.
Brazil is also one of the 12 countries that have double taxation agreements
with Portugal. Companies can use these to reduce withholding taxes on
royalties, interest and dividends. But Portugal is one of the few countries
whose roll of bilateral taxation agreements is, in fact, decreasing. Denmark
unilaterally severed its agreement in January 1994 because it considered
Danish investors were using the Madeira facilities to abuse Danish tax law.
Other impediments that analysts say Madeira needs to iron out include
minimum capital requirements that are much higher than those of its main
competitors; an obligation to draw up accounts in escudos showing exchange
losses or gains that can be purely fictitious for service companies whose
business is solely in dollars or another foreign currency; and the
impossibility of setting up variable capital companies by fund managers with
varying numbers of subscribers.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (11): New image for old wine - The island
is best known for an eponymous produc / Peter Wise reports that vineyards
once used for making table wine are switching to export varieties with
European support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE

<TEXT>
Madeira wine may never again attain the level of prestige advertising and
customer-driven distribution channels it commanded from the 17th to 19th
centuries. Falstaff celebrated Malmsey, the best-known variety, in Henry IV
 -an anachronism as the island had not been discovered at the time at which
the Shakespeare play is set.
America's Declaration of Independence was toasted with Madeira wine. The
island's growing importance as a port of call in the 18th century led to
voyagers such as James Cook and Horatio Nelson taking thousands of gallons
on their journeys to south-east Asia and the Americas. By 1780 more than 70
British Madeira wine shippers were based in Funchal.
Today, only seven export houses remain, but the largest in terms of turnover
are still dominated by Britons. The cachet of Madeira as a fine drinking
wine has been undermined by bulk shipment of more than half the island's
production to be used mainly as a cooking ingredient in France and Germany.
Rising production costs have turned Madeira from being the cheapest to the
most expensive of the three fortified wines - Madeira, port and sherry - in
the past 20 years. And the limited scale of the industry means that shippers
cannot support the marketing and distribution costs required to stay ahead
in an international drinks market dominated by big multinationals.
But steps are being taken to meet the challenges that an age-old industry
faces in an era of mass marketing. The Madeira Wine Institute (IVM), a state
body set up in 1979 to regulate and promote the wine, has set an ambitious
target of not only doubling production from 3.2m litres a year but also of
substantially increasing the quality of the wine and thus the value-added it
produces for the island's economy.
Less than 2,000 hectares of terraced vineyards currently cultivate the four
varieties of vine used in making Madeira wine. These produce Malmsey, a
sweet, rich dessert wine and the best-selling variety; Bual, fragrant and
full-bodied; Verdelho, elegant and golden; and Sercial, light, dry and
served chilled as an aperitif.
'The forests and mountains that cover two-thirds of Madeira mean that our
vineyards cannot be greatly extended,' says Mr Alberto Casimiro of the IVM.
But vineyards used for making the non-marketable table wine that many
Madeirans drink at home are being converted to the cultivation of export
varieties with the support of European Union funds. And vines used for
producing wines for blending into Madeira will be replaced with superior
stock.
More cultivation of the better vines will produce more high-quality,
higher-priced wine. This will put pressure on some exporters to place
greater emphasis on bottled wine than on bulk wine destined for culinary
sauces, which is younger, less technically-demanding and cheaper to produce
but also much less profitable. It remains to be seen whether the big French
and German importers who sell cheap Madeira under their own cooking-wine
labels will also be willing to adapt.
Unlike port and sherry, which are also fortified with grape brandy, Madeira
has been unable to benefit from mechanisation. 'The terrain is too hideously
steep for any machine,' says Mr Richard Blandy of the Madeira Wine Company,
which accounts for 40 per cent of the quality bottled Madeira wine market,
with annual sales of Es840m out of Es1.5bn for the whole industry. The other
cost problem is that most vineyards are minuscule. His company buys grapes
from more than 2,000 farmers each harvest.
But exporters are moving to cut costs and enhance quality by improving their
own production methods. Henriques and Henriques, a large shipper, will open
a new winery in Camara de Lobos, close to the vineyards, later this year.
Madeira Wine is investing Es800m, of which 60 per cent will be provided by
EU grants, in a new winery in the same area. It is due to be ready for the
1996 harvest.
Madeira wine shippers are also developing links with bigger drinks companies
to extend their marketing and distribution capacity. Warre, a leading group
in the port wine trade, bought a controlling stake in Madeira Wine in 1989.
La Martinicaise, a large French importer of bulk Madeira wine, has formed an
association with the shipper Justino, apparently to guarantee supplies.
Barbeito, another Funchal-based exporter, has established ties with
companies in Japan, the biggest importer of bottled Madeira wine after
Britain.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (9): The debate on tourist strategy -
Should the island stay exclusive or aim for the charter market?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINICK COYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two or three thoughts may strike the first-time visitor to Madeira on the
30km taxi ride to the island capital, Funchal, from the airport near Santa
Cruz. The highway is impressively modern - thanks to generous support funds
from the European Union - as it weaves through mountains and valleys, a
countryside not unlike parts of southern Italy, even down to the terraced
mini-vineyards.
And then there are the buildings, lots of new ones and more in the making,
small hotels, large homes and the timeshare developments. An initial
reflection: is planning getting out of control in Madeira, and is the
traditional tranquillity of an island oasis favoured by the rich and famous
(especially during the winter months) about to be ruined? On the flight back
from Funchal to Lisbon on the Portuguese mainland, the thought persists,
despite efforts by local officials who insist that planning is now well and
truly under control.
The emphasis on 'now' is important, for there is something like a consensus
on the island, and particularly with most of the main players in the tourist
industry, that things did get out of hand more than a little in recent
years. There is just a suspicion that the long-established regional
government had been rather flexible with the approval of planning
permissions, sometimes it is claimed to local political and financial
supporters.
The argument about the best tourism strategy for the island tends to be
drawn in extremes, although in truth it is relative. Should Madeira remain
an expensive quality market with top-class hotels and supporting facilities
for the relative few who can afford them, or should it shift a little or
even more downmarket to attract greater tourist numbers to somewhat more
modest surroundings? Should the aim be the individual traveller or the
charter market, albeit not on a mass scale, since the island's size and
infrastructure could not cope with, say, Spanish-type numbers?
Group Pestana, Madeira's and Portugal's largest hotel chain, is inclined to
go for greater numbers: the English Blandy family, with extensive hotel,
transportation and wine interests, wants to remain upmarket. Mr Antonio J.
da Trindade, himself an hotelier and head of the tourist section of the
Madeiran chamber of commerce, is somewhere in-between in the debate,
although he is currently developing a new upmarket hotel project with the
Blandys and some other local interests. Mrs Conceicao Almeida Estudante, the
recently appointed regional director of tourism, maintains a diplomatic
silence on the debate, but she is aware of the issue.
The argument might not be all that important if tourism was a fringe
activity, but it very definitely is not. Tourism is responsible for some 20
per cent of Madeira's gross product and gives employment to around one in 10
of the total labour force, and very many more if you add in downstream
support and supply services.
The industry peaked in 1991 with almost 400,000 tourist arrivals, compared
with only 120,000 some 20 years earlier, but it has come through hard times
in the past two years with tourist numbers down almost 10 per cent last year
as the European recession took hold. Visitors from Portugal apart, Britain
has traditionally been the largest single market for Madeira, and while
numbers were down last year, the UK still provided one in three of all
tourists to the island. Other large national groupings were German, Swedish
and French.
Madeira's tourist industry remains centred in Funchal and its immediate
surroundings, where the vast majority of the island's 16,000 hotel beds are
situated. But as the island's road network is extended west of Funchal and
eventually to the northern coastline, it is hoped to decentralise the
industry and spread tourist benefits to the poorer and mainly unspoiled
parts of the region, albeit (it is claimed) with a tighter planning regime.
The most recent of three independent studies of the potential for tourist
development, taking into account the size of the island, its population and
the need for better balanced economic growth, has suggested an optimum
number of 25,000 hotel beds with the emphasis on four-star rather than de
luxe accommodation.
Environmental considerations apart, there are certainly some limitations to
immediate expansion. Larger aircraft and more direct scheduled flights to
Funchal must await the further expansion of the runway at Santa Cruz and
deregulation of the European airline industry to permit more carriers to
land there. The indirect flights via Lisbon are both tedious and
time-consuming, and TAP Air Portugal's present virtual monopoly on the
Lisbon-Funchal route means that space is often hard to get. (The problem is
aggravated for tourists by the fact that native Madeirans get concessionary
rates on the Lisbon service, thus taking up a large slice of available
tickets.)
Again, while Madeira has a wonderful climate - the average summer weather
reading of 22 degrees falls to only 16 during winter months - it has no real
beaches, so the big hotels must provide swimming pools and this is
inevitably reflected in accommodation costs. The island does have some
stunning scenery, exotic gardens, a well-development internal transport
system of buses and relatively inexpensive taxis and marvellous facilities
for walking through the mountains and along the Levadas, Madeira's
wonderfully constructed 800km of irrigation channels that take water from
the mountain tops to the fields and villages below.
But the visitor wanting to experience one of the cleanest environments in
all Europe, and to play or simply laze on more than 7km of fine sandy
beaches, should visit (by short air trip, or by boat) the small island of
Porto Santo to the north of Madeira and part of the same autonomous region.
There are few cars for hire, but lots of taxis for sight-seeing, including
to the house where Christopher Columbus lived for a while after his marriage
to Isobel Moniz, the daughter of the local governor.
But be warned. Accommodation is very limited on Porto Santo so, as all the
good guide books say, be sure to book in advance. Most of the smart people
you will find there, especially during summer months, are the industrial and
commercial elite from Funchal who know a good find, and who tend to keep
quiet about it.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (4): Volume could treble by
1996 - British Rail expects a boom in freight traffic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opening of the tunnel creates enormous opportunities for rail freight
transport in the UK.
With few freight journeys economical at distances of less than 300 miles,
the land-locked British rail network has in the past been unable to compete
with road.
The completion of an undersea rail link with France changes all that. The
10,000 miles of British railway track will be joined to the mainland
European network of 150,000 miles.
Transit times of just 26 hours between Manchester and Stuttgart and of only
30 hours between London and Milan should now be achievable.
'The opening of the Channel tunnel will give us a very large railway to
sell,' said Mr Ian Brown, managing director of Railfreight Distribution
(RfD), the British Railways' freight arm responsible for container and other
shipments to the Continent.
Freight is expected to take up an important chunk of the 50 per cent of
tunnel capacity which has been booked by the national railway companies. It
is also forecast to account for a large part of Eurotunnel's revenues from
running shuttle trains between Folkestone and Calais.
RfD hopes that the opening of the tunnel will increase current train freight
volumes from 2m tonnes a year to 6.5m tonnes within two years and 9m tonnes
by about 2000. At present railborne freight, which goes by train ferry from
Dover to Dunkirk or by lift-on, lift-off container ship between Harwich and
Zeebrugge, accounts for just 7 per cent of cross-Channel shipments by
container, closed rail wagon or lorry.
RfD hopes to develop its container business and conventional bulkier
shipments of cargoes such as steel, paper and wood products and white goods.
It has contracted to carry Ford vehicle components to Spain and completed
Rover cars in specially built double-decker wagons to Italy.
Success will depend, to a large degree, on RfD persuading potential
customers that it can provide a high standard of service. Many shippers have
given up on BR in the past because of the unreliability of its freight
deliveries.
An important advantage of road transport is that the driver stays with his
truck to ensure that the cargo reaches its destination on time and in good
condition.
To overcome this suspicion RfD has promoted the creation of three joint
venture companies in which road hauliers and shippers also have a
shareholding. Combined Transport (CTL), Allied Continental Intermodal (ACI)
and Unilog will sell freight capacity to hauliers and freight forwarders.
Increasing rail freight traffic will also involve a change in attitudes in
the UK towards what is known as intermodal or combined traffic, the shipment
of goods by more than one means of transport, in this case road and rail.
Because of the long distances involved in mainland Europe, intermodal
traffic is much more widely established on the Continent.
Apart from containers, it can take three main forms: piggyback shipments
which involve standard truck trailers being carried on specially designed
low platform rail wagons; swap bodies which are effectively truck trailers
without the wheels; and roll-on/roll off transport where the complete road
vehicle, including the tractor unit and cab, are loaded on to the train.
Intermodal shipments within Europe rose to 20.1bn tonne/kilometres in 1993
from 19.1bn the year before and 15.4bn in 1988, according to the
International Union of Rail-Road Transport (UIRR), which groups 17 companies
throughout Europe.
The European Commission is keen to promote the increased use of intermodal
shipments to relieve pressure on busy transport corridors, to reduce exhaust
emissions by trucks and to increase road safety. It has enabled combined
transport operators to claim financial support from their national
governments for investment in equipment.
Some continental European governments have granted concessions on road tax
for vehicles involved in combined transport activities.
Germany, for example, has given 100 per cent refunds for vehicles which
carry out a specified number of journeys in a year.
The UK meanwhile is raising the weight restriction on trucks serving
regional rail terminals from 38 to 44 tonnes.
But despite the continuing growth of intermodal shipments, the UIRR is
concerned at what it sees as a bias towards roads in the European Union's
policy of liberalising transport.
With the exception of Switzerland and Austria, which are not EU members but
which are keen to get lorries off their roads and on to rail, no country has
made satisfactory efforts to promote intermodal transport, it said in its
1993 annual report.
That further investment in intermodal capacity is needed was confirmed by a
study by consultants AT Kearney. This revealed that a shortage of road/rail
terminal capacity and the lack of a standard loading gauge (which determines
the width and height of wagons) on Europe's railways were constraints on
growth.
On many journeys combined transport could compete with road on price but on
average road/rail journeys were slower than those made solely by road.
Intermodal shipments travelled at an average of 37 kilometres/hour while
road shipments went at 69 km/hour, the survey found.
Improvements in the quality of the service, more active marketing and the
creation of a standard loading gauge could lead to a trebling of intermodal
shipments, which were just 4 per cent of total shipments at the time of the
survey.
The cost of introducing a standard loading gauge would be enormous, as RfD
has found with work involved in upgrading just a small part of the British
network. Modifying even a limited number of routes from the Channel tunnel
to the Midlands, the north west of England and Scotland to what is known as
the Berne gauge would cost more than Pounds 3bn, it has calculated.
RfD has compromised by designing a new fleet of low-platform wagons, which
avoid the need for a full-scale conversion to the Berne gauge, and by
renewing bridges on key routes.
Even so, its total investment in preparing for the Channel tunnel has
amounted to Pounds 450m.
This has created a freight network which links into nine regional freight
terminals which are owned by the railways as well as a number of privately
owned terminals which are currently being developed.
If all goes well RfD hopes to have six trains a day travelling through the
tunnel this summer rising to 16 trains each way by the spring of 1995.
Britain would then be finally plugged into the European rail freight
network.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (5): Eurotunnel's strongman -
Profile / Alastair Morton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, is pugnacious, blunt to the
point of rudeness and can be a bully. At other times he can be charming and
humorous. He is undoubtedly charismatic and commands a grudging respect even
from his critics.
No one has dominated the construction of the Channel Tunnel quite like
Morton. Over the past six years he has antagonised contractors; battled with
BR and SNCF; and criticised government ministers, particularly British, for
holding back the project.
Joe Dwyer, chief executive of UK construction group Wimpey, when Morton last
summer was simultaneously threatening to sue for damages contractors, BR and
SNCF and the British government, sighed: 'Surely, we cannot all be in the
wrong.'
Morton's detractors insist that the row with British and French contractors
over their claims for extra payments could have been settled and the project
opened earlier but for his stubbornness and belligerence.
But his aggressiveness may not have been a disadvantage as far as the banks
were concerned. They needed to feel confident that they were giving their
money to a tough client who would fight to protect their interests.
The banks on several occasions supported Morton against attempts by
contractors to unseat him. It is also doubtful that Morton could have
persuaded the banks much earlier to accept the settlement finally agreed
with the contractors.
Even his fiercest critics among the construction companies admit that the
project would never have started but for the energy and determination
displayed by Morton in persuading banks and financial institutions to part
with their money in the first place and then to stick with it when the going
got tough and costs started to rise.
His sharp mind and previous experience of working in the City gave them
comfort that he would keep a tight rein on the project's finances.
Morton, 56 last January, was born in Johannesburg. His father was a Scottish
oil executive and his mother a member of an old Afrikaner family. He has
never shrunk from speaking his mind whether to journalists, fellow
executives or supposedly recalcitrant construction companies.
It appears that he almost delights in rubbing people up the wrong way. He
has been described as a man who cannot pass a calm pond without throwing a
large rock into it, just to see what happens.
He will fight fiercely, not shrinking from personal attacks, to defend his
judgment. He is a busy sender of letters and faxes to editors and others who
have taken opposing views or have offended.
For such an outspoken character, he harbours surprisingly few grudges.
One French contractor involved in the long running battles over costs said:
'After the storm there is the calm. Alastair having argued until he is red
in the face that you are wrong, will suddenly say 'OK you win' and he will
be absolutely charming.'
Equally, he has not been afraid to back his judgment when he feels he is
right. He resigned as managing director of the British National Oil
Corporation after clashing with BNOC's chairman Sir Philip Shelbourne over
privatisation.
The Bank of England subsequently prevailed upon him to take the helm at
Guiness Peat, the ailing banking group. He publicly rowed with the bank's
founder and major shareholder, Lord Kissin, over asset disposals and
resigned after a successful hostile takeover by Equiticorp of New Zealand.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke has now appointed Morton head of a working group
to encourage greater private sector investment in infrastructure.
He will not shrink from criticising government if he thinks this necessary
and contractors may yet be glad to see their former adversary lining up up
on their side.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (6): Tentacles of a top hotelier - Profile
/ Dionisio Pestana
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINICK COYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dionisio Pestana is the acceptable face of capitalism in Madeira (though he
does have a few detractors). He admits to working a 26-hour day, has no
hobbies (since he gave up squash and tennis a few years ago), does not admit
to being one of the richest men on the island - which he certainly is - and
shows no signs of easing up in his myriad business activities. But then, why
should he: he is a mere 42 years of age?
First, a few business facts. The privately-owned Group Pestana, in effect
controlled by Dionisio, runs the largest hotel chain in Madeira, but not
only that: it is the biggest hotel operator in mainland Portugal, with
extensive properties in the Algarve, Estoril and Lisbon. In addition, the
group is in effective control (the regional government has 25 per cent of
the shareholding, but no blocking 'golden share') of the Madeira Development
Company, which runs the island's expanding free trade industrial zone, the
offshore financial centre, the industrial services division and the
international shipping register.
Mr Pestana also has an interest in a charter airline, owns travel agencies
in a number of European centres, including Britain and Germany, and has even
ventured into electricity generation by buying in some windmills and
associated expertise from Denmark, 'because our group's electricity bills
were getting too high'. Overall, an extensive industrial and commercial
portfolio, and Mr Pestana is not even a native son.
The foundations of the Pestana empire go back a bit, to his father, Manuel,
who like thousands of his fellow-islanders left Madeira in the 1950s and
1960s in search of work and fortune. In those days, Madeira was slap-bang in
the sealane from Britain to South Africa via the Cape Verde islands. Manuel
took one of these passing ships to the Cape and soon built up a highly
successful construction company in South Africa and Mozambique.
Dionisio is Manuel Pestana's only child. After university, where he took a
business degree, the young Pestana went to Europe on a working vacation.
Visiting his father's island homeland, he was encouraged by Manuel's dream
of building a luxury hotel in the centre of Funchal. With foresight - the
Salazar dictatorship still ruled in Portugal - and using some of the early
profits from his construction business Mr Pestana acquired a prime site in
the city in the mid-1960s.
The timing of his arrival in Madeira could not have been better, coming
immediately after the 1974 revolution in Portugal. He explains: 'The whole
country, including of course Madeira, was in a state of shock after the
years of dictatorship. There were few entrepreneurs: no-one at that time had
the courage, resources or commercial vision to take the plunge in the new,
free Portugal. As someone from outside, I guess I saw things differently.'
His father's dream was soon fulfilled with the building of the Madeira
Sheraton (since renamed the Madeira Carlton where Mr Pestana retains his
executive offices), and was the foundation for the group's rapidly-expanded
hotels chain on the island. His next move was into Portugal itself.
While tourism in all its forms - Mr Pestana is a believer in a totally
integrated approach with the company controlling direct sales outlets,
providing air transportation and accommodation - remains the sheet-anchor of
the group, its tentacles have moved much wider.
In a dominant partnership deal, which is unusual to say the least, Pestana
has joined with the regional government to control and operate the Madeira
Development Company, and hence ownership (until the year 2017 under existing
arrangements) of the industrial zone, the offshore financial centre and the
embryo shipping register (MAR). Mr Pestana may be in bed with the local
regime, but he makes no bones about who calls the shots; his 75 per cent
stake is what counts.
And, to be fair, that appears to be the way that Mr Alberto Joao Jardim, the
president of the regional government, likes it. The International Business
Centre was conceived as an operation run for free enterprise businesses by
free-enterprise businessmen. The founding philosophy was to keep the
bureaucrats at bay and red tape to a minimum, maximise fiscal and other
operating concessions and get as much development money as possible out of
Brussels (the European Union).
Taming the bureaucrats and getting the necessary enabling legislation
through the central government and parliament in Lisbon did, however, take
its time - in fact almost the entire decade of the 1980s. But Dionisio
Pestana was not idle. When not alternatively praising and threatening the
regional and central governments, he was busy scouting out other similar
tax-free facilities, making a special study of the industrial zone at
Shannon in Ireland and of the Dublin financial services centre.
Does his considerable hold on the island's economy bring with it social
obligations to the wider community? Mr Pestana reflects for a while before
saying 'No. We're in business for profits, to make money. All our
enterprises are designed to be profitable, but it doesn't always happen that
way. To that extent, I guess, we often do end up with a social input.' As an
afterthought, and without clarification, he mentions that he does have a
'small foundation'.
The collective 'we' and 'our' in his replies seem to run against the man's
very image, a style and approach suggesting that he rules his business
empire like a dictator, a one-man executive board. Again, a brief period of
reflection, and then Mr Pestana rattles off the names of his top aides and
departmental managers. Most notably, he mentions the widely-respected Mr
Francisco Costa, who heads the Madeira Development Company.
But there is a small slip. 'Costa is my man on the company; we meet every
second Monday for discussions and policy decisions.' Its all rather precise,
but then Mr Pestana is a precise man, but he is not without wit and a good
deal of charm. He prefers living on Madeira rather than in Lisbon because he
can get around quicker and avoid the social circle in the Portuguese
capital. That, he implies, would be rather a waste of profitable working
time.
One thing is for certain: Manuel Pestana, now in retirement, can be proud of
his boy.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (7): Jardim is used to getting his own way
 -Peter Wise and Dominick Coyle profile the regional president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE and DOMINICK COYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An 18th century Portuguese naval engineer's map of Maastricht, a town now
symbolic of European integration, hangs in the office of Mr Alberto Joao
Jardim, president of the regional government of Madeira, reflecting what he
describes as his 'European soul'.
Two other plaques in the pink-walled villa of his official residence affirm
character traits that critics say are more prevalent in the 51-year-old
politician. One states simply: 'J'ai toujours raison.' The other, in
English, asks: 'Why argue? Just let me have my own way.'
Mr Jardim has been getting his own way for a long time. He has headed the
regional government since Madeira was made autonomous in 1978 and has won an
overwhelming majority on the island for Portugal's centre-right Social
Democratic Party (PSD) in 23 consecutive elections - local, regional,
national and European.
Admirers describe Mr Jardim as a forceful character who has been singularly
successful in winning support from the European Union and the central
government in Lisbon for an unparalleled period of development in Madeira.
Critics brand him as little short of a dictator who has wielded the EU's
largesse in a way largely designed to bolster his own power.
Mr Jardim acknowledges that his 16 years in office have placed a strain on
the democratic system. 'There is no doubt that a prolonged period in power
carries risks and creates dependencies,' he says. 'Voters have to choose
between the lesser of two evils: electing an alternative party whose
policies they have no faith in or re-electing the same party knowing the
dangers of protracted office.'
He has not yet decided whether to stand for re-election to a fifth four-year
term as regional president in 1996. Like many strong leaders, Mr Jardim's
chief concern is to groom a successor who will not split his party into
rival factions. Even opponents accept that he is more likely to lose his
leadership as the result of a coup within the regional PSD than through an
election victory by the Socialist party, which polls about 30 per cent of
the vote.
Why has he enjoyed the overwhelming support of voters for so long?
Certainly, he has charismatic appeal. During a recent carnival, he danced
along the streets of Funchal dressed as a Zulu. He is known to break out
into song during election addresses. 'I'm a wag and a bon vivant by nature,'
he says, drawing on a Churchillian cigar. 'But my behaviour is also
didactic. Leaders on the mainland practise politics as if it were a Roman
Catholic rite. I want to show young people that democracy is fun, natural
and human.'
People vote for him, he says, because he has improved the quality of life in
Madeira and broken down a hierarchical society. A secondary-school teacher
and part-time businessman who had taken 13 years to acquire a law degree, he
came to the fore in Madeira after the 1974 revolution that restored
democracy in Portugal; first as a journalist, then as the regional leader of
the newly-formed PSD.
Mr Jardim first approved legislation providing low-interest credit for
peasants to buy the land they worked. 'A worker wasn't allowed past the
kitchen of his boss and all hell was let loose if a poor boy wanted to marry
a rich girl,' he says. 'All that has changed. Madeira is now predominantly
lower middle class.'
He is clearly not sorry that some English families may not be as prominent
in Madeira's economy as they were before the revolution and shows
considerably more enthusiasm for rich Madeirans from emigrant communities
who have returned to the island to pursue their business careers.
Such criticisms would appear to sit ill with an English family such as the
Blandys, whose interests in areas vital to Madeira's economy such as tourism
and wine are being developed in a modern entrepreneurial spirit that must
benefit the island. But Mr Jardim is firm - some would say stubborn - in his
convictions.
His main opposition, he says, is not the Socialist party but landowners and
once-powerful economic groups resentful of the position and influence they
have lost. He complains of systematic harrying from the Diario de Noticias
of Funchal, the best-selling newspaper in Madeira, which is owned by the
Blandy family. And he is not averse to banning journalists from the mainland
at press conferences as 'a legitimate protest against the lies they tell
about me'.
Among criticisms that those on the left level against Mr Jardim is that he
stirs up popular prejudices of anti-communism and latent separatism. The
first he readily admits to: 'I am equally anti-communist and anti-fascist
but I'm not anti-alcohol nor anti-women.' The second he dismisses: 'I'm as
Portuguese as anyone from the mainland' - and considerably more European, he
claims, than many 'provincial' and 'old-fashioned imperialist' politicians
in Lisbon.
Before the last regional elections in 1992, the Socialists raised charges of
Mr Jardim's high-handed treatment of the opposition to the level of a
national debate on an alleged 'democratic deficit' in Madeira. But the PSD
was re-elected with two-thirds of the vote. It was a 'joke' that backfired
on the Socialists, says Mr Jardim, because the people of Madeira 'don't like
to see their problems debated on the mainland'.
One question on which Mr Jardim would have welcomed more debate from the
mainland was the possibility of his standing against Mr Mario Soares when
the Socialist leader was first elected as president of Portugal in 1986. Is
Mr Jardim likely to be a candidate in the next presidential election in
1996?
'Portugal has invested a lot in me and I am ready to serve in whatever
capacity my country chooses,' he says. 'But being a decorative figure like
the Queen of England doesn't attract me. I like executive power.'

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (2): Asia and Brazil targeted - Dominick
Coyle on progress at the industrial free trade zone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINICK COYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to Mr Alberto Joao Jardim, president of the regional government,
Madeira has a current unemployment rate of around 4 per cent. But
definitions are important. It may well be that only four in every 100 of the
island's estimated total workforce of more than 118,000 have no job, but
that does not cover people in training for jobs which may not be there, and
certainly does not include the considerable underemployment in the declining
agricultural sector.
Getting on for one-fifth of Madeira's labour force is engaged in
agriculture, most of them working minuscule plots for mere subsistence. The
traditional sugar industry is finished and banana growers are meeting tough
competition from lower-priced producers elsewhere.
Madeira's traditional cottage industries of embroidery, tapestry and
wickerwork are just that, painstakingly-made and beautiful products of
family cottages or very small units with a predominant female workforce.
These underemployed, highly skilled workers, and many more equally skilled
but with no work, need jobs as the island's economy is transformed away from
agriculture and towards industry and the services sector, most noticeably,
of course, tourism.
An important role in this transformation, according to the regional
government, will be played by the Madeira Development Company and, in
particular, its Industrial Free Trade Zone. The magnet to attract companies
to Madeira is a generous package of fiscal concessions, start-up grants and
worker training subsidies all wrapped round the island's full membership of
the European Union through the motherland, Portugal.
Mr Jose Antonio Camara, who represents the regional government's 25 per cent
stake in the Madeira development company, points to the island's full
membership in, and consequent access to, the European Union as one of the
zone's major attractions to non-EU companies seeking to manufacture for the
European market, but he is by no means a one-ticket salesman.
The zone's other attractions, he emphasises, include the benefit of access
to all double taxation treaties ratified by Portugal, total exemption from
any form of taxation until the year 2011, potential benefits from various EU
structural funds to help with financing projects and with the training of
workers, a stable political system and an excellent year-round climate and,
not unimportantly, low operational costs.
There are, he agrees, some drawbacks, not least transportation costs, since
Madeira is an island out in the Atlantic almost 1,000km from the Portuguese
coast. There are twice-weekly cargo sailings between Lisbon and Madeira, and
less frequent services between the island and London, Rotterdam, Bremen,
Antwerp, and also to New York, but container charges are high; the aim of Mr
Camara and his team is to trim costs at the new port now being completed to
service the freeport zone directly.
The industrial complex itself is located on a 130-hectare site at Canical on
the eastern end of Madeira, some 8km from the international airport. It is
securely fenced off and is being developed in stages.
Each site or unit has direct access to all basic infrastructure, including
energy supply, telecommunications, water and sewerage, and the supporting
port facilities include a terminal for discharging liquids and cereals by
suction, together with berthing facilities for both general cargo and
containers.
The initial development phase of the zone is now complete with 29 operating
entities, while a further 12 companies are awaiting completion of their
registration and licence procedures. Manufacturing and warehousing
activities under way include clothing, computers, watch-making, paper
products, tobacco, household appliances, optics, canning, jewellery and
petroleum products.
One of the first companies to take up residence in the zone is a garments
manufacturer. Sheenotto Industries is a Macau-Hong Kong joint venture, most
of whose output is pre-sold to the US. Its resident director, Mr Rui Alberto
Santos, himself a Madeiran, speaks glowingly of the skills and adaptability
of local workers, many of whom came from the island's craft industries.
Sheenotto recruits are put through an intensive eight-month training
programme, the cost of which is grant-aided up to 50 per cent. On the
completion of their training, workers do not have to pay any social security
contributions until they are 22 years of age, although they are covered for
benefits.
Local labour laws, which apply equally in the industrial zone, permit
short-term labour contracts of six months' duration, renewable at the
employer's option up to a limit of three years - after which workers are
either made permanent, or are dismissed.
Mr Santos, whose company employs over 150 people, is impressed with the
zone's facilities and with the enterprise and support of the development
company, but like Mr Camara, he points to heavy shipping costs and says
these will have to be reduced if the promotion of the zone is not to be
undermined. His company currently exports through Funchal.
Promotion for the industrial zone is being narrowly targeted, not least
because of a limited budget, and the focus is very much on south-east Asia
and on countries with which Portugal has traditional ties, including Brazil
and South Africa, where the development company maintains offices or
representative agents. Brazilian companies form a good slice of the initial
tenants of the zone.
All tax concessions applicable within the legal framework of the
International Business Centre, the umbrella organisation covering the
industrial zone, the offshore financial centre and the international
services division, also apply to the new International Shipping Register
(MAR). Specifically, the crews of MAR-registered vessels get their wages
tax-exempt and are not subject to Portuguese social security deductions.
What is less specific are the prerequisites on crew nationality. The
enabling legislation appears to be clear-cut: 'The captain and 50 per cent
of the crew of each registered ship should be citizens of any of the
member-states of the European Union,' itself a major concession by the
labour unions which initially insisted on half of all crews being Portuguese
nationals.
This dispute has held up the operational launch of MAR, but an uneasy
compromise has been reached with the unions and Brussels. This gives MAR's
Technical Commission flexibility in agreeing crew composition and
nationality with vessel owners 'under special circumstances'.
However, owners of registered yachts have no restrictions on crews, but they
do benefit from all the fiscal and other concessions on offer, including the
absence of any exchange controls. Overall, not a bad deal, and a great deal
better than Portugal's traditional shipping register.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (3): EU funds pay for roads - A backward
region of a backward country / Peter Wise on the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Viewed from some angles, Madeira appears to offer little hope of prosperity
for its quarter of a million people. The leading manufacturing industry is
embroidery. The island imports 85 per cent of all it consumes. Export
markets can be half an ocean away. A sixth of the workforce farms terraced
plots not much bigger than a couple of tablecloths.
But economic weaknesses are negotiating strengths when it comes to securing
aid from the European Union. EU funds currently account for a third of the
region's income and are the driving force behind an economy where output
rose by an estimated 6 per cent in 1993, while mainland Portugal suffered
recession. Construction companies are benefiting from an extensive
infrastructure programme.
Tourism is another promising sector, representing 20 per cent of gross
regional product and employing 9 per cent of a working population of
118,000. Operators differ over which niche Madeira should aim at within the
higher-income bracket of the tourism market; but they agree that prospects
are relatively bright both for earnings and jobs.
A third focus of development is the International Business Centre (IBC),
whose tax exemptions represent another perk from the European Commission.
However, its immediate impact on the economy is likely to be limited
considering that the free-trade industrial zone will employ only 3,000
people - 2.5 per cent of the workforce - when all the projects currently in
the pipeline are operating. Nor does much of the money that moves through
offshore financial and services companies stay in Madeira.
As a backward region of a backward country, Madeira has qualified for a
substantial inflow of European funds since Portugal joined what is now the
European Union in 1986. The Lisbon government raises no objection to
allocating Madeira between 5 and 7 per cent of its EU aid, although the
island accounts for only 2.5 per cent of the population.
'We could never catch up with the rest of the country if we received any
less,' says Mr Alberto Joao Jardim, president of the regional government
since 1978. 'The central government has given Madeira the fullest support in
our negotiations with Brussels and never complained that we were getting
more than our fair share.' He acknowledges that being a stronghold of the
centre-right Social Democrats, also the governing party in Lisbon, has
helped the island win favour with the central administration.
Madeira is due to receive about Es200bn in EU funds from 1994 to 1999,
double the amount transferred during the previous five years. Lisbon also
supplies about 10 per cent of regional budget spending out of the central
budget. This is to compensate for the duty the island loses on goods
imported into mainland Portugal but consumed in Madeira and for the
corporate tax paid by companies operating in the island whose consolidated
profits are taxed in Lisbon. In effect, Lisbon covers the cost of servicing
Madeira's Es100bn public debt.
Statistics testify to the development that these funds and a central
government guarantee enabling Madeira to run up debt have brought to the
island. Madeira's GDP per capita was 24 per cent of the European average in
1976; it is now close to 45 per cent. The figure for Portugal as a whole is
58 per cent. Emigration, once the only hope of affluence for the island's
workers, has fallen to a trickle. Over the same period the number of doctors
has increased threefold, the infant mortality rate has been cut from 75 to
12 per 1,000 births and six times as many children receive secondary school
education.
Most money is being spent on infrastructure. New roads sweep across the
island, cutting through the precipitous volcanic terrain by tunnel and
viaduct. 'Where do the people go on all these roads?' Mr Anibal Cavaco
Silva, Portugal's prime minister, is reputed to have asked during a recent
visit to the island, which is only 61km long and 25km wide.
Almost 200km of new roads have been built over the past 18 years, cement
consumption has increased fivefold and construction companies employ 13 per
cent of the workforce. But critics question the wisdom of pouring so much
cash into concrete and tarmac.
'The regional government has made itself popular by building impressive
infrastructures but what is going to happen when the money from Europe stops
flowing?' asks Mr Jose Carlos Mota Torres, leader of the opposition
Socialists, who have 12 seats in the 57-member regional parliament compared
with the Social Democrats' 39 seats.
The Socialists argue, as do some businessmen, that a bigger share of the EU
money should be allocated to the private sector in the form of investment
incentives. 'This would help create an economy that would be able to stand
on its own in the future without subsidies from Brussels,' says one Madeira
economist.
'The people who make these kinds of criticisms were born with a silver spoon
in their mouths,' argues Mr Jardim in his usual forthright style. 'When they
say incentives they mean subsidies. They don't know how to make a profit in
a market economy. But I'm not going to help them.' Building roads, schools
and hospitals improves the quality of life for everyone, he says. The voters
who have elected him with an absolute majority in four successive elections
so far appear to agree.
Mr Jardim adopts the same tough-minded approach towards reforming
agriculture, which provides little more than a subsistence living for 15 per
cent of the workforce. 'There is no future for agriculture in Madeira unless
people cultivate profitable crops such as tropical fruit and flowers. But
many farmers still insist on growing cabbages and potatoes,' he says. The
government provides fruit tree seedlings and flowers for farmers who want to
adapt. 'But I'll never give them money,' says Mr Jardim, 'they'd just spend
it in the tavern.'
One planned infrastructure investment is causing little controversy. The
regional government will spend about Es60bn, of which the EU will provide
two-thirds, to extend Madeira's airport runway by 500 metres. This will
enable tourism operators to bring in larger aircraft and lower the cost of
transporting cargo, which currently has to compete with passengers for
expensive and limited space. Not least, the extension, involving a
realignment of the runway, should make landing on the island a less alarming
experience.

Labour costs in Madeira vary according to industry, but they are generally
low by European Union standards. Annual wages for unskilled labour are in
the region of Es500,000 (Pounds 2,000), and roughly double for skilled
workers. Most workers are covered by employer-union labour agreements, but
this is not a legal requirement.
Social costs are high. The employer's contribution is 24.5 per cent of basic
salary, while the employee pays 11 per cent, but there are concessions
during training periods and for younger workers.
Overtime is usually payable at a rate of 150 per cent for the first hour,
and 175 per cent thereafter. Overtime worked during rest days is double the
basic salary.
There are some few variations on vacation periods, but employees generally
are entitled to one month's holiday a year, plus some 14 additional days
covering statutory holidays.
Residence permits for non-Portuguese employees are easily obtained, provided
they come from other European Union countries, or are nationals of countries
with which Portugal has close relations. These include the US, Brazil and
Sweden.
Office rents: rates in Funchal range from Es15,000 to Es30,000 a square
metre per annum, depending on location.
House rents: these again depend on location, monthly charges varying between
Es100,000 and Es150,000. A large apartment in a prime site could run to
Es200,000.
Buying a house: a four-bedroom apartment in a good location in Funchal could
cost Es30m or more.

What the user gets

For the regular air traveller between London and Paris, the Channel Tunnel
rail service is the answer to a jet-lagged dream. Farewell to the
interminable London Underground journey to Heathrow airport. Goodbye to the
air passenger in front whose seat is pushed back against your nose. No more
confused wanderings around the circular terminal one at Paris Charles de
Gaulle. Adieu to FFr250 taxi rides into central Paris.
While many travel agents expect the Eurostar railway service from London's
Waterloo station to Paris and Brussels to take business away from the
airlines, they say it will not appeal to everyone. And they are less
optimistic about the chances of the Le Shuttle car service taking business
from cross-Channel ferries.
The Eurostar service is expected to win business from the airlines,
particularly among business travellers. European Passenger Services, which
will run the trains, has indicated it will charge fares which undercut
airline prices.
Mr Simon Beeching, managing director of Wexas International, a club
organising business and leisure travel for its members, believes Eurostar
could win business even if it charged slightly more than the airlines.
'Everyone I've spoken to has said they like the idea of going by train. It
takes you from the heart of London to the hearts of Paris and Brussels,' he
says.
Mr Mike Platt, director of commercial affairs at Hogg Robinson Business
Travel International, says many of his customers have mentioned the
attractions of being able to sit around a table on trains between London and
the Continent, running through presentations or preparing for meetings -
something which is difficult to do on an aircraft.
For anyone living reasonably close to the centre of Paris or London,
travelling by Eurostar could take about the same amount of time as flying.
Door-to-door, a journey from a London suburb to central Paris is about four
hours. The Eurostar train journey between the two cities is expected to take
three hours; door-to-door travel will also be about four hours.
Mr Platt points out, however, that the Channel Tunnel rail service will not
be convenient for everyone. Many business travellers from London live in the
Home Counties and they might not be travelling to the centre of Paris. Mr
Platt says: 'If you're travelling from your office in London SW1 and going
to downtown Paris, the train is ideal. But it's not if you're going from
your home outside London to a factory outside Paris.'
The train service will also be up against one of the airlines' principal
attractions: frequent flyer points. Accumulating frequent flyer points has
become an obsession with many business air travellers, who use them to take
their holidays.
Business travel agents say that European Passenger Services should have no
difficulty developing attractive customer loyalty programmes. Paris and
London are popular tourist destinations for the British and the French
respectively. The opportunity to collect points towards a family visit to
either capital would be a strong incentive for many Eurostar customers.
If the attractions of the Eurostar services will be obvious to many, those
of Le Shuttle will be less so. Cross-channel ferries have succeeded in
recent years in making the journeys they offer more pleasant, with bright
decor, children's play areas, cinemas and better restaurants and shops.
Car shuttle services are expected to be relatively spartan, with travellers
remaining with their cars during the journey and the price of travelling by
shuttle will be higher than crossing by ferry.
But Mr Peter Shanks, retail commercial director at travel agents Thomas
Cook, points out the time advantage to travelling by shuttle. From motorway
to auto-route, travelling time by shuttle will be 60 minutes. By ferry, it
is 80 to 90 minutes.
Mr Shanks expects that by next year Le Shuttle will have 40 per cent of the
non-air, non-rail traffic, compared with 60 per cent for the ferries, and by
1996, 50 per cent.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (2): All aboard the 'bullet' -
The 160 mph train is coming down the track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are few more potent symbols of advanced technology in the 1990s than
the high speed train. The fast rail networks being developed throughout
Europe promise a remarkable reversal of the steady decline of train travel
which has been under way since the end of the Second World War.
High speed rail services have their origins in the Japanese bullet train or
Shinkansen which first went into service between Tokyo and Osaka in 1964.
But it has been in Europe, with its scattered centres of population and its
crowded transport routes, that the idea has taken off.
A growing awareness of the the potential of rail travel prompted the
European Commission in 1990 to launch a programme to bring together national
initiatives. Detailed studies are being carried out by a high speed task
force while the scope of the programme has recently been extended to include
the countries of eastern Europe.
The programme, which envisages the creation of a European network of high
speed lines by 2010, involves the construction of 5,600 miles of new track,
the upgrading of a further 9,400 miles of track and the creation of 750
miles of linking tracks.
The new lines are to take trains running at 160 miles per hour and more,
while the upgraded lines will handle speeds of about 125 mph. The aim is to
make rail an attractive option for business and leisure travel on journeys
of between 125 miles and 625 miles. Even longer journeys would be realistic
overnight.
Journey times across Europe would roughly be halved with Brussels to Madrid
falling to just over eight hours from nearly 16 1/2 hours; Brussels to Milan
to five hours 15 minutes from 10 hours 20 minutes and Brussels to Berlin to
six hours 15 minutes from nine hours.
The benefits of high speed train travel over airplanes and cars are that it
delivers passengers into city centres, it can handle large volumes of
traffic, is less polluting than other means of transport and makes more
efficient use of energy.
In addition, high speed trains boost passenger numbers on connecting slower
inter-city and suburban lines, increasing the financial return to the entire
network. They also make an important contribution to regional and economic
policies, improving links with peripheral regions.
Choked European airports, crowded skies and congested motorways have
combined to make fast rail travel a viable alternative for many travellers.
The costs of creating a pan-European high speed rail network have been
estimated at more than Pounds 60bn though it is thought that it could lead
to a quadrupling of passenger mileage travelled. Passenger growth coupled
with improved productivity could lead to the rail companies achieving a 10
per cent rate of return on the project, it has been calculated.
It is France where high speed trains have made the biggest impact and where
the most comprehensive network has been established although Germany, too,
is creating an ambitious network of high speed services.
The French railways began operating its first high-speed trains - trains a
grande vitesse (TGV) - at up to 170 mph between Paris and Lyon in September
1981, halving the journey time to just two hours and doubling the volume of
passengers using this route. The TGV Atlantique followed in 1989 linking
Paris with Bordeaux, Biarritz, Toulouse and Brittany at speeds of up to 185
mph.
The imminent opening of the Channel Tunnel led to the construction of high
speed lines north from Paris to Lille and Calais while work is also under
way on a section to the east of Paris linking the northern and southern
routes.
Germany began developing a high speed network of InterCity Express (ICE)
trains in 1988 and now has three routes in service including a link with
Berlin. The ICE trains are built by a consortium headed by Siemens while
French high speed technology has been developed by the Anglo-French company
GEC- Alsthom.
Both Spain and Italy are working on ambitious plans to establish high speed
networks but both currently run just single lines. The Spanish AVE high
speed train, built by GEC- Alsthom, came into service in 1992 on 270 miles
of specially built track between Madrid and Seville.
In Italy the Direttissima service runs between Rome and Florence although
plans for a larger network have been stalled for several years. However, a
consortium of international banks and the Italian railways is now putting
together proposals for a vastly expanded network linking Turin, Venice,
Milan and Naples.
At present no high speed service crosses a national border though this will
change once Eurostar trains, which are a modified form of TGV, start running
between London, Paris and Brussels. But it will not be before about 2002,
that high-speed services will be available on the British side of the tunnel
because of delays in beginning work on a high-speed line through Kent to
London.
The main barrier to cross-border links is the varying technologies used by
the different national railways. The Eurostar trains have been designed to
take account of three different electricity networks and four signalling
systems (including the one in the Channel Tunnel).
Track gauges, the distance between the rails, are not a problem in most of
Europe though Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Russia differ from the standard
gauge.
A problem for Britain is its smaller loading gauge which means continental
European locomotives and rolling stock are too broad and high to fit between
British station platforms or under many bridges.
Technical harmonisation is one of the biggest tasks of the task force
working on the high speed pan-European network. A priority is to create a
unified 'command and control' system, combining the latest developments in
electronics, computing, telecommunications and avionics, to replace the
incompatible national systems.
A potentially worrying development for the European task force is the
development by Germany of magnetic levitation technology whereby trains run
on a magnetic cushion above a monorail. The German government gave its
approval two months ago for the world's first commercial 'maglev' train to
run between Berlin and Hamburg at speeds of up to 250 mph.
Maglev technology has yet to prove itself in large-scale commercial use but
it does raise the prospect of a competing system which cannot be fitted into
the continental network.
Elsewhere in the world conventional 'wheels on rail' technology is being
used for the development of high speed links. The South Korean government
last month gave the go-ahead for the construction of a high speed line
between Seoul and the port of Pusan by a consortium headed by GEC- Alsthom.
Taiwan has plans for a high speed line between Taipei and the southern city
of Kao-Hsiung.
In North America, meanwhile, European manufacturers are attempting to win
contracts for high-speed lines in Texas and between the cities of eastern
Canada. To date high speed rail links have made their biggest impact in
Europe but they clearly have the potential to revolutionise medium-distance
travel around the world.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (2): Ripples in a haven of tranquillity -
The island has had great success in obtaining funds from the European Union.
But there are clouds on the horizon. Dominick Coyle and Peter Wise report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
To its devotees, who return again and again as long-stay tourists, Madeira
is heaven, or at very least an acceptable proximity. To less frequent
visitors, and to first-time arrivals, the island is still a haven of
tranquillity in an extremely agreeable year-round temperate climate.
The regulars, many of whom have spent their winters there for 20 years and
more, tend to be what retail bankers love to call clients of high net worth,
and they are prepared to pay for luxury. Others will settle for less
luxurious four and three star hotel accommodation, itself none too cheap.
In a word, Madeira can be expensive for all visitors, but for companies
setting up in free port operations there, it is one of the cheapest labour
markets in Europe.
Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal, nestles in the Atlantic off the
African coast and almost 1,000km from Lisbon. An area of some 700 sq km -
not a great deal larger than the Isle of Man - Madeira sits on top of an
extinct volcano rising some four miles from the sea. It is the dominant part
of the Madeiran archipelago, which includes the much smaller island of Porto
Santo to the north and the uninhabited islands of Desertas and Selvagens.
The discovery of Madeira in 1419 by the Portuguese explorer, Joao Goncalves
Zarco, was almost a chance event since, like his successor, Christopher
Columbus, he thought he was on a different navigational voyage. Claiming it
for Prince Henry the Navigator, he named his discovery, A ilha de madeira
(the wooded isle), and the name took root. (An island legend that Madeira
was discovered almost 75 years earlier by an Englishman, one Robert Machim,
said to have been shipwrecked there with his mistress, contains more romance
but, apparently, less historical accuracy. It is still touted by souvenir
sellers in the capital, Funchal.)
Madeira's international airport near Santa Cruz is well to the north-east of
Funchal, and the landing there is no great joy, for passengers and pilots
alike. The runway rests deep between two mountain ridges which can generate
alarming cross-currents. Fortunately, the island's charms and its
spectacular scenery quickly reduce the pulse rate of new arrivals, and a
glass or two of Madeira wine can soon complete the process.
But the airport is a problem, and according to Mr Alberto Joao Jardim, the
colourful president of the regional government since 1978, its planned
expansion by some 500 metres on stilts out into the Atlantic, coupled with a
two degree realignment of the existing runway 'is the key to the development
of the Madeiran economy'. It will cost an estimated Es60bn (Pounds 233m),
some two-thirds of the cost being met by the European Union. But it will
allow widebody aircraft to land and considerably reduce transportation costs
 -for both passengers and freight.
In fact, Brussels has been a veritable breadbasket for Madeira in recent
years, ever since Portugal joined what was then the European Economic
Community in 1986. As one of Europe's most deprived regions, and allowing
for the additional economic disadvantages of its island status, Madeira has
been raking in EU money under its regional, structural, training and any
other fund for which Brussels can be tapped. Even his detractors on the
island acknowledge that when it comes to extracting money from the EU, Mr
Jardim is a past master.
The signs of this largesse are everywhere. Virtually all major
infrastructural developments carry the 12 gold stars against the European
blue background, proclaiming who is really paying the piper. The internal
debate, and it is considerable, is not about getting Brussels money, but on
how it should be spent. The Jardim regime says it should go on more and
better roads, new hospitals and education. Its critics would like more of
the EU support to go towards modernising industry and in developing tourism.
Mr Antonio J. Trindade, a hotelier and head of the tourism section of
Madeira's chamber of commerce, believes there should be a better
relationship between the regional government and the industrial and services
sectors, and a more even distribution of the cash cow from Brussels. Other
critics think that new highways are important for opening up much of the
island outside Funchal to tourist development, but they ask rhetorically
whether getting from A to B five minutes faster on a small island amounts to
a great economic achievement or the best use of resources.
Mr Jardim will have none of this, claiming that his critics are the few
remaining big landowners and some long-established British families, whom he
seems to view as a somewhat lower order than the natives, or the small
farmers who are seeking subsidies 'but who just want to spend it in the
tavern'. All are agreed on one thing: as long as Brussels will pay, let us
get as much as possible.
Madeira has definitely benefited from the subventions from Brussels. In the
mid-1970s, the island's per capita income was less than one quarter of the
European average; today it is close to half, and not all that much behind
that of Portugal itself. The Lisbon government has been generous to the
island whose population of around 254,000 is less than 3 per cent of
Portugal's. Nevertheless, Madeira is getting some 6 per cent of all EU
support going to Lisbon. The fact that the political structure of Mr
Jardim's regional government mirrors that of the ruling centre-right Social
Democratic Party on the mainland may also have helped.
Impressive infrastructural developments apart, EU funds have assisted in the
establishment of the main activities now being co-ordinated by the Madeira
Development Company. These include an industrial free trade zone, an
offshore financial centre, an international services facility and a new
shipping register.
An extensive range of attractive tax and support concessions through to the
year 2011, provided under Lisbon legislation and approved by the European
Commission, is the magnet to attract new industry, banking and related
financial services. In essence, the industrial free trade zone is the
regional government's main instrument for creating jobs, not just for the
existing unemployed (under 5 per cent of the island's workforce), but for
the thousands more who are underemployed in the declining agricultural
sector.
It is early days yet, and the development company's promotional activities
have been held back by the slow progress of the enabling legislation through
the Lisbon parliament, but the initial signs are encouraging. Add in the
sizeable revenues from the tourism sector, despite two poor years since the
1991 peak, and the island's economic performance is impressive. Provisional
figures estimate last year's growth at around 6 per cent, compared with a
sharp recession in Portugal itself.
On Madeira how the regional government allocates the funds from both Lisbon
and Brussels is inevitably the main driving force in the economy, together
of course with the dynamics of the tourist industry. The immediate outlook
is positive, but there are some in Funchal who see a possible dark cloud on
the horizon, although the majority view is that their forecast is too
pessimistic. It touches on South Africa after last month's general
elections.
Folk of Madeira origin, either born there or first-generation settlers in
South Africa, are estimated to outnumber the entire population of the island
by two to one. What if they were all to come back, or even some of them,
many of whom would almost certainly be of the older generation? Such an
influx would produce extraordinary economic and social strains, but the
signs are that preliminary planning by South African Madeirans is focused
more on Canada and Australia than on their original homeland. Madeira is
keeping its fingers crossed, although it is known that the Lisbon government
has made contingency plans, just in case.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (1): Step that meets the spirit
of the age - The opening of the Channel Tunnel strengthens the argument that
the destiny of Great Britain lies in and with Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One more barrier in Europe has fallen, of supreme importance, though neither
the largest nor the last.
In 1987, when Britain and France ratified the Channel Tunnel accord, few
would have predicted that it would come to fruition seven years later with
east and west Europe reunited by the end of the cold war.
The tunnel to be opened today by Queen Elizabeth II and President Francois
Mitterrand forges a further link in the chain of contact and cooperation
across a continent that again is whole and free.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.' After months in which
elation over the tunnel's prospective opening has been tempered by
frustration at delays and financial overruns, Charles Dickens' classic line
aptly describes the mood at Eurotunnel, the operator of the 32 mile (50km)
link.
Dickens' introduction to A Tale of Two Cities - now separated by a mere
three hours' rail journey between London's Waterloo and the Gare du Nord in
Paris - also sums up the state of Europe. The walls and the watchtowers of
east-west division have disappeared. Yet the continent is beset by strains
engendered by recession, deep-seated changes in economic structure, the
break-up of the Soviet empire and German reunification.
The continent must now manage an arduous transition. The momentous task of
tunnelling beneath the Straits of Dover symbolises the challenges Europe
faces and the trials it has yet to overcome.
The stretch of water between Britain and France has a central place in the
history and folklore of the two nations, both in peace and at war. During
the past 200 years, the idea of joining Britain and France has sporadically
occupied the minds of engineers and admirals, financiers and functionaries,
schoolboys, prime ministers and madmen.
The problems of constructing the world's longest undersea tunnel cannot be
gainsaid. Accomplishing this ambitious infrastructure project without
recourse to government funds has been more exacting than the optimists
forecast.
The tunnel's overall cost has grown to Pounds 10bn. This is more than double
Eurotunnel's estimate when construction started six years ago, a time when
buoyant economic conditions spurred wishful thinking.
As a result of tortuous teething troubles, a full freight and passenger
service will not start until October, causing a large financial loss in the
first year of operation and exacerbating pressure on banks and shareholders.
Yet when the overall assessment of the enterprise is drawn up, these burdens
should not be allowed to weigh too heavily in the balance. If the skill,
ingenuity and perserverance deployed in building the tunnel can be turned
towards fashioning the new Europe, then the continent's salvation is
assured.
The historic rapprochement between the UK and the rest of Europe advances
one more pace. Britain remains tied by formidable bonds of blood, heritage
and shared experience to America and the Commonwealth. Yet the tunnel makes
more evident and more acceptable the reality that Britain's destiny lies
with and in Europe.
The French President and the British Queen will today turn a new page in
relations between two countries joined and separated by a rich vein of
turbulent history. In 20 years, the chroniclers of the century's final
decade may speak of a new heading. In 50 years, with luck, they may be able
to point to a new chapter.
In psychological and geographical terms, today's event is unquestionably of
greater magnitude for the UK than for the French. Britain's land connection
to the rest of the European Union has hitherto been limited to the troubled
border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.
France is already joined physically to Spain, Belgium, Germany,
Switzerland,Luxembourg and Italy. From now on, all these countries will
appear, to British hearts, a small but perceptible degree closer than
before.
Construction has marked an effort of colossal technical, financial and
political complexity. Environmentalists' objections have had to be acted
upon, politicians' egos massaged, bankers' nerves calmed, terrorists'
ambitions (with luck) thwarted.
The tunnel sets a milestone for many reasons. Achieving such a project
without public sector funding has necessitated imaginative and controversial
financing techniques.
The venture has literally unearthed new ground in construction and civil
engineering technology. It has spurred salutary competition on a
much-travelled route on which sea operators up to now have enjoyed natural
dominance, and has opened new perspectives for rail transport and freight
haulage across Europe.
The tunnel has intensified Anglo-French cooperation in areas ranging from
handling equity flotations and harmonising railway signal equipment to
commissioning boring machines and providing fences against rabies-carrying
foxes.
More than anything, it is a project both in line with and in advance of the
spirit of the times. The two governments were able to reach agreement on a
project embodying many of the concepts of economic policy that have come to
dominate the agenda of the 1990s: competition, the primacy of private sector
finance, the drive to complete the barrier-free single market.
For all the commonly-held belief in the constancy of national
characteristics, the tunnel illustrates what has changed in Europe. The
British were once renowned as a race of railway-builders, the French - at
least in the popular imagination of the English - as a people incorrigibly
wedded to time-honoured preservation of their forefathers' paysage.
In the latter part of the 20th century, these roles seem to have been
reversed. Ludicrously yet endearingly, Britain has failed to construct a
high-speed train link to join the tunnel to London. By contrast, the French
engineers of the Polytechnique and the Ecole des Mines have unswervingly
pressed new lines into service to ensure Eurostar trains race across the
Nord-Pas-de-Calais plain before ambling through the hop groves of Kent.
The tunnel, by itself, will make neither France less French, nor Britain
less British. It represents a step towards European convergence, but also
illustrates the continent's abiding diversity.

FT  06 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market was startled by the 19 per cent dividend increase announced
by British Petroleum and hoisted the oil company's shares to an all-time
high of 408p, before a flurry of profit-taking left the stock a net 16 1/2
up at 399 1/2 p.
Turnover was 21m shares, the highest day's business in the stock since its
preliminary results in February.
Dealers in the oil sector acknowledged that the figures were startlingly
good but posed the question as to why BP was hastening to reinstate a
dividend cut made only two years ago. Some of the more cynical traders still
harboured a suspicion that the Kuwait Investment Office might be waiting for
a good opportunity to place its near 10 per cent stake in BP, the residue of
the 22 per cent holding the KIO built up in the late 1980s.
But industry analysts were at pains to applaud BP's performance. 'It is very
hard to criticise these figures. The company is enormously leveraged to
European recovery in refining and chemicals,' said Mr Jeremy Hudson at
Lehman Brothers, the US-owned brokerage concern.
Hoare Govett, BP's broker, described the figures as 'stunningly good' and
the stock 'undervalued'. Goldman Sachs forecast that the shares would reach
the high 400s later in the year. Mr Keith Morris at Schroders, a long-time
bull of BP, said the shares' performance demonstrated the market's belief
that the company can still make decent profits at Dollars 15 a barrel.
Reports of swingeing cuts to come at Do It All, the home improvement
subsidiary of Boots and WH Smith, boosted the shares in both companies. 'If
true, this degree of rationalisation at this price represents good value for
Boots and Smith,' said one stores specialist. The report that around half -
or 100 - of the DIY outlets would be shut or sold at a cost of some Pounds
60m compares with City predictions of 50 closures at a cost of Pounds 55m.
Boots added 12 at 559p, while Smith 'A' put on 12 at 506p. Boots was also
refusing to comment on US press reports that it was talking to HJ Heinz over
the sale of its Farley baby food subsidiary.
The strong rally by the Hong Kong market triggered a big recovery in stocks
such as Standard Chartered and HSBC Holdings. The latter jumped 29 to 698p
and the former, whose shares are scheduled to be split four-for-one this
morning, rose 29 to 965p.
Barclays advanced 13 to 512p following the annual meeting, while Lloyds
closed 20 better at 579p. Bank of Scotland fell to 177p immediately
following the preliminary figures, reflecting profit-taking, but rallied to
close a net 5 up at 188p.
Zeneca improved 9 to 697p ahead of its annual meeting today, and a
presentation to analysts on Monday at its research base in Cheshire. Lehman
Brothers was also said to have recommended the stock at a pharmaceuticals
conference focusing on emerging markets. Wellcome, another of Lehman's
favoured stocks, moved up 13 to 563p.
ICI, 12 firmer at 830p, benefited from the improved figures at BP, which
revealed that its chemicals division had moved into profit for the first
time in 18 months.
Chemicals group Laporte slipped 6 to 808p, with one securities house
believed to be offering a line of 1m shares around the market.
Turnover in whisky manufacturer Burn Stewart reached 6m shares as 5 per cent
of the company changed hands. Dealers said the shares were bought at 108p
and placed in the market at between 110p and 111p, with Cazenove thought to
be responsible. Burn Stewart dipped 2 to 116p.
Management changes at Bass were said to have unnerved some investors,
together with a bout of profit-taking after a recent good run. The stock
retreated 9 to 558p. Scottish &amp; Newcastle, up 11 at 523p, and Whitbread,
ahead 16 at 564p, benefited from switching from Bass.
Sparkling spirits figures from LVMH's Far Eastern operations helped Guinness
put on 6 at 482p. Luxury goods group Vendome moved forward 14 to 452p.
Airtours fully-paid shares surged 39 to 469p after presentations to Scottish
institutions. The nil-paid doubled in value to 79p.
Turnover in Rolls-Royce rose to 9.9m and the shares hardened 4 to 194 1/2 p
on reports that the group may win a substantial order from Saudi Arabia.
Queries over the safety of the Channel tunnel cast a shadow over operator
Eurotunnel ahead of today's official opening. The shares relinquished 8 to
460p.
The market appreciated news from conglomerate Wassall that it planned to
acquire General Cable, of the US, in a Pounds 178.7m deal, to be partly
funded by a rights issue. The shares jumped 18 to 320p.
Food retailers continued their encouraging run. Argyll climbed 13 1/2 to 251
1/2 p on 9.8m traded, Kwik Save 16 to 567p, Tesco 8 1/2 to 223 1/2 p on 11m
dealt and J. Sainsbury 14 1/2 to 392 1/2 p also on 11m.

FT  06 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy sale of Reuters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News and financial information group Reuters Holdings was the most heavily
traded stock in London and recorded one of its highest daily turnover totals
since flotation. The volume was boosted by a Pounds 65m stake sale, believed
to have been carried out by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, executed an agency cross of 13.5m
shares. The deal accounted for 27m of the day's final turnover of 34m shares
and was concluded at 480p a share.
The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority bought 12.5 per cent of Reuters in 1984
and was recently quoted as holding just under 7 per cent of the company's
shares. Yesterday's deal represented a reduction of 0.8 per cent.
It came just days after Reuters' key European presentation to analysts and
potential customers in Geneva. However, most analysts did not believe that
it pointed to a change of heart by the company's leading shareholder. They
pointed out that Reuters shares had outperformed the FT-SE-Actuaries
All-Share Index by 40 per cent over the past year. With the potential
pressure of the trade out of the way, the shares ended the session 11 higher
at 500p.

FT  06 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery in UK gilts and sterling helped stock index futures shrug off
the gloom seen in recent sessions and the advance helped to pull the
underlying cash market higher, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 finished at 3,105, up 48 from its
previous close but at parity with the underlying cash market. Volume was
12,313 contracts.
Earlier, sellers of the contract dominated trading, with Goldman Sachs
reported to have been particularly active in the first hour. Having opened
at 3,051, June fell to the day's low of 3,045, dragging the cash market
lower.
The improvement in UK gilts, along with a more steady performance in the
other European bond markets, helped to reverse the earlier retreat, with the
underlying cash market once again following suit. The high of the day was
3,112, reached in the last half-hour of trading.
In the traded options, total volume of 36,718 was little changed from
Wednesday's figure. Most of the trading activity was in the index options,
with the FT-SE 100 option trading 12,508 lots and the Euro FT-SE option
8,042 contracts.
Hanson was the busiest stock option with a total of 2,142 lots dealt. The
August 260 calls were said to have been the busiest series. Argyll Group was
next at 1,776 lots.

FT  06 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE regains 3,100 as dollar
tensions relax - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The absence of further devel-opments in the US dollar left the London stock
market to stage a technical recovery yesterday which took the FT-SE 100
Index back above the 3,100 mark as UK voters went to the polls in the local
elections. The day was enlivened by good trading figures, an increased
dividend from British Petroleum and a Pounds 65m deal in Reuters as the Abu
Dhabi Investment Authority lightened its stake in the global financial
communications group.
The equity rally was helped by a recovery in British government bonds and in
sterling, but analysts took a restrained view of the 35.5-point gain in the
FT-SE 100 to a close of 3,106, just a shade below the day's best level.
The market fell by 14 Footsie points in early trading but this appeared to
be a reflection of the Reuters deal. The US investment bank handling the
business was believed to have sold the June stock index future first as
insurance against the possible effects of the transaction in Reuters stock.
Once this deal was done, the US house bought back the futures contracts and
the underlying market turned higher.
The sharp rise in BP shares caught some securities traders wrong-footed and
the trading screens briefly showed a backwardation - when some marketmaker
bid and offer quotations are briefly out of line - as at least two US houses
battled to change portfolio stances on the stock.
Higher dividend payouts from both BP and Bank of Scotland reinforced
optimism on corporate earnings and gave the market a significant boost.
Later, as it became clear that the central banks had no immediate plans for
further moves to support the US dollar, tensions relaxed and shares moved up
smartly.
London was helped at the close by initial firmness on Wall Street, although
analysts warned that the US payroll data, due today, could present the
Federal Reserve with a further opportunity to tighten credit.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index climbed 12.9 to 3,770.6. Seaq volume of 688.5m
shares was some 20 per cent up from Wednesday's figure which, in turn,
reflected retail business worth Pounds 1.22bn, at the lower end of recent
daily averages.
The blue chip sectors were boosted by the oil majors, which are heavily
weighted in all leading market indices. Elsewhere, the share price gains
were more scattered, with many of the best performances coming from stocks
which had suffered the most over the past two weeks.
The pharmaceutical sector, where the multinational leaders are undergoing a
spree of acquisition moves sparked by moves into the US by some European
groups, reported a calmer session yesterday.
Firmness in UK bonds, which have clearly shown this week that they can still
upset the equity sector, provided an underpinning for the recovery trend.
But doubts were expressed as to whether the US dollar has yet stabilised and
analysts admitted that stock markets remained highly vulnerable to the next
move to tighten credit policy at the Federal Reserve. Such a move is widely
expected at some time in the near future and the timing could now depend on
the dollar.
Meanwhile, the UK equity market will watch sterling today to see the effects
of the outcome of the local elections.

FT  06 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks wary ahead of
economic data
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US stocks moved in a narrow range yesterday as many investors stayed on the
sidelines ahead of today's important economic data, writes Frank McGurty in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.78 easier at 3,695.97, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dipped 0.34 to 451.38 in uninspired trading. NYSE
volume came to 255.7m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE
composite receded 2.09 to 441.70 but the Nasdaq composite edged up 0.25 to
740.55.
With the Labor Department due to release its report on April employment
trends this morning, investors were generally unwilling to make fresh
commitments. The data will give them the first comprehensive reading of the
economy's strength in the second quarter, and could suggest the timing and
aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve's next move to lift interest rates.
Economists were expecting an increase in non-farm payrolls of about 170,000,
after March's surge of 456,000, the largest monthly gain since October 1987.
The announcement yesterday of a slight rise in claims for unemployment
benefit last week gave reason to be optimistic that inflationary constraints
were not developing in the labour market.
Bonds were little changed, but equity investors in recent sessions had
tended to downplay movements in the Treasury market. A modest rally by the
dollar against the yen and D-Mark was generally ignored.
With US chain stores reporting April sales, retailers were relatively
active. The results were mixed. Sears Roebuck rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars
48 5/8 on a 12.3 per cent sales jump for stores opened at least a year. Gap,
with no change in same-store sales, fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 47 1/2 .
FPL Group, the holding company for Florida Power &amp; Light, dropped Dollars 2
1/8 to Dollars 31 3/4 when Merrill Lynch lowered its ratings on the stock.
British Petroleum ADRs jumped Dollars 3 to Dollars 71 7/8 on strong
first-quarter results.
In financial services, Salomon climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 50 after its
board waived a restriction preventing Berkshire Hathaway, controlled by Mr
Warren Buffett, from raising its stake in the company to more than 20 per
cent before October.
Southwest Airlines retreated Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 28 1/2 amid fears that
it would lose booking after being ejected from a big computerised
reservation system.
Canada
Toronto finished a cautious session easier as golds declined and nervous
traders awaited the Ontario budget, presented just after the market close.
The TSE 300 index slipped 9.4 to 4,259.8 and falls led rises by 412 to 302
after volume of 71.4m shares. The golds group lost 2.0 per cent as the
bullion price fell USDollars 2.90 an ounce.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo dropped 8 per cent, hit by a sharp fall in blue chips
and a general sense of frustration with the government's handling of the
economic plan. The Bovespa index ended 1,259 down at 14,479.

FT  06 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Australia falls to
7-month low on job package worries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the exception of Hong Kong and Bombay the region's markets were easier,
partly affected by the overnight fall on Wall Street. Tokyo remained closed
for Golden Week - the market reopens today - while Seoul and Bangkok were
also on holiday.
AUSTRALIA fell as investors worried over what the government might do to
finance its ADollars 6.5bn job creation programme. The All Ordinaries index
declined 30.3 to 1,988.1, its lowest close since October 1993. Turnover was
ADollars 581.6m.
The market has fallen 15.4 per cent from its all-time high of 2,350.1 set on
February 3.
News Corp, which lifted its nine-month net profits by 54 per cent to
ADollars 991.6m, retreated 29 cents to ADollars 9.22. Brokers remarked that
the result was within expectations and that profits had been taken after the
stock's recently strong performance.
Speculation that Leighton Holdings could win the bid for Sydney's ADollars
800m casino, to be announced today, left the shares 10 cents up at ADollars
2.30.
The golds index declined 40.5 to 2,001.0, with Newcrest shedding 25 cents to
ADollars 5.35.
HONG KONG staged a late technical rebound to finish modestly higher, the
Hang Seng index gaining a net 43.44 at 8,412.88 after hitting an intraday
low for the year of 8,249.20 in morning trade.
Sentiment remained weak, with the poor health of Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese
leader, among factors overhanging the market. Properties, regarded as
oversold in recent sessions, rose 220.05, or 1.6 per cent, to 14,405.71.
Among smaller stocks, Sum Cheong jumped 26 per cent, or HKDollars 1.25 to
HKDollars 5.90 on rumours, later denied, that its application for a
Singaporean listing was being reconsidered.
MANILA saw profit-taking after Wednesday's 4.3 per cent rise, with
Philippine Long Distance Telephone leading the sell-off. The composite index
dipped 84.05 to 2,980.00 in turnover of 1.4bn pesos.
PLDT receded 3.5 per cent to 1,925 pesos, largely on arbitrage related
activity, although a 13 per cent fall in its first-quarter net profits
affected sentiment.
KUALA LUMPUR recorded its largest single-day fall since April 4, the
composite index dropping 21.24, or 2 per cent, to 1,007.01. Volume eased
from 146.8m shares to 139.6m.
Golden Plus, an investment holding group, relinquished 60 cents to MDollars
11.40 on profit-taking following a sharp rise last week on suggestions that
it might establish a gaming venture in China.
SINGAPORE fell on light selling by foreign funds which, said brokers, could
be switching into the cheaper Hong Kong stock market. The Straits Times
Industrial index closed 23.34 lower at 2,277.74. Volume stayed thin, at
121.9m shares.
DBS Land eased 2 cents to SDollars 4.68, although it denied that it was
planning a share placing. Seapower Asia Investment, to be taken over by
Richard Li, son of the Hong Kong billionaire Li Kah-shing, fell 31 cents to
SDollars 2.03, with investors disappointed by a poor offer price, SDollars
1.45, and a weak 1994 outlook.
TAIPEI saw late profit-taking and, after a high of 5,993.03, the weighted
index ended just 9.23 up at 5,916.77. Turnover was TDollars 89.8bn (TDollars
84.29bn).
Plastics attracted late buying on expectations for the industry's improving
profits. Formosa Chemical Fibres surged TDollars 1.90 to TDollars 38.40 and
China Petrochemical moved ahead 60 cents to TDollars 27.60.
The textile sector led early gains on reports that Hualon Corp, a leading
textile company, had been granted British loans for its investment in
Northern Ireland. A Hualon spokesman declined to confirm the reports. Hualon
ended 40 cents higher at TDollars 26.80.
BOMBAY recovered from the day's lows on buying by Indian mutual funds and
brokers on expectations that the carry forward or badla trading system would
be reintroduced in the near future. The BSE index rose 13.76 to 3,614.24.
There was no immediate confirmation from the government of the rumour. The
ban had been introduced by the Securities and Exchange Board of India on the
grounds that the local system of forward trading had been leading to
excessive speculation.
WELLINGTON tumbled 2.9 per cent to a 1994 closing low of 2,012.82, with the
bearish tone set by Telecom, weaker in the US overnight and shedding 28
cents to NZDollars 4.65. Telecom reports annual results on May 13.
Weakness in Telecom flowed through into the other leaders, but their falls
were not nearly as pronounced. Turnover, at NZDollars 60m, was at its
highest level so far this week.
KARACHI closed higher on institutional support which erased early losses and
took the KSE index up 23.65 to 2,405.37. COLOMBO put in a recovery after a
bear run, the CSE all-share index improving 26.09 to 1,017.17 after a 12 per
cent fall in the previous four trading days. Turnover rose from Rs142.8m to
Rs191m.

FT  06 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Nintendo shares no fun in 1994 - Emiko
Terazono on reaction to the gamemaker's revised forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nintendo, the Japanese leading video game maker, has had a bad time on the
Tokyo stock market over the past seven months.
Poor sales in Europe, the strengthening of the yen, the lack of new products
and increasing competition have hurt earnings, forcing the company to revise
down its initial profits estimates for the business year ended last March.
This year the stock has lost 9.5 per cent, in sharp contrast to the Nikkei
225-share index which, in spite of its recent weakness, is still 12.3 per
cent to the good.
There has been turmoil in video game shares since the Nintendo sell-off
started last October, following its downward earnings revision. The
revelation that the company would be posting its first earnings decline in a
decade with pre-tax profits of Y121bn, against earlier expectations of
Y170bn, prompted panic selling of the stock and of other game makers'
shares, including Sega Enterprises.
Nintendo, hovering around Y9,400 before the announcement, plunged to Y7,000
by the end of the year, while Sega lost 23 per cent over the two months to
December. The sharp falls followed a spectacular rise on growth expectations
during the late 1980s. 'Nintendo was overbought and is suffering an
aftermath,' says Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel in Tokyo.
Many investors, too, had not expected the company to be hit by the global
recession and by competition in Europe, where it faced increasing
competition from Sega. Nintendo was also slow in responding to consumer
demand in quality graphics, and fell behind Sega in introducing 16-bit high
quality video game hardware.
The unexpected appreciation of the yen has also hurt profits, since the
company exports all of its products for the US markets from Japan. Company
officials have hinted that the rise in the yen during the first quarter of
this year may have done further damage.
For the current year, analysts are pessimistic. Nintendo wants to
concentrate its resources on joint product development of a 64-bit machine
with Silicon Graphics, the US computer company, and will not join the race
with Matsushita Electric Industrial and Sony, the consumer electronics
companies, and Sega all introducing new 32-bit products this autumn.
Over the long term Nintendo may regain its innovative reputation due to
high-tech advances from Silicon Graphics. But in the short term its failure
to bridge the new product gap between now and next year is expected to
undermine its status as the industry leader.
For investors, Sega may now be the pick of the video games industry. To
minimise currency risks and cut costs, the company has shifted 50 per cent
of its production to Taiwan, Hong Kong and China, and is able to subsidise
its earnings with income from its arcade business. 'At the moment, Sega
seems to be looking best for Christmas,' says Mr Joseph Osha, an analyst at
Baring Securities.

FT  06 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Madrid rebounds after Gonzalez
performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses recovered some ground in the afternoon, with political uncertainties
offering a variety of effects, writes Our Markets Staff.
MADRID got another pound of flesh as Mr Carlos Solchaga, effectively the
Spanish Socialist party's chief whip, added his resignation to those of two
other goverment ministers; but it enjoyed an unflappable performance from
the prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, who refused to resign and pointed to
support from the Catalan nationists. The currency, bond and equity markets
went up in tandem.
Mr Salvador Martinez, of the international sales desk at Asesores Bursatiles
in Madrid, observed that equitities, down 6 per cent since the latest bout
of political scandals began, would probably have risen if Mr Gonzalez had
resigned, or called new elections. As it was, the market got an interim
conclusion and, after hitting a low of 307.57, the general index responded
with a rise of 4.68, or 1.5 per cent to 316.25.
AMSTERDAM was easier, although a sharp fall in Philips, on profit-taking
following strong results earlier in the week, was set against a good gain in
Royal Dutch. The AEX index slipped 1.01 to 410.73.
The market remained slightly uneasy following this week's general election.
This resulted in a loss of power for the Christian Democrat/Labour party
coalition, and necessitated the search for what is expected to be a
three-way combine.
NatWest Markets said that anew administration could be formed from the
Labour party, the Christian Democrats and D66, a left-of-centre grouping,
under the premiership of Mr Wim Kok, of Labour. This solution would be
satisfactory for the Dutch financial markets, NatWest added, since there was
likely to be a continuation of 'the reasonably tough monetary and fiscal
stance of the previous Lubbers government, with no threat to the strong
guilder.'
Philips fell Fl 3.10 to Fl 53.50, while its Polygram subsidiary added Fl
1.90 to Fl 75.80. James Capel yesterday downgraded Polygram to hold, and
said that it preferred Philips on the basis that, in the short-term,
cyclical stocks were likely to outperform the market.
Royal Dutch improved Fl 2.70 to Fl 200.70 helped by a gain in crude oil
prices.
PARIS took comfort from another slight easing by the Bank of France in the
intervention rate - the third in as many weeks - and the CAC-40 index gained
21.05 or 1 per cent to 2,162.62.
Turnover remained weak, estimated at below FFr3bn.
One of the day's features was Rhone-Poulenc, off FFr3.20 at FFr151.80, but
up from a session low of FFr148.20, following a sharp fall in first quarter
profits. The chemical group's results were in line with most analysts'
expectations.
LVMH featured among the day's risers, the shares advancing FFr22 to FFr941,
after it reported a 28 per cent increase in first quarter turnover.
FRANKFURT fell on the session, the Dax index losing 13.18 at 2,235.84 under
pressure from falling bond prices and worries about the weakness of the US
dollar. However, the afternoon sawa bounce in the bund future, said Mr Edgar
Benischek, head of trading at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, and the
Ibis-indicated Dax went along, reaching a post-bourse close of 2,249.78.
Turnover eased from DM8bn to DM7.8bn. Lufthansa resumed trading after a
day's suspension to announce a rights issue and the privatisation of the
government's stake in the airline; the share's outperformance over the past
year, however, was reversed on profit-taking for a drop of DM13.80, or 6.3
per cent to DM206, and only slightly retrieved with a rise to DM208.40 after
hours.
ZURICH focused on falls in shares influenced by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ Bank as
Swiss equities continued their general downtrend.
The SMI blue chip index fell to a new closing low of 2,680.8, down 24.8 but
up from an intraday low of 2,667.3. Roche certificates, an Ebner target this
year and an oasis of relative strength until recently, fell another SFr85 to
SFr2,6265.
Meanwhile, the BZ quoted investment offshoots, BK vision and PharmaVision,
fell by SFr150 to SFr4,900, and by SFr60 to SFr1,375 respectively. There was
talk that the BZ group's ability to continue buying its favoured stocks
might be compromised by the recent ebb in enthusiasm for international
equity investment.
MILAN fell back as the market remained beset by uncertainty regarding the
formation of the new administration. The Comit index lost 9.15 or 1 per cent
to 774.04.
Fiat went against the trend, adding L150 to L6,790 on an increase in car
sales during April.
Fondiaria recaptured Wednesday's losses, up L935 to L16,505.
STOCKHOLM was encouraged both by a cut in interest rates and good first
quarter results from Electrolux, whose B shares rose SKr6 to SKr429. The
Affarsvarlden general index closed 10.2 higher at 1,523.9.
ISTANBUL extended its technical rebound, rising another 5.1 per cent for a
three-day gain of 12 per cent after a fall of 37 per cent since mid-April.
The composite index ended 769.7 higher at 15,900.68.
WARSAW saw a similar bounce, the Wig index rising 369.1, or 3.3 per cent to
11,389.4 after a fall of more than 20 per cent last week.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Markets Report: US dollar holds firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central bank intervention to support the dollar appeared to have worked
yesterday as the US currency traded in a fairly stable range against the
D-Mark and the yen, writes Philip Gawith.
The dollar closed yesterday in London at DM1.6682 against the D-Mark from
DM1.6620 on Wednesday. Against the yen it finished at Y102.695 from
Y102.205. It ended in New York at DM1.6665 and Y102.835.
There was no sign of central bank intervention, with the market seemingly
taking a breather ahead of the release of important US non-farm payroll data
today.
Few observers believe the dollar's woes are behind it. The focus of
attention now is on what sort of follow-up activity can be expected. Options
include further intervention, US or German interest rate changes supportive
of the dollar, or market-access measures in the case of Japan.
Elsewhere, the French franc was firm after the Bank of France cut its
intervention rate by 10 basis points to 5.60 per cent. The peseta and the
escudo were weak after the overnight arrest of the former Bank of Spain
governor for tax fraud. Swedish and Austrian interest rates were also cut.
Analysts said the sight of up to 17 central banks operating in concert on
Wednesday appeared to have 'frightened off' the market. Mr Akis Karayiannis,
head of foreign exchange at Lehman Brothers, commented: 'Markets will
perhaps take on a central bank if its on its own. But if more than three
banks do something in the market, the market will respect that.'
Fresh impetus for the markets could come today with the release of labour
market statistics. The market is anticipating a 200,000 increase in jobs. If
the figure is less than anticipated, this would aggravate the dollar's woes
by undermining the consensus view that another Fed tightening is imminent.
The market yesterday was concerned with trying to understand why the
intervention had taken place, what it sought to achieve, and what more can
be anticipated. Mr Karayiannis disputed the view that a change of trend was
taking place. 'Central banks are concerned about volatility. They do not
change trends. I think they want to smooth the process, not to change the
direction.'
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, commented:
'The intervention by itself is helpful, but not a sufficient condition to
arrest the dollar's downward move.' He sugg-ested that it needed to be
supported by shifts in interest rates, with US rates rising and German rates
falling. Attention will be on the Bundesbank council when it meets next
Wednesday to see whether it reduces the discount rate.
One possible complication for the Bundesbank in supporting the dollar is
that this inflates the money supply, already well beyond its target range.
The German central bank will hardly welcome further complications in an area
that has already caused embarrassment.
If the bank chooses to counteract this effect by draining money from the
system, it will put upward pressure on money market rates at a time when it
is hoping to ease policy. If the intervention is left unsterilised, this
will put downward pressure on money market rates.
The fact that intervention would then be working with the grain of money
market trends - supporting lower rates in Germany and higher rates in the US
 -leads some analysts to argue that the intervention has a good chance of
succeeding.
The D-Mark was firmer against most European currencies yesterday. It closed
at FFr3.428 against the French franc from FFr3.424.
The Portuguese escudo continues to suffer from the fall-out of the political
scandal in Spain. It finished at Es103 from Es102.8 per D-Mark.
But the Spanish peseta recovered some ground after Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez said he had no intention of resigning and would continue as head of
government.
The after-effects of Wednesday's intervention was seen in German money
markets yesterday, with call money easing to 5.35/5.45 per cent from
5.45/5.55 per cent. Analysts said this reflected the anticipation of rate
cuts, sparked by comments earlier this week from Bundesbank council members,
as well as the expectation of a large inflow of cash from the currency
intervention.
This bullish sentiment was also evident in the futures market, with the June
Euromark contract settling at 95.05, up 13 basis points. Volumes were good,
with more than 47,000 lots traded.
Sterling futures also finished higher. The June contract closed at 94.59, up
from 94.56. Volumes were fairly light, with 9,482 lots traded. In the UK
money market, the Bank of England provided Pounds 320m of late assistance.
Earlier the Bank had put in Pounds 373m of assistance, after forecasting an
Pounds 850m shortage.
The pound had a steady day, tracking the dollar, and finished at DM2.4969
from DM2.491. Against the dollar it was barely changed at Dollars 1.4968
from Dollars 1.4988.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rwandan farming programme
threatened

Scientists working for the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture,
based in Colombia, are urging the resumption of one of Africa's most
successful agricultural programmes - the growing of climbing beans,
developed in Latin America in the Great Lakes region of Rwanda, Burundi and
western Zaire.
Beans are staple of the Rwandan diet and the introduction of climbing beans,
which grow upward on stakes in farmers' fields, has tripled yields in a
country where farmers average only one-half to one hectare each and 500
impoverished people live on each square kilometre of rural lend. Production
has risen by at least 33,000 tonnes, worth USDollars 18m.
The bloody civil war has put the entire scheme at risk. One plant breeder,
Dr Wayne Youngquist, was evacuated in a convoy of 75 cars and then airlifted
to Kenya. Dr Robin Buruchara, a plant pathologist, was in Kenya when the
fighting began and has been unable to return.
According to Dr Youngquist, most of the bean crop in southern Rwanda was
lost to drought last year. When the fighting broke out early last month the
rains were good. The next harvests are five to nine weeks away.
'If we can get back into Rwanda within a month - before the weeds take over
 -we can continue the programme without losing much. But right now, people
worry more about their lives than weeds,' said Dr Youngquist.
To keep the bean programme going, the tropical agriculture centre
temporarily moved operations to Burundi, where they are multiplying seeds to
send to Rwandan farmers when the fighting ends.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ankle deep in agricultural
controversy - Alison Maitland attends a meeting of farmers, policy-makers
and environmentalists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Where better to debate the pros and cons of the European Union's changing
agricultural policy than standing ankle-deep in a field that has been 'set
aside' from its previous use of growing barley?
The field, now sporting several varieties of wild plants, was the first stop
on a farm walkabout this week in the picturesque Dedham Vale, in the Essex
countryside best known through the paintings of John Constable. The tour, an
annual event organised by the local Tendring Hundred Farmers' Club, provides
an opportunity for leading policy-makers, lobbyists and farmers to discuss
the most contentious issues in British agriculture.
The debate, helped by a stiff breeze, was lively.
Mr Patrick Holden, policy director of British Organic Farmers, said that
set-aside, whereby farmers are paid to take a percentage of their arable
land out of production, was a desperate measure by the European Commission
to control grain surpluses. It would not work because farmers would simply
intensify production on their remaining land.
Hailing its environmental benefits - the lower use of pesticides or the
reappearance of wildlife - 'is just making the best of a bad job', he said.
'It would be much better to de-intensify farming as a whole rather than to
use set-aside as an oasis.'
Not surprisingly, the officials from the ministry of agriculture disagreed.
Mr Howard Fearn said that a study being carried out by Wye agricultural
college had found no evidence of production being stepped up on the rest of
the land. And he pointed out that while concern for the environment was not
the driving force behind the common agricultural policy reforms, it was
becoming inextricably linked with them as a way of making continued
subsidies for farming more palatable.
'The only way of getting the taxpayer rather than the farmer to pay is to
introduce something called the environment,' he said.
This appears to be throwing up contradictions. Farmers choosing the option
of non-rotational set-aside - where they leave a fixed area of their farm
unproductive rather than rotating the site each year - are contributing more
to wildlife. But the impact, in terms of reducing production, will be less
great as only the poorest land is set aside, according to agricultural
economists.
A huge cloudburst forced the al fresco meeting to reconvene in a barn, where
the steam was visibly rising as the arguments over environmentally-sensitive
farming grew hotter. Conservationists wanted subsidies transferred wholesale
from mainstream agriculture to promoting environmentally beneficial farming
practices. But, apart from stressing the difficulty of Britain persuading
its EU partners to go down that road, the man from the Treasury said he
doubted whether the taxpayer would agree to Pounds 3bn a year being
reallocated to an industry that had already been so heavily supported in the
past.
So what did the scores of farmers present think of the prospects? The view
was suitably down to earth. 'At the end of the day, farmers have got to
produce a net profit,' said Mr Jim Macaulay, one of the organisers. 'They
can look towards the movement of sustainable farming, but if they take their
eye off the costs they're in deep trouble.'
The problem facing farmers in Europe is that many of their competitors
elsewhere in the world do not face the same tough legislation on animal
welfare or pesticide use - one reason why they can produce much more cheaply
 -said a senior official from the National Farmers' Union.
Mr Oliver Doubleday, who farms in both England and Brazil, said UK farmers
were naive if they thought they could survive without subsidies. 'It's a
huge trap to think we ought to be trading on world prices,' he said. 'You
just don't realise how low they are. There are going to be people - and I
hope it's going to be me - who will clean up behind you.'
Mr Macaulay concluded that UK costs of production would have to come down
'if we're to stay in farming and deliver what the environmentalists want'.
Exactly how high-cost, high-quality producers in Europe would continue to
survive once markets became more open remained unclear. So did the common
ground between the environmentalists and the bureaucrats. But at least the
farmers were happy - they had got the rain they needed.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alumina terminal opened on
Russia's east coast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An Anglo-Russian project to open up one of the bottlenecks that has
restricted the import of an essential raw material for the Russian aluminium
industry became operational this week when 25,600 tonnes of alumina
(aluminium oxide) was unloaded by new facilities at the east coast port of
Vanino.
The bulk alumina handling facilities, costing 'several million dollars,' are
jointly owned by by Trans-World Metals, the UK-based trading group, and the
Vanino Port Authority, one of the new Russian joint stock companies.
Russia has only one other such handling facility, at Murmansk. According to
Mr Alan Bekhor, managing director of Trans-World, said to be the biggest
trader in Russian aluminium: 'The Vanino facilities open the way for alumina
to get to Russia more efficiently. They represent a logical link between
Australia, the world's biggest alumina producer, and Russia's big Siberian
smelters.' The first alumina through the facilities was bought from Alcoa of
Australia.
Mr Bekhor said that within three months a second stage would lift the bulk
alumina handling capacity at Vanino to 50,000 tonnes a month. The port is at
one end of the Baikal-Amur railway which runs parallel to the Trans-Siberian
railway.
In theory the facilities are available to all but 'Trans-World will probably
keep them busy for the rest of this year.' However, Mr Bekhor stressed:
'This is a long-term investment and there will be no quick returns.'

FT  06 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Precious metals seen past their
'best buy' dates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The precious metals price forecasting season is under way as analysts put
their gold, silver and platinum market predictions up for inspection.
Ms Rhona O'Connell at T. Hoare and Company, in a special report on the
silver market, suggests this 'is now one of the most dangerous metals in the
non-ferrous sector and carries with it a large Wealth Warning'. Prices may
rise, she points out, but 'disillusioned liquidation, or mere profit-taking
into a rally, can send prices spinning down again, usually faster than they
rose'.
While the underlying fundamentals of the silver market are improving, prices
will not be sustained for long above Dollars 6 a troy ounce, Ms O'Connell
suggests.
She sees prices moving between Dollars 4.50 and Dollars 6 an ounce this year
and next with an average of Dollars 5 for each year.
Stocks of silver in the US alone stand at 36 weeks of supply, which would
take some three years to whittle down to a more manageable eight-week level
even though the annual supply deficit is forecast to increase from last
year's 128m ounces to 137m this year and 150m in 1995.
Mr Andy Smith at Union Bank of Switzerland suggests all the precious metals
probably achieved in the first quarter their highest prices for 1994 as a
whole.
He points out that in the January-March period US interest rates were at
their lowest level in 30 years and this coincided with a weak dollar and
concerns over precious metal supplies, especially supplies of platinum from
South Africa.
He warns that many of gold's emerging markets are losing their promise. Low
oil prices are affecting Saudi Arabia's purchasing power and several Middle
Eastern countries may suffer economic dislocation because of the rise in
Islamic fundamentalism. The lack of pensions provision in China, South Korea
and Singapore may cause personal gold hoards to be sold by an ageing
population.
Silver's price, which reached Dollars 5.75 an ounce in the first quarter, is
forecast by Mr Smith to be down at Dollars 4.50 an ounce in three months
time and back up at Dollars 5 in 12 months. He expects platinum, which
reached Dollars 418 an ounce in the first quarter, to perform in a similar
way, falling to Dollars 360 an ounce in three months and recovering to
Dollars 390 in a year.
Gold, which has been up to Dollars 395 an ounce in the first quarter, is
predicted by Mr Smith to fall to Dollars 350 in three months and recover to
Dollars 390 in a year's time.
Meanwhile, at the CPM Group, based in New York, Mr Jeffrey Christian,
managing director, says gold may be at the start of a major cyclical upward
move. Private investment demand in gold began to revive sharply in the last
four months of 1992, he recalls, and there are several factors that are
likely to keep investors interested in the metal, at least intermittently,
for the rest of this year and next.
Mr Joseph Rosta, CPM research director, suggests platinum is on an upward
phase that may last another year or more. He says the time when supply has
been growing more quickly than demand appears to be passing 'and it may be
replaced over the next several years by conditions in which the rate of
growth in fabrication demand outpaces any increases in total supply.'
Nevertheless, platinum prices may go down in the coming year as fears about
South African supplies diminish.

FT  06 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices paid at wool auctions this week increased steadily, and with
offerings declining in the closing stages of the selling season it became
more difficult to imagine a setback. The Australian market indicator reached
587c/kg on May 5, a new peak for the season. Nervousness about stockpile
offering to be offered by fixed schedule from July dissipated some time ago
and the market is inclined now to assess this as a potentially strengthening
rather than a weakening factor. The wool using industry is keeping busy but
there is eagerness to see new business coming through at the higher prices
now being paid for wool. After a long quiet period it is hoped that the
latest dearer price trend is finally bringing out more buying interest.
Currency volatility affecting the US and Australian dollars has disturbed
price calculations during the past week.

FT  06 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee rallies to fresh high -
Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures perked up towards the close,
briefly reaching fresh five-year highs.
The market had opened softer and slipped further, looking set to consolidate
recent strong gains. The July position was Dollars 15 down at Dollars 1,668
a tonne by the mid-session close, having touched a low of Dollars 1,655. But
a flurry of trade and commission house buying late in the afternoon quickly
took the price up to a new high of Dollars 1,710 before it eased to close at
Dollars 1,700, up Dollars 17.
'We saw good buying again towards the close, it would be a brave man to go
short in this market,' one trader commented.
The COCOA market ended a very dull but choppy day mixed, the near July
futures position dipping to Pounds 870 a tonne before closing Pounds 4 up on
balance at Pounds 886.
Traders said the market shrugged off news that according to the chief
executive of the Ivory Coast's Caistab, the country was short of its current
commitments and the mid-crop would only be 80,000 tonnes, against forecasts
of up to 200,000 tonnes. 'The market isn't in the mood for bullish news,'
one explained. 'Sentiment is slightly unfriendly.'
At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices snapped higher in the afternoon,
setting the market up for a further attempt on recent highs at Dollars 1,983
a tonne, but other markets ended mixed.
ALUMINIUM prices moved off their lows aided by copper. But the three months
delivery quotation was unable to repeat Wednesday's foray above Dollars
1,330 a tonne, and final business was at Dollars 1,327, down Dollars 2.
Price trends were mixed for the PRECIOUS METALS after gold fixed unchanged
from its lower morning setting and the New York markets mostly opened
sharply lower. Dealers said the turn-round in the dollar's strength from
weak to firmer and the apparent calm in South Africa had taken away GOLD'S
two major price supports.
London SILVER prices struggled for most of the day after only briefly
holding a firmer opening level at Dollars 5.17-Dollars 5.19 for the cash
position. A sudden bout of selling took the price down to around Dollars
5.10 support near the morning gold fix and although a couple of rallies were
attempted, the support was re-visited when the New York market lost nearly
11 cents shortly after opening.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Treasury prices mixed despite stronger
dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices were mixed yesterday, with the market gaining some
support from a stronger dollar and data which suggested the chance of
favourable news in today's pivotal employment report.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/8 better
at 87 3/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.319 per cent. At the short end,
the two-year note edged  1/32 lower to 99 5/16 , to yield 5.855 per cent.
The focus was squarely on today's data on April non-farm payrolls and
unemployment, which will give the market its first comprehensive reading on
the strength of the economy in the early part of the second quarter.
Forecasts centre on a payroll increase of 170,000, and an unemployment rate
of 6.5 per cent.
Yesterday's announcement of rising claims for unemployment benefit last week
was marginally encouraging for fixed-rate investors, who are looking for
indications of weak inflationary pressures. The good news was offset by the
announcement that unit labour costs jumped 5 per cent in the first quarter.
Trading was largely confined to professional dealers, who were squaring
their positions ahead of today's data.
Improvement in the value of the dollar against the yen and D-Mark was
helpful at the long end, but most traders were content to remain on the
sidelines.
Their over-riding concern remained the likelihood of an imminent move by the
Federal Reserve to lift interest rates for a fourth time this year, perhaps
as early as this morning.
The Spanish government bond market bounced back up yesterday to end over a
point higher, recovering part of the losses made in the previous two days.
The market saw sharp declines of over a point on Tuesday and Wednesday as
further news about the political corruption scandals triggered more selling,
particularly by foreign investors.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, was forced to respond to
political attacks about the recent scandals at a press conference.
Two of Mr Gonzalez's ministers have resigned in recent days in connection
with the scandals.
Meanwhile Mr Mariano Rubio, the former governor of the Bank of Spain, was
arrested late on Wednesday and charged with tax fraud.
Yesterday saw some renewed buying interest in Spanish paper, inspired mainly
by the realisation that Spanish 10-year yields were hovering close to 10 per
cent, while the yield spread over 10-year German paper had widened out to
well over 300 basis points.
'At close to 10 per cent yields, people felt there was relative value out
there,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at S. G. Warburg
Securities.
The Spanish government bond futures contract quoted on Meff opened at 94.00
and touched a low of 93.55 early in the session, before climbing steadily
back up to a high of 95.67 and ending the day at 95.36.
The strength of the German economic recovery provided the main focus of
attention in the German government bond market again, with some market
participants wondering whether independent German economists are likely to
revise their growth forecasts upwards again.
'The rise in unemployment was smaller than expected, and we continue to see
signs that the German economy is recovering,' said one analyst.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 94.39, fell to a low of 93.77, and
then climbed back up to a high of 94.44, settling at 94.32.
Elsewhere in Europe, French government bond prices mostly followed bunds in
the course of the day, despite a 10-basis-point cut in the intervention
rate, from 5.70 per cent to 5.60 per cent.
Dealers said the Treasury's auction of stock yesterday was generally
well-covered, but they were disappointed at the yields accepted. The
Treasury sold FFr13bn of 10-year stock with a 5.5 per cent coupon at an
average yield of 7.09 per cent. The notional futures contract opened at
119.48 and settled at 119.24.
UK gilts bounced back to end a point higher on the day, although dealers
said the recovery in prices was technical. The gilt market will be focusing
on the outcome of the local elections and the US data today.

The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) has elected Ms
Gay Evans, managing director of Bankers Trust International in London, as
its new chairman, replacing Mr Joseph Bauman.
She will hold the position for a year. Ms Evans has been an officer on the
ISDA board for four years, and chaired the association's regulatory
committee in Europe.
Mr Mark Brickell, a vice-president of J. P. Morgan, and Mr Chip Goodrich, a
managing director of Merrill Lynch, were elected vice-chairmen. Both are
based in New York.
Ms Evans said ISDA would focus on two main areas. 'We will press forward on
our educational efforts with regulators, legislators and our other
constituencies around the world. Increasingly, these efforts will involve
derivatives end-users,' she said.
'At the same time, we will continue to fulfil our long-standing mission to
assess and reduce sources of risk in the derivatives industry.'

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: ONGC sticks to Euro-issue
plan
</HEADLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) intends to go ahead with
planned domestic and Euro-issues despite the decision earlier this week by
Videsh Sanchar Nigam (VSNL), the telecommunications monopoly, to postpone
its planned Dollars 1bn Euro-issue, the company chairman said, Reuter
reports from New Delhi.
'We are going to place in the market shares valued at Rs30bn. Half of it
will be in the domestic market and the rest in the international market,'
said Mr SK Manglik, ONGC's chairman.
State-owned ONGC, one of Asia's largest oil exploration firms, was converted
into a public limited company on February 1. Formed in 1959, it employs
48,000 and has assets of Rs89.4bn.
The company made a record net profit of Rs20bn in 1993-94, a 153 per cent
increase over the previous year. It produced 24.21m tonnes of crude during
the year.
Mr Manglik said the company hoped to make its domestic issue around June or
July.
'We are thinking of going in for the international GDR (Global Depositary
Receipt issue) in the latter part of the year,' he said.
'As of today, we have no intention of changing our plan but we will be alive
to the environment and keep a watch,' he said. 'After all, who expected
VSNL, which is a very good company, to bomb like this?' he added.
The VSNL Euro-issue of GDRs, certificates representing domestic equity, was
to have been priced on Tuesday after roadshows around the world. However,
the ambitious offering, riding on the back of India's economic
liberalisation programme, fell victim to falling global interest in emerging
markets after the US Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates.
ONGC sources said the domestic price for a share was expected to be fixed
around Rs140 to Rs150.

strategies
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) may launch a global yen issue in 1995, and
may also spearhead the first bond issue in Taiwanese dollars this year as
part of its new funding programme, a bank official said, Reuter reports.
Mr Erkki Jappinen, the ADB's assistant treasurer, said the 55-member bank
aimed to raise up to 20 per cent of its Dollars 2.8bn funding target this
year through the structured placement market.
'We have two new approaches to our funding strategy this year - issuing
global bonds and the placement plan,' he said in Nice, where the bank is
holding its annual conference.
Bankers said the structured placement plan would bring the ADB into the
rapidly-expanding market for issues involving options or swaps.

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Hellenic Republic FRN meets strong
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's long-awaited D-Mark offering provided the highlight of another
torpid day in the Eurobond markets.
As expected, the Hellenic Republic issued DM1bn of seven-year floating-rate
notes, with a call and a put option after five years.
Paying a coupon of six-month Libor plus 75 basis points, the notes were
priced at a discounted margin of 112 basis points over Libor at their 98.42
re-offer price. CS First Boston and Deutsche Bank were joint lead managers.
According to one of the leads, the issue met strong demand from German and
Austrian investors who benefit from their countries' double-taxation
agreement with Greece. Some UK and east Asian demand was also reported.
Empresa Distribuidora Sur (Edesur), an Argentine electricity distribution
company, issued Dollars 150m of two-year floating-rate notes paying a coupon
of three-month Libor plus 395 basis points and carrying a call option in May
and November 1995.
According to lead manager Chase Investment Bank, the deal met with healthy
demand from investors keen on high-yielding short-term floating-rate paper.
Primary market activity is likely to remain subdued ahead of today's US
April jobs data, and is expected to be further crimped by next Thursday's
Ascension holiday in most parts of Europe.
However, there is some talk of further short-dated dollar deals as well as
yen issues targeted at Japanese investors when they return from the Golden
Week holiday.
IBCA, the European rating agency, issued its first credit ratings for
Depfa-Bank, Germany's largest mortgage bank. It awarded Depfa's unsecured
Eurobonds a double-A rating and its mortgage bonds and government-guaranteed
liabilities a triple-A rating.
Depfa commissioned the IBCA rating after receiving an unsolicited Aa3
Eurobond rating from Moody's in February. After Moody's disappointing
rating, 'we are pleased about our double-A rating' from IBCA, said Mr
Gerhard Bruckermann, chief financial officer.
Depfa's lending activities are substantially German-based, long-term and
mostly to the public sector. Since the main part of its business is subject
to the German mortgage law, its profits are low compared with those of the
commercial banks. However, according to IBCA, the quality of its lending is
higher.
Moreover, its profitability has improved over the last four years, and this
trend is continuing. Depfa has about DM60bn in mortgage bonds and some DM5bn
in Eurobonds outstanding.
Standard &amp; Poor's lowered its rating on the long-term debt of the Province
of Newfoundland and on the provincially guaranteed debt of Newfoundland &amp;
Labrador to triple-B plus from single-A minus. Some Dollars 2bn of debt is
affected. The new rating is equivalent to Moody's Baa1 rating of the
province, which was confirmed by the agency.

Colgate-Palmolive, the US consumer products group, hinted yesterday that it
could emerge as a bidder for L &amp; F Products, one of the companies being sold
by Eastman Kodak, the US photographic products group.
Earlier this week, Kodak announced it was selling its pharmaceutical and
consumer healthcare businesses to concentrate on its core imaging business.
L &amp; F makes Lysol disinfectant, Ogilvie hair treatment and other household
products, while Colgate's wide range of brands includes Ajax cleaner and
Palmolive shampoo.
Mr Reuben Mark, Colgate's chairman and chief executive, said at the
company's annual meeting that senior officers would take a look at L &amp; F.
'We are always on the look-out for good, strategic acquisitions,' he said.
'We will, naturally, examine it.'
Mr Mark also said Colgate would consider buying back more shares under its
stock repurchase programme.

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Bank Austria cuts payout despite
rise
</HEADLINE>

   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, yesterday reported a sharp rise in
operating profits but will pay a reduced dividend of 8 per cent, compared
with 10 per cent in 1992, as part of further efforts to improve financial
resources and enhance competitiveness.
Partial operating profits doubled to Sch4.2bn (Dollars 347m) from Sch2.1bn
in 1992, helped by further measures to reduce costs and additional synergies
from the 1991 merger of Oesterreichische Landerbank and the city of Vienna's
Zentralsparkasse savings bank to form Bank Austria.
Profits before allocations to reserves at Sch1.32bn were broadly in line
with the Sch1.29bn earned in 1992.
Operating expenses declined by almost 7 per cent, mainly due to a 15 per
cent cut in labour costs, and the one-off effect of a reform of the
company's pension scheme.
The domestic branch network was reduced by 15 branches to 340 branches, and
more will be closed this year.
Provisions against bad debts were reduced by almost one-third from 1992 to
about Sch4bn 'despite the problems faced by the Austrian economy, and
bankruptcies climbing to an all time high', the bank said.
Primary funds totalled Sch332.9bn, with private household savings deposits
accounting for 48.5 per cent of the total.
The bank continued to expand in central and eastern Europe. It now has
subsidiaries in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia, and became the
first foreign bank to open an operational branch office in Moscow. Bank
Austria recently completed its takeover of GiroCredit, Austria's third
largest bank.

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: NYSE approves policy to protect
shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The New York Stock Exchange has approved a new shareholder voting rights
policy that will prevent US companies from restricting or diluting the
voting powers of shareholders through special stock issues.
Mr James Buck, the NYSE's corporate secretary, said: 'The new policy
prohibits the most abusive types of recapitalisations which take away the
voting rights of shareholders.'
Under the policy, companies will not be able to conduct share exchange
offers where the stock issued carries lesser voting rights than of the stock
originally owned by shareholders. They will be prohibited from adopting
plans which require shareholders to hold stock a certain length of time
before they can use the stock to vote, and from issuing 'super-voting' stock
above existing common stock, unless such stock existed at the time of the
original flotation.
However, companies with existing dual-class capital structures will not be
affected by the new policy.
The NYSE's new policy has been approved by the American Stock Exchange and
the National Association of Securities Dealers. The rules should be quickly
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Last year, Mr Arthur
Levitt, SEC chairman, proposed the exchanges adopt a uniform policy to
protecting shareholders' voting rights.
The exchanges were able to draw up a new voting rights policy after reaching
agreement with the Business Roundtable, which represents the chief
executives of the largest US public companies. In 1990, the Roundtable
successfully appealed to a Federal court to block the SEC introducing a
voting rights policy. Since then its position has softened and, according to
Mr Buck of the NYSE, the new policy enjoyed 'the overwhelming support of the
business community'.

1.03bn, little changed.
However, after writing off CDollars 396m goodwill for the acquisition of CAE
Link several years ago and providing a further CDollars 33m for Link's

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Chinese stocks lose their shine
 -Caution is the watchword
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first flush of enthusiasm for 'China Inc' that was so much in evidence
last year has given way to caution.
Since the beginning of the year the share prices of the first clutch of
Chinese state companies listed in Hong Kong - the H-share companies - have
come under pressure, which has become especially acute as they have reported
their earnings over the last two weeks.
Since the beginning of the year, the Hang Seng Index has fallen 31 per cent.
But the share price of Guangzhou Shipyard has slumped 54 per cent, and those
of Maanshan Iron and Steel and Shanghai Petrochemical by 45 per cent and 36
per cent respectively.
Only Tsingtao Brewery has outperformed the market, falling by 29 per cent
since the start of the year.
Mr Ravi Narin, head of Hong Kong research at Peregrine Securities, a local
brokerage, says: 'We've told investors to sell all of them. They had been
pushed up to ridiculous levels. We don't like them on relative valuation
basis; we have questions about their currency exposure; and their
managements and businesses are largely unknown.'
In spite of impressive-looking earnings reports for the H-share companies -
Maanshan's profits rose 431 per cent and Tsingtao Brewery's rose more than
300 per cent - investors looking ahead to an uncertain year in China and
studying the fine print of the reports are concerned.
Investors have also been taken aback by some novel accounting practices  -
such as taking 'below the line' items which a western company might allocate
above it, such as welfare provisions akin to funding a pension scheme.
There is a growing appreciation among the financial community that the
mainland is poised for a sharp slowdown in economic activity.
Also causing concern are signs that the Chinese government's policy of
economic retrenchment has begun to bite, showing up in the sharp, and to
some alarming, rise in debts owed to the H-share companies.
Mr CY Ho, head of China research at Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia, says:
'In the past it was a question of 'why bother to offend people?' If you did
not collect receivables you just made borrowings - it was the same thing.
Now it's a different story. The H-share companies have become alien to other
state-owned enterprises; they are forcing them to pay back their debts, so
relations are not going to be that smooth in 1994.'
The brokerage calculates the increase in debtors has outstripped the growth
in sales at four of the six companies - Beiren Printing, Kunming Machinery,
Maanshan Iron and Steel and, most dramatically, Tsingtao Brewery where a 35
per cent increase in sales year-on-year has resulted in a 230 per cent jump
in money owed to it.
Mr Ho says difficulties in debt collection can be exacerbated by the very
privatised status which underlines H-share companies' accountability to
shareholders. In China the companies are perceived to be cash rich and, as
such, come bottom of the list to be paid off.
But it also reflects a systemic problem in corporate China. State owned
companies across the board are floundering, giving rise to the re-emergence
of 'triangular debt'. This is a peculiarly Chinese phenomenon which afflicts
the state-owned sector and was meant to have been eradicated by Mr Zhu
Rongji, now China's economics minister, after a high-profile attack on the
problem in 1992.
The inability of one company to pay its debts feeds straight through the
system of corporate relationships: company A cannot pay back company B until
it receives payments from company C. Those companies with cash are making
loans to each other, commanding interest rates in excess of 25 per cent.
Tsingtao has lent a total Yn263m (USDollars 20m) to other Chinese companies.
Another aspect of the latest H-share reports which has raised eyebrows is
the treatment of certain transfers from the profit and loss account. The
H-share companies are required to transfer 10 per cent of their after-tax
profits (before distribution to shareholders) to a 'collective welfare fund'
and another 10 per cent to a 'statutory surplus reserve', a form of
compulsory retained earnings.
H-share companies have to accumulate these reserves until they equal half
the paid up capital of the company. The 'collective welfare fund', which is
also defined as 'shareholders' funds' is for the benefit of the work force.
All of the H-share companies are the creations of merchant bankers and had
no independent existence before the Chinese government decided they would be
listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Companies such as Shanghai
Petrochemical and Maanshan Iron and Steel were (and still are) industrial
towns with integrated social services which the welfare funds support.
It is a fine point whether the collective welfare fund should be treated as
an expense, and therefore above the line, as it represents some of the costs
of doing business in China for these companies.
In any event, it appears that the heyday for H-share companies is over for
the time being. The interest generated in China stocks was partly due to
their scarcity, but their rarity value is about to be eroded as 22 more
state companies are listed in Hong Kong - 17 of which will have their
primary quotation in the colony.
In a market notorious for its short-termism, stock market analysts now say
that mainland companies are for those investors with a long-term view. That
is Hong Kong's way of saying 'sell now and buy another day'.

Nedcor, the South African banking group, yesterday announced a 16 per cent
rise in net income to R271m (Dollars 80m) for the six months to March, up
from R234m a year ago.
The interim dividend has been increased to 29 cents from 25 cents, while
earnings per share rose to 139 cents from 121 cents. Overall interest income
rose to R3.39bn from R3.12bn, and was helped by growth in both loans and
advances. Other income rose 16 per cent to R653m from R562m.
Mr Richard Laubscher, chief executive, said the improvement was chiefly the
result of 'very good volumes'.
Results were also boosted by a 14 per cent reduction in provision for bad
debts to R103m compared with R120m last year. This was partially offset by a
21 per cent increase in the tax burden as a result of an increase in value
added tax.
The group's best performer was its UAL financial services division, which
increased net income by 25.4 per cent, rising to R32.1m from R25.6m.
Mr Laubscher said he was 'much more positive' about prospects for the
economy after the elections.
He singled out the Perm, Nedcor's main home-loan arm, and said that it was
exceptionally well placed to take advantage of further growth in the black
market, particularly as the new government pursues its reconstruction and
development programme in the townships.

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: NSW authorities will award
Sydney casino licence today
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The New South Wales Casino Control Authority will today announce the winning
bidder for the right to develop a casino in Sydney.
The contest has come down to a two-way fight between Circus Circus, the
large US casino operator, acting in conjunction with Mr Kerry Packer, the
Australian businessman, and Showboat, a smaller US gaming company, which is
partnered by Leighton Holdings, the Australian property and construction
group.
The Sydney casino is the last prize in a string of Australian gaming
developments which could lead to a trebling of the nation's casino industry
revenues by the late-1990s.
Developers have been chosen for new casinos in Cairns, Brisbane, and
Melbourne - all of which will come on stream over the next three years.
According to consultants at Price Waterhouse, the total annual gross gaming
revenues from those projects, plus Sydney, could amount to about ADollars
1.25bn (USDollars 886m).
The operator of the Sydney casino will have to pay more than one-fifth of
all revenues from table games, up to ADollars 200m, and 22.5 per cent of
gross revenue from 'gaming devices'.
Table game revenues which top ADollars 200m will attract a 'super' profits
duty, which rises progressively to a maximum rate of 45 per cent.
The CCA says annual income from the property should be about ADollars 100m,
although this may be a conservative estimate.
The developer will hand over a 'once-only, non-refundable lump-sum payment'
when the casino licence is granted. 'The benefits to the state arising out
of the size and proposed timing of the payment will be significant factors
in the CCA's assessment of the applications,' the bidding terms state.
Some critics argue that New South Wales has gone too far - and the
aggressive structuring of the tax-take from the Sydney property will
mitigate against a high-roller type of casino, and encourage the developer
to pursue a more downmarket operation.
This is thought to be the reason why a number of big US gaming groups backed
away from bidding.

Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT), the country's dominant
telecommunications company, yesterday reported a 12.8 per cent drop in
first-quarter profits to 912.3m pesos (Dollars 32.9m), in spite of a 10 per
cent rise in revenues to 4.78bn pesos.
The company said higher capital spending, mostly related to its programme to
meet an estimated 800,000 applications for telephone lines, led to the lower
earnings.
Industry analysts had forecast slower profits growth for PLDT, which faces
keener competition from rivals in the newly deregulated industry.
The company said operating expenses in the first quarter grew 21 per cent to
3.51bn pesos.

Bajaj Auto, India's largest producer of motor scooters, has announced plans
for a Dollars 250m Euro-issue.
Part of the proceeds could be used to finance plans to produce low-cost
cars.
Mr Rahul Bajaj, chairman, said he hoped to begin by making 50,000 cars a
year, later increasing to 100,000.
Mr Bajaj did not say when the final decision on the scheme might be taken,
or who the potential foreign partners might be. However, the company is
unlikely to go into production before the end of the decade.
The announcement came as Bajaj Auto reported full-year net profits up
sharply to Rs1.46bn (Dollars 46.6m) from Rs520m, due to strong exports,
tight control on interest charges, and reduced provisions for depreciation.
Sales overall rose 28 per cent to Rs16.5bn.

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: First-quarter improvement at
Dyno Industrier

<TEXT>
Dyno Industrier, the Norwegian chemicals, explosives and plastics group,
yesterday reported a sharp rise in first-quarter pre-tax profit to NKr130m
(Dollars 18m) from NKr75m, helped by increased demand and higher volumes.
Dyno expects the positive development to continue throughout the year,
helped by the emerging economic recovery in European markets and a slight
increase in coal production in North America, which will contribute
positively to explosives activities.
First-quarter sales rose to NKr2.26bn from NKr1.91bn, boosted by a
combination of growth in volumes, the stronger dollar and higher prices for
a number of raw materials. Operating profit increased to NKr147m from
NKr114m.
Dyno warned, however, that increasing prices for the group's most important
raw materials purchases could create pressure on margins for the remainder
of the year.
Vard, the troubled Norwegian cruise and ferry group, has cut first-quarter
pre-tax losses by more than half to NKr57.3m from NKr127.6m.
The result was better than analysts had expected. Vard said the improvement
was due to increased passenger volume for its ferries and reduced shore-side
expenses and higher turnover for in cruise division.
Operating revenue rose to NKr1.8bn from NKr1.6bn. Operating expenses
increased to NKr1.58bn from NKr1.44bn leaving operating profit up to
NKr96.7m from NKr11.08m.
Financial items charged against first-quarter accounts increased to
NKr153.95m from NKr138.41m partly as a result of a rise in interest expenses
to NKr192m from NKr130m in the same period last year.

talks

<TEXT>
Canadian Pacific plans to reach agreement with the federally-owned Canadian
National Railways (CN) for a merger of their eastern Canada railway systems
late this month, said Mr William Stinson, CP's chairman.
The deal could take effect from January 1 1996.
Both sides believe the merger is the only way to deal with overcapacity in
eastern Canada and federal officials support the strategy, Mr Stinson said
after CP's annual meeting in Calgary.
'Overcapacity is draining hundreds of millions of dollars yearly from both
railways,' he said.
'Trade routes have shifted more north-south and we have hundreds of miles of
non-profitable track.'
CP's western rail system, which has been expanded to carry rising volumes of
export wheat and other commodities, is profitable and would not be part of
the merger. A new company 50 - 50 owned by CP and CN would operate the
eastern system from Manitoba to the Maritimes.
'CP Rail's results must be brought into line with those of the best US
railroads,' said Mr Stinson.
CP has sold assets to concentrate on rail and sea transport, oil and gas,
coal, hotels and property.
CP's first-quarter profit was CDollars 17.2m, or 5 cents a share, after a
CDollars 7m special charge, against CDollars 21.7m, or 7 cents, after a
special gain of CDollars 28.5m a year earlier.
Revenues were CDollars 1.6bn, against CDollars 1.47bn. Operating income
gained 45 per cent to CDollars 224m.

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Fighting fit and looking for
aerospace deals - McDonnell Douglas is emerging from a harsh restructuring
with its focus sharpened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McDonnell Douglas, the US aerospace and defence group, has been building up
financial muscle. It wants to put itself in a good position to take
advantage of investment and acquisition opportunities for its core aerospace
business.
'We have conducted an overall analysis of our industry and identified areas
of business where an acquisition would make sense,' Mr John McDonnell,
chairman, said.
The company was considering internal investments to expand core businesses,
as well as acquisitions 'if an opportunity comes along at a reasonable
price'.
However, Mr McDonnell said that it was not seeking to make a hostile
takeover bid.
In particular, it was interested in expanding its helicopter business and
satellite launch activities, Mr McDonnell said.
Barely two years ago, the US company had planned to shed its helicopter
activities as part of its restructuring and recovery programme. However, Mr
McDonnell said it had now decided to keep this business and expand it.
He stressed, however, that the company was no longer interested in
diversifying, and wanted instead to concentrate on strengthening its core
aerospace businesses.
'We've learnt our lesson. In the late 1980s, I was the prime advocate of
diversification in the company: now I'm the prime advocate for aerospace,'
he said.
The company's sweeping restructuring programme, which has reduced the
workforce from 135,000 in 1990 to 67,000 at the end of the latest quarter,
has given the group a strong capital structure.
A 20 per cent increase in first-quarter operating earnings, to Dollars 259m
compared with Dollars 215m in the same period last year, continued to help
reduce debt.
'We reduced net debt by more than Dollars 400m in the first quarter, and our
net debt-to-equity ratio is now down to 0.36, which is one of the lowest in
the industry - lower than that of our principal competitors, including
Lockheed and Martin Marietta,' he said.
The company's strong recovery has been reflected in a leap in the share
price, from about Dollars 48 at the end of 1992 to around Dollars 120 this
year.
Mr McDonnell said the outlook for the military aircraft business remained
good. However, with continuing pressure on government defence budgets, he
expected 'a reasonably stable' market rather than growth.
The big challenge for the company's military aircraft business remains the
troubled C-17 large transport aircraft programme.
The company reached a settlement with the US government at the end of last
year over the Pentagon's purchase of an initial batch of 40 aircraft.
Under the settlement, McDonnell Douglas has been placed on a two-year
probation while it makes technical and managerial improvements to the
programme. The agreement is estimated to have cost the US government Dollars
348m and McDonnell Douglas Dollars 454m.
'This gives us until the end of 1995 to demonstrate we can deliver the
aircraft on time, on spec, with high quality and at an affordable cost. If
we do, it could lead to a programme of as much as 120 aircraft for the US
Air Force and potential overseas sales to the UK and other countries, as
well as some modest sales in the commercial market,' Mr McDonnell said.
However, if the C-17 failed to meet the programme targets and the Pentagon
cancelled it, the cost to McDonnell Douglas would be about Dollars 2bn in
lost sales a year during the next decade. 'This programme will account for
about 20 per cent of our government business in the next decade,' Mr
McDonnell said.
Although the company is trailing Boeing and the European Airbus consortium
in the commercial aircraft field, its prospects have been boosted by Saudi
Arabia's decision to buy up to Dollars 6.2bn worth of airliners for Saudia,
its national carrier, from Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
Mr McDonnell said Saudia was expected to complete its analysis of its fleet
renewal and expansion needs 'in the next month or two', and the company was
hoping to win a 'significant slice' of the order. It is offering its MD-11
three-engine airliner as well as the narrow-bodied MD-90 and MD-80 aircraft.
Mr McDonnell conceded that the world airline industry was continuing to have
'a hell of a time', but he expected the airliner market to bottom this year.
'I do see signs that we are coming out of the depression. I've been through
three cycles. People have speculated that we would go out of the commercial
business. It hasn't happened yet and it won't happen in this cycle,' he
said.
The company intended to remain in its two niche markets in the commercial
business, with its MD-11 wide-bodied and MD-80, MD-90 and the planned MD-95
narrow-bodied airliners.
However, Mr McDonnell said he had not abandoned the idea of forging an
international alliance for the commercial aircraft business, with foreign
partners acquiring up to 49 per cent of it.

Aga, the Swedish industrial gas group, is sticking to a forecast of higher
profits this year, in spite of a slight weakening in its first-quarter
performance.
Income after financial items eased to SKr401m (Dollars 52.7m) from SKr415m.
Operating income was also lower at SKr366m, compared with SKr392m, although
sales rose 4 per cent to SKr3.87bn.
The group recently announced plans to spin off Frigoscandia, the world's
leading cold storage chain, and obtain a separate listing for the company.
The move is in line with its long-term strategy of concentrating on
industrial and medical gases.
Pro-forma figures showed that gas operations achieved a SKr404m profit in
the first three months, on sales of SKr2.96bn. In the same period of 1993,
profit was SKr416m on sales of SKr2.73bn.
Most of the group's gas operations recorded higher operating income. This
was attributed to improving economic conditions in the US and Nordic region.
The European continent remained weak, however.
Frigoscandia had a slightly higher loss, of SKr3m compared with SKr1m, in
what is always a weak period. The company's sales dropped 6 per cent to
SKr924m.

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Jefferson Smurfit prices US
offer at Dollars 13
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jefferson Smurfit, the Irish paper and packaging group, yesterday priced an
initial public offering of 19.25m shares in its US division at Dollars 13.
The company also offered Dollars 400m of senior notes in Container
Corporation, which is owned by its US arm.
The equity offering is part of a Dollars 2bn refinancing plan for Jefferson
Smurfit Corporation in the US, which is partly owned by two equity funds run
by Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank.
Mr Michael Smurfit, chairman of the Irish group, said he was pleased the
company had achieved the offering 'despite extremely difficult and volatile
markets'.
In addition to the 19.25m shares to be sold to the public, a unit of the
parent Jefferson Smurfit group will also buy 11.54m shares at the same price
as the public offering.
The remainder of the refinancing comes from a bank facility of Dollars
1.65bn, of which a Dollars 900m loan will be delayed until December. That
loan will be used by the company to redeem Dollars 844m of junk bonds which
date back to 1989.
The refinancing will save the company Dollars 68.3m a year in interest
payments on its debt burden, largely made up of junk bonds. The US company
has struggled under high interest payments and weak paper and packaging
markets.

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Brazil's biggest airline cuts
costs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Varig, Brazil's largest airline, yesterday announced a series of cost
cutting measures in the face of continuing financial difficulties.
Varig hopes the measures, the latest of its restructuring moves, will lead
to monthly savings of up to Dollars 6m.
The company, which has not made a profit since 1989, said that it would seek
to reduce its 24,000 workforce by up to 10 per cent.
Staff numbers have already been cut from 29,000 under previous
restructurings.
Varig also intends to reduce its regional network in Brazil.
In March, the company suspended lease payments on 50 aircraft for two months
in order to renegotiate its leases, which it thought too expensive.
Varig said the payment suspension, due to expire later this month, had the
backing of its main Brazilian lending banks.
The banks wanted to see a reduction in the company's annual lease costs of
Dollars 500m, negotiated before the downturn in the airline industry.
Varig, which is privately owned, made losses of Dollars 97m in the year to
December 31. The company's main problems remain the still-depressed
Brazilian market and a stubbornly high cost base.
Other recent attempts to reduce costs have included a reduction in fleet
size and efforts to lift operational efficiency, which the company said
could lead to annual savings of Dollars 30m.
