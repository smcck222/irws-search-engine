FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Profits surge at Swedish
steelmaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Firmer prices and increased volumes helped SSAB, the Swedish steel group,
lift first-quarter pre-tax profits sharply, to SKr478m (Dollars 62.9m) from
SKr23m, writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
It says profits for the full year could be nearly twice last year's SKr776m,
provided current market trends continue.
The group, one of Europe's few profitable steelmakers, noted that supply and
demand in western Europe had improved during the spring. 'This should
improve chances for certain price increases during the second half of the
year,' it said.

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Pall above entertainment wedding
 -The Dollars 8bn Viacom-Blockbuster union looks shaky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dead, but just not buried.
That was the epitaph pronounced this week by one Wall Street analyst on the
proposed Dollars 8bn takeover of video retailer Blockbuster Entertainment by
Viacom, the film, television and publishing group. The takeover was
announced at the start of this year as part of Viacom's successful bid for
Paramount Communications.
Neither Viacom nor Blockbuster is acknowledging the deal is off, and the
merger agreement gives them until the end of September to consummate the
marriage.
However, it is hard to find anyone on Wall Street who thinks the deal will
go through in anything like its present form, and there are indications the
two sides are discussing various forms of co-operation short of a merger.
In a letter to shareholders this week, Mr Wayne Huizenga, Blockbuster
chairman, said there could be no assurance its board would be able to
recommend a deal.
Formal or not, the ending of the engagement has significant implications for
both parties. For Viacom, it increases pressures to sell off assets acquired
when it took over Paramount. For Blockbuster, it creates question marks over
the group's strategy, and makes it a potential takeover target for another
media company.
The death knell has been sounding for the deal ever since Viacom took over
Paramount in March, as victory sharply depressed the price of Viacom stock.
Investors feared the company had overpaid for the film and publishing group,
and burdened itself with too much debt.
That in turn endangered the Blockbuster deal, for Viacom proposes paying for
the video retailer in stock: 0.08 of a share of Class A stock and 0.60615 of
a share of non-voting class B stock for each Blockbuster share. Blockbuster
shareholders would also get limited protection against poor Viacom
share-price performance - an award of up to 0.13829 of a share on the first
anniversary of the consummation of the merger.
However, based on Viacom stock's trading price yesterday, that package would
give Blockbuster shareholders only Dollars 21 1/2 a share, Dollars 9 1/2 a
share less than the level at which Blockbuster shares were trading before
January's announcement. Blockbuster shareholders are hardly likely to accept
such a deal. This is reflected in that the company's shares are trading
substantially higher than the bid terms, at around Dollars 26 1/2 .
The two sides could try to restructure the deal, but there are no signs of
Viacom being prepared to do so.
Instead, the companies appear to to be discussing a more limited form of
co-operation, such as renaming Viacom's Showtime cable television film
channel 'The Blockbuster Channel', and possibly using it as an outlet for
movies made by Blockbuster's Spelling Entertainment/ Republic Pictures
Hollywood film units.
For Viacom, the main attraction of the marriage with Blockbuster was always
financial. As part of the merger deal, Blockbuster agreed to make a Dollars
1.25bn investment in Viacom stock (on top of the Dollars 600m it had
committed earlier in the Paramount bid), giving the company cash to boost
its offer at a crucial moment in the takeover battle.
The merger also promised to bolster Viacom's balance sheet - weighed down
with bid-related debt - with the injection of Blockbuster's strong cashflow
from retailing.
If the merger does not go through, Viacom will come under increased pressure
to sell off peripheral Paramount assets to lower debt. It is already
weighing offers for New York's Madison Square Garden arena, though Mr Sumner
Redstone, Viacom's chairman, insists it does not intend to sell any
'strategic' assets.
For Blockbuster, the main attraction of the Viacom marriage was to diversify
the group away from the video rental market, which is expected to face
strong competition from inter-active television over the next decade.
If the deal is abandoned, Mr Huizenga may have a tough job convincing Wall
Street the company has an equally-compelling strategy for growth. He could
also have a hard time convincing shareholders the equity investment already
made in Viacom is worthwhile. This is because the stake was bought at
Dollars 55 per Viacom B share against a stock market price of Dollars 26
yesterday. Abandonment of the marriage would allow Blockbuster some
compensation for this drop, but possibly not enough to cover the investment.

<TEXT>
Ares-Serono, the Geneva-based leader in human fertility drugs, is selling
its diagnostics division to BioChem Pharma of Montreal for Dollars 44m in
cash and Dollars 21m in notes.
The group is developing biotechnology-based drugs for treating infertility
and multiple sclerosis.
It plans to invest SFr300m (Dollars 208m) in expanding production facilities
in Switzerland.
The deal is the latest in a series of transactions this week that
illustrates a fresh drive by pharmaceutical companies to focus resources on
their most competitive businesses.
Earlier this week Roche, the Swiss group, took over Syntex of the US for
Dollars 5.3bn.
The Anglo-US drugs group SmithKline Beecham announced it would buy
Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, a US drug distribution group, for
Dollars 2.3bn, while Eastman Kodak put its three healthcare divisions up for
sale.
Ares-Serono's diagnostics division was established in the 1970s and was
boosted substantially with the purchase of Baker Instruments of the US in
1988. It had sales of Dollars 89.3m last year, 12 per cent of the group
total.

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Jefferson Smurfit prices US
offer at Dollars 13
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jefferson Smurfit, the Irish paper and packaging group, yesterday priced an
initial public offering of 19.25m shares in its US division at Dollars 13.
The company also offered Dollars 400m of senior notes in Container
Corporation, which is owned by its US arm.
The equity offering is part of a Dollars 2bn refinancing plan for Jefferson
Smurfit Corporation in the US, which is partly owned by two equity funds run
by Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank.
Mr Michael Smurfit, chairman of the Irish group, said he was pleased the
company had achieved the offering 'despite extremely difficult and volatile
markets'.
In addition to the 19.25m shares to be sold to the public, a unit of the
parent Jefferson Smurfit group will also buy 11.54m shares at the same price
as the public offering.
The remainder of the refinancing comes from a bank facility of Dollars
1.65bn, of which a Dollars 900m loan will be delayed until December. That
loan will be used by the company to redeem Dollars 844m of junk bonds which
date back to 1989.
The refinancing will save the US company Dollars 68.3m a year in interest
payments on its debt burden, which is largely made up of junk bonds. The US
company has struggled under high interest payments and weak paper and
packaging markets, pushing it into the red in the past three years.
However, company officials say the market is on the upturn again with prices
for liner board - its main product - increasing by Dollars 55 a tonne over
the past five months and another price rise scheduled for June. The price
increases will add Dollars 110m a year to the company's bottom line.

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Video group to develop Dollars
1bn park
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blockbuster Entertainment yesterday said it was forming a Blockbuster Park
division as part of the group's transformation from a video rental company
to a full-scale entertainment conglomerate, writes Richard Tomkins.
The division's first project will be the development of the Dollars 1bn
Blockbuster Park, a sports and entertainment complex that the group wants to
build on a 2,500-acre site near Fort Lauderdale in Florida.
If the project goes ahead, one function of the complex will be to serve as a
home to two sports teams owned by Mr Wayne Huizenga, Blockbuster's chairman
 -the Florida Panthers, an ice hockey team, and the Florida Marlins, a
baseball team.
At one end of the complex will be a 20,000-seat hockey arena for the
Panthers and at the other a 45,000 to 50,000-seat baseball stadium for the
Marlins. In between an entertainment village will feature restaurants, shops
and a theme park.
Broadcast facilities, a film and television production studio, a 15- to
20-screen cinema, virtual reality entertainment, a sports museum, a golf
course and a hotel are also planned for the site.
Blockbuster already owns 1,800 acres of the site - mainly scrubby marshland
straddling the Broward and Dade county lines. However, the project has to
overcome environmental objections and win approval from the planning
authorities before it can go ahead.

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: US carrier posts Dollars 71.6m
deficit in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Continental Airlines, the Texas-based carrier that emerged from its second
bankruptcy in April last year, yesterday reported a net loss of Dollars
71.6m for the first quarter.
It blamed the effects of an exceptionally severe winter on its operations in
the north-east US and teething troubles associated with the rapid expansion
of its low-cost, no-frills services on short-haul routes.
The loss appeared to mark an improvement on the net loss of Dollars 107.9m
in last year's first quarter, but the previous year's figures are not
strictly comparable because the company was recapitalised when it emerged
from bankruptcy.
A better indicator was the performance at the operating level, where
operating losses were unchanged at Dollars 55.2m.
This was in sharp contrast with last year's fourth quarter when the company
reported operating profit of Dollars 8.5m, compared with operating losses of
Dollars 43.7m the previous time.
Most other US airlines have reported first-quarter losses this year because
of bad winter weather or low-fare competition, but most have improved their
performance from last year because of a slight increase in revenues and a
big fall in fuel costs.
Continental's revenues were unchanged at Dollars 1.4bn, and nearly all the
reduction in net losses was attributable to a tax credit of Dollars 42.8m.
Fully diluted loss per share was Dollars 2.86.
Mr Robert Ferguson, chief executive, said the severe winter had cost the
airline an estimated Dollars 28m in lost revenues. That and teething
troubles with the expansion of its low-cost flights had caused the
proportion of scheduled services completed to fall to 95.3 per cent from
98.3 per cent.
Mr Ferguson said the operational problems had been mostly corrected and the
company had achieved a significant operating and bottom-line profit in
March.
He said the low-cost operation - dubbed CALite - was exceeding its financial
targets and Continental was 'ever more confident' of its success.

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Travel agent finds tax
'discrepancies'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reiseburo Kuoni, the Swiss travel agency group, is in discussions with the
UK Inland Revenue about 'discrepancies' dating back to the late 1970s.
Mr Peter Oes, chief executive, said yesterday he expected the investigations
to be completed by the autumn.
The company is believed to have approached the Inland Revenue and launched
its own investigation using an external auditor after discovering the tax
problems.
A spokesman for Kuoni said no provision had been made for the charge in its
1993 accounts, and any additional tax payments would be shown in the 1994
results.
He said the company would probably announce the amount as soon as the
investigation was complete, especially if it would have a material effect on
the year's results.
Mr Oes forecast that net income this year would reach a record. Net income
last year slipped to SFr44.7m (Dollars 30.8m) from SFr49.9m in 1992.
Kuoni is one of Europe's largest agents with revenues last year of SFr2.4bn.
Domestic business accounts for nearly half of company revenue.

<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Indonesian government is to list 25 per cent of PT Indosat, the
state-owned telecommunications group, in New York. It has hired Merrill
Lynch as lead underwriter.
The American depositary receipt issue will introduce one of Indonesia's
largest companies to the international financial community and will mark the
first time an Indonesian company has listed shares overseas before doing so
at home.
A further 10 per cent of the company will be listed on the Jakarta stock
exchange. PT Danareksa Sekuritas will manage the domestic share sale.
Brokers in Jakarta estimate Indosat will raise at least Dollars 500m in New
York. Mr Tjahjono Soerjodibroto, Indosat's president, said the share
placement would take place in the second half of this year.
Indosat is one of Asia's most profitable companies. In 1992, the company's
assets were valued at Dollars 690m. It employs about 1,600 people. Mr
Soerjodibroto said that figures were not available for last year but the
telecommunications company had a healthy track record.
Indonesia will invest Dollars 10bn over the rest of the decade to expand
telecommunications across its archipelago of nearly 14,000 islands.
The decision to list overseas was prompted by the fact that the Jakarta
stock exchange limits share prices to 15 times earnings.
Merrill Lynch is believed to have advised Indosat to sell its shares at
about 30 times prospective 1994 earnings in New York.
However, not everyone is convinced that selling shares abroad is Indosat's
best option. Some local officials and brokers argue that a larger portion of
the shares should be sold in Jakarta to stimulate development of the local
stock market.

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney wins banks' support
for shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the troubled French amusement park company, said yesterday that
92 per cent of its creditor banks, holding 90 per cent of its debt, had
signed the memorandum of understanding that sets out the restructuring
scheme designed to bring the company back to health, agencies report.
Euro Disney, whose parent is the US entertainment group Walt Disney, said 'a
sufficient number of banks have agreed to underwrite more than FFr3bn
(Dollars 508m) of a proposed FFr6bn rights offering'.
The creditor banks will underwrite 51 per cent of the offering and the
remainder will be guaranteed by Disney, in line with its 49 per cent stake
in Euro Disney.
The rights issue, scheduled for early summer, will be formally proposed at
an extraordinary meeting to be called shortly, Euro Disney said.
All the proceeds of the offering will be used to repay the lenders, bringing
total bank debt to about FFr10bn. Euro Disney has a total debt of FFr21bn.
The restructuring will involve a halving of the nominal value of Euro Disney
shares to FFr5 from FFr10.
Euro Disney said the broad lines of the agreement had been presented at the
shareholders' meeting on March 14, but the company had since agreed 'a
significant addition' to grant all shareholders - including Walt Disney -
warrants valid for 10 years that allow them to buy Euro Disney shares at
FFr40.
The group said revenues for the six months to March 31 had declined to
FFr1.572bn, compared with FFr1.794bn in the same period of fiscal 1993.
In spite of this, the first-half operating loss narrowed to FFr1.048bn from
FFr1.18bn, due largely to a 25 per cent reduction in general and
administrative expenses and a reduction of lease payments resulting from
lower interest rates. Net losses were reduced to FFr1.055bn in the first
half of fiscal 1994 from FFr4.338bn, due largely to a change in accounting
methods.

<TEXT>
Avesta Sheffield, the Swedish-British stainless steel producer, yesterday
struck an optimistic note about prospects in 1994 after a strong recovery in
the first quarter.
The group, which is 40 per cent owned by British Steel, made a SKr111m
(Dollars 14m) profit after financial items, compared with a SKr43m loss in
the same 1993 quarter. The loss for the whole of last year totalled SKr98m.
It said the performance had benefited from higher demand, cost-cutting and
changes to inventory prices.
Mr Per Molin, president, said the improved profits level was expected to be
maintained over the rest of the year, against a background of general
economic recovery in the western world.
He forecast a continued upturn in demand for the group's products, but
warned it might not be at the same rate as in the first quarter because of
restocking.
He noted that prices were recovering but 'they have not yet reached a
satisfactory level and are still below 1993 average levels'.
Demand for the group's main products, cold rolled sheet and plate, rose
strongly in early 1994. Together with the weaker krona, the trend enabled
the group to lift sales to SKr3.98bn from SKr3.49bn.
Sales of cold rolled sheet and plate rose to SKr2.04bn from SKr1.80bn but
the division tumbled to a SKr6m loss from a SKr27m profit because prices
were lower. A recovery is expected over the rest of the year.
The group's hot rolled plate division achieved a SKr45m profit after last
year's SKr18m loss, as turnover climbed to SKr635m from SKr587m.
Avesta, which was formed in late 1992 from a merger between Avesta and the
stainless steel interests of British Steel, recently approved a SKr592.5m
rights issue.
It plans to invest more than SKr1bn over the next three years.

<TEXT>
Philips, the Dutch electronics manufacturer which and the world's largest
producer of light bulbs, has agreed to buy AEG Lichttechnik, a lighting
engineering company, from AEG of Germany.
The Dutch company declined to reveal the purchase price, but said AEG
Lichttechnik was profitable and had generated sales of nearly DM300m
(Dollars 174m) last year.
'Philips Lighting considers the acquisition essential for its position in
Scandinavia and in the main European lighting market, Germany,' it said. The
transaction reflects the desire of AEG, part of the Daimler-Benz group, to
concentrate on its core electronics activities.
AEG Lichttechnik, which focuses mainly on professional lighting equipment,
has a plant near Hanover in Germany and a subsidiary in Finland, Idman Oy,
which operates a factory in Mantsala.
The company has a total workforce of 1,200.
Philips said the AEG business would continue to use its own brand names and
would operate in parallel with the Dutch company's own lighting sector.
Lighting is Philips' most profitable business. The sector posted an
operating profit margin of 13 per cent in the 1994 first quarter.

Volkswagen, the German carmaker, said Skoda, its partially-owned Czech unit,
had finally agreed its annual accounts, Reuter reports from Wolfsburg.
Problems had existed between VW and Skoda over VW's accounting for 1993
which showed Skoda had made a net loss of DM246m (Dollars 144m) after a
DM233m profit in 1992.
The loss resulted almost exclusively from adjustments to Skoda's accounts to
bring them into line with international standards which include more
depreciation and write-downs.
Without the adjustments, Skoda would have made an DM8m profit in 1993 after
a DM70m profit a year earlier, VW said.

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Strong US demand helps
Electrolux beat forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electrolux, the world's leading producer of household appliances, yesterday
announced a SKr668m (Dollars 84.5m) profit after financial items for the
first quarter following strong US demand and more stable conditions in
Europe.
The result, which compares with a SKr122m profit in the same 1993 period,
beat expectations, taking the company's B share up SKr6 to SKr429.
The group, which has agreed to buy AEG's household appliance division for
DM730m (Dollars 427m), said operating income rose 88 per cent to SKr1.06bn
from SKr563m. Sales were up 11 per cent at SKr26.6bn, helped by a 7 per cent
rise in volumes and a favourable exchange rate.
Electrolux said operating income had improved in both Europe and North
America, helped by restructuring and higher demand for household appliances.
However, it stressed that the European recovery was patchy, with stronger
performances in the UK, Spain and the Nordic region offset by weakness in
Germany, France and Italy.
Household appliances saw sales rise to SKr15.0bn from SKr13.8bn. Operating
income for white goods was 'substantially' higher in both Europe and the US.
Results from air conditioners, floor-care, sewing machines and compressors
also improved.
The improvement was flattered by the company's difficulties last year in its
North American and Spanish markets. Restructuring and one-off charges
reduced household appliance income by SKr300m in the first quarter of 1993.
Commercial appliances had a more difficult quarter, with sales rising
marginally to SKr2.30bn from SKr2.29bn and operating income remaining
static. Refrigeration and cleaning equipment both reported lower operating
income, but industrial laundry equipment improved its result.
Outdoor products increased operating income as sales rose to SKr4.25bn from
SKr3.95bn; there was also a better performance from industrial products
where sales climbed to SKr5.05bn from SKr3.96bn.
Group net financial expenses fell to SKr391m from SKr441m, due to lower
interest rates and a reduction in tied-up capital.
Mr Leif Johansson, group president, said the group would concentrate on
increasing operating margins and boosting its market position in 1994.

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Reduction in capital gains
depresses Rhone-Poulenc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group which was
privatised last year, reported a sharp fall in first-quarter net profits to
FFr189m (Dollars 32m) from FFr676m in the first three months of 1993.
The company said the decline, which contrasts with improved results at other
European chemicals groups, largely reflected the sharp reduction in capital
gains on the disposal of assets and the absence of currency gains. Both
factors lifted profits in the same period last year.
Operating profits slipped by much less than the net result, falling to
FFr1.68bn from FFr1.74bn. Sales increased to FFr20.09m from FFr19.8bn for
the three months.
Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman, said the results showed the beginnings of an
upturn in sectors sensitive to recession and a stabilisation in the group's
healthcare activities.
However, in spite of the improvement, he said the company did not expect a
genuine upturn in the European economy this year.
Organic and inorganic chemicals activities benefited from improved sales,
lifting profits to FFr57m from break-even last year in spite of continued
weakness in prices.
The fibres and polymers division recorded strong gains, increasing profits
to FFr134m from FFr51m, while specialty chemicals saw profits rise by 22 per
cent to FFr179m. The healthcare division, which includes US-based
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, reported slightly higher profits of FFr1.23bn.
The most difficult problems were encountered in the group's agricultural
activities, which include herbicides, pesticides and insecticides. .
Operating profits declined by 29 per cent to FFr343m.
According to Rhone-Poulenc, sales were affected by bad at the beginning of
the year in Europe and the US. The market has since started to recover, the
company said, adding that the division was on course for improved profits
for the full year.
Industry observers said full-year profits for the group as a whole were
difficult to predict because of the importance of asset sales. In the first
quarter of last year, for example, gains on asset sales amounted to FFr244m,
compared with just FFr17m in the first three months of this year.

FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: AMB ahead despite Spanish losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second-biggest
insurance group after Allianz, reported net profits of DM85m (Dollars 50m)
for last year, up from DM73m.
The increase was achieved in spite of a sharp fall in operating profits from
mainstream insurance activities. These fell to DM147m from DM289m. They were
hit by a number of factors, including large losses at the two Spanish
subsidiaries.
The group has been in the throes of an intense reorganisation over the past
year. The most important move was the sale of a majority interest in the BfG
Bank to Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, concluded at the end of 1992.
After years of losses, the group benefited from a special dividend of
DM24.6m last year as part of the terms of the sale.
Total unconsolidated premium income for the group was DM14.4bn, up 8.8 per
cent. Pre-tax profits from continuing businesses fell to DM105.5m from
DM111.3m, while the dividend for 1993 will be unchanged at DM14 a share.
AMB predicted that the 1994 result would at least match 1993, in spite of
the long-awaited liberalisation of the German insurance market this summer.
The aim is to take premium income up to DM15.5bn in the current year.
Mr Wolfgang Kaske, chief executive, said the group had implemented a
wide-ranging rationalisation ahead of the opening up of the domestic
insurance market under European Union legislation on July 1.
He predicted competition would gradually increase in the German market over
the next few years.
This would be reflected in new products and pressure on prices, although he
said the initial impact of the changes would be limited.
It has being tidying up its group structure, acquiring majority control of
the numerous satellite companies in the AMB orbit.
For example, the group has taken its holding in Volksfursorge, a large
German insurance company, to 75 per cent from 50 per cent.
AGF, the French insurance group, owns 33 per cent of AMB, balanced by a
block of shares owned by large German institutions such as Dresdner Bank.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Ford of Britain cuts deficit to Pounds 92m
 -After three years of successive losses UK carmaker looks set to return to
the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford of Britain, the leader of the UK new car market, suffered a third
successive year of heavy losses in 1993 (excluding Jaguar) and reported the
worst financial performance of any of the leading carmakers in the UK.
It reduced its pre-tax loss to Pounds 92m, however, from a deficit of Pounds
353m in 1992 and a loss of Pounds 430m in 1991 (excluding Jaguar).
Ford claimed yesterday that it was on the road to recovery and had performed
better than expected so far this year, helped by the growing strength of the
UK new car market.
It is understood that Ford of Britain returned to profit in the first
quarter this year, and it is expected to achieve a significant profit for
the whole of 1994.
The UK arm's pre-tax losses, which have totalled Pounds 875m in the past
three years - excluding Jaguar, the UK luxury carmaker, which is owned
directly by the Ford parent company in the US - contrast sharply with the
robust profits earned throughout the recession by Vauxhall, the UK
subsidiary of General Motors and Ford's chief rival in the UK.
Vauxhall's pre-tax profits fell by only 17 per cent last year to Pounds
185.1m, and it has earned total pre-tax profits of Pounds 780.5m in the past
four years.
Among the other volume carmakers in the UK, Rover Group, which was taken
over by BMW of Germany in March, suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 9m last
year, but it achieved a considerable turnround at the operating level with a
profit before interest and tax of Pounds 56m, compared with a deficit of
Pounds 49m a year earlier.
Peugeot Talbot, the UK subsidiary of the PSA Peugeot Citroen group of
France, has suffered a continuous decline in profitability for the past four
years and fell into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.7m last year, from a profit
of Pounds 10.2m in 1992 and a peak profit of Pounds 123m in 1989.
The reduction of Ford of Britain's pre-tax loss last year was helped by
one-off gains from the disposal of Ford Credit and Aston Martin to the Ford
US parent com-pany.
Without these moves the pre-tax loss would have been Pounds 136m. Ford of
Britain's automotive operations had an operating loss last year of Pounds
114m compared with a loss of Pounds 237m in 1992. Turnover declined slightly
to Pounds 5.33bn (Pounds 5.38bn).
Ford of Britain, traditionally one of the most profitable parts of the Ford
group worldwide before it plunged deep into loss during the UK recession,
has been forced into a drastic restructuring with heavy cuts in its
workforce and a big reduction in the manned capacity of its British plants.
The workforce of the core Ford of Britain automotive operations had been cut
to 30,400 by the end of 1993, from 34,200 a year earlier and 39,000 at the
end of 1991.
Its share of the UK new car market has been under heavy attack, not least
from Vauxhall.
Ford's new car sales in the UK rose by 8 per cent last year to 381,671, but
it under-performed the market in which overall new car sales increased by
11.6 per cent.
Its UK new car market share fell to 21.5 per cent, its lowest level for more
than 20 years. Its share has been gradually eroded from a peak of just over
30 per cent in the early 1980s.
By contrast Vauxhall has doubled its market share since the beginning of the
1980s, from 8.6 per cent in 1981 to 17.1 per cent last year, while the PSA
Peugeot Citroen group has also made big inroads, increasing its UK market
share to 12.6 per cent last year from only 5.4 per cent 10 years ago.
Ford's problems in the UK were compounded last year by the collapse of its
car exports to continental Europe, which fell to only 11,600 from 74,900 a
year earlier, as west European new car sales suffered their steepest fall of
the post-war period.
Its overall vehicle exports, including commercial vehicles, dropped to
82,000 from 162,000 in 1992 and 214,000 in 1991.
The total output from its three vehicle assembly plants at Dagenham,
Halewood and Southampton fell by 13 per cent to 391,100 (449,600). Engine
production at Dagenham fell to 399,713 (567,424), while engine output at
Bridgend dropped to 472,231 (510,052).
The assembly plants worked at only 63 per cent of installed capacity last
year compared with 71 per cent in 1992.
As production was cut back to keep pace with falling exports, Ford had to
cut a total of 145 shifts at the vehicle assembly plants - 61 at the Transit
van plant at Southampton, 54 at the Fiesta small car plant at Dagenham, and
30 at the Escort plant at Halewood.
The decline in exports of cars and components cut the value of Ford of
Britain's total exports to Pounds 1.7bn from Pounds 2.2bn a year earlier. It
has had a balance of trade deficit for the past 13 years, and the deficit
increased substantially last year, although Ford refused to disclose
details.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aminex, the Irish oil group, reported increased losses in 1993, reflecting
substantial administration expenses and the costs of its failed bid for
Tuskar Resources.
On sales from continuing operations little changed at IPounds 281,702
(Pounds 274,300), losses before tax deepened to IPounds 135,200 (IPounds
66,307).
General and administration expenses rose to IPounds 217,808 (IPounds
139,692). An exceptional item of IPounds 82,675 related to Tuskar. Losses
per share were unchanged at 0.01p.
Aminex hasinvested Dollars 4.68m (Pounds 3.2m) in a joint venture with
Komineftj, a state-owned oil production company in the Komi republic of the
Russian Federation. Production from the Amkomi project has been raised to
some 2,200 barrels per day and further increases are planned.
Aminex expects the Russian output to dramatically boost turnover this year.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Credit lifts Regent Corp to Pounds 5.1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Regent Corporation, the property developer formerly known as Nouvelle,
returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.15m for the year to end-March. The
figure included a credit on voluntary arrangements totalling Pounds 4.8m.
The company was transformed over the year and comparisons are not
meaningful. For 1992-93 there was a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 3.91m after
taking account of disposal losses of Pounds 3.69m.
For 1993-94 pre-tax profits of continuing activities amounted to Pounds
606,000. That mainly reflected the merger of the Regent housebuilding
business in 1993 together with subsequent acquisitions.
Basic earnings on continuing operations emerged at 2.35p. There is again no
dividend but the directors anticipate being able to resume payments in the
foreseeable future.
Sales totalled Pounds 3.15m. Year-end gearing stood at 53 per cent but had
been reduced to nil by yesterday.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Finsbury Growth net asset value improves
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Finsbury Growth Trust had a net asset value of 125.4p per share at March 31,
up from 112.9p at the September year-end and 102.9p at end-March 1993.
Mr Michael Reeve, chairman, said the 11 per cent advance in value over the
last six month period outperformed both the trust's benchmarks - the FT-SE
100 and the FT-SE-A All-Share - which rose 1.6 per cent and 3.7 per cent
respectively.
The trust saw net revenue improve to Pounds 504,000 (Pounds 455,000) in the
six months to end-March, equivalent to earnings of 1.1p (1p).
The interim dividend is maintained at 0.9p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BMSS, the USM-traded timber and building materials merchant, benefited from
reduced distribution and administrative costs and lower interest charges and
returned to the black in the 12 months to January 31.
The pre-tax outcome - Pounds 314,139 against losses last time of Pounds
95,498 - came on turnover marginally down at Pounds 14.9m (Pounds 15.2m) and
was struck after a Pounds 284,000 reduction in distribution and
administrative costs to Pounds 4.34m. Interest payable declined to Pounds
184,418 (Pounds 306,360).
Gearing at the year-end stood at 29 per cent (24 per cent), reflecting the
acquisition in December of Price &amp; Brown, a heating and plumbing operation.
A proposed final dividend of 1.5p maintains the total at 3p; earnings per
share were 3p (losses of 0.7p).

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Positive outcome for Chiroscience drug
trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chiroscience, the Cambridge biotechnology company, has had positive results
from its first set of clinical trials since its flotation in February.
The phase one trial was conducted on 14 young, healthy male volunteers and
compared Chiroscience's purified form of an existing anaesthetic with the
established version. The purified version 'demonstrated that it has a higher
tolerability', said Mr John Padfield, chief executive. 'It also demonstrated
its efficacy.'
Chiroscience purifies drugs that are sold as a mixture of two virtually
identical chemical structures. By separating the two structures it hopes to
eliminate one that produces more side effects or is less effective.
The approach should also cut the time taken for a drug in trials to be
approved because much of the work needed for approval has already been done
with the mixture.
The trials were on a purified version of the long acting local anaesthetic
bupivacaine called levobupivacaine. It is usually used for women in
childbirth as an epidural.
Mr Padfield said that independent industry figures showed the global market
to be worth about Dollars 100m (Pounds 68m) a year. It is supplied in the UK
by Astra, the Swedish company, under the brand name Marcain. However, the
potential market for levobupivacaine is substantially greater than this
given 'improved safety profile and possible additional indications such as
cancer pain,' said Mr Padfield. 'Levobupivacaine also has potential
applications in day surgery where a safer, long-acting agent could encourage
an increased number of long surgical procedures to be carried out under
regional rather than general anaesthesia,' he said.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Co-op societies in merger proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Co-operative Retail Services, the second largest co-operative retailer in
the UK, yesterday launched a new proposal for a merger with the largest,
Co-operative Wholesale Society, to create a significant retailing force.
The combined societies would have annual turnover of more than Pounds 3bn -
about 75 per cent from grocery sales - making them the UK's seventh largest
retail group.
The latest of three attempts to merge the groups foundered in 1990 when they
failed to agree on the structure of the board. But as the CRS published a
new merger manifesto, 'The Time is Right', both groups said they were
hopeful.
'There is a tangible will within both societies to make it happen,' said Mr
Harry Moore, CRS chief executive.
The CWS responded that it was on the record as supporting a merger.
'If the CRS and its members are enthusiastic and convinced of the case, we
welcome that.'
The CRS move came as it revealed a small increase in its pre-tax surplus for
the year to January 29 to Pounds 26.7m, against Pounds 25.9m which excluded
a Pounds 22m exceptional gain from the sale of its dairy business.
Turnover fell 6 per cent from Pounds 1.36bn to Pounds 1.27bn, but adjusting
for the dairy disposal, sales fell 0.7 per cent.
Mr Moore said this was a 'resilient performance' amid tough competition in
the grocery market and given that the previous year was 53 weeks. He added
that the CRS, which includes the Pioneer, Leo's and Stop &amp; Shop formats, had
held market share and increased gross margin - in contrast to many grocery
groups - through better buying and adjusting the product mix.
However, Mr Moore warned that co-operative retailers faced the threat of
being squeezed between discounters and 'premium chains'. A merger was vital
if they were to fight back.
Failure to achieve that 'could signal the end of the Co-op as a serious
national retail force'.
The benefits included cost savings, increased financial strength for
investment and development, doubled purchasing power, and the ability to
compete nationally with cohesive marketing campaigns.
The main issue, as in 1990, will be achieving the correct balance on the
board between individual members and the CWS's corporate members, which
include CRS itself and regional co-operative societies which have joined the
CWS in recent years.
Mr Moore said changes in the structure of both groups since 1990 increased
the chances of agreement.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Vymura resists slide with Pounds 39m
placing tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vymura, the wallcoverings group which was originally part of ICI, has
resisted the slide in new issue pricing and is to be valued at Pounds 38.6m
via a placing price of 150p.
Mr David Simpson, a director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Vymura's sponsor and
financial adviser, said the price was exactly as planned when the flotation
was first announced six weeks ago.
'We have been seeing some softening of prices but there is still an appetite
for quality new issues.'
He added that in Vymura's case there was a comparable quoted company, Fine
Decor, whose share price has not weakened in the past few weeks.
The placing price represents 14.5 times last year's earnings per share.
The notional yield is 3.7 per cent, slightly higher than Fine Decor.
BZW is placing a total of Pounds 24.1m of shares, raising a net Pounds 10m
for the company.
Just over half the new money will be used to repay preference shares held by
institutions that backed a management buy-out in 1992.
UBS are brokers to the issue. Dealings are expected to start next Thursday.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: London Capital to get Pounds 150m valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Capital Holdings, the property investment company owned by Citibank,
will offer up to Pounds 104m of new shares in a flotation, valuing the
company at close to Pounds 150m, a small discount to its net asset value of
Pounds 160m.
Citibank will sell between 65 per cent and 70 per cent of its shares, while
LCH - the former Randsworth Trust property portfolio - will raise a further
Pounds 15m from new shares.
The value of LCH's 14 properties increased by 7.25 per cent to Pounds 244.8m
between December and mid-April. Management is optimistic that with limited
new property coming on stream before 1996, the outlook for property values
in London's west end remains positive.
According to James Capel, the brokers, vacancy rates in the west end are
expected to fall from 8.7 per cent in March 1994 to 2.5 per cent by March
1996, and prime rents should rise 30 per cent by the end of 1995.
However, the outlook for property flotations has become less rosy since LCH
announced its intention to float. The sector's premium to asset value has
all but disappeared, while the company will have to compete with a number of
property flotations, including Argent and Pillar.
LCH has recently signed a Pounds 100m loan facility from HSBC, and will have
gearing of less than 50 per cent. Mr Nigel Kempner, joint managing director,
said he would be happy to see gearing rise to about 70 per cent.
The shares will be offered through a placing and public offer, sponsored by
Baring Brothers. The pricing will be announced on May 25.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: MEPC pays Pounds 67m for Midlands
properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEPC, the quoted property company, has bought a Pounds 67m portfolio of
office and industrial properties in the Midlands from the Richardson Group,
a private property company.
It is also negotiating with John Laing, the construction company, about
acquiring Castlecourt, a Belfast shopping centre.
The 14 properties being acquired from Richardson total 1.75m sq ft of space
and range from industrial estates to newly erected government offices at the
Waterfront, Merry Hill, West Midlands. The overall yield was 9.5 per cent.
Two properties in the portfolio are under construction, namely the St Chads
office development in Birmingham and the Waterfront Business Park at Merry
Hill. The final price will be determined by the letting of these properties.
MEPC said the acquisitions gave it an interesting mixed portfolio to which
it believed it could add value.
Richardson said it intended to sell more investments this year, to 'take
full advantage of the current buying interest in investment properties'.
In a separate announcement, John Laing said it had received a number of
unsolicited offers for Castlecourt. It is pursuing exclusive negotiations
with MEPC.
Hanson Properties has sold a portfolio of properties for Pounds 85m to O&amp;H
Properties, a subsidiary of O&amp;H Holdings, a privately-owned development
company, based in Hammersmith, west London.
The portfolio, which is spread across England, Scotland and Wales, is
composed of office buildings (57 per cent) and shopping centres (38 per
cent) together with some warehouses (5 per cent).
Hanson said it was disposing of the portfolio as part of its general
strategy of selling properties that had been acquired with large
acquisitions.
About Pounds 30m of the initial consideration - which represents the
approximate net asset value of the properties - is in guaranteed deferred
notes.
The deal was funded by GE Capital, a subsidiary of the General Electric
Company, which has provided structured finance that included a share in the
equity appreciation of the properties.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Aerostructures expects Pounds 26m from
flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aerostructures Hamble Holdings, the former British Aerospace aircraft
components subsidiary, expects to raise about Pounds 26m net of expenses
when it comes to the market this month.
The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, said the money would be
used, alongside a new Pounds 10m unsecured revolving credit facility, to
repay Pounds 35m of debt incurred during the Pounds 47.6m management buy-out
in 1990. It will be raised through a placing and intermediaries offer.
Aerostructures Hamble, which occupies the site near Southampton where
Sunderland flying boats were built, made operating profits of Pounds 7.89m
on turnover of Pounds 70.4m in 1993, compared with profits of Pounds 7m on
turnover of Pounds 71.3m in 1992. The pathfinder puts pro forma pre-tax
profits for 1993 at Pounds 5.6m, after allowing Pounds 2m for restructuring.
The charge will cover the cost of shedding a further 200 jobs this year. At
the end of December the workforce had been reduced from 2,000 at the time of
the buy-out to 1,635.
The company, which is expected to be valued at more than Pounds 70m,
depended on BAe for 93 per cent of its business in 1990, but reduced that to
78 per cent last year.
Mr Andy Barr, chief executive, said new orders already won, including a
substantial contract from Boeing for wing parts for the 737-700, would
reduce the level further this year. He described the broadening customer
base as 'blue chip'.
The senior management, all with experience at Rover Group, is implementing
Japanese techniques learnt in the car business but not previously used in
the aircraft industry.
Mr Barr said that margins had improved from 8.9 per cent to 11.3 per cent in
three years, and he was seeking continuing improvements.
The management, including Mr Barr who has a 14.8 per cent stake, will be
selling some shares. Legal &amp; General Ventures Partners, the largest
institutional holder, with 36.7 per cent, is also likely to sell some of its
investment.
The flotation is sponsored by NM Rothschild and the broker is Smith New
Court.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Mercantile &amp; General Re swings back into
the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercantile &amp; General Reinsurance, the reinsurance subsidiary of the
Prudential, yesterday returned to the black.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 104m were achieved for 1993, against losses of
Pounds 45m last time, despite a Pounds 49m strengthening of reserves against
claims from business underwritten in prior years.
'The results have clearly benefited from our policy of profit before
volume,' said Mr John Engestrom, group chief executive. M&amp;G Re reduced its
exposure to general reinsurance following heavy catastrophe claims in recent
years.
As a result, general reinsurance premium income fell from Pounds 409m to
Pounds 332m, although the fall was less steep than the company envisaged a
year ago owing to rate increases in many areas of the international market.
The rate rises helped this segment of the business report profits of Pounds
5.6m (Pounds 143.5m losses).
In contrast, the group increased its premium from life reinsurance, in which
it is an international market leader, to Pounds 765m (Pounds 613m). Life
profits amounted to Pounds 73m (Pounds 67m).
Expansion in the life area was focused in the North American medical
expenses market.
Extra reserves were needed to meet claims from past catastrophes and marine
reinsurance liabilities incurred on policies underwritten in prior years. An
extra Pounds 9m was set aside to meet claims relating to asbestos and
pollution.
The shareholders' operating result - investment income plus 'smoothed'
capital gains - amounted to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 31.5m).

Dealings in Chartwell Group, the manufacturer of carpet tiles and toilet

shareholder approval of a proposed substantial acquisition, the terms of
which are currently being finalised'.
Chartwell has been linked recently with Sir Tim Bell, and his Lowe Bell
public relations company. There has been speculation that Lowe Bell could be

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: EuroDollar set for Pounds 100m summer float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EuroDollar, the UK's second-largest short-term car rental company, plans to
come to the market this summer through a placing and public offer which is
expected to value it at more than Pounds 100m.
EuroDollar has about 10 per cent of the UK market, compared with Avis's
estimated share of 14 per cent.
About 77 per cent of EuroDollar's revenue comes from corporate customers.
Its UK fleet of more than 12,000 vehicles operates from 104 branches.
EuroDollar has a master franchise agreement with Dollar, the US car rental
company, which grants EuroDollar a perpetual licence to operate an
international rental network in 33 countries.
Last August EuroDollar was the subject of a Pounds 118m management buy-out
from TSB Group, which was backed by Prudential Venture Managers.
The company was established as Swan National in 1973 by UDT, the credit
financing business which was bought by TSB in 1981.
Swan National was relaunched in 1989 as EuroDollar, to reflect its growing
international strategy. It is now the fifth largest vehicle rental company
in the world.
Mr Freddie Aldous, EuroDollar's chairman, set up the original business in
1973 and led last year's 11-strong MBO team.
He said: 'We believe that now is the right time to obtain a listing to
establish a sound financial footing for the long-term development of the
group.'
The issue will be sponsored by Schroders, with Warburg Securities acting as
broker.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Purchase gives fillip to Wassall shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Supporters of Wassall, the conglomerate whose acquisitive ambitions have
been thwarted in recent years, have waited a long time for yesterday's big
deal. Expectations were extremely high and they were not disappointed.
Wassall's shares rose 18p to a new high of 320p as the acquisition met with
universal approval from the company's followers.
Mr Paul Beaufrere, analyst at James Capel, the broker, summed up: 'If you
had put down on paper everything that Wassall wanted from a deal you would
come up with this.'
Mr Chris Miller, chief executive, said it closely matches Wassall's six main
acquisition criteria.
Established markets. General Cable serves three main markets in electrical,
telecommunications and consumer cables. It is among the market leaders in
both the electrical and consumer sectors, which generate two thirds of its
sales and are growing steadily.
In telecommunications it makes the heavy duty copper cable that connects
telephone exchanges - now almost entirely a replacement market following the
introduction of fibre optic cable - and is a smaller player in the
fast-growing data transmission market.
Everyday products. General Cable makes mainly low-technology products which
find their way into most American homes, cars and offices. Its products have
a high copper content - it is thought to be the biggest purchaser of copper
in the US - and relatively little labour content.
This makes it relatively immune to import threats, since the transport costs
are high and the savings to be had by using cheap non-US labour are modest.
The group makes more than 10,000 different products and Mr Miller said it
was 'inconceivable' that they were all profitable. 'But they do not have the
information available to tell.' Introducing such systems will be one of
Wassall's first tasks.
Asset-backed. Wassall is paying Dollars 269.8m (Pounds 180m) for net assets
valued at Dollars 331m at the end of 1993. The purchase price is less than
General Cable's Dollars 320m of inventories and receivables. 'The copper
inventory is simply far too high, with partly-worked copper lying about all
over the place.'
Potentially cash-generative. 'It is not cash generative at the moment, but
it very shortly will be,' said Mr Miller, pointing to the company's high
depreciation charge.
Poor relative performance. General Cable made an operating profit of just
Dollars 2.3m on sales of Dollars 763.5m last year, compared with a loss of
Dollars 32.9m on sales of Dollars 800.8m the previous year.
Although most of its markets have been hit by recession, Mr Miller says this
is poor even by the standards of an industry which is 'not particularly well
run'. Some of General Cable's competitors in the low added value markets are
already making margins of over 5 per cent while General Cable's figures for
the first quarter of this year show margins recovering to 2.7 per cent on
sales up by more than 10 per cent to Dollars 191.8m.
Mr Miller said he would be 'amazed' if it was ever a 10 per cent margin
business but added: 'Even if we only get it up to industry standards then it
will be a pretty good deal.' It has 22 factories 'not producing at anywhere
near capacity, which are where they are for distant historical reasons'.
History of under-investment. Until it was partially demerged in 1992 General
Cable was wholly owned by American Premier Underwriters, a privately-held
financial services group which ran it for cash.
'The managers were not allowed to spend any money with more than a two-year
payback,' said Mr Miller, who stressed that the capital investment needs
were 'tens of millions of dollars, rather than hundreds of millions'.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Blagden calls for Pounds 26m to help pay
off borrowings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blagden Industries, the steel drum maker hit by recession in continental
Europe, yesterday announced a 5-for-9 rights issue to raise almost Pounds
26m net of expenses.
The group is proposing to issue up to 25.86m new ordinary shares at 105p a
share. The shares closed 2p lower yesterday at 130p.
The issue was well flagged at the end of March, when the group passed its
final dividend after diving Pounds 10.6m into the red for 1993. The losses,
which included Pounds 13.3m of exceptional items and interest of Pounds
3.23m, breached the interest cover covenant with the group's main lender.
Part of the proceeds of the rights issue will be used to pay off Pounds 10m
of the debt with the main lender, which has conditionally agreed a
replacement unsecured facility up to January 1996.
Blagden said the rest of the proceeds would go initially towards reducing
outstanding bank borrowings across the group. In addition, it is expecting
shortly to enter into a formal agreement for the sale of its plastics
packaging businesses for Pounds 6.8m.
Mr Richard Searle, who became chief executive seven weeks ago, said
yesterday that group gearing would fall from above 80 per cent to about 25
per cent following the issue.
The strengthening of the balance sheet would put Blagden in a position to
finance the strategic development of its chemicals and protective equipment
divisions.
The group warned that there had been no significant changes in its main
markets in the first four months of this year.
The rights issue is fully underwritten by NM Rothschild and brokers are
Panmure Gordon.
COMMENT
The rights issue will bring much needed relief from financial pressures,
which will give the group breathing space to choose its own route forward.
There is plenty of room for better margins in the packaging division - the
rest is up to the new chief executive and his team. If they succeed in
creating a more balanced company built around the mature steel drum business
 -a good cash cow - Blagden could become a much more exciting bet than it
has been for some time.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Healthcall flotation price tag reduced to
Pounds 58m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flotation value of Healthcall, the doctors' deputising service, has been
cut to Pounds 58m from initial estimates of Pounds 70m as the new issues
market continues to cool.
The company is issuing fewer new shares than expected and the price is more
than 10 per cent lower than hoped for last month.
Mr Maurice Henchey, chief executive, said: 'Institutions liked the company,
but they have been inundated with new issues. In the circumstances we did
remarkably well.'
He added that, with few existing shareholders selling, 'the most important
thing was to allow a lot of scope in the after-market'.
He said pricing had not been affected by expected government moves to reduce
the out-of-hours burden on family doctors.
The shares have been priced at 105p, equivalent to 14.9 times last year's
earnings from the group's continued healthcare operations. The notional
yield at the issue price is 4.8 per cent.
Shares valued at Pounds 31m are being placed with institutions by Morgan
Grenfell, of which Pounds 7.8m can be clawed back via an intermediaries
offer.
Applications must be received by James Capel, the stockbroker, by next
Thursday, with dealings due to start on May 18.
COMMENT
The last minute price cut should help the shares get off to a good start,
but there are some question marks over the long-term growth prospects of the
core business. Healthcall already has almost half the potential duty doctor
market, which has been growing strongly over the past few years. More
recently, revenue has been boosted by flu epidemics and rate increases.
However, the government is keen to stem the rising bill for out-of-hours
calls, a fair proportion of which could be dealt with more cheaply at
24-hour health centres. Healthcall already has five such pilot centres, but
a big shift away from home visits could require significant capital
investment with uncertain returns. The group is well-placed to capitalise on
the trend towards community-based care and has moved into new areas such as
eye-care services for residential homes. But these are currently too small
to offset any significant slow-down in the core business.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Greenway Holdings, the waste oil recycling business formerly known as
Kingston Oil &amp; Gas, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.77m for the 15
months to end-March.
The outcome compared with a deficit of Pounds 4.11m for the previous 12
months, struck after an exceptional provision of Pounds 4.49m against the
carrying value of its investment in its discontinued US oil and gas
operations.
The company has changed its year end to tally with that of the DCC Group,
its principal shareholder.
Turnover for the 15 months totalled Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 6.1m) and included
Pounds 701,000 (Pounds 1.58m) from discontinued operations.
Earnings per share emerged at 14.54p (31.44p losses) and a final dividend of
1.5p (nil) is proposed.

placing
</HEADLINE>

   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Capitol Group, the specialist security company, has placed 3.2m shares at
125p through sponsors Granville Davies; dealings in its shares will commence
on May 17.
The company, capitalised at Pounds 11.5m, provides a range of security
services, including fraud investigation, and port and ferry security.
Capitol has raised Pounds 1.5m from the placing, which will be used to fund
strategic acquisitions.
In addition, Mr Ken Dulieu, the founder, will receive Pounds 2m of the
proceeds, reducing his shareholding from 85 per cent to 59 per cent.
The shares are being issued on an adjusted p/e ratio of 15.1, based on
profits of Pounds 1m for the year to March 1994.
Mr Dulieu said that the port and ferry business had been the main source of
earnings growth in the past two years, but this was now being overtaken by
the increase in fraud investigation work, particularly in the City.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: B&amp;J counter proposal expected - Board's
support likely for SA retailer's plan to inject up to Pounds 60m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pepkor, the South African retailer, is expected today to offer to inject up
to Pounds 60m into Brown &amp; Jackson, which owns the troubled Poundstretcher
chain of variety discount retailers.
The Pepkor offer is likely to be backed by the B&amp;J board, which last month
recommended acceptance of a rescue deal with the Weisfelds, the millionaire
couple who created the What Everyone Wants discount clothing chain.
B&amp;J shareholders are due to vote at an EGM on Monday on the plan for Mr
Gerald and Mrs Vera Weisfeld to inject an initial Pounds 6m to meet the
lossmaking group's immediate working capital needs, in return for a 19 per
cent stake and two seats on the board.
However, Pepkor executives have continued talking to B&amp;J and last night were
still negotiating details of their counter-offer.
This would involve an immediate cash injection of up to Pounds 20m, in
return for an eventual substantial shareholding. The deal is unlikely to
involve any offer to existing shareholders.
Sources close to the talks dismissed a report that Pepkor would launch a
hostile Pounds 50m bid and described the 8p per share mentioned as 'far too
high'.
B&amp;J's shares last night closed 1p higher at 6 1/2 p, valuing the group at
Pounds 42m.
Pepkor is Africa's largest mass-market retailer. PEP, the group's core
business, sells to a predominantly black customer base.
Although its international presence has been hitherto restricted to
Scotland, where it operates a number of outlets under the Your More Store
name, it has been looking for further international acquisitions.
B&amp;J has been struggling to recover since the Pounds 16m rescue rights issue
which brought in new management in 1992. However, poorer than expected
trading last Christmas led to a profits warning in January. In March the
group announced losses of Pounds 12.7m for 1993, against expectations prior
to the warning of a Pounds 4m deficit.
The Weisfelds' proposal was their first business venture since they
unexpectedly left Amber Day, as WEW was then known, just eight months after
selling the chain to Amber Day for Pounds 47m in 1990. Since then, the
Weisfelds, who sold their 15 per cent stake in Amber Day for Pounds 11m,
have devoted most of their time to charity work.
Mr Weisfeld was not surprised by Pepkor's intervention, but said: 'What do
they know about British retailing? They are last-minute people, who have
been flushed out by our bid. Where were they when the company was going
bust?'

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Body Shop maintains recovery with Pounds
29.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Body Shop International continued its profits recovery, yesterday reporting
a rise at the pre-tax level for the year to end-February from Pounds 21.5m
to Pounds 29.7m, more than reversing the decline of the previous 12 months.
The shares rose 20p to 234p.
Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman, said the current year had started well with
'strong growth in all of our major markets'. He also said the group planned
to change its Memorandum of Association 'to crystallise the principles and
values of our business'.
He said this would mean that if the company was run at some future date by
people with different business ethics shareholders would 'have a hook to
hang them on'. He stressed this did not mean he and Mrs Anita Roddick,
managing director, had any less commitment to remaining with Body Shop.
The figures went some way to allaying investors' fears that Body Shop was
failing to counter competitive pressure in its home market. Comparable store
sales in the UK were level in the year, after a fall of 6 per cent last
time.
Further, the growth in international profits reduced the UK's contribution
to group operating profits to under 38 per cent.
During the year the group opened 6 shops in the UK, taking the total to 239,
out of a group-wide increase of 153 to 1,053 shops.
Group turnover rose 16 per cent to Pounds 195.4m, while total retail sales,
including franchisees' sales, were 18 per cent higher at Pounds 438.2m.
Operating profits rose 24 per cent to Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 24.3m) and there
was also a Pounds 1.1m profit on the sale of the 65.6 per cent stake in
Eastwick Trading, which operates shops in the Benelux countries and Austria.
Interest charges fell from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 1.5m as debt was reduced
from Pounds 28.5m to Pounds 11.8m, giving gearing of 12 per cent.
Operating profits in the UK rose from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 11.4m. In the
US, profits were ahead from Pounds 2.1m, a figure depressed by the Pounds
1.3m cost of moving the head office, to Pounds 6.2m. The rest of the
American region was flat at Pounds 2.4m. In Europe profits rose from Pounds
5.7m to Pounds 5.9m, while Asia, improved from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 2.4m.
Profits from Australia and New Zealand were ahead from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds
1.8m.
Earnings per share, excluding the profit on the Eastwick sale, were 36 per
cent higher at 10.1p. A final dividend of 1.25p is proposed to give a total
of 2p (1.7p).
COMMENT
These results should have confounded some of Body Shop's critics. True, UK
profits are unlikely to grow more than pedestrianly in future, but the rise
in US profits, for instance, shows what the group can achieve overseas when
it reaches the desired 'critical mass'. Further, Body Shop's revamped
management team has tightened up the business, and the investment in recent
years in new production facilities is beginning to pay off. On a forecast of
Pounds 33.5m pre-tax this year, the prospective p/e is just under 20. The
rating is nothing like it has been at times in the group's 10 year stock
market history, but is justified by current growth prospects.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lombard forced to cut float price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The impact of a falling UK stock market has forced Lombard Insurance to
reduce its flotation price.
The company yesterday announced it will issue Pounds 33m of shares through a
placing and intermediaries offer valuing it at Pounds 57m, compared with the
initial target of 'at least Pounds 65m'.
At the issue price of 160p, the shares are being sold on a p/e of 9.3 and
dividend yield of 6 per cent, based on the prospectus forecast of pro forma
Pounds 6.2m profits for the year to June 1994.
Even at the reduced price, brokers said the reception had been lukewarm,
reflecting concerns over increasing competition in the insurance market, and
the anticipated impact of weakening bond and equity prices.
Mr Andrew Laing, managing director, said there was no downward pressure on
premiums, as 'so much capacity went out in 1991 and 1992, that there is no
appetite for competition for the sake of it'.
Lombard will raise Pounds 16m after expenses and the redemption of
preference shares. The management buy-out team, which purchased Lombard from
its parent Continental Inc in May 1993 for Pounds 32m, will also be amply
rewarded.
The shares begin trading on May 13.
COMMENT
Lombard is focused on the lower risk portion of the general insurance
market, and has taken no exposure to London, let alone the US. The
management is confident that it offers limited risk at good time of the
cycle, but Lombard is in the sector of the market where everyone wants to
be, and competition is tightening. Having been reduced by 10 per cent, the
issue price looks more attractive, but institutions have shown little
appetite for the placing. The shares look set for a lacklustre debut.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Norcor set to reduce debt through listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norcor, the corrugated board maker, is aiming to eliminate a Pounds 19.2m
deficit on shareholders' funds with a proposed flotation later this month
which will value the Norwich-based group at about Pounds 40m.
The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, showed Norcor with net debt
of about Pounds 35m - including some Pounds 22m in loan notes. Bank debt of
Pounds 9.3m was rescheduled last month to be repayable on flotation.
Norcor expects to raise between Pounds 17m and Pounds 20m from the flotation
to pay the debt and fund between Pounds 4m and Pounds 8m in working capital.
One of its production lines is to be refurbished from the proceeds.
A further Pounds 18.5m in shares will be issued to satisfy loan note
obligations. The balance of loan note holders - representing Pounds 3.55m in
debt - are due to be repaid in 1995.
Norcor has faced a number of difficulties since the Pounds 32m management
buy-out in 1989. It failed to meet profit targets and was refinanced in
1991, while two of the past three years' accounts were qualified by
accountants. The group had been capitalising its goodwill, without any
provision for amortisation. Accounting practises have been changed in the
run-up to flotation, and the figures for 1993 were unqualified.
Earnings per share for 1993, excluding an exceptional insurance gain, fell
from 16.7p to 14.6p. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of more than
Pounds 4m this year, before exceptional items. Last year the group made
operating profits before exceptionals of Pounds 3.85m.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Associate companies help News Corp rise by 28%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's media and publishing group, yesterday
announced a 27.6 per cent rise in net profits but before abnormal items, to
ADollars 852.8m (Pounds 410m) in the nine months to end-March. Profits in
the third quarter were ADollars 227.9m, up from ADollars 178.4m.
But, as in previous quarters, the improvement was due to associate companies
 -BSkyB, the British satellite broadcaster, and Ansett Airlines - and
reduced interest charges. BSkyB had 3.4m subscribers - an increase of more
than 1m since last June. News News owns 50 per cent of BSkyB. Pearson, owner
of the Financial Times, has a minority interest.
But operating profits from News' core newspaper and publishing operations
fell to ADollars 303.7m in the quarter from ADollars 373.4m a year ago.
Their operating profits in the first nine months stood at ADollars 1.16bn,
down from ADollars 1.24bn. Group revenues were ADollars 2.59bn (from
ADollars 2.64bn) in the third quarter, and ADollars 8.42bn (ADollars 8bn) in
the nine months.
News said filmed entertainment, television and TV guide business showed
'strong gains,' but these were offset by lower results from UK newspapers,
book publishing and the 'free standing inserts' division. Results in 1992-93
were also boosted by the inclusion of the South China Morning Post, now
sold. However, even after adjusting for this, nine-month operating profits
nudged down to ADollars 1.17bn from ADollars 1.13bn.
On the newspaper side, operating profits fell from ADollars 167.9m to
ADollars 91.3m in the third quarter, due to the UK price war and SCMP
omission. However, News said its strategy of boosting circulation by cover
price reductions was being achieved, with The Sun's circulation up by 16 per
cent, and The Times by a third. That allowed The Sun to increase advertising
rates, and advertising revenues generally were up 11 per cent year-on-year.
Book-publishing made a ADollars 22.1m loss (from a ADollars 3.6m profit) in
the quarter. Magazines and inserts made ADollars 92.5m in operating profits,
down from ADollars 113.4m, but television improved from ADollars 55.2m to
ADollars 79.7m, and filmed entertainment from ADollars 31.9m to ADollars
61.9m.
Associate companies contributed ADollars 102.4m in the third quarter,
compared with ADollars 28.9m. Interest charges dipped from ADollars 180.4m
to ADollars 158.3m.
A net abnormal charge of ADollars 5.2m in the quarter, compared with a
ADollars 12.3m profit last year, left attributable net profits at ADollars
222.7m (ADollars 190.7m). The nine-month figure after abnormals stood at
ADollars 991.6m (ADollars 643.5m).

FT  06 MAY 94 / QVC has its sights on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QVC, the television home shopping channel, is planning to expand into
continental Europe with the possibility of local language channels in
Germany, France and Italy.
Mr William Schereck, president of QVC International and a close associate of
QVC executive Mr Barry Diller, said yesterday that talks with potential
partners were under way.
'Expect startling announcements within the next six months,' said Mr
Schereck who is responsible for taking the QVC concept around the world.
QVC has grown to a Dollars 1.2bn-a-year revenue business in the US in less
than eight years. It was launched in the UK last October and a month later
in Mexico.
The company said it had reached agreement with the Dutch cable television
association to transmit in the Netherlands and will launch in Norway in
June, Denmark in June or July, and Sweden and Belgium by the end of the
year.
They will be serviced from the UK in English with the help of bilingual
telephone operators.
Mr Schereck said joint ventures and channels in French, German and Italian
were the best way to tackle the biggest markets of Europe. He hoped to be
able to launch such channels in those countries next year.
Since its UK launch, the shopping channel estimates it has reached 4.5 per
cent of its potential customers - a faster rate than in the US. There, the
channel has signed up only 8 per cent of its potential customer base in
eight years. Mr Schereck confirmed yesterday the UK channel was in line to
reach its first year revenue target of Pounds 40m.
The QVC channel has also had talks with a UK supermarket group about
extending its range of 'impulse' buys, which include electrical goods,
jewellery and sports equipment, to packages for Pounds 30 or Pounds 40 of
non-perishable supermarket items such as cleaning equipment and canned
goods.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Healthy BP increases dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum yesterday capped its return to robust health with a 20 per
cent rise in its first quarter dividend to 2.5 pence a share. It was the
first such increase since 1992, when structural weaknesses and mounting debt
caused it to cut the payout to shareholders.
Investors welcomed the the signal of renewed confidence, and BP shares rose
16 1/2 p to close at 399 1/2 p.
Mr David Simon, chief executive, said the BP board was confident that the
company could operate profitably even with relatively low oil prices. 'It
was the right time to share some of the benefits' of BP's successful
cost-cutting, he said.
The company warned investors not to expect the same pace of dividend growth,
although it 'intends to grow the dividend progressively'.
The first quarter results exceeded analysts' expectations. Replacement cost
net profits before exceptional items were Pounds 305m, 32 per cent up on the
Pounds 231m recorded in the first quarter of 1993. Earnings per share were
5.6p (4.3p). After an exceptional gain of Pounds 23m (Pounds 18m a year
earlier), net profits were Pounds 328m (Pounds 249m).
The company attributed the performance to success at cutting costs, higher
production volumes and wider refining margins in the US. The chemicals
division returned to profit after 18 months.
It was the third successive quarter in which BP was cash positive excluding
proceeds from divestments. Net cash inflow excluding disposals was Pounds
342m, although the average North Sea oil price in the first quarter was
Dollars 13.92, 25 per cent lower than in 1993.
Analysts say BP's ability to generate large amounts of cash at low oil
prices probably persuaded the board it was safe to raise the dividend, even
though the company has not met all the targets it set when it cut the
dividend. These were: capital expenditure of Dollars 5bn a year or less;
annual debt reduction of Dollars 1bn or more; and Dollars 2bn in replacement
cost profits.
Mr Simon said debt now stands at Dollars 11.8bn (down Dollars 593m in the
quarter), its lowest level since 1988. About Dollars 400m has been raised
from disposals so far this year, with Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn expected for
the full year. That would bring full-year gearing down to 66 per cent,
according to company officials.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Wassall acquisition takes a bet on America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wassall, the conglomerate which lost the bid battle for Evode last year, has
clinched its first deal since 1991 with the Dollars 269.8m (Pounds 180m)
acquisition of General Cable in the US. The proposed purchase is being
partly funded by a Pounds 92.2m rights issue.
The City gave the thumbs up and the shares rose 18p to a new high of 320p.
The purchase of General Cable, which makes power, communications and
consumer product cables, will more than double Wassall's turnover and
increase US sales to more than three-quarters of the total.
Mr Chris Miller, chief executive, said: 'We are consciously taking a bet on
America.'
He said General Cable was an ideal target for Wassall, being a manufacturer
in established markets which has suffered from under-investment and
performed poorly relative to its competition. It barely broke even on sales
of Dollars 763m (Pounds 510m) last year.
The main vendor is American Premier Underwriters, formerly The Penn Central
Corporation, a financial service group which partly demerged General Cable
in 1992. 'It is just the sort of owner you like to buy from,' said Mr Miller
who described General Cable as 'a corporate orphan'.
The bulk of the consideration covers the purchase for Dollars 169.8m (Pounds
113m), a 30 per cent discount, of a loan note issued by General Cable to its
parent. Wassall is paying an additional Dollars 34.5m for APU's 54 per cent
of the ordinary shares and has made a Dollars 38.1m tender offer for the
remainder which are traded on Nasdaq.
Mr Paul Beaufrere, an analyst at James Capel, said he expected the deal to
be neutral at worst for Wassall's earnings this year and that next year
there should be 'significant enhancement'.
Wassall plans to keep cash on deposit in the UK which should prevent any
problem with unrelieved advance corporation tax.
On a pro forma basis the enlarged group would have had gearing of 18 per
cent at the end of last year. The company estimated this would creep up to
not more than around 30 per cent. The terms of the rights issue are
one-for-four at 250p.
Mr Miller yesterday admitted he had overlooked the possibility that, with
over half its sales coming from cables, Wassall might be reclassified from
the diversified industrials sector.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Boost for Bank of Scotland's purchase plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Scotland yesterday affirmed its interest in buying a building
society to improve its deposit base as it disclosed that it had more than
doubled annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 268.7m, against Pounds 125.3m.
Mr Bruce Pattullo, the governor, said that it was among banks examining the
possibility of buying a society. But it was not involved in discussions at
the moment, and was 'ambivalent' about the benefits of a purchase.
Mr Pattullo said that in contrast to Lloyds' proposed Pounds 1.8bn purchase
of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, the bank believed the main
advantage would be it could strengthen its balance sheet by increasing
deposits.
The bank, which a year ago set a target limit of 5 per cent asset growth for
the year to February 28 in order to maintain its capital ratios, said that
assets had grown by 6 per cent as it expanded its market share of bank
lending.
Operating profits before provisions for bad and doubtful debts rose 19 per
cent to Pounds 580.2m, against Pounds 487.9m. The specific provisions charge
fell 22 per cent to Pounds 283.8m, which Mr Pattullo said was 'less than we
would have liked'. General provisions for anticipated bad debts which have
not been identified were increased by Pounds 30.1m, including a Pounds 20.1m
discretionary charge. Mr Pattullo said that this was for reasons of
prudence, and 'not in order to smooth profits'.
The main upset was at its Bank of Wales subsidiary, which recorded a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 4.8m because of problems at its motor finance arm. Mr
Pattullo said it had found further bad debts after changing provisioning
methods.
Margins rose, helped by a Pounds 500m increase to Pounds 5.4bn in its
mortgage portfolio, and more high margin personal lending. The bank's
liabilities were strengthened by a rise in funds held in customer accounts
for the first time in eight years.
Non-interest income, an area in which the bank has traditionally been
regarded as weak, increased by 18 per cent to Pounds 364.5m. Some Pounds
147m of this came from fees and commissions income from branches, which rose
by 52 per cent.
The tier 1 ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets remained at 5.8 per
cent despite the asset growth, and a 10.5 per cent increase in the dividend
to 5.05p, against 4.57p. This figure includes a proposed final dividend of
3.18p.
Operating costs rose 8 per cent to Pounds 541m, against Pounds 500.3m,
although the ratio of costs to income fell from 50.6 per cent to 48.6 per
cent. Staff numbers have fallen 10 per cent from their 1989 peak through
natural wastage.
Mr Pattullo said that internal generation of capital meant that the bank
would now be able 'comfortably' to finance asset growth of up to 10 per cent
this year. The bank's ordinary shares closed 5p up at 188p.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Barclays directors defended at AGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI and Zeneca, stepped into the breach to
defend the chairman and chief executive of Barclays against attacks from
hostile shareholders at the bank's annual general meeting yesterday.
Sir Denys, a non-executive director of the UK's biggest bank and chairman of
its remuneration committee, praised the performances of Mr Andrew Buxton and
Mr Martin Taylor amid heated criticism of the bank's directors.
Much of the antagonism at the two-and-a-half hour meeting came from members
of a pressure group called the Struggle Against Financial Exploitation
(Safe), founded by unhappy customers of Barclays who bought shares to
attend.
There was strong criticism of the bank for paying Mr David Band, chief
executive of its BZW investment banking arm, Pounds 1.4m last year and for
giving Mr Buxton a basic salary of Pounds 350,000 this year and Mr Taylor a
package worth Pounds 737,500.
'We are talking very large telephone numbers, and I can understand why you
might think they are excessive,' said Sir Denys, who led the group of
non-executive directors who searched for a chief executive last year.
Barclays had had to attract Mr Taylor, who became chief executive in
January. 'Of course he has got to earn it now. We will be looking very
carefully, and I have no doubt that he will fully repay our confidence in
him,' said Sir Denys.
Sir Denys told shareholders that Mr Buxton, who split the roles of chairman
and chief executive after Barclays lost Pounds 242m in 1992 had faced 'a
hell of a battering from people all over the place, and has done it with
courtesy and grace'.
One shareholder compared Barclays with a football team which had reponded to
relegation by recruiting 'a synchronised swimming coach' in the form of Mr
Taylor, a former chairman of Courtaulds Textiles, and Financial Times
journalist.
But Mr Buxton was praised by one shareholder, Mr Granville Whitehead, who
told him he was 'by far the handsomest man on the platform'.
Mr Whitehead said that he had spent the meeting sketching Mr Buxton and the
'ugly ducklings' around him.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Gonzalez pledges to fight on: Ministerial resignations deal
heavy blow to Spanish PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, stated firmly yesterday that
he intended to maintain his hold on government and to tackle the corruption
cases at the source of the country's political crisis.
He said it would be 'an irresponsible act' to resign and rejected a snap
election. He was nevertheless badly wounded when his former finance minister
and political soul-mate, Mr Carlos Solchaga, quit as leader of the ruling
Socialist parliamentary party and resigned his seat in the Cortes.
Mr Solchaga's appointment last year was an important element in Mr
Gonzalez's effort to weaken the grip leftwing Socialists had enjoyed over
the parliamentary party for more than a decade.
His position had been called into question because of his staunch backing,
as finance minister, for Mr Mariano Rubio, the former Bank of Spain governor
who now faces fraud charges.
Mr Gonzalez's statement, broadcast live on television and radio, came after
reassurances from Catalan and Basque region-al parties that they did not
intend to destabilise the minority Socialist government. His appearance
brought relief to nervous securities and foreign exchange markets. The
Madrid general share index rose 1.5 per cent, regaining most of the ground
lost on Wednesday because of the crisis, and the peseta recovered somewhat
after falling sharply against the dollar and D-Mark.
Mr Gonzalez rejected the idea of a wider cabinet reshuffle after the
resignation of his interior and agriculture ministers in connection with
corruption scandals.
Mr Rubio and Mr Manuel de la Concha, a former stock exchange head who
handled his investment portfolio, were remanded in custody without bail at
Madrid's Carabanchel prison yesterday.
A former interior minister, and close Gonzalez ally, Mr Jose Luis Corcuera,
also resigned his parliamentary seat yesterday because of his connection
with Mr Luis Roldan, ex-chief of the paramilitary Guardia Civil, who went
missing last Friday. An international arrest warrant has been issued for Mr
Roldan alleging tax fraud, bribery, misappropriation and other offences.
The latest resignations will not affect the parliamentary balance since the
Spanish system provides for the seats to be filled by the same party.
Mr Gonzalez held talks early yesterday in Madrid with Mr Jordi Pujol, leader
of the Catalan nationalist party on whose support the Socialists rely to
carry a majority in parliament. He assured Mr Pujol the government would
press ahead with a free-market economic programme and combat corruption.
Mr Juan Alberto Belloch, 44-year-old justice minister, was appointed to take
over the interior ministry in a combined portfolio. The new agriculture
minister is Mr Lus Atienza, 36, now undersecretary for energy.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Touche Ross to sue BCCI directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liquidators to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International are
suing the bank's directors for failing in their duties, it emerged
yesterday.
The action is significant because it is the first move against the board
members of BCCI, which was closed by regulators in July 1991 after evidence
emerged of widespread fraud.
It comes on top of litigation to recover funds for creditors brought by the
liquidators against BCCI's auditors, the Bank of England and Sheikh Khalid
bin Mahfouz and National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia.
Partners from Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, issued the writ in the past
few weeks through the Luxembourg courts because this is where the BCCI
holding company is registered.
Those named in the writ include Mr Alfred Hartman, Mr Cliff Twitchen, Mr
Yves Lamarche, Mr J D Van Oenen and Sheikh Khalid, former chief operating
officer of National Commercial Bank.
However, one director, Mr Ghanim Faris Al Mazrui, the representative on the
BCCI board since the early 1980s of the government of Abu Dhabi, the
majority shareholder in the bank, has not been named.
The decision to avoid including his name reflects an attempt by the
liquidators to prevent any difficulties in finalising an agreement with Abu
Dhabi over a payment of Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in exchange for a
waiver of future legal action.
But the liquidators are believed not to discount the possibility of adding
Mr Mazrui's name in the future if the agreement with Abu Dhabi ultimately
founders.
The writ is not a public document, and is couched in general terms alleging
that the directors failed in their duties under Luxembourg company law. It
is not expected to advance quickly to hearings.
In an interview with the Financial Times in February, Mr Mazrui protested
his innocence in spite of his tenure on the BCCI board for 10 years.
Mr Hartman said yesterday: 'If anything happens the directors will defend
themselves. They were not aware of the fraud.'
The other directors could not be contacted for comment.
The liquidators continue to negotiate with the BCCI creditors' committee and
the government of Abu Dhabi over the details of an agreement tentatively
approved in March.
Meanwhile, accountants Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney, now part of
Ernst &amp; Young, filed their defences to a claim for up to Dollars 11bn for
their allegedly faulty auditing of BCCI.

FT  06 MAY 94 / ANC edges towards two-thirds majority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission is expected to release final
results today confirming the overwhelming victory of Mr Nelson Mandela's
African National Congress in last week's all-race poll.
Any further delay in the count could upset the timetable leading to Mr
Mandela's inauguration as president next Tuesday. All party leaders consider
it unthinkable that the event, expected to be attended by more than 40 world
leaders, should be postponed.
The latest official count, based on figures made available last night,
showed the ANC edging further towards a two-thirds majority in the
400-member National Assembly that would give it the power to draft the
country's constitution.
The commission's latest batch of figures, encompassing more than 80 per cent
of the estimated electorate, showed the ANC consolidating its lead with 64.7
per cent of the vote. The National party, led by outgoing president F. W. de
Klerk, was second at 20.6 per cent and the Inkatha Freedom party third on
8.1 per cent.
The assembly is required to draw up a new constitution which will be the
basis of the next election, due by 1999. The constitution's principles,
however, were agreed after multi-party talks last year.
The strong support for the ANC will also reinforce its dominance of the
cabinet, where posts will be allocated according to the parties' electoral
showing.
Mr Mandela has hinted, however, he will offer ministries to the conservative
Freedom Front, the liberal Democratic party and the radical black Pan
Africanist Congress, although none is likely to achieve the minimum 5 per
cent of the vote that cabinet representation requires.
Uncertainty over parliament's composition saw the financial rand, main
barometer of international investor confidence, shed 6 cents in London to
close at R4.79 to the dollar.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Building workers 'cheated' of wages on German sites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of British construction workers lured to German building sites by
the promises of high wages have been left destitute after being cheated by
unscrupulous labour agencies and employers, the UK Building Employers
Confederation said yesterday.
In a single month this year, British consulates in Germany made arrangements
to ship home 150 construction workers in distress, according to the Foreign
Office.
The confederation claims many more workers are still stranded or trying to
make their way home unaided. Consulates will make travel arrangements and
help individuals trace friends and relatives who might pay for fares, but
they do not provide money.
One 19-year-old Londoner was paid the equivalent of Pounds 10 for four weeks
grinding the surface of bricks in a German car park before being dismissed
for allegedly poor work, according to the confederation. Conditions on the
site were very poor.
A big rise in eastern German construction following the unification of the
country has increased demand for cheap labour sucking in thousands of
temporary workers from eastern Europe, Turkey and Britain.
German construction workers, under the country's strict labour laws, are
much more costly than foreign workers, many of whom are uneducated or do not
speak German. They find it difficult to complain about appalling living
standards or dangerous working conditions.
Mrs Elizabeth Bridge, the building confederation's director of taxation
services, said she was alerted to the scale of the problem after UK
construction workers requested information on how to reclaim German tax paid
on wages. They had been duped into accepting lower wages on the false
grounds that British authorities would repay the tax.
Many of the labour agencies advertising for bricklayers, plasterers and
scaffolders in British national newspapers are based in Belgium or the
Netherlands. Job seekers mostly are interviewed in bars or public places.
The agencies cannot operate legally in Germany itself.
A 36-year-old scaffolder who answered an advertisement in the Sun newspaper
was told to make his way to a Frankfurt hotel where he waited for three days
with about 50 other workers. Their potential employer never arrived -
presumably because he did not get the contract - and the scaffolder was left
with a Pounds 400 bill. The agents could not be traced.
Two brothers from Glasgow told how they were expected to live in a hut on
the building site, without sanitation or electricity with nine other
workers. After complaining of the stench, one of the brothers was placed in
bed and breakfast accommodation. After various deductions, including paying
for their accommodation, they received less than Pounds 25 for two weeks'
work.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Receivers sell off Lancer Boss: Deal with Jungheinrich of
Germany secures 700 UK jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of Lancer Boss was finally resolved when administrative receivers
to the last big UK-owned producer of lift trucks yesterday announced they
had sold the business to Germany's Jungheinrich.
The deal, which was welcomed by managers and employees at Boss, ends one of
the most extraordinary receiverships in UK corporate history. It secures the
future of 700 jobs at Boss factories in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire.
Terms were not disclosed, but it is understood Jungheinrich paid about
Pounds 18m, excluding debtors, for the Lancer Boss Group and associated
companies in the UK, Ireland and Austria. The deal follows intense
negotiations involving Grant Thornton, the accountants who were appointed
administrative receivers on April 8, and the three bidders. Jungheinrich,
based in Hamburg, was persuaded to raise its bid 'very significantly',
outbidding Terex of the US and a proposed management buy-in.
Mr Allan Griffiths, a partner at Grant Thornton and one of the
administrative receivers, said the price paid by Jungheinrich was 'at the
very top end of our estimates'. He would not say how much Boss's banks, led
by National Westminster, would receive, but said they were pleased with the
deal.
Lancer Boss called in the receivers after German banks withdrew support from
Steinbock Boss, the UK company's big German unit, prompting it to call in a
German receiver. The case quickly highlighted the difficulties of selling a
group with borrowings and operations in different European countries when
there are no standard European insolvency rules.
Mr Griffiths said yesterday that there would have been more international
interest in Lancer Boss if he had been able to sell the UK and German sides
of the business together. Jungheinrich bought Steinbock Boss from its German
receiver on April 14. Mr Griffiths warned that a split receivership could
occur again, especially with medium-sized UK companies whose European
operations were financed locally, and said he would be sending a report to
the Department of Trade and Industry on the lessons learned from the affair.
Jungheinrich was considered the leading contender for Lancer Boss after its
purchase of Steinbock Boss. Mr Bob Bischof, chairman of Jungheinrich (GB),
defended his company's role in the affair against industry accusations of a
'conspiracy' against Lancer Boss.
He claimed the combined price paid by Jungheinrich for Lancer Boss and
Steinbock Boss was virtually the same as it had offered before the
receivership.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investing in News Corporation has always been an act of faith in Mr Rupert
Murdoch's strategic vision. Yesterday's mildly disappointing third-quarter
figures underline the point. Price cuts in UK newspapers and an unexpected
write-off in US book publishing were the main reasons for the fall in
operating profits from the wholly-owned parts of the empire. Without a
timely gain in feature films - Mrs Doubtfire providing a box-office hit -
only television would have shown progress over last year.
Against that background, News's status as a growth stock looks a little odd.
Even television may suffer next year as Fox Network's investment in American
football rights adds to overheads. The main earnings momentum will probably
continue to come from associated companies, notably BSkyB and Ansett. It is
a credit to News's robust management style that these two have been turned
around. But earnings from partially-owned operations might deserve a lower
rating. A low tax charge - running at 11 per cent so far this financial year
 -also argues for caution in valuing the shares. So long as the main planks
in Mr Murdoch's strategy are secure, these factors are unlikely to unsettle
the market. Investors will reason that a year or two of modest earnings
growth is a price worth paying. If News suffers a set-back in its long term
ambitions, though, shareholders may start to hunger for jam today.

FT  06 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Wassall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wassall's acquisition of General Cable appears classic conglomerate
strategy. As a partially demerged subsidiary of a US financial services
group, General Cable has been neglected by its owners. Capital spending has
been falling for three years to a level well below depreciation. An
operating margin of less than 0.5 per cent last year leaves plenty of room
for improvement. Since Wassall is more than doubling its turnover as a
result of the deal, even modest gains in margin will have a big impact on
profits. The wonder is that another conglomerate or cable industry rival had
not stepped in before.
With 22 US manufacturing sites to work on and a product range covering
10,000 lines, there is scope for rationalisation. That hints at sizeable
fair value provisions. Though with fresh equity under its belt from
yesterday's rights issue, Wassall's balance sheet is unlikely to be
stretched even if goodwill write-offs result. The main worry is whether it
has the management resources to swallow such a large morsel without
indigestion.
On the strength of its record so far, Wassall probably deserves the benefit
of the doubt. Rising US construction orders may make it easier to pass on
higher copper prices to customers, which would provide some breathing space.
With the shares already on a heady multiple in anticipation of a deal,
Wassall has its work cut out to maintain upward momentum. But its first
substantial acquisition since September 1991 seems to justify the market's
considerable faith.

Mr Bruce Pattullo of the Bank of Scotland is one of the few bankers around
who appears to believe that banks should actually lend money. Yet again he
has shown that it is possible to increase profits by doing so. Customer
advances were up 8 per cent last year; operating profits rose 19 per cent
with net interest income up 14. Admittedly, the bank was helped by
favourable conditions in the mortgage market where variable rate margins
came close to 2 per cent and bad debt problems are relatively small. This
year, the act could be harder to repeat.
In general, loan demand remains subdued and, although increased activity in
the housing market suggests a plentiful supply of mortgage business, there
is more competition among lenders. Bank of Scotland still expects to lend
more this year but it may become harder to maintain margins. Those on
mortgage lending will certainly narrow if and when base rates rise again. At
least the bank is less dependent than the English clearers on dealing
profits. A further drop in provisions and non-performing loans should
compensate to some extent for any margin squeeze.
Still, the time seems to have come for Bank of Scotland to concentrate more
on building return. It admitted as much yesterday with its reference to
greater emphasis on productivity and cost control. Despite the impressive
increase in profits, net return on average equity was still only 14 per
cent. And the relatively modest dividend increase is a reminder that banks
which rely on volume for growth have to keep up a flow of retained earnings.

FT  06 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: BP's rich promise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BP has delivered the goods much faster than investors expected. The 19 per
cent increase in its dividend is all the more impressive given that it
relates to a quarter during which crude prices averaged only Dollars 14.
Since BP was able to increase profits and pay down Dollars 600m of debt in
such a tough environment, the board felt it was time to let shareholders
have a slice of the action.
Though chief executive Mr David Simon was anxious to deflate expectations
that 20 per cent annual dividend increases would now be the norm, there is
clearly much more to come. The group is about to kick into the next phase of
its restructuring programme, designed to improve operating performance by
Dollars 1bn a year. Meanwhile, worldwide economic recovery should sharply
enhance BP's earnings from the highly cyclical chemicals and refining
businesses. Within three or four years, the dividend should be back at the
level it was before being halved in the dark days of 1992.
Yesterday's 4 per cent rise in BP's share price, which follows strong
support for the stock in recent months, means the scope for further
out-performance is reduced. But judged against its main international peers,
the possibility for capital gains has not vanished entirely. Measured as a
proportion both of earnings and of gross cash flow, the share price still
looks cheap. Moreover, BP's ability to increase earnings is probably
somewhat greater than that of its rivals, given that it is still coming
slightly from behind. It is only on a yield basis that the shares look
expensive. But, given the new dividend policy, that is less of a concern
than it was.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Leading Article: All hands to the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Markets are bearish on the dollar. Equally, US policy-makers are unwilling
to see the dollar fall further. Both pieces of information are subject to
alteration at any moment. But at least the dollar weakness offers a good
opportunity to push policy faster in the direction it is - and should be -
moving: towards tighter monetary policy in the US and looser policies in
Germany and Japan.
It is not impossible to explain why the dollar has been so weak. The problem
is, as usual, that there are far too many explanations. This is so even
though some explanations can be eliminated quite quickly. Investors are not
moving into the yen because of the strength of the Japanese government or,
for that matter, the vigour of its recovery. The same is true, if to a
lesser degree, for Germany.
Short term interest rate differentials are also not moving in favour of the
yen and D-Mark. On the contrary, interest rate differentials on three month
money have moved consistently in favour of dollar-denominated securities: by
four percentage points vis-a-vis the yen, since the cyclical trough reached
in April 1991, and by six percentage points vis-a-vis the D-Mark since
September 1992. These shifts in relative interest rates have been widely
expected. It is hardly surprising therefore that conventional wisdom
expected the dollar to be strong. Conventional wisdom has been disappointed.
Current accounts
Three explanations for dollar weakness remain: first, that the current
account surplus of Japan and deficit of the US are a permanent, if
intermittent, source of upward pressure on the yen; second, that the dawn of
recovery, however faint, in Japan and continental Europe heralds relatively
high returns on real assets; and, finally, that expectations of inflation,
even though they have deteriorated everywhere, have deteriorated rather more
in the US than in the other major countries.
What is important to note is that the US currency has fallen by 11 per cent
against the yen since the beginning of the year, but also by more than 7 per
cent against the D-Mark just since February. Dollar weakness is a general,
rather than just a bilateral, phenomenon. At the same time, while bond rates
have risen everywhere, they have risen more in US dollars than in yen or
D-Marks. Since last autumn, the differential against 10-year D-Mark bonds
has moved from almost minus one percentage point to plus half a percentage
point and against the yen it has moved, over the same period, from one
percentage point to more than three percentage points.
These shifts imply not only a marked relative worsening in expectations of
US inflation, but also a parallel shift in views about the long term
performance of the US dollar. The currency must be expected to move to
offset changes in relative long term interest rates. Some of that shift has
occurred right now.
US policy
It would be foolish for US policy makers to ignore the pessimism.
Fortunately Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, in justifying recent
intervention, announced that the administration 'sees no advantage in an
undervalued currency'. Unfortunately, the administration does not seem to
recognise that the very same logic applies to the internal purchasing power
of the dollar. What it needs to do is to support the action of the Federal
Reserve in raising short term interest rates and so help preserve the
credibility of US counter-inflationary policy. Indeed, failing such action,
it may be impossible to stabilise the exchange rate.
Yet the unexpected weakness of the dollar has its good side. It has
encouraged senior Bundesbank officials, including the president, Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, to admit that D-Mark strength is unwelcome. With luck, that will
bring forward further needed declines in German short term interest rates.
Equally, without a government, the sole policy-maker able to act in Japan is
its central bank. Here too aggressive monetary loosening, via exchange
market intervention, is justified. It would be helpful if short term
interest rates were lowered too. US dollar weakness may be a surprise. It
may be unwelcome to most policy makers. But at least it should force the US,
Germany and Japan to accelerate the changes they need to make in their
monetary policies.

Tut, tut. Is Sir Tim Bell, Lady Thatcher's favourite spin doctor, about to
reverse his private PR business into a toilet cubicle maker?
Sir Tim was surprisingly silent when Observer contacted him yesterday about
a Daily Mail report that he was planning to use Chartwell, a small Gravesend
company, to get his long-rumoured stock market quote. He has grown his Lowe
Bell business into Britain's second-biggest PR company in double quick time.
The presence of a few trophy names, such as Lord Carrington and Sir Ronald
Grierson, on the letter head of Chime Communications, his parent company,
suggest Sir Tim has public ambitions.
But why Chartwell? Its shares were suspended yesterday, pending shareholder
approval of a 'proposed substantial acquisition'. Luke Johnson, a former
media analyst at Kleinwort Benson and son of writer Paul Johnson, has a
stake in Chartwell and was involved in the successful reverse takeover of
PizzaExpress. Hence, the gossip that Sir Tim is about to make a move.
Given the recovery in the media sector - market leader Shandwick's shares
have recovered from 2 1/2 p to 53p - there might be a window of opportunity
for PR companies to come to market.
But Sir Tim had better be quick.

Still on the subject of tercentenaries, the Bank of Scotland has not yet
made up its mind how it should celebrate its big birthday next year.
It may have been founded by the same man who set up the Bank of England  -
but it doesn't sound as if it will imitate the Bank of England's extravagant
partying, with everything from floats at the Lord Mayor's show to a
specially commissioned musical by Geoffrey Burgon.
Even so, the board of the Bank of Scotland should at least be able to be a
bit more generous than it was at the time of the 250th anniversary in 1945.
Then the staff presented the board with a silver casket which they had to
pay for. Indeed, staff members on active service were written to - the only
communication they received from the bank during the war - and told that
their accounts were automatically being debited to pay for the gesture.

The Royal Mint has made a bit of an ass of itself - and produced a mule.
In addition to the Pounds 2 base metal coins being struck to commemorate the
Bank of England's tercentenary, the Mint decided to produce a limited
edition of one thousand 22 carat gold coins.
About 800 had already been dispatched when one eagle-eyed numismatist
noticed that the design on the front of the coin differed from that in the
marketing literature. It lacked the crucial 'Two pounds' legend under the
Queen's head.
Apparently the die for a double sovereign (confusingly also worth two
pounds, but which has St George and the dragon on the reverse) had been
paired with the (correct) reverse of the special Bank commemorative design.
Ergo, a mule, which is two incorrectly associated dies - and a rare enough
event to get coin collectors pretty excited. The Mint would like the duff
ones back. Sadly, the fact that they are not legal tender is hardly going to
bother the punters, who paid Pounds 295 apiece for their now distinctly more
curious curiosities.

Gendjim the mystery horse finally surfaced in France yesterday, two months
after arriving from the central Asian republic of Turkmenistan, a special
gift to president Francois Mitterrand.
The French media has been whinnying about Gendjim's non-appearance so the
presidential palace gave him a special photo-call at the Parisian barracks
of the Republican Guard. Alexandre Gros, a veteran rider and trainer, said
Gendjim, a light-bay 7-year-old, had arrived tired and emotional and needed
peace and quiet.
He should be getting plenty of that. Mitterrand, 77, does not ride.

At last Nigerian citizens can get cracking with head of state general Sani
Abacha's 'War Against Indiscipline and Corruption'. Due to start in April,
it was postponed but not - as unkind wags suggest - because of trouble
deciding the identity of the enemy in this odd war.
Still, the war should prove highly popular in some quarters of Lagos. It
might persuade the police guarding the federal secretariat to cease doing a
brisk trade in parking spaces. It could ease the city's traffic jams, by
preventing drivers from queueing to buy scarce fuel - supplied by state
monopoly - from illegal roadside hucksters.
It might even reconnect the FT's office telephone. Despite paying the bills
on time, it's been disconnected by clerks at the state-owned telephone
company Nitel. They say an additional cost is necessary in order to

FT  06 MAY 94 / Leading Article: The tunnel visionaries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The question of Britain's institutional links with the rest of Europe may
continue to bedevil its national politics. But from today, the country's
geographic relationship with the continent is definitively settled. With the
opening of the Channel tunnel, it can never again be truthfully claimed that
the UK is not part of Europe. That is a development which deserves to be
celebrated, for both symbolic and practical reasons.
Late, over-budget and beset by financial uncertainties though it is, the
Anglo-French project marks a milestone in co-operation between two countries
accustomed to viewing each other as rivals rather than as natural allies. As
an engineering achievement, it represents a triumph of human perseverance
over arduous physical and technical obstacles. And as a means of transport,
it offers advantages in speed and convenience which promise in time to
reshape trade patterns and transform popular attitudes to international
travel, above all on the British side of the Channel.
Probably the biggest wonder is the fact that the tunnel has been completed
at all. Had it depended on government funding, as originally planned, it
would almost certainly not have been built. The halt called in 1975 by the
Wilson government - which concluded it could not afford both the tunnel and
the Concorde aircraft programme - would have seen to that. The project was
rescued only by the decision a decade later by a radical rightwing UK prime
minister and a socialist French president to resurrect it as a private
sector venture.
Useful example
Private management has not been a trouble-free solution. Eurotunnel's
history has been punctuated by missed deadlines, financial cliffhangers,
public squabbling and successive increases in total cost. Nonetheless,
without the commitment of private capital, notably by the commercial banks,
the pressures to ensure accountability, contain cost over-runs and drive the
project through to completion would almost certainly have been weaker. That
commitment has also been a useful example to some other governments about
the potential of privately owned national infrastructure.
However, it would be disingenuous to view the venture as a pure experiment
in free enterprise, untouched by the hand of government. Much of its
financing has depended on state-owned French banks closely linked to centres
of political power and, at a crucial juncture, on arm-twisting by the Bank
of England. The cost over-runs are due partly to government mandated
specification changes during construction. And the project's viability
hinges on public expenditure on fast rail links, which the UK government at
one stage balked at approving.
Further refinancing
Nor is it certain that private capital would have been as readily available
if its providers had known at the outset what they know now. As the
project's construction budget has steadily mounted, its revenue forecasts
have been repeatedly down-graded, deferring the prospect of returns. As a
consequence, Eurotunnel will soon be obliged to seek further refinancing to
replenish its dwindling cash resources.
Why the banks have remained loyal for as long as they have is a moot
question. Perhaps it is because they genuinely believe that Eurotunnel will
eventually prove a big money spinner - just as the Mont Blanc tunnel did
after it was built three decades ago. Or maybe it is because they concluded
long ago that it would cost them more to cut their losses by calling in
their loans than to stick with the project to the end.
Either way, it is clear that projects as monumental, as innovative and with
as long a lifespan as the Channel tunnel defy the risk and return
calculations conventionally employed by providers of private capital. Their
achievement involves a blind faith and vainglorious ambition exceptional in
business and rarer still in Anglo-Saxon financial markets often accused of
excessive short-termism. How far such faith will reap commercial rewards is
still impossible to say. But the world is a richer place for this piece of
Anglo-French tunnel vision, whose benefits will be counted for generations
to come. Eurotunnel has changed the map of Europe for the better.

FT  06 MAY 94 / High stakes at the launch-pad: The ambitions of the European
space industry will ride on next month's Ariane 4 mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The countdown has started for what will be the most important lift-off in
the 14-year history of Arianespace, the European satellite launch company
that has given Europe leadership in the Dollars 2bn a year commercial space
transport business.
'It would be a catastrophe if we suffered a second consecutive failure,'
says Mr Charles Bigot, the chief executive of Arianespace, bluntly.
Since the failure on January 24 of an Ariane 4 rocket with the Dollars 350m
loss of Turkey's first national satellite, Turksat 1, as well as a European
telecommunications satellite, the European consortium has been working round
the clock to investigate and modify its rocket to ensure that the launch at
the beginning of next month goes off without a hitch.
The stakes are high. Arianespace must restore confidence among its
international customers at a time when competition in the high risk
commercial satellite launch business is intensifying. Apart from its
traditional US rivals, the European group is facing an increasing challenge
from Russia, China and Japan, all seeking to penetrate the western
commercial launch market.
New cut-throat price competition coupled with uncertainties about European
governments' funding of future European space initiatives, risks undermining
the success of the Ariane programme. The project has done for the European
space industry what the Airbus consortium achieved in the civil aircraft
field: the establishment of a credible competitor to the US dominance of
commercial aerospace markets that lasted until the early 1980s.
The achievement has been all the more remarkable because Arianespace, 56.6
per cent controlled by French state and private shareholders but also public
and private shareholders from 11 other European countries, was set up when
rockets, or expendable launch vehicles (ELVs) as they are known, were widely
believed to have become redundant.
The US threw its lot into the development of the space shuttle. But the
Europeans considered a manned shuttle too complex a system on which to build
a reliable space transport business.
The gamble paid off. The disaster that befell the US shuttle Challenger in
1986 and the long interruption in US shuttle flights vindicated the European
decision to concentrate on rocket technology. It also helped Arianespace to
capture more than 50 per cent of the commercial satellite launch market.
'It was not just the choice of sticking with ELVs. But Ariane's success was
also the fruit of a new concept in space launches,' says one French space
industry official. 'The idea was that not only could launchers be produced
and sold like aircraft, but that a comprehensive launch service also had to
be offered to the market,' he adds, explaining that Arianespace now offers
its customers financing facilities, satellite insurance cover and other
services.
Until the latest accident, the reliability of Ariane rocket launches had
also helped build up international market confidence. Since the first
experimental launch in December 1979, there have been 63 launches, of which
six have failed. But since the introduction in 1988 of the bigger Ariane 4
rocket capable of placing more than one satellite into orbit, there have
been only two failures: flight 36, which destroyed two Japanese commercial
satellites, and the recent flight 63.
Flight 36 failed in February 1990 because a cloth was left in the rocket's
cooling system. 'It was a stupid accident,' concedes Mr Bigot, 'but it did
not raise questions on the fundamental soundness of the rocket.' In
contrast, the flight 63 failure was the result of an engine shutdown in the
third stage of the rocket after an oxygen pump bearing overheated. 'We
couldn't simply say it was the fault of a rag or a particle of sand: the
explanation of what happened was far more subtle,' Mr Bigot adds.
A board of inquiry set up after the accident did not establish a 'unique and
proven cause' for the failure. It concluded, however, that the engine
shutdown was probably due to the conjunction of a late pre-cooling of the
liquid oxygen pump bearing and a series of aggravating factors.
Modifications have now been made to ensure that the rocket's third stage
cryogenic engine is less prone to overheating.
The new modified systems have undergone more than 100 tests at facilities in
France and Belgium. Mr Bigot has travelled to the US and Japan to reassure
customers who are also kept up to date with weekly company briefings on the
latest developments in the Ariane rocket corrective programme.
'We now have the situation well in hand,' says Mr Bigot. 'It is most
important for us to show our customers how we are correcting the system.
They would never forgive us if we failed to give top priority to quality and
security.'
Arianespace is also anxious to resume rocket launches as quickly as possible
to meet its existing commitments to place in orbit 39 satellites for a total
revenue of about Dollars 3bn during the next three years. Before the January
accident, the company had planned 10 Ariane 4 launches this year at monthly
intervals. It is still hoping to meet this target by adjusting its
procedures to enable launches every three instead of four weeks from the
beginning of next month.
Although Arianespace has continued to win new satellite launch orders since
the flight 63 failure, the four-month interruption in its timetable has
inevitably had an impact on business, with some potential orders lost to
competitors.
The biggest blow was last month's decision by the European
Telecommunications Organisation Eutelsat, which consists of 39 European
telephone companies, to opt for a US General Dynamics Atlas 2A rocket to
launch a television satellite, Hotbird 2, in August 1996.
The telephone consortium claimed it picked the US rocket because there were
no slots available at that time in Arianespace's packed launch manifest for
its Ariane 4 rocket. But Arianespace had offered to launch the Hotbird
satellite on the first commercial flight of its new Ariane 5 rocket,
scheduled for late summer or early autumn of 1996.
The underlying reason for Eutelsat's decision appears to have been its
reluctance to be first on Arianespace's larger and more powerful rocket,
which will eventually replace the current family of Ariane 4 rockets,
suggests a senior French aerospace official. 'It's clearly a snub for Ariane
to see a European organisation not committing itself to a rocket programme
in which Europe has invested more than Dollars 6bn,' he adds.
Arianespace officials describe the Ariane 5 programme as Europe's biggest
engineering project after the Channel tunnel with substantial
infrastructural investments already completed at Arianespace's launch site
in the jungle of French Guiana.
Ariane 5, a two-stage rocket capable of transporting 6 to 7 tonnes of
satellite payload compared with 4.5 tonnes on the three-stage Ariane 4, has
been designed not only to put heavy satellites into orbit but also to carry
manned spacecraft and parts of a planned space station programme being
studied jointly by the US and European space industries. Space experts also
believe that the two-stage rocket design will provide even greater safety
and reliability because most failures have so far involved the third stage
of the Ariane rockets.
Our ambition is to become during the next 30 years not only a satellite
launch company but also Europe's space transport company providing flight
services to and from space as well as in space itself,' Mr Bigot explains.
But with the cuts in Europe's space budget, the immediate challenge for
Arianespace is to consolidate its position as leader in the commercial
satellite launch market.
To remain competitive, Arianespace must retain at least 50 per cent of the
commercial satellite market. 'We need a large market share to justify the
scale of our investments and maintain competitive operating costs for our
rockets,' Mr Bigot concedes, adding that the operating costs of the new
Ariane 5 rocket will be directly tied to the rocket's annual launch rate.
Achieving this long-term target will depend on the reliability as well as
the cost of the European consortium's satellite launch services, compared
with rivals.
US competitors have become more aggressive following the failure of the
Challenger space shuttle eight years ago and the subsequent decision of the
US government to encourage its three US launcher manufacturers (McDonnell
Douglas, General Dynamics and Martin Marietta) to compete for commercial
business against Ariane.
As for other competitors, Mr Bigot is more worried by the Russians at this
stage than the Chinese who are still trailing western manufacturers. He also
regards the threat from Japan as a longer-term problem.
In four weeks, the future of Arianespace and the ambitions of the European
space industry will ride on the 64th mission of the Ariane 4 rocket carrying
an Intelsat telecommunications satellite and two small space technology
research vehicles for the British Ministry of Defence.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Space war over eastern sky: Jenny Luesby on the threat from
rival satellite launchers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The emergence of Russia, China and Japan as rivals to Europe and the US
threatens a glut of satellite launch facilities at a time of falling demand.
With fewer than 20 commercial launch opportunities a year, Europe's
Arianespace needs a substantial market share to make its launch facility and
rocket development programme viable.
But the going is getting tough for the Europeans and the US. Russia's first
commercial launch contract from the west, to launch a satellite for
Inmarsat, the international maritime co-operative, was priced at Dollars
36m, 30 to 50 per cent less than an equivalent Ariane launch.
The competitive price reflects more than Russia's desire to earn foreign
exchange. Its Proton satellite launcher is cheaper than those of its western
rivals largely because it puts the satellite into final orbit, rather than
requiring boosters on the satellite to fuel the last leg of the journey.
Besides saving fuel, this almost doubles the life of the satellite, to 12
years.
Since the Inmarsat deal, the US and Russia have agreed on a quota of eight
Russian launches of US-made satellites by 2000, in return for the US
granting, for the first time, export licences to American satellite
manufacturers. Russia has also agreed to refer to the US for approval any
Proton bid that undercuts the lowest western offer by more than 7.5 per
cent.
However, the agreement has done little to slow sales of Proton launches,
which boast a record of reliability comparable to the market-leading Ariane.
A recent joint venture between the US aerospace group Lockheed, Khrunichev,
the maker of Proton, and the Russian research group, Energia, announced that
since the Inmarsat deal, it has won orders for Proton worth Dollars 600m.
The US telecoms group Motorola has booked Proton for the launch of 21 of its
satellites for the Iridium communications network. Khrunichev says these
orders do not exceed the quota agreed with the US; the Iridium launches will
be to low-earth orbit, the quotas only cover launches into the higher
geostationary orbit.
But western competitors doubt whether Russia will adhere to the quotas,
pointing to the failure of a similar deal between the US and China to
prevent undercutting; China consistently offers deals at a discount of about
30 per cent to comparable European prices.
But China's price competitiveness has been undermined by the dubious safety
record of its Long March launchers. A planned launch for Australia was
aborted in March 1992, while last month the destruction of China's first
advanced weather satellite on its final pre-flight testing further
undermined China's ambitions.
The accident has set back China's planned launch of six satellites this
year. But with the US deal on Chinese foreign launches due to expire in
December and several foreign satellites already booked for Chinese launches
over the next decade, China's space ambitions are far from dead.
Meanwhile, Japan's space effort finally achieved the maiden flight of its
H-II launcher in February, some two years behind schedule. The H-II's main
engine, the LE7, is fuelled with liquid hydrogen. Although the LE7 has been
beset with technical problems, it has greater potential for higher
performance than the more traditional closed combustion engine. However,
with launches restricted to just two a year, for environmental reasons, and
no commercial customers yet signed up, Japan is unlikely to make an impact
on the commercial satellite launching market for some time.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Snooker for the voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The phantom race for Mr John Major's job is sheer entertainment. Consider
the friskiest three runners. Mr Michael Portillo, the loyal chief secretary
to the Treasury, has made it plain that he wants to be prime minister when
he grows up. We should be safe until the next century.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the loyal president of the board of trade, studiously
avoids opportunities to deny that if asked he would move into No 10 Downing
Street. The request had better come soon if he is to get his chance while he
is young enough to enjoy it. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the loyal chancellor,
delivered the Mais lecture on Wednesday. The what? Never mind. It came
across as an advertisement for the candidacy of Clarke, K, willing and able,
ready to start tomorrow morning. The talk had the flavour of those 'why I
think I would be good at this' affirmations commonly found at the tail-end
of job applications. It lacked only '. . . and I know it would be an
exciting opportunity . . .'
These three pretenders differ from one another in age, ideology, experience,
subtlety and skill. Fortunately we are spared the task of sifting them out.
When it comes to the essential qualification they are equally deficient.
None of them has the stature, the magic, necessary to restore life to the
Conservative coalition, beyond the fleeting moments that would follow
victory. None is so magnificent that he can be trusted to lead the
unleadable. Mr Portillo, whose support in the parliamentary party is
concentrated within the Europhobic/xenophobic faction, is an unlikely
unifier. Mr Heseltine, still unforgiven by some for the downfall of Lady
Thatcher, could not both pacify Mr Portillo's platoon and remain true to his
previously stated convictions. Mr Clarke, whose Mais lecture is the single
visible piece of serious work he has produced since last November's Budget,
is a known Europhile and self-confessed spender on welfare.
If the Conservatives had a majority of 100-plus, as Lady Thatcher did, any
one of the three could play the game her way. First win the leadership,
then, in reshuffle after reshuffle, steadily cull the cabinet of opponents.
Those were the days. They are long gone. This year such surgery might
destroy the Tories, not unify them. A prime minister with a majority of 17
and falling must weigh every decision with extreme care. This makes steady,
efficient ad-ministration of the country's affairs extreme-ly difficult.
Sackings that did not preserve the balance in the party might render the
task impossible.
In short, it could be that whatever the results of yesterday's local
election, the prime minister is safer than conventional wisdom suggests. He
could even survive heavy defeats in next month's elections to the European
parliament. Who knows? Who cares? Whether Mr Major stays or goes has become
one of the terminally boring questions of British politics. The prime
minister might hold on, or he might not. Either way, the Conservatives are
saddled with the same problem. They must find a way of settling their
differences, particularly over Europe. If they do not, they will be
unwelcome under any leader - even the loyal Mr Douglas Hurd, who is not
actively campaigning for the post.
There is a second proposition that should give potential Tory assassins
pause for thought. If they do force Mr Major out, his successor will be
under strong moral pressure to call an immediate general election. This is
the position taken, both in public and in private, by Mr John Smith. The
leader of the Labour party does not imagine that there would be a fresh
contest, a re-run of April 1992 which he would win. He merely regards the
prospect of taunting a hypothetical new opponent as too good an opportunity
to be missed. He is right. A second defenestration of a Conservative leader
within less than four years would leave the electorate bemused. The Tories'
reputation as the natural party of government would be sunk. The legitimacy
of the new prime minister would be questioned from the start. The new
cabinet would be born destabilised. Labour could pile on the misery. Mr
Smith beams when he pictures the scene.
His motives may not be particularly high-minded, but he does have a point. A
new prime minister appointed by disgruntled Conservatives because they could
not unite under the old one should seek a fresh mandate for his or her
party. This is not a matter of law. It is more important than that. It is
what would feel right. There are plenty of precedents for a change of prime
minister within the lifetime of an elected parliament. The voters were not
immediately consulted when the then Mr Harold Wilson made way for the then
Mr Jim Callaghan. Against that the British constitution is unwritten. It is
famously plastic. It is only a slight exaggeration to say that it is
whatever the principal political players choose to make of it at any given
time. Their choice is heavily influenced by public opinion.
In the circumstances here envisaged, it would be proper to ask the
electorate to endorse the change of prime minister, or choose another. A
leadership contest this autumn would, if Mr Major's court is to be believed,
be hard-fought. The incumbent would not go easily. The proceedings would
necessarily be nasty. The purpose would be self-preservation - the
maintenance in office of a deeply unpopular government. Tory MPs with
marginal seats would be fighting to save their parliamentary careers. The
national interest would not be considered.
This is not to say that we would be better off with Mr Smith. The time to
decide about that will come when - if - the Labour leader enlightens us
about Labour's proposed policies. Indeed, if he does not he might get a rude
shock. He might force Mr Major's successor to call an early election, and
then fall out of history as Labour loses. Unlikely? Try this: Mr Heseltine
becomes prime minister in November. He makes the happy discovery that the
budget deficit is likely to be lower than previous projections indicated. A
strong-looking cabinet, a quick tax cut, a promise of a referendum before
joining any European single currency, a brilliant early spring campaign, and
Labour could once again be snookered. The Tories would then resume their
internal battles, having won themselves a breathing-space. Only the country
would lose.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Euro straitjacket created on works
councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ZYGMUNT TYSZKIEWICZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Bert Thierron reassures us (Letters, April 29) that works councils
will neither cost very much nor delay management decisions. However, the 18
agreements he cites were freely concluded and are therefore tailor-made to
suit each company's individual needs, thus minimising costs and red tape.
The Commission's lastest draft would force all companies into a rigid,
bureaucratic straitjacket which ignores the infinite diversity of company
situations. The apparent freedom it gives to negotiate any formula for
information and consultation is an illusion; in the event of failure to
agree, the minimum conditions in the annexe to the directive are mandatory.
The annexe offers no choice. It imposes creation of a central European
Committee with attendant rigidities and bureaucracy.
Urged on by trade unions, workers will take the annexe as a starting point
for negotiations, not because it improves information and consultation; on
the contrary, it will seriously interfere with many successful existing
company information systems. Unions will insist on the centralised European
Committee as a major step towards realising their ambition for pan-European
union structures and collective bargaining. This unvoiced ambition has
driven this project for 24 years, but cannot be the stated aim of a
Commission Directive, since the right of association is expressly excluded
from the scope of EU competence by Article 2.6 of the 'Social Chapter'.
The Commission's White Paper rightly blames the rigidity of Europe's labour
markets for our failure to create jobs. Yet its draft directive on
information and consultation will only add to these rigidities, unless the
the annexe is modified so that companies and their workers have freedom to
devise the formula best suited to their individual needs. No single formula
decreed by Brussels can possibly be right for all companies, in all four
corners of Europe. The Treaty says a directive 'shall be binding as to the
results to be achieved . . . but shall leave to the national authorities the
choice of form and methods'. The present directive fails to respect this
requirement.
It is not too late for the Council of Ministers to build the required
flexibility into this directive, and especially its annexe, thus sending
positive signals to those who would invest in Europe, while fully satisfying
workers' needs for guaranteed information and consultation.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Crest will leave the private investor
with crumbs only
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J D LITTLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Kevin Goldstein-Jackson ('Diary of a private investor: Unanswered
questions', April 30) details further problems with the proposed Crest share
settlement system as far as the private investor is concerned. In this
regard it is interesting to note that, buried in appendix III of the task
force report is the fact that 67 per cent of bargains by volume are done by
or for individuals accounting for 14 per cent by value. The private investor
makes a considerable contribution to the functioning of the market.
I can answer his question on what weight is given to views submitted to the
Bank or Treasury - none. After corresponding with both august bodies over a
period of four months it was the task force report which finally indicated
why my representations were getting nowhere; Mr Iain Saville, who heads the
Crest project at the Bank, was sticking strictly to the recommendations in
the report and nothing was going to make him deviate from it.
A long-shot letter I sent to Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair
trading, produced a reply on his bahalf which reiterated so many of the
views expressed by the Bank that we are unlikely to get any redress from the
Office of Fair Trading.
I am afraid the private investor is going to have to accept the crumbs
dropped from the table of the fat cats. The problem arises because Crest has
been designed by and for the convenience of institutions; any so-called
concessions to the private investor are a sop to divert criticism until
Crest is introduced, when it will be too late to make any changes.

Sir, I am a bit confused. Former US President George Bush has suggested to
current President Bill Clinton that the US discontinue its efforts to return
President Aristide to power in Haiti because he lacks sufficient support
there ('Clinton toughens stance against Haitian junta', May 4). He also
feels that it would be a mistake to intervene militarily because 'no US
lives are at risk in Haiti today'. Since when has US policy in central/South
America aligned itself with the wishes of the local population? And when did
'US lives' and not 'US interests' become the driving force in policy
decisions?

FT  06 MAY 94 / Going up with smoke: Tony Jackson asks why tobacco is back
in favour at BAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the shareholders of BAT Industries queue up for their free cigarettes at
their annual meeting in London today, they might care to reflect on a
curious shift in their company's strategy. BAT is a kind of corporate Jekyll
and Hyde: on the one hand, an Anglo-American insurance giant, on the other
the free world's second biggest purveyor of the killer weed, tobacco. For
years, Jekyll has been in the ascendant: but as last week's Dollars 1bn
purchase of American Tobacco suggests, Mr Hyde is not finished yet.
The story of his revival is that of world tobacco as a whole. A decade ago,
only a third of the world cigarette market was open to BAT. The rest was
accounted for either by China - now a third of the world market on its own -
or by state monopolies in countries such as Russia, Japan, France and Italy.
Denied room to expand, BAT started to pour its surplus cash into financial
services, beginning with the near-Pounds 1bn purchase of Eagle Star
Insurance at the end of 1983. But in the mid-1980s, the Japanese market
started to open up, followed by Thailand and Taiwan. The Chinese market
became slightly less hostile. Then came the crucial event: the fall of the
Berlin wall, which opened up the whole of eastern Europe.
Thus, says Mr Martin Broughton, BAT's chief executive, in the past decade
the available market has tripled, most of it happening in the last five
years. 'When we first moved into financial services,' he says, 'it was all
in the context of seeing tobacco as a cash generator in long-term decline.
We never saw it declining as fast as outside pundits, but we were looking to
financial services for growth. Now we have two growth businesses.'
The American Tobacco purchase scarcely fits the growth scenario, since the
US market, by Broughton's reckoning, has fallen by a steady 2 to 3 per cent
a year for many years. More than anything else, the deal amounts to buying
cash flow on the cheap. Even so, it is hard to believe that BAT would have
contemplated it had its thinking on tobacco not undergone a sea-change in
the past few years.
The logic for the deal is simple enough. The two giants of US tobacco,
Philip Morris and R J R Nabisco, could not have bought American on
anti-trust grounds: and given the anti-smoking climate in the US, anyone not
already in the market would be crazy to get involved. As the number three US
producer, BAT thus found itself in a buyer's market.
According to Broughton's sums, he would still break even on the deal if
consumption fell by 7 per cent a year from now on. This, he argues, is
unlikely on a sustained basis. Even if it did happen, he says, the deal
would buy him time. A combined business selling 80bn cigarettes a year in
the US takes longer to become non-viable than one selling 50bn, as BAT does
at present.
Then again, if a 7 per cent fall sounds unthinkable, it is worth considering
the case of Brazil. In its first quarter statement this week, BAT said its
Brazilian cigarette volume had fallen by 17 per cent year on year, leading
to a loss of several million pounds. Since this is partly due to such exotic
factors as hyperinflation and cross-border smuggling from Paraguay, the
comparison is not exact. But it is sobering to reflect that in Brazil, BAT
still sells twice as many cigarettes a year - 100bn - as it does in the US.
On a wider front, the Brazilian experience suggests that the brave new world
of tobacco may have its awkward aspects. BAT's market share in Brazil is 80
per cent. In Chile it is 97 per cent. In fact, more than half of BAT's
cigarette sales worldwide are in the 30 or so countries in which it has more
than half the market: countries in which, historically, BAT had the official
monopoly. Its big competitors such as Philip Morris have no such cosy
tradition. As world markets open up, BAT has plenty to lose as well as to
gain.
Looking further ahead, some of the big old state monopolies have yet to flex
their muscles on the world stage. Japan Tobacco, the former Japanese
monopoly company which still holds over 80 per cent of its home market, is
starting to make headway internationally. But the really terrifying prospect
is that one day its Chinese counterpart, the Chinese National Tobacco
Corporation (CNTC), might do the same.
At present, Broughton argues, the phenomenal growth of the Chinese market
must keep CNTC's hands full. 'They're growing at a rate of 50bn cigarettes a
year,' he says. 'That's a pretty damned big factory (each year).' But the
potential of a company whose cigarette output is roughly equal to that of
Philip Morris, BAT, R J R Nabisco and Rothmans combined is slightly
unnerving. 'We've developed good relationships with them over the years,'
Broughton says cautiously. 'But we certainly wouldn't suggest we know what
they're going to do.'
Meanwhile, the battle for the brave new markets continues, particularly
against BAT's old adversary Philip Morris. The two make an interesting
match. Philip Morris has 12 per cent of the world market, BAT 10.5 per cent.
Philip Morris is much bigger in the US, BAT rather bigger in the rest of the
world. BAT has a range of weapons, from its vast experience of international
markets to its panoply of local brands. Philip Morris has a single weapon,
but a very formidable one: Marlboro, one of the strongest brand names in the
world.
'Philip Morris is the most aggressive competitor we have,' Broughton says.
'They're very active in eastern and central Europe. They appear to use
different financial criteria from ours. We've had three cases recently where
we've been competing head to head to buy a factory (in eastern Europe). Even
in the third one, where we pushed our numbers up a bit, they put in a
package three times as high as ours. Either they're right or we are. We
don't know yet.'
In any case, the main point is that in tobacco, BAT now has plenty to do.
According to Broughton, the outside world was always wrong to see BAT as
wanting to get out of tobacco. 'The cash was available in greater quantities
than could be invested in tobacco, since the opportunities weren't there,'
he says. 'Now we have a number of alternative strategies open to us, each of
which is viable and sound in its own right. We may not be able to do it all
at once, but having competing opportunities is a position I like.'
In other words, BAT's ambitions to buy a European insurance company or a UK
building society may or may not come to immediate fruition. At the same
time, BAT may or may not buy into the French tobacco monopoly when it is
privatised, or grab other such opportunities as they turn up. Hyde and
Jekyll, it seems, will have to coexist in the same corporate body for quite
a while yet.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Directors must be responsible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY GAMBLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Ian Brindle's concerns (Letters, May 3) about the unlimited
liabilities of auditors would be reduced if the appropriate prosecuting
bodies took a tougher approach on directors' liabilities.
For many employees 'becoming a director' has no more implications than, say,
getting a better company car. For the retired businessman 'taking on a few
non-executive directorships' is often thought of as a bit of handy fee
income in exchange for attending the occasional board meeting.
Most such directors have no knowledge of their duties contained in the
Companies Act. They may not even realise that they have personal liability
for unpaid company Paye/National Insurance, or to unpaid creditors if the
company fails having traded knowingly insolvently. I believe that is because
the authorities either turn a blind eye, or are too busy to take proceedings
against directors. Most of us have dealt with companies where the dominant
director(s) has traded into insolvency and then reappeared, phoenix-like,
often in the same area of business. Why, we all ask, are these people
allowed to get away with it?
It may be argued that often many (junior) directors are not privy to the
information that enables them to know whether the company is trading within
the law. On the other hand 'ignorance' is not treated as a defence in other
legal matters.
A tougher line on those who are elected as 'stewards' of the company would
encourage them to be more realistic about their own policing, or be more
appreciative as to what they are asking their auditors to do.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Always time to deal with the trivia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRYN GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Adrian Furnham ('On the road to procrastination', May 4th) ought to
reread his Northcote Parkinson. True, the professor observes that the time
spent on any item is inversely proportional to the sum of money involved,
but that does not mean that committees handle trivial matters promptly;
quite the reverse in fact.
Parkinson gives the example of the company finance committee members with
feelings of guilty unease that they have just nodded through a multi-million
pound redevelopment plan on the strength of a consultant's report which most
of them did not really understand. A scheme to replace the cycle shed for a
couple of hundred pounds was much easier to grasp, and they settled to a
long debate on sizes, materials and numbers of bicycles; each eager to be
seen to be making his or her contribution to the process.
Three hours later, having shaved Pounds 23.46p off the original estimate,
they retired exhausted to the executive dining room, reflecting contentedly
on a good morning's worth of top-level decisions, and on the debilitating
responsibilities of high office.
These were not decision avoiders, about whom Furnham is writing; these were
keen decision takers, restrained only by their own inadequacies.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Arts: Banks head new spending - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the major players in the extraordinary growth of arts sponsorship
over the past decade retired last week: Geoff Shingles, who proved that
sponsoring the arts could be good for business when, as chief executive of
Digital, he persuaded his board in 1985 to rescue Sadler's Wells with a
Pounds 150,000 investment.
Shingles then put together Partners in Dance: dance was under-sponsored at
the time and Digital could make a big impact with relatively little money.
In the last nine years Digital has pumped Pounds 5.5m into the arts and
reckons it has proved an excellent investment, enabling the company to
entertain its 5,000 key customers, and more importantly, potential
customers.
Shingles later backed the National Theatre and the Tate and has given
computer systems to leadings arts companies, but in recent months Digital
has been forced to cut its spending from Pounds 500,000 a year to nearer
Pounds 350,000 and The Digital Dance Awards were axed. But in the autumn
Digital will review its position and, if profits are up, will probably raise
its budget.
* * *
Profits have already improved for many companies, especially banks, which
means that the 13 per cent fall in sponsorship last year could be quickly
reversed.
A few years ago NatWest was spending Pounds 1m a year; in 1993 it invested
just Pounds 100,000, which basically went towards a prize aimed at art
school students. But this year NatWest is spending Pounds 350,000, and all
the signs are that in 1995 its budget will have grown again.
The likelihood is that NatWest will choose to stick with the visual arts.
Next week the bank announces the winner of its 1994 Art Prize. The winner
receives Pounds 5,000 but NatWest also buys some of the short listed entries
to add to its collection of contemporary art.
Apart from the patronage (and investment) benefits from bolstering the
visual arts it is a sponsorship area which suddenly looks sadly neglected.
Two of the biggest sponsorships, the Barclay's Prize for graduates and BT's
touring exhibition, New Contemporaries, are coming to an end.
* * *
In the next few months 50 or so managers of small businesses in Birmingham,
Bristol and Cardiff will be invited to see a Welsh National Opera
production. Putting them on the guest list will be KPMG, the management
consultancy group, which is masterminding a networking service.
The idea is that the businessmen will so enjoy themselves that they will
form a local syndicate to provide funds, Pounds 1,000 each, or even less, to
help finance the next WNO visit to their city, and in particular its
community work there.
This grass roots form of sponsorship is one of many initiatives anticipated
from 'Go Opera', the new sponsorship package from KPMG. It is committing
Pounds 550,000 over three years, distributed between WNO, Scottish Opera,
Opera North and English National Opera. The money will back core activities,
like new productions, starting with WNO's first ever Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, The
Yeoman of the Guard, this Christmas, and followed by Britten's A Midsummer
Night's Dream at the ENO in 1995. But it will also attempt to widen access
to opera.
At the WNO this will consist of creating community operas, workshops, and
subsidised tickets; at Opera North cut price tickets for first time opera
goers, workshops, discounts for regular attenders, and a new production;
family tickets at Scottish Opera, plus a production; and help for the
outreach Baylis programme through family days at ENO.
* * *
West Merchant, London based subsidiary of two German banks, is the latest
financial institution to use the arts to drum up business. It is investing
Pounds 100,000 a year to promote the arts of Latin America in the UK.
West Merchant specialises in offering potential investors advice on Latin
America and is also keen to work for rich South Americans living in Europe.
Its first project is this month's Festival of Bahia in London. It has
contributed Pounds 33,300 and as a first time sponsor has received a
substantial Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme back up award from the
government.
The final concert, at the Albert Hall on June 1, features four top Bahian
singers and a samba band, and will be used to entertain clients who earlier
attended a business seminar. Without the concert it is doubtful there would
have been such a healthy response. In the autumn West Merchant promotes
contemporary Argentinian art at the MoMA, Oxford.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Arts: Peer's inner quest - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The RSC is now giving John Barton's production of Peer Gynt, in Stratford's
intimate Swan Theatre, only two months after it co-presented Yukio
Ninagawa's touring production in the great big Barbican auditorium.
Ninagawa's involved a vast metal box set, painted two-dimensional scenery,
and film projections; Barton's has no real scenery at all, just props. Each
catches different facets of Ibsen's vision. Watching Barton's (which he
first created for Oslo's National Theatre), I sometimes missed the colour,
energy, and epic sprawl of Ninagawa's version, and its tremendous central
performance by young Michael Sheen. But Ninagawa kept gilding Ibsen's onion
with fancy layers of his own, whereas Barton simply peels it and reveals its
layers to us.
A certain amount of editorial rearrangement is involved. Barton (adapting C
Fry's version, with lyrics by Adrian Mitchell) has homed in on the beautiful
choral lines near the end ('We are thoughts. You should have thought us
 .'), and he adds a prologue of Peer's birth (chorus: 'We are the thoughts
you must think . . .'), and an epilogue (Peer: 'I am the thoughts I made
myself shun . . .'). The emphasis is all on Peer's inner quest, and some
peripheral characters are wholly or partly cut. The Nordic farmfolk are here
Irish (as in Ninagawa's); and some of the minor trolls are Scots.
Ibsen's large dramatis personae are enacted by just 11 actors (plus four
musicians). The most important stroke lies in casting the same actress - the
fine Haydn Gwynne - as both Peer's mother Aase and as his wife Solveig.
Though Gwynne distinguishes between the wary old Aase and the trusting young
Solveig, she reveals how like they are in their love for Peer; how Aase's
mother-love is in fact the preparation for Solveig's wife-love. Ibsen was
often ahead of Freud.
The casting of Alfred Burke as both Solveig's father and the Button-Moulder
pays equal dividends. The two roles, often unalike, here find many
connections, especially since Barton has also found a heretofore unstaged
scene in Ibsen's manuscript for Solveig, her father, and Peer.
A role like Peer is just what the marvellously assured and amiable Alex
Jennings needed to lever himself out of the rut of harshly debonair young
toffs he keeps playing. Alas, he falls right back into it in Act Four, where
he hardly hints at the young peasant beneath the sophisticated veneer Peer
dons as Sir Peer, then Emperor of Bedlam. Yet in the first three acts he is
splendid at Peer's blarney; his voice is softer here, and his face, with its
little Petrushka nose and its gaping mouth, looks like a pumpkin.
Jennings's authority is never in doubt, and he makes it increasingly clear
that the play is his spiritual journey. There are, admittedly, several more
layers of the onion for him to reveal. In Act Five he ages less than any
Peer I have ever seen, and yet does little to hint at the peasant he was
once; he even drops almost any hint of the Irish accent he mastered so well
for the youthful scenes. Nor does he always persuade us that young Peer
believes in all his own play-acting and story-telling. But this is the most
tender and the most imaginative performance Jennings has given us.
The centre of the play is clearly its poetic visions. Peer's restless
journeying reminds you of many others. It brings to mind not only umpteen
folk tales, but also the quests of Hamlet, Faust, Candide; as well as the
Rake's progress. And I had never realised before how Peer's castles in the
air pave the way for Ibsen's later Master Builder. Peer Gynt, even when cut,
is too vast for perfect comfort; I always become restless myself during Act
Four. But what makes Barton's account of Peer Gynt so refreshing is its
economy. Simple magic is achieved through little showers of snow, sand,
soap-bubbles, or stardust. Peer may journey through the whole world, and yet
it is as if he is just a boy losing himself in a toy theatre. And it is at
home that he must find himself.

<TEXT>
Nicholas Payne, director of the Royal Opera, has put together an intriguing
1994-95 season at Covent Garden. Richard Eyre, of the National Theatre,
directs his first opera, La traviata; Jonathan Miller returns to work in the
UK with his first Covent Garden production, Cosi fan tutte; while Gilbert &amp;
Sullivan also make their House debut in the new WNO production of The Yeomen
of the Guard.
There is also the first new British Ring of the 1990s, starting on October
13 with Das Rheingold, with Richard Jones handling the staging; the first
Covent Garden production since 1930 of Gounod's Romeo et Juliette; and the
first ever performance at Covent Garden of Purcell's King Arthur.
Throw in a Verdi season in the summer of 1995, with seven productions, (two
in concert performance) and including the first Garden playing of I due
Foscari, and you have an exciting programme. AT

FT  06 MAY 94 / Arts: Tunnel vision - Marina Benjamin looks at a
photographic record of Britain's last days as an island
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARINA BENJAMIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Queen and President Mitterrand officially open the Channel Tunnel
today, the ceremony will also mark the culmination of an ambitious
photographic project recording the end of Britain's days as an island.
The Cross Channel Photographic Mission, sponsored by South East Arts, is a
rich, diverse, and bittersweet essay on Britishness drawn from the sum of
its parts, its history, street-culture, landscapes, traditions, and
self-delusions. Work by a dozen photographers provides a portrait of a
nation in limbo, immobilised between the legacy of a heavily mythologised
but fast-fading imperial identity, and faced with the necessity of adapting
to a new order.
Hew Davies takes as his subject the British neo-colonists who have forsaken
Albion for the greener pastures of Nord Pas de Calais - re-christened 'south
Kent'. Davies presents them not as Utopian dreamers chasing a Rousseauesque
back-to-nature ideal, but as hard-nosed London yuppies and misfits, who,
having conquered the home counties territories, see France as the new
frontier. Amidst anglicised pubs, houses and gardens, the emigrants have set
up a home from home.
The Royal Festival Hall is showing three Cross Channel commissions under the
sub-heading Britannia. Karen Knorr's allegorical Europhiliac tableaux,
featuring androgynous figures in wigs and frock-coats, draw inspiration from
the Enlightenment. This was an age of cultural exchange, of curiosity and
exploration, a time when no gentleman's education was complete without a
European Grand Tour and when Samuel Johnson pronounced patriotism to be the
last refuge of the scoundrel. Driving the point home, Knorr has titled her
images in English and French.
Such bonhomie, however, was the privilege of a small band of channel-hopping
intellectuals, who ignored the old enmities between the nations and prized
liberty, equality and fraternity before these ideals were used to justify
the guillotine.
Leaving the tricky issue of Anglo-French relations aside, Peter Kennard and
Paul Trevor choose to focus instead on London. Kennard's wittily-titled and
hard-hitting installation, 'Welcome to Britain' depicts the bleak side of
the metropolis encountered at Waterloo, our cross-Channel starting point.
Working in collaboration with the poet Peter Reading, Kennard has
constructed an edifice of our time from gaudy souvenirs and scavenged urban
flotsam, including wooden pallets and scraps of corrugated card - the bricks
and mortar of the homeless. Photographic images of forlorn faces, hands and
street-signs can be discerned through its dust coating. The hands are
particularly evocative: such eloquent symbols of authorship and manufacture,
they are here transformed into the scratching, grasping means of escape.
What Kennard has effectively conjured up is the fright at the end of the
Tunnel.
Paul Trevor's equally gritty work tells a tale of two cities in one. Taking
in the square mile occupied by the capital's money market and the street
market at Brick Lane, he plays with the notion of neighbours remaining
worlds apart. Top cats and underdogs. By getting right up close yet
remaining unobserved, Trevor has photographed the passing faces of passing
trade. In the City, there are clear complexions, confident jawlines, mobile
phones, cigars, pin-strips, handshakes and designer sunglasses; in Brick
Lane there are wrinkles, pimples and tattoos, second-hand clothes, cheap
make-up, fag-ends and NHS specs. Life - delivered to us in its minutiae - is
very different at the two poles of our market economy. And so, by
implication, is the inner landscape of the mind.
Where symbols of Empire are depicted at all, they are represented as
obsolete relics, part of the furniture of nostalgia. Nonetheless many of the
photographers seem prone to a spirit of regret, dwelling on what we stand to
lose rather than what we might hope to gain: the 'dustman of Europe' looms
large while any vision of a potential nouveau Britain is sadly absent.
Karen Knorr, Paul Trevor and Peter Kennard at The Royal Festival Hall, until
June 5, July 3 and from June 11 to July 10 respectively.

This is the day the Channel tunnel is opened. Sorry, 'inaugurated' is
perhaps the safer word. BBC1 follows the Queen to France and back from
11.30am onwards. Her Majesty actually goes on a train, unlike the public who
will have to wait.
Julia Ford features in the first of A Skirt Through History (BBC2, 9.30pm),
a series which views the past through the lives of women. Queen Victoria
could not conceive of a sexual relationship between women so lesbianism
never suffered the legal restraints of male homosexuality. A rare insight
into the life of a 19th century lesbian surfaced in the 1980s when the
diaries of Anne Lister, a Halifax gentlewoman, were deciphered. They reveal
an active sex life, invariably thwarted by the wish for a conventional
marriage by most of her lovers.
Conjugal Rites returns for a second series (ITV, 8.30pm). This is a typical
modern sitcom, dealing with the mid-life crisis of an 'ordinary' couple,
played by Michael Williams and Gwen Taylor. All the usual contemporary
issues are aired, with the idea that the audience can identify with the
protagonists.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Arts: Love's Labour's Lost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a director Ian Judge is good with lost boys. I remember a haunting Peter
Pan at the Shaw Festival in Canada, where the twilit gleam of Kensington
loomed dream-like through the excitement of Never Land, and the everyday
reality of the nursery was glimpsed in forest and pirate lair.
His updated Love's Labour's Lost for the RSC, first seen at Stratford in
October, has arrived at the Barbican and, placing the action in another
Never Never Land, hints that these golden lads too belong to a doomed
generation.
The setting is late Edwardian Oxbridge. Distant spires dream; in a
neighbouring quad Lord Fancourt Babberley is almost certainly impersonating
his chum Charley's aunt from Brazil. More immediately the King of Navarre
and his earnest fellow-students (as it were a Rupert Brooke reading party)
make their rash vow to forswear such mundane pleasures as female company.
The breaking of that vow and the blossoming of love are depicted gravely, in
a production that takes the play more seriously than usual. If the dramatic
pulse seems initially sluggish, the idyllic mood is cumulative, and Judge
brilliantly makes sense of that awkward conclusion when the happy ending is
postponed after death has suddenly cast its shadow over the high spirits.
John Gunter's sets give us high-backed pub settles festooned with victorious
oars and college photographs. The page-boy Moth (Christopher Luscombe) is
here a choral scholar; his master, Don Armado, would today be a TV pundit. A
whiskery Daniel Massey blends Bernard Shaw with Lytton Strachey and makes a
good case for Shakespeare's atrociously facetious word-play being the
forerunner of Oxford linguistic philosophy.
Berowne, part cynic, part romantic, is the most interesting of the men. If
Jeremy Northam lacks the dazzling ebullience with which Roger Rees skimmed
the language on this stage some years ago, he has the intensity the
production requires, a fit mate for Abigail McKern's pointed Rosaline.
Unexaggerated comedy marks the amateur theatricals. The women have the grace
not to join in the men's sneers; but start the laughter at one of the play's
most touching moments, when haughty Don Armado confesses he has no shirt.
Above all, the production triumphs in avoiding familiar traps: mummerset
rustics (Costard is a smart young butcher's lad; Jaquenetta does a final
number in exotic plumes), and it speeds through the flowery verbosity
inspired by the fashionable euphuisms. The wistful palm-court gaiety of
Nigel Hess's score is countered by hints of future shock with mock-Muscovite
masquers who look like Rasputin. The spires finally disappear from a bleak
horizon that we know contains Paschendael and the Somme; and afternoons will
never be so golden again.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Technology: Checkmate by silicon chip - As a computer
prepares to play the world's top chess players, Charles Arthur assesses its
chances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES ARTHUR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On May 20, a rather unusual chess player will line up in a hall in Munich
alongside professionals such as Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short. Beside five
more of the world's top chess players and eight human qualifiers will be a
computer.
'It won't win, but it won't come last either,' says Fred Friedel about the
Fritz3 chess program developed by his Munich-based company, Chessbase. As
the third generation of an already successful program, it is now being
adapted to run on a personal computer using an Intel Pentium chip running at
100MHz - a contender for the most powerful available PC.
Its presence is partly explained by the fact that Intel, as a sponsor of the
Professional Chess Association - the breakaway group formed last year to
which Kasparov, Short and a number of other professionals now belong - is
keen to show off its processor running the software. But Fritz3 is also
there on merit: in 'blitz' chess, where each player has 25 minutes to play
all his moves, its ranking puts it easily among the world's top 20 players.
The increasing power of computers means it might not be long before the
world champion in some of the west's best-known games, such as chess and
draughts, is made of silicon rather than flesh and blood. 'All the programs
are better than 99.99 per cent of chess players,' says Malcolm Pein,
publisher of Chess magazine and a grandmaster. 'They're just having trouble
with the last 0.01 per cent. There's about 1,000 of us out there who are
better than them.'
Computers are already central to chess professionals' lives: they are used
to study openings, to record games, to confirm analysis of complex positions
and to provide a huge, cross-referenced database of past games as a clue to
opponents' strategies. And the sponsorship of Intel of the US, the world's
leading computer chip maker, is recognition that after a couple of thousand
years chess has become big business. This fact was driven home by last
year's live TV coverage in the UK of the PCA's world championship.
'According to the research, 60 per cent of all adults watched at least one
of the programmes,' says Andrew Finan of the sponsorship company Sports
Bureau International. 'That blew away all the thinking that it was a niche
market.' The more detailed profile found that most watchers were ABC1 males
(demographics for 'well-off middle-class') and aged between 16 and 44. 'It
is an advertiser's dream market,' says Finan. 'And it's also Intel's core
market.' As the biggest chip maker in the world, Intel is now spending more
than Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) over each of the next five years to have
its name associated with the game.
Sales of chess programs are worth millions each year; every games software
house knows that having one in the catalogue is a necessity. The market
splits quite equally between players aged from 40 upwards, and those aged
about 20.
Chess programs have actually been around longer than computers. The first
was written in the 1940s by the mathematical genius Alan Turing, who helped
crack the German Enigma code. He realised that deciding between moves could
be reduced to a formal process: by trying each move, and each combination of
moves following that, and then evaluating the position after those moves (by
allotting some numerical value to each - say, +1 point for capturing a pawn,
+5 for capturing a rook, +1,000 for checkmate), you could choose between
them. Assign the correct values, and you would have an unbeatable program.
Turing's first efforts were laboriously manual, using pencil and paper. But
when the first computers were developed, some of the first non-serious
applications were chess programs. In the 1970s, a master player, David Levy,
set a series of challenge bets that he could beat the best machine versions.
He won, before retiring in 1983.
The programs' weakness remains their strictly mathematical approach, say
those who beat them. 'People have intuition, and the knowledge and plans for
hundreds or thousands of positions,' says Pein. 'They have a much keener
knowledge of when to give up material for a positional advantage. And when
the position is closed, with little chance for tactics, humans are better at
manoeuvring so that when it does open up, they will be at an advantage.'
Not many humans will be, though. By the official Elo chess rating - awarded
to players on their record, such as the quality of the players they beat -
today's programs, such as Fritz, Chess Genius or Kasparov's Gambit are
better than almost everyone in the world, even in standard tournament play
where players get two or more hours for the first 40 moves. The 6m or so
club players worldwide have Elo ratings between 1,200 and 1,900; masters,
from 1,700 to 2,000; the 1,340 international masters, from 2,200 to 2,450.
The 465 grandmasters rank from 2,400 upwards; Kasparov, at just above 2,800,
is officially the best player ever. Fritz2 is ranked at about Elo 2,300, and
Pein expects to see a program ranked Elo 2,500 soon.
For would-be writers of chess programs, there are four attractive factors,
says Friedel: 'It's competitive - you can evaluate claims of whose program
is better simply by playing them against each other, which you can't with,
say, word processing programs. And there's a lot of literature to guide you;
chess openings and endgames have been studied for centuries. It's
commercially viable: you can sell what you make. And it's a hard problem to
solve - but not too hard. I wouldn't touch go, for example.'
Go, an eastern game invented 4,000 years ago, making it about twice as old
as chess, is played on a 19 by 19 grid, on which the players alternately
place black and white counters (called stones) to try to surround empty
territory. It has only nine rules, fewer than chess, but that very
simplicity, coupled with the size of the board, means that at every stage
there can be a couple of hundred different moves to choose from.
In draughts the problem is simpler, since only half as many squares are
used. In 1992, a program called Chinook - officially the world's second-best
player - challenged Marion Tinsley, the world champion since 1954. After 39
games, Tinsley won 4-2. But Chinook's developer is now working on an even
better version.
'It's analysing from the endgame backwards, and from the opening forwards,'
says Friedel, who keeps in touch with such developments. 'It's about six
moves away from linking up the two ends. And then that will be that. It will
be like playing God. You may draw, but you will never win.' The program will
simply never let itself be drawn into a losing thread of play; it will, in
effect, have a map of the entire game. When Tinsley makes the tiniest error
he will lose his title.
Could the same ever happen to chess? Kasparov is as dismissive of computers
as he is of many of his human rivals. In October 1989, he played and twice
defeated Deep Thought, a customised IBM workstation running a chess program;
it was the first computer to achieve grandmaster status. Asked what
improvements they should make, its programmers were told: 'Teach it to
resign earlier.'
Undaunted, the team is developing the successor, Deep Blue, which will
contain Deep Thought shrunk on to a single chip.
So is Kasparov's crown really at risk from a machine? 'Probably not,' says
Friedel. This is the fascination for me.'

FT  06 MAY 94 / Management: Women on the move - Michael McCarrey gives his
view on why the number of female directors in the UK has fallen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MCCARREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of women at the top of business appears to be falling. This week
a survey by the Institute of Management showed that the number of women
managers and directors in the UK's biggest companies fell by 6.9 per cent
last year. The trend in the US and Canada is also downwards.
Given that many large organisations have affirmative action programmes for
women, this situation may seem surprising. Following research in North
America I would argue that it has come about because of two filtering
biases: sex-based stereotypes and performance management or appraisal.
A sex stereotype consists of ideas concerning ability, skills and
preferences which are based on the sex of a person rather than their
behaviour and job performance. Stereotypes are short-cuts to decision making
because they use the obvious - for instance, is someone male or female? -
rather than judging a person's knowledge or evaluating what they have done
in their work.
Many people in general believe that women have more 'expressive' skills
(more relationship-oriented, helpful, emotional, supportive, consensual) and
that men have more 'instrumental' skills (more autonomous, independent,
assertive, take greater risks, are more focused on attaining objectives).
Some psychologists would push our acceptance of the biological differences
to believing that these are the basis for different abilities, motivation
and personality. Stereotypes are easy-to-use views of people in general,
having a grain of truth. The point is that they are based on men and women
non-managers in the general population.
Our research asked women and men managers (matched on socio-economic status,
salary, position, years of work experience and months of supervisory
experience) to describe the meaning of the motivational components of their
jobs. The stereotypes would suggest that male managers would primarily offer
'instrumental' motivators - for example: 'I'll exceed my sales quota'; while
the women managers would give 'expressive' motivators such as: 'I'll feel
better.'
We found no differences whatsoever. Our results offer no support for the
argument that the work motivators for women versus men managers lie in two
different worlds.
Critics might still argue that even if their motivations are similar, the
behaviour of the sexes - the way they go about realising those motives - is
different: that is, 'expressive' for women managers and 'instrumental' for
men. No doubt promotion and selection board members can selectively recall
some candidate behaviours that do fulfil their biased expectations. But this
is an example of the self-fulfilling prophesy.
Performance management is the most blatant smoking gun to sex inequity in
management jobs. The basic problem is the lack of weight given to the task
by CEOs and executive cadre who, in spite of saying the opposite, feel
performance appraisal is good for their subordinates, but not for
themselves.
Most managers in a group of top US Fortune 500 Companies, for example, did
not feel that performance management was a legitimate part of their job as a
manager. In their corporate cultures the implication is that the assessment
process really belongs to the human resources department, which is seen as
complicating the manager's job with armloads of cumbersome, time-consuming
forms (in whose design they have had very little involvement). Consequently,
line managers are rewarded for tasks which do not include real steps towards
the development of their subordinates.
Performance management works to the detriment of women managers because of
the way it combines with the aforementioned sex-based stereotypes. It is
precisely because performance management is time consuming, difficult and
seen as peripheral, that supervisors are too often tempted to use sex-based
stereotypes to accelerate or simplify the appraisal process.
For example, our research found that compared with egalitarian supervisors
(identified as those who had few sex-based stereotypes), traditional
supervisors (who had many stereotypes) devalued the work of their women
subordinates. They appraised them as less able to direct their subordinates
autonomously, promote their career development, or effectively monitor their
day-to-day results.
Little wonder then that an increasing number of women managers react, not so
much against the tough demands of modern management regimes as against
biased performance management outcomes. Some women managers have been
leaving to run their own companies where stereotyped performance management
evaluations will not work to their disadvantage.
Companies that insist on real results in reducing gender inequity in their
managerial workforce need to examine their corporate culture and determine
the role given to performance management, by comparison with their (other)
strategic goals. If the same weight is not given to the improvement of human
capital as to market share, profit and other organisational priorities,
small wonder the human resources function is often viewed as unrelated to
the 'real' goals of the company. The acid test here is: do the job
descriptions of all staff (board of directors, executive, administration)
include meaningful percentages of weights and time spent in subordinate
development with examples of what this means in practice?
Many younger companies in fast-moving, high-tech fields have no job
descriptions, nor do many self-directed work teams. They need procedures
such as weekly or monthly scrutiny of the team 'job' description with action
statements when indicators show poor outcomes across team goals.
Second, companies insisting on real results in reducing managerial sex
inequity need to examine the corporate culture of their board of directors,
executives and administration for the less overt instances - attitudes,
prejudice, defensiveness, posturing, territoriality - of sex bias in
recruitment, selection and performance management.
Almost 20 years ago a prominent bank's chairman in Canada reported that the
bank was unable to appoint a woman to the board. In response to public
outcry and, one suspects, a drop in retail banking market share, the bank
appointed an outstanding woman who met the criteria for board membership.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Management: Cross-border victory, national casualty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How time flies. Four years ago a government affairs executive from a big
American multinational was heard complaining about a nagging problem. How
could the company tell governments, without causing a storm, that the
changing technology and economics of its industry were undermining its
ability - and that of many competitors - to remain a 'good corporate
citizen'?
To be specific, how could it convince seemingly deaf officials that slower
market growth, plus the scope for greater cross-border economies of scale
within Europe and across the globe, would soon make it impossible for many
multinationals to maintain a balance of activities between countries?
Put bluntly, they would soon need to develop products in only one or two
European countries, and to make them in just a handful. There would have to
be some painful relocations.
Today even the deafest government official is all too aware of the problem.
The arrival of the single European market has combined with recession and
greater global competition to force company after company to reconfigure its
network of activities.
For understandable but misguided reasons, the relocation of existing factory
work tends to grab more headlines than the reconfiguration of higher
value-added activities - such as research, design and engineering - on which
future businesses depend.
In the last fortnight there have been several such moves. One of the most
widely publicised was LIG's transfer of condom manufacture from Britain to
Italy and Spain. Moulinex also announced the shift of kettle-making from the
UK to its native France.
But the two most significant decisions came from Texas Instruments, the US
electronics group, and from Ford.
As part of a 're-engineering' of its operations which involves creating a
small number of European 'business centres', TI is to shut its
long-established plant near London. It also plans to transfer two of its
four highest-technology development teams in the UK to Germany and France. A
smaller number of engineers will move in the reverse direction to join one
of the other UK teams.
Even more sweeping is Ford's merger of its North American and European
vehicle operations, which have always worked separately. Europe will become
the global product development and management centre for small and
medium-sized cars, while America takes the rest.
In one sense the TI and Ford changes are the latest examples of a now
standard 1990s phenomenon: the migration of multinationals away from
geographic structures towards global ones.
Because of the circumstances of its industry and its corporate history, Ford
is a generation ahead of TI and many other companies in this process; it is
moving from regional to global, while they shift from national to regional.
But in other ways, the moves by TI and Ford challenge conventional wisdom
about how multinationals should operate.
Take TI first. Other large US multinationals, such as 3M and
Hewlett-Packard, have been able to abandon country-based structures without
affecting the scope and depth of their operations in major European nations.
Units in France, Germany, Italy, the UK and elsewhere have been given
regional or global responsibility for particular businesses and product
lines. Their manufacturing and product development have been reinforced, not
reduced.
Sadly, 3M and HP are in the minority. TI's problem, and that of most other
US and European companies, is that their range of activities in Europe is
not broad enough, or breakable into sufficiently small units, to be spread
evenly across the region. Nor has TI been growing fast enough to emulate 3M
and HP.
But this does not explain its need to move two teams of engineers out of the
UK. The one being moved to Germany was too small to stand alone. But this is
not true of the other.
TI says it decided that the British team, which works on digital signal
processing for use in multimedia and information highways, should be brought
together to create 'synergy' with a similar group in France. Nice was the
best location, even though it is further than southern England from TI's
main European customers.
But why co-locate the groups at all? Why, in these electronic days, could
they not be kept in different locations, able to communicate with each other
at will?
Given all the complexities of developing new products, co-location is always
ideal. But in order to tap skills around the world and to be responsive to
market differences, networks of far-flung specialists often have to work
together. Such networks are supposed to be one of the hallmarks of the
modern multinational.
Which brings us to Ford. Unlike TI, it is retaining, at least for now, its
existing European design, development and engineering centres - in Germany
and Britain. The financial and political costs of merging them would be
high.
But it has admitted in the past that it suffers a cost penalty from having
two centres in the same region. Its new global managers will be hunting hard
for productivity increases in engineering.
Ford could also decide in a few years' time to shift responsibility for some
small cars to Mazda, its Japanese affiliate - a step which was mooted a few
years ago.
So, although Ford has always tried harder than most to be a good European
corporate citizen, it may yet have to bring itself to concentrate most of
its engineering in either Germany or Britain. Other companies - and
countries - will be watching with more than a modicum of self-interest its
struggle to organise more productively across borders without creating
national casualties.

FT  06 MAY 94 / People: New finance director at Green Property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the space of six months, Green Property, the Dublin-based property
investment and development group, has recruited its second corporate finance
specialist from the Investment Bank of Ireland (IBI) stable, one of
Ireland's leading fund managers.
The 42-year old Danny Kitchen is leaving his post as a director of IBI
Corporate Finance, to join Green Property as its new finance director.
He will be replacing David McDowell, who will continue as a director on the
board and as company secretary.
Kitchen has worked closely with Richard Hooper, who last September retired
as the managing director of IBI corporate finance and was immediately
recruited onto Green's board as a non-executive director by Stephen Vernon,
Green's managing director.
Hooper has been involved in most of the major corporate finance deals in
Ireland for the past two decades.
Belfast-born, Kitchen was educated at Queen's University and went on to work
for Northern Bank, subsequently joining IBI in 1980.
He advised Green on its IPounds 42m acquisition last February of the Irish
Merchant Navy Officer's Pension Fund property portfolio, which consists
mainly of office buildings in Dublin's city centre, and its part financing
through a successful IPounds 26.3m three-for-four rights issue.
Vernon said yesterday: 'I wanted to take on someone with the appropriate
corporate finance skills the company needs and Danny is the best man
around.'
Vernon has been on Green's board since 1989 and became managing director in
September last year, four weeks before Hooper joined the board.
His main experience has been in the UK property market. He added yesterday
that Kitchen will now bring specialised knowledge of the Irish property and
financial markets into Green. The company has 'ambitious plans for further
growth and development,' he said.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Property: An appetising brew - Investors are increasingly
heading for the pub. Vanessa Houlder explains why
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors scouring the commercial property market in search of value are
beginning to turn their attention to an unconventional target: pubs.
Pubs are 'one of the last untapped property investment resources', according
to property advisers Erdman Lewis. The recent changes in the UK brewing
industry - prompted by the 1989 Monopolies and Mergers Commission report
designed to make the industry more competitive - has potentially opened up a
new class of property investment, with a total value equivalent to 8 per
cent of the total property market.
Institutions and property companies have, so far, been tentative in their
approach to the pub market. But the remarkable performance of the property
investment market over the past year is encouraging investors to be more
adventurous in their search for bargains. Pubs share many of the
characteristics of retail property, but yields (ratio of income to capital)
are markedly higher.
'More and more people are looking at pubs as a form of property investment
in order to get more attractive yields,' says Mr Gareth Jones of Conrad
Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith, property advisers. The recent sale at an auction
of a pub in Whitechapel, east London, (currently let to Shepherd Neame) for
about Pounds 500,000, on a yield of 9.5 per cent, is a good example.
Relatively few other deals have yet been struck, though some investors are
actively considering investing in the market. Erdman Lewis estimates that
Pounds 150m has been earmarked by institutional funds, property companies
and family trusts to spend on pub property.
This nascent interest in the pub property market is the result of the
MMC-induced shake-up in the industry. In a market traditionally dominated by
the brewers, the MMC limitations placed on brewers' pub ownership has
created new opportunities for other investors to enter the market.
In broad terms, the impetus for the development of an investment market in
pubs is likely to emerge from the search by pub owners for increasingly
creative ways to finance their pub estates.
Opportunities for investors could also arise with the emergence of licensed
retailers such as J D Wetherspoon, Regent Inns and Grosvenor Inns. According
to Erdman Lewis, property investors are prepared to regard this type of
company as acceptable tenants.
The market has been slower to take off than some analysts expected. Brewers
have so far shown little appetite for striking sale and leaseback deals
while finance is available from more conventional sources.
They may also be holding back while there is continuing uncertainty over the
structure of the pub industry until the European Commission reviews in 1997
the competition exemptions that enable British breweries to operate the tied
house system.
But an equally important brake on the market is investors' reticence. This
reluctance is not entirely the consequence of unfamiliarity with the sector.
In a survey of investors that own more than Pounds 3bn of direct property
holdings, Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith found that 40 per cent already
held pubs as investments in their property portfolio, usually as a result of
a larger property holding, which in many cases was historic.
One of the most serious obstacles blocking direct institutional investment
in property is a difference of approach between investors and tenants
concerning the method of rent calculation.
Traditionally, pub operators have based their assessment of rents on the
potential trade that could be generated from a pub. This basis of assessing
rents deters investors accustomed to calculating rent on the basis of total
floor area.
When Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith surveyed investors it found that rent
calculation methods topped the list of concerns. 'Problems with rental
calculation are evidently preventing investments in public houses,' it
concluded.
The poor quality of information about rental and capital values is another
inhibiting factor holding back potential pub investors. In the Conrad
Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith survey, nearly all investors said this factor has
resulted in poor market awareness. 'In any event, an index demonstrating
rental and capital growth is a prerequisite to any significant investment
market being created,' it said.
The low value of the average pub deal and the heavy toll on management time
and effort is another disincentive. Institutions frequently require
portfolios of between eight and 50 pubs or big city centre sites, to make it
worth their while in investment terms.
Potential investors are also concerned about the perceived oversupply of
pubs. The brewing industry expects the closure of a further 10,000 pubs in
the next few years from a total of about 60,000 at present.
The concern over a possible flood of pub sales over the next few years is
reflected in the higher values commanded by those pubs which could
potentially be put to alternative use. An urban pub, with a strong potential
for alternative use, will command much higher prices than a rural pub.
The dilemma facing potential investors is that some obstacles to the
development of a pub investment market, such as the lack of a rental index
and the method of rental calculation, are unlikely to be changed in the
early stages of the market's development. Investing in pub property may have
attractions, but at present it is strictly for pioneers.

FT  06 MAY 94 / People: Foreign policy expert joins Morgan Grenfell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Rodric Braithwaite, 61, the former foreign policy adviser to Britain's
prime minister, has found a City job.
He has been appointed a senior adviser to Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant
bank owned by Deutsche Bank.
Sir Rodric, right, who is also on the European advisory board of ICL, is one
of the diplomatic service's most experienced figures, with 37 years notched
up, including serving as ambassador in Moscow during the difficult years of
1988 to 1992.
Although he has spent time in Rome, Brussels and Washington, it is Sir
Rodric's Russian expertise which will be most useful to Morgan Grenfell; he
is fluent in Russian. He is expected to spend about three days a week on
bank business.
The merchant bank has been a major player in Eastern Europe for many years.
It was the first UK merchant bank to open an office in Moscow (in 1977) and
has arranged over 90 per cent of the export credits to the former Soviet
Union.
More recently, it has completed the first limited recourse financing for an
oil project in Russia, and is also advising British Gas and Agip on the
Dollars 6bn Karachaganak gas field development in Kazakhstan.
Whereas most merchant banks tend to recruit ex-diplomats as non-executive
directors, Morgan Grenfell prefers to hire them as advisers.
Last year, Morgan recruited Sir John Whitehead, a former ambassador to
Tokyo. This latest appointment, of Sir Rodric, will bring the bank's total
of special advisers to four.

FT  06 MAY 94 / People: Wetherspoon recruits for a heady future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tim Martin, the 38-year-old New Zealander who founded and then floated the
pub operator JD Wetherspoon, has brought in another young man to help him
run the rapidly-expanding chain.
Martin has shared the roles of chairman and managing director since the
group came to the market in October, 1992 - a period which has seen the size
of its estate grow from 44 pubs to 77.
The choice of Mark McQuater, 34, as the group's new managing director seems
partly designed to allay any concern among institutional investors that
Martin might overstretch himself, as the group expands beyond its London
base.
If reassuring institutions was their brief, the headhunters who came up with
McQuater appear to have pressed all the right buttons. A Scottish chartered
accountant, he has experience with both big-company procedures in the drinks
industry and the City.
For the last five years McQuater has been working in Scotland with Natwest
Venture, the clearing bank's venture capital arm. Before that, he spent
three years with Scottish and Newcastle Breweries, working on corporate
transactions and group planning.
McQuater - who Martin first met in 1987, while signing a deal with S&amp;N  -
will concentrate on the day-to-day management of the group, allowing the
chairman to concentrate on strategic development.
JD Wetherspoon's slick marketing - which involves reserving up to a third of
its bar space for non-smokers - has proved successful; another 10 pubs will
soon open.
The splitting of his roles is unlikely to mean a drop in salary for Martin,
who last year earned Pounds 128,000; but the issue is scarcely a burning
concern. The group's shares have more than doubled since coming to the
market, and the 18 per cent stake held by Martin and his wife is now worth
nearly Pounds 25m.

FT  06 MAY 94 / People: Cadbury comes to fore at Premier Brands
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roger Cadbury, 56, has been appointed chairman of Premier Brands, the
Hillsdown Holdings subsidiary.
He replaces Bart Constandse, who stands down on June 1. Constandse will also
be resigning as a director of Hillsdown - after being with the group for 4
1/2 years - on July 1.
The post of Premier Brands chairman incorporates the European biscuits and
beverages division of the group.
Cadbury has considerable experience of the food and beverage business,
having worked for Beecham, General Foods and Whitworth Holdings.
He was promoted from being sales director of General Foods to deputy
managing director in 1984, moving up to managing director in 1987. He joined
Whitworth Holdings as group managing director in January 1990.
Although a member of the well-known Cadbury family - as second cousin of
Dominic and Sir Adrian Cadbury, his great-grandfather was their grandfather
 -he has never worked for the Cadbury businesses.
Ironically, however, thanks to a management buy-out which gave birth to
Premier Brands, he will now have responsibility for some famous biscuit
brands carrying the Cadbury name.
Hillsdown restructured its subsidiaries into four European divisions some 18
months ago.
Of the many familiar beverage brands included in his new portfolio, Typhoo
Tea and Bournvita are perhaps the most well-established. Cadbury will be
reporting to David Newton, Hillsdown's chief executive.
Constandse will be returning to his native country, Holland, to pursue his
business career.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Jungheinrich wins bidding for Lancer Boss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of Lancer Boss was finally resolved when administrative receivers
to the last big UK-owned producer of lift trucks yesterday announced they
had sold the business to Germany's Jungheinrich.
The deal secures the future of 700 jobs at Boss factories in Leighton
Buzzard, Bedfordshire.
Terms were not disclosed, but it is understood Jungheinrich paid about
Pounds 18m, excluding debtors, for the Lancer Boss Group and associated
companies in the UK, Ireland and Austria. The deal follows intense
negotiations involving Grant Thornton, the accountants who were appointed
administrative receivers on April 8, and the three bidders. Jungheinrich,
based in Hamburg, was persuaded to raise its bid 'very significantly',
outbidding Terex of the US and a proposed management buy-in.
Mr Allan Griffiths, a partner at Grant Thornton and one of the
administrative receivers, said the price paid by Jungheinrich was 'at the
very top end of our estimates'. He would not say how much Boss's banks, led
by National Westminster, would receive, but said they were pleased with the
deal.
Jungheinrich was considered the leading contender for Lancer Boss after its
purchase of Steinbock Boss, the UK's company's Germam arm.
The takeover may not be to everyone's taste - including that of a man who
wrote to the receivers complaining bitterly about the sale to a German
company - but for its workers and managers it has a compelling industrial
logic.
However, precedent suggests the deal will mean a new beginning for the
company. Five years ago, Lansing Bagnall, the great rival of Lancer Boss in
the UK lift truck industry, was short of money and heading for trouble. It
would probably never have made it through the recent recession had it not
been purchased in 1989 by Linde of Germany, the world's biggest lift truck
company.
The Basingstoke-based company, now called Lansing Linde, has become an
important part of Linde's global product and manufacturing strategy.
If the optimism and bonhomie yesterday at Leighton Buzzard were anything to
go by, Lancer Boss is destined for a similarly secure future under
Jungheinrich's ownership.
Mr Bob Bischof, chairman of Jungheinrich (GB), said the booms and busts of
the UK lift truck market were far more pronounced than in Germany or
elsewhere in Europe. He added that it was very difficult for a company such
as Boss to manufacture under those conditions.
The takeover by the financially strong Jungheinrich should make it much
easier for Boss to weather recessions. It also brings Jungheinrich a highly
regarded product range that will make the German company a much stronger
third company in the increasingly global lift truck markets.
Crucially, it brings Jungheinrich a manufacturing plant in a relatively
low-cost country making engined products complementary to its own electric
trucks.
There are no plans to expand production in the UK. But Dr Hans-Peter
Schmohl, a senior Jungheinrich manager, said: 'If we do expand we will do it
here.'

Ministers have ordered trials of electronic tagging of criminals covered by
curfew orders, the Home Office said last night. The Pounds 1.3m trials will
start early next year in Manchester, Reading and Norfolk and will last nine
months. Private security companies may be involved in running the three
pilot schemes.
The tags will be used to ensure that offenders placed under curfew orders -
a sanction so far seldom used - abide by them. A previous tagging experiment
was abandoned five years ago after difficulties with equipment.
The scheme is being resurrected while the Home Office is reviewing
non-custodial sentencing to ensure that it is tougher and tightly
supervised.

The cabinet yesterday gave its stamp of approval to the Conservative
manifesto for the European elections.
In what was seen as a victory for Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
over the party's hardline Euro-sceptics, the manifesto won unanimous
approval from senior ministers. Mr Hurd will develop one of the key themes
of the manifesto - the case for a wider, decentralised European Union, in a
speech in Warsaw later this evening.
In what is being billed as the first of a series of speeches on Britain's
European agenda for the second half of the 1990s, he will press the case for
enlargement of the European Union to include the former Communist states of
eastern Europe.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Students spurn jobs in accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of students entering chartered accountancy has slumped to the
lowest level in 20 years, a report on education within the profession says,
Andrew Jack writes.
There were only 4,074 trainees with the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales joining firms in 1992-93, reducing steadily from a peak
of 7,063 in 1988-89. The figure was last this low in 1974.
Mr Phil Armitage, director of education and training for the institute, said
the decline reflected a reduction in demand for new entrants by the UK's
accountancy firms, which have been cutting numbers since the start of the
recession.
The decline poses a considerable threat to the finances of the institute
which relies on new recruits for a substantial proportion of its income.
More than 90 per cent of entrants were graduates, and 61.5 per cent joined
firms with more than 100 partners. Women comprised 37 per cent of the
intake.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Sell-offs with one hand tied: Andrew Baxter unravels the
tangled web of a split receivership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 8pm on April 13, an offer for the UK operations of Lancer Boss was faxed
to Grant Thornton, the firm of accountants that five days earlier had been
appointed receivers for the Bedfordshire-based lift-truck maker.
Simultaneously, an offer from the same big UK-based suitor was faxed to Mr
Werner Folger, the German lawyer handling the receivership of Steinbock
Boss, Lancer's German subsidiary.
'The offer was for the whole group,' said Mr Allan Griffiths, Grant Thornton
partner and joint administrative receiver with his colleague Mr Scott Barnes
for Lancer Boss in the UK. He added: 'We sent a fax to our German
counterpart that night, and said we had to sit down and discuss the offer.'
The following day Mr Peter Flesher, another Grant Thornton partner, was
despatched to Munich to meet Mr Folger. At Munich airport he phoned Mr
Folger's office to check on the time for his meeting, but was told that the
lawyer was out and could not be contacted. That morning, Steinbock Boss had
been sold to Jungheinrich, the big Hamburg-based lift-truck producer.
The saga was one of a number of events that turned the Lancer Boss
receivership into one of the most extraordinary in recent years, culminating
yesterday with the announcement that Jungheinrich had acquired from Grant
Thornton the Lancer Boss Group and associated companies in Great Britain,
Ireland and Austria.
As soon as the collapse of Lancer Boss was announced, it was clear that this
would be no normal receivership. The decision by German banks to withdraw
support from Steinbock Boss led to the German lawyer being called in. This
prompted the receivership in the UK.
Mr Griffiths was left in the unusual situation for a UK receiver of lacking
full control of the company he was trying to sell. He believed the group
would be worth more if the German and UK parts could be sold together.
But Mr Folger and the German banks who appointed him had other ideas. They
wanted Steinbock sold as quickly as possible to Jungheinrich, partly to
reduce their own losses but also to ensure that Steinbock's future was clear
before the Hanover Fair - Germany's leading exhibition of industrial
equipment - later in April.
Mr Griffiths does not hide his irritation that Mr Folger sold Steinbock as
fast as possible, in effect preventing other purchasers from buying the UK
and German operations.
The UK receivers also became highly critical of the disparity between
different national insolvency laws - the main issue raised by the whole
saga. 'My argument is not with Jungheinrich, but with the system that
allowed this to happen,' Mr Griffiths said yesterday. 'You cannot sell a
business with Pounds 70m of turnover in three or four days.'
The receiver has warned that a split receivership could reoccur, especially
with medium-size UK companies whose European operations were financed
locally. He plans to send a report to the Department of Trade and Industry
on the lessons learnt.
Once Jungheinrich had bought Steinbock and Mr Griffiths had clinched the
vital trading relationship between Lancer Boss and its former German unit,
the sale of Lancer Boss could proceed more like a regular UK receivership,
with potential bidders examining the company, the drawing up of a shortlist
and the announcement of a buyer.
Jungheinrich was in a powerful position after buying Steinbock Boss, and any
other buyer knew it would have to sort out a relationship with the German
company or risk losing 50 per cent of its business.
In the past few days Mr Griffiths and his team deployed a variety of
arguments to push up 'very significantly' the price the German company was
prepared to pay.
'We argued that it was worth paying more to keep Lancer Boss out of a
competitor's hands,' Mr Griffiths said. It was 'useful', he admitted, that
there were three bids in the final negotiations.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Brand owners will go to court against lookalikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brand manufacturers intend to launch a series of court cases against
supermarkets that sell lookalike products, having become convinced that a
full-scale war with the big supermarket chains has become unavoidable.
Their fears of sales being damaged by supermarket products packaged to
resemble leading brands have been underlined by an NOP opinion poll
published by the brand manufacturers.
It shows that more than a fifth of all consumers purchased supermarkets' own
brands in the mistaken belief that they were purchasing a leading branded
product.
Mr John Murphy, chairman of the brand development company, Interbrand, and
spokesman for the British Producers and Brand Owners Group, said the brand
manufacturers felt that they had been exploited by supermarkets for too
long.
'There are a series of other supermarket rip-off products in the pipeline,'
he said. 'But brand owners are now going to take on the retailers in a major
way'.
He said the brand owners would be launching a series of lawsuits alleging
that supermarkets were 'passing off' in the packaging of their products.
Coca-Cola is widely expected to initiate the legal campaign with a
passing-off case against Sainsbury for allegedly infringing Coca-Cola's
intellectual property rights with its 'Classic' cola range of soft drinks.
'We have made our views known to Sainsbury', said Mr Peter Stokes of
Coca-Cola. 'However, I cannot comment on what further action we will take
until our talks with the company are completed'.
Mr Murphy said Sainsbury was likely to be the target of several cases.
Manufacturers might launch a case against the group in France, where the
supermarket chain has recently opened a shop in Calais and where the legal
restrictions on lookalikes are much tighter than in the UK.
The NOP poll was conducted three weeks ago and involved interviews with
1,008 shoppers. Of these, 42 per cent said they had picked a supermarket's
product off the shelf thinking it was a manufacturers' brand, and 21 per
cent said they had mistakenly bought a lookalike product.
Equally worrying for the brand manufacturers is that 41 per cent believed -
mistakenly - that supermarkets' products were made by the manufacturers of
the market-leading equivalents.
The results seem to contradict an earlier MORI poll for the British Retail
Consortium of 514 shoppers which found that 78 per cent said they never
confused branded goods and the lookalike version.
The brand owners' group, which includes Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, Nestle
and Mars, has so far failed to persuade the government to amend the trade
mark bill before parliament to introduce curbs on lookalike products.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Revenue is told of threat to venture capital trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Venture capital trusts, proposed by the government in last November's Budget
as a way of boosting investment in unquoted companies, will flounder unless
current Inland Revenue proposals are substantially changed, the Association
of Investment Trust Companies said yesterday.
Association members include venture and development capital specialists
already managing investment trusts with assets worth Pounds 1bn.
Mr Ernest Fenton, association director-general, says investors would be
unlikely to take the additional risk of investing in unquoted companies
unless the tax incentives were significantly increased.
The association says few sponsors would be willing to promote the venture
capital trusts because the Revenue was proposing to restrict too severely
the maximum investment in any company and the size of qualifying businesses.
Nevertheless, Mr Fenton said: 'The AITC warmly welcomes the government's
initiative. We would like to see venture capital trusts work.'
The association's criticism comes in a detailed reply to the Revenue's
consultative document on the new trusts.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said in his Budget address that the new
trusts would stimulate substantial investment in unlisted companies, many of
which suffer from a shortage of equity and long-term finance. The government
plans to include final proposals in the 1995 finance bill.
The association suggests a number of changes that would make the venture
capital trusts more likely to succeed. These include:
The maximum size of an investee company should be raised from the Revenue's
suggested limit of Pounds 10m of assets to a maximum of Pounds 30m, broadly
the size of company that can realistically expect to provide an exit for
investors via a stockmarket flotation.
The maximum investment in any company should be raised from Pounds 1m to
about Pounds 3m.
Mr Fenton argued that for a venture capital trust to be floated it would
need to raise about Pounds 25 to Pounds 30m. Finding and investing that
amount in Pounds 1m parcels would be time-consuming and commercially
unattractive. Investors should be given tax relief on their initial
investment at their top marginal rate. This would then be similar to the
relief given investors in the Business Expansion Scheme, which ended in
December.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Lie test seeks the truth on adverts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A form of lie-detector test intended to help advertisers pinpoint what makes
consumers buy products is being developed at the University of East London.
Volunteers are being wired to a machine called a Grass Polygraph, which
monitors changes in heart rate, blood pressure, respiration and sweating.
They are then given advertisements to watch, and peaks and troughs in the
polygraph readings are measured.
Professor Brian Clifford, head of the project, said yesterday that the
research had potential to give advertisers 'the lowdown on how people
process advertising'.
The work is due to be completed within three months and several advertising
agencies are already showing interest in the machine, Prof Clifford said.
The intention is to 'look at the relationship between what people say they
like about an advert and what the body or the brain is saying,' he said.
It would be the first time there had been a scientific attempt to measure
physical reaction to advertisements, rather than relying on what consumers
say, he said.
Prof Clifford dismissed fears that advertisers could rely too heavily on
polygraph peaks and that all beer advertisements, for example, might consist
entirely of naked women. 'It's much more complex and subtle than that, and
the advertising agencies know that,' he said.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Slow start made to energy saving
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Government departments have made a slow start in meeting targets for energy
saving, says a report by the National Audit Office published yesterday.
On average, departments will need to save energy at the rate of 5 per cent a
year to meet their targets of saving 15 per cent of energy use during the
five years ending 1995-96, the NAO said.
The report also comments that while some 600,000 low-income households have
benefited from the government's Home Energy Efficiency Scheme, more than
three-quarters have used the benefits to improve 'warmth and comfort', and
that overall savings in energy will be limited.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Forecasting urged in property sector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The commercial property industry should develop formal forecasting models to
try to smooth out damaging fluctuations in the property market, says a Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors report.
The cycles in the commercial property industry damage the economy as a
whole, the report says. Owners, occupiers, lenders, borrowers, the
government and the public are affected by sharp declines in property values,
wasted investment in unwanted buildings and mistimed developments.
Although the property cycle feeds directly off the economic cycle,
additional instability in the property market arises from speculative
development. This is because market conditions can change substantially
between the decision to build a building and completion.
The RICS report recommends that the industry improve its timing and
information base. It should focus on 'how the speed of development responses
could be accelerated, how market signals could be read with greater
circumspection and how other ways of meeting occupier requirements, such as
custom building, could be encouraged'.

FT  06 MAY 94 / 98% of schools order tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Copies of national curriculum tests which 14-year-olds in England and Wales
are due to take next week have been ordered by 98 per cent of schools,
government officials announced yesterday, John Authers writes.
Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority
which supervises the tests, said: 'Clearly, schools have taken heed of the
improvements made to the tests.'
He added that the time taken for the majority of pupils to sit them had been
cut by about a half since last year, when a boycott by teachers' unions
meant that scarcely more than 100 schools, out of more than 4,000, completed
and reported test results.
The NUT union, which is continuing its boycott this year, played down the
figures' significance. Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said: 'There's
a big difference between asking to see the tests and the results being sent
back to the government. We are confident that the boycott will be very
strongly supported.'
Next week the SCAA will launch the biggest educational consultation that
England and Wales have seen, when it publishes the preliminary version of
the new national curriculum. More than 1.5m documents will be distributed to
parents, schools and other interested parties at a cost of between Pounds
1.5m and Pounds 2m.
Complete new guidelines for the national curriculum will be in schools by
the end of next January, ready to be implemented from September 1995.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Compelling logic of sale that points to secure future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The takeover of Lancer Boss may not be to everyone's taste - including a man
who wrote to the receivers complaining bitterly about the sale to a German
company - but for its workers and managers it has a compelling industrial
logic.
The sale to Jungheinrich of Hamburg means the last significant UK-owned lift
truck producer has passed into foreign hands. But precedent suggests the
deal will mean a new beginning for the company based in Leighton Buzzard,
Bedfordshire.
Five years ago, Lansing Bagnall, the great rival of Lancer Boss in the UK
lift truck industry, was short of money and heading for trouble. It would
probably never have made it through the recent recession had it not been
purchased in 1989 by Linde of Germany, the world's biggest lift truck
company.
The Basingstoke-based company, now called Lansing Linde, has become an
important part of Linde's global product and manufacturing strategy.
If the optimism and bonhomie yesterday at Leighton Buzzard were anything to
go by, Lancer Boss - or Boss as it will now be called - is destined for a
similarly secure future under Jungheinrich's ownership.
Mr Bob Bischof, chairman of Jungheinrich (GB) and one of Germany's best
known UK-based German industrialists, pointed out that the booms and busts
of the UK lift truck market were far more pronounced than in Germany or
elsewhere in Europe. He said it was very difficult for a company of Lancer's
size to manufacture under those conditions.
The takeover by the financially strong Jungheinrich should make it much
easier for Boss to weather recessions.
It also brings Jungheinrich a highly regarded product range that will make
the German company a much stronger third company in the increasingly global
lift truck markets. Jungheinrich has already purchased Steinbock Boss -
Lancer's German arm - from its German receiver.
Crucially, it brings Jungheinrich a manufacturing plant in a relatively
low-cost country making engined products complementary to its own electric
trucks.
Yesterday this gave the 700 workers at Boss a sense of security after all
the uncertainty of the past four weeks.
There are no plans to expand production but Dr Hans-Peter Schmohl, a senior
Jungheinrich manager, said: 'If we do expand we will do it here.'

FT  06 MAY 94 / Lords warn Brussels of EU 'jobless expansion'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union is facing the prospect of a 'jobless expansion' with the
European Commission underestimating the gravity of its structural
unemployment, a House of Lords committee warns today.
Warning that 'unemployment is the most important social problem facing us at
the present time', the committee on the European communities calls on the EU
'to develop a strategy both for competitiveness and for employment'.
Restoring Europe's competitiveness is a necessary condition for sustained
growth, the committee says in a report on last year's commission white paper
on growth, competitiveness and employment. But competitiveness will not
solve the problem of structural unemployment - the type that will not be
dislodged by economic growth and accounts for at least half of the EU's 17m
or more jobless.
The report says structural unemployment is, 'if anything, even more serious
than the white paper suggests'.
The committee says the EU has much to learn from the US and Japan, which
have better records of job creation. It cites inadequate growth and
investment, high short-term interest rates over a long period, reduced
competitiveness in terms of quality and cost, loss of 'technological edge',
high unit labour costs and excessive non-wage labour costs as reasons for
the EU's high structural unemployment.
Job creation can be achieved partly through improving productivity and
partly through encouraging innovation. But the Lords point out that
microeconomic measures to create jobs need to be carried out at a national,
rather than at an EU level. These include simplifying regulations, reforming
benefits and the use of lifelong education and vocational training to match
skills to changing technological needs.
The EU's role should be to act as a catalyst for the exchange of ideas; an
advocate of best practice; a monitor, for example, of the effect of
regulations on employment; and an umpire to prevent mutually destructive
de-regulation between member states.
The Lords report, which was agreed unanimously, says that recovery should be
'the immediate priority' of macroeconomic policy in the EU. It urges member
states to aim to achieve the tough fiscal and monetary convergence criteria
of the Maastricht treaty in the medium term. 'They should not be strictly
applied until the Community has recovered from recession,' the report says.
Although the report steers clear of a full assessment of the planned
economic and monetary union, it is sceptical as to whether it will help
solve the problem of cyclical unemployment.
The report calls on the EU to complete the single market quickly and enforce
it equally.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Coffee price at five-year record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shoppers may face further coffee price rises because of a surge on the
international market. A squeeze in supplies pushed prices up on the London
Commodity Exchange yesterday.
Prices on the July futures contract rose a further Dollars 17 a tonne to a
five-year high of Dollars 1,700. The increase this week alone is Dollars 134
a tonne.
The benchmark price has risen by more than 40 per cent or nearly Dollars 500
a tonne so far this year.
'Clearly manufacturers will be looking with interest to see what they can
pass on, but there will be a certain amount of consumer resistance to
another price rise,' one UK retailer commented.
The recent rise in the coffee market follows five years of low prices after
an agreement between producers and consumers to set price levels collapsed
in 1989. Producer countries have been strapped for cash to invest in new
crops with the result that output in countries such as Brazil and Colombia
has dropped by a third this year.
'Overall, producers' revenues have halved to Dollars 5bn a year in the past
five years and they cannot afford to fertilise their crops,' said Mr Nestor
Osorio, Colombian coffee representative in London.
Coffee processors insist that they try to keep supermarket prices stable
rather than respond to market fluctuation. Nestle said its January increase
was the first for four years and that a 100 gram jar of Nescafe was 4p
cheaper than five years ago.

FT  06 MAY 94 / The odd tale of Lancer Boss: Andrew Baxter on a receivership
that never quite went as planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 8pm on April 13, an offer for the UK operations of Lancer Boss was faxed
to the Euston office of Grant Thornton, the accountants who five days
earlier had been appointed receivers for the Bedfordshire-based lift truck
maker.
Simultaneously, an offer from the same big UK-based suitor was faxed to Mr
Werner Folger, the German lawyer handling the receivership of Steinbock
Boss, Lancer's German subsidiary.
'The offer was for the whole group,' said Mr Allan Griffiths, Grant Thornton
partner and joint administrative receiver with his colleague Mr Scott Barnes
for Lancer Boss in the UK. He added: 'We sent a fax to our German
counterpart that night, and said we had to sit down and discuss the offer.'
The following day Mr Peter Flesher, another Grant Thornton partner, was
despatched to Munich to meet Mr Folger. At Munich airport he phoned Mr
Folger's office to check on the time for his meeting, but was told that the
lawyer was out and could not be contacted. That morning, Steinbock Boss had
been sold to Jungheinrich, the big Hamburg-based lift truck producer.
The saga was one of a number of events that turned the Lancer Boss
receivership into one of the most extraordinary in recent years, culminating
yesterday with the announcement that Jungheinrich had acquired from Grant
Thornton the Lancer Boss Group and associated companies in Great Britain,
Ireland and Austria.
As soon as the collapse of Lancer Boss was announced, it was clear that this
would be no normal receivership. The decision by German banks to withdraw
support from Steinbock Boss led to the German lawyer being called in. This
prompted the receivership in the UK.
Mr Griffiths was left in the unusual situation for a UK receiver of lacking
full control of the company he was trying to sell. He believed the group
would be worth more if the German and UK parts could be sold together.
But Mr Folger and the German banks who appointed him had other ideas. They
wanted Steinbock sold as quickly as possible to Jungheinrich, partly to
reduce their own losses but also to ensure that Steinbock's future was clear
before the Hanover Fair - Germany's leading exhibition of industrial
equipment - later in April.
Mr Griffiths does not hide his irritation that Mr Folger sold Steinbock as
fast as possible, in effect shutting out other purchasers from buying the UK
and German operations.
The UK receivers also became highly critical of the disparity between
different national insolvency laws - the main issue raised by the whole
saga. 'My argument is not with Jungheinrich, but with the system that
allowed this to happen,' Mr Griffiths said yesterday. 'You cannot sell a
business with Pounds 70m of turnover in three or four days.'
Once Jungheinrich had bought Steinbock and Mr Griffiths had clinched the
vital trading relationship between Lancer Boss and its former German unit,
the sale of Lancer Boss could proceed more like a regular UK receivership,
with potential bidders examining the company, the drawing up of a shortlist
and the eventual announcement of a buyer.
Jungheinrich had put itself in a powerful position by buying Steinbock Boss,
and any other buyer for Lancer Boss knew it would have to sort out a
relationship with the German company or risk losing 50 per cent of its
business.
In the end, Jungheinrich very nearly lost out by bidding too low for Lancer
Boss. Terex, the US construction equipment group which owns Clark Material
Handling, was setting the pace in the bidding at the end of last week.
In the past few days Mr Griffiths and his team deployed a variety of
arguments to push up 'very significantly' the price the German company was
prepared to pay.
'We argued that it was worth paying more to keep Lancer Boss out of a
competitor's hands,' Mr Griffiths said. It was 'useful,' he admitted, that
there were three bids in the final negotiations.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Large gains for Scots Nats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservatives slipped to third place in Scotland, taking only 14 per
cent of the vote in the elections for the nine regional and three island
councils.
In Lothian, a council that the Tories once controlled, the they lost 7 seats
to Labour and the Liberal Democrats, ending with only 5.
Mr Major is scheduled to address the conference of the Scottish Conservative
party at Inverness on Friday. He will face renewed calls to delay unpopular
plans for local council re-organisation and a shake-up of Scotland's water
services.
Labour took 42 per cent of the vote, about the same level as in 1990, the
last time the councils were contested. The party kept control of the two
largest regional councils, Strathclyde and Lothian.
However, the Scottish Nationalist party registered the biggest gains, with
27 per cent of the vote.
Among the seats it picked up were one from Labour in Airdrie South, part of
Strathclyde that falls within the Monklands constituency of Mr John Smith,
the Labour leader.
The SNP also picked up a seat from Labour in what should have been the safe
Labour territory of Kilmarnock.
Mr Alex Salmond, the party's leader, said it now faced the long-awaited
prospect of votes cast being translated into actual seats, and reaching the
critical 30 per cent turning-point.
'The Scottish people have gained the confidence to vote for their power to
change,' he said. 'The SNP are the real winners in this election, giving us
an excellent launch-pad for the European elections.'
The Liberal Democrats passed their modest target of increasing their share
of regional council seats from 42 to 50 or more. They are likely to end up
with about 60 seats, and will replace Labour as the biggest single party in
Grampian region.
Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, admitted on BBC
Radio Scotland that former Tory voters had stayed at home - 'which is
clearly disappointing'.
The Conservatives lost seats even in blue-chip suburbs of Edinburgh. Mr
Alistair Darling, Labour MP for Edinburgh Central, said: 'The Tories have
lost their heartland vote.'

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Conservatives hurt in London suburbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservatives suffered unprecedented setbacks in London last night as both
Labour and the Liberal Democrats won control of a series of councils, many
of which were previously thought impregnable.
The most wounding results were in the suburbs, with the Conservatives losing
overall control of Bexley, Harrow, and Redbridge. They also came within one
seat of doing so in Bromley. Labour also came within one seat of taking
control of Havering, which was previously hung.
Labour took control of Ealing, Enfield, Croydon and Hillingdon (which had
already fallen in a by-election) from the Conservatives, while the Liberal
Democrats enjoyed their strongest ever showing in the capital, seizing
Kingston upon Thames and making double-figure gains in Bromley and Harrow.
The Conservatives also failed to take overall control of Brent, where they
had hoped to exploit memories of previous Labour administrations.
Labour's problems with a generalised 'London effect', with voters punishing
so-called 'loony left' councils, appeared to be at an end. Instead, this
effect was limited to Lambeth, where Labour lost overall control after a
succession of scandals, and Waltham Forest, where the party also lost
overall control.
Mr Tony Travers, head of the Greater London group at the London School of
Economics, said that London had over recent years been moving 'further and
further away from swingometer politics'.
He added: 'London is beginning to break into a kind of new politics of a
number of different two-way battles. It's the way the local electorate is
coming to terms with a two-party system when it wants to have a three-party
system.'
In Enfield, Labour won 10 seats, overturning a Conservative majority of two.
The borough, where Treasury chief secretary Mr Michael Portillo is an MP,
had been Conservative-held for more than 25 years. Liberal Democrats were
not a factor.
Ealing was particularly humiliating for the Conservatives, after they had
confidently predicted victory in the borough on the back of memories of past
Labour administrations. Instead, they lost about 20 seats, including that of
their leader, and Labour was able to crow that it was now trusted in a way
that the Conservatives were not.
But the 'London effect' seemed alive and well in Lambeth, where the Labour
council has been accused of making unlawful payments of more than Pounds
20m. Early results showed the Tories had gained three seats from Labour,
including that of the Labour leader, Mr Steve Whaley. The council seemed set
to be hung.
But in Kingston upon Thames the Liberal Democrats took control after a
straight fight with the Conservatives.
The Conservatives took limited solace from retaining Wandsworth, which has
been lauded by the national party as a 'flagship' council for its policies
for more than a decade. However, losing it would have been almost
unthinkably humiliating for the Conservatives, and Labour campaigners had
been careful to discount any suggestion that they could win the borough.
In Tower Hamlets, much attention focused on the far right British National
Party.
The first result involving a BNP candidate showed a substantial increase in
the far-right party's support since the last municipal elections 4 years
ago.
Although he did not win a seat the candidate achieved 653 votes compared
with the party's 93 in 1990.
But British National Party councillor Mr Derek Beackon, who won the
far-right party's first-ever council seat in a Tower Hamlets council
by-election last september, was defeated last night.
He increased his vote from 1,480 to 2,041 but three Labour candidates in the
Millwall ward all polled more than 3,000 each after a powerful campaign
involving national Labour party figures.
Tower Hamlet council's majority Liberal Democrat group, badly divided over
the ramifications of the BNP by-election win, lost control of the council to
Labour.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Tories fail disastrously in Birmingham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservatives failed disastrously last night in their attempt to win
their main target outside London - Birmingham City Council, the UK's largest
metropolitan authority.
A succession of Conservative ministers had visited the city, and Labour had
only to drop four seats to lose control.
Instead, in an election covering 40 wards, the party won two seats from the
Conservatives but lost one to the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives made
no gains at all.
With all the results counted Labour had 62 seats, the Conservatives 40 and
the Liberal Democrats 14. Labour thus has an overall majority of eight.
Mrs Theresa Stewart, who became the Labour leader of the council last
autumn, attributed the victory to an unpopular government, responsive
council services and excellent candidates.
Labour penetrated Conservative strongholds with its two gains. One was in
prosperous and leafy Edgbaston, which has never gone Labour before. The
other was in Quinton, where last month Labour upset the political odds with
a by-election victory.
Turnout was patchy, ranging from 29.6 per cent in the inner city and
Asian-dominated ward of Sparkbrook, to 50.9 per cent in the southern ward of
Sheldon.
This reflected the generally low-key nature of the campaign, in which the
Conservatives had sought to tar Labour with the 'loony left' brush and to
win votes by promising better management of council affairs.
Also in the west Midlands, Labour gained control of Wolverhampton, thanks to
a net gain of two seats from the Conservatives who had targeted the council.
Elsewhere, however, Liberal Democrats were the biggest winners. To an extent
this reflected the parties' differing bases in the last equivalent elections
four years ago, when the Liberal Democrats did badly with only 18.5 per cent
of the vote outside London, while Labour did exceptionally, with 43.8 per
cent.
The Conservatives, who in 1990 hit 'bedrock' support of 30.2 per cent, made
only one gain, in Tandridge, Surrey.
Liberal Democrats celebrated a psychologically important result in the Kent
town of Tunbridge Wells, with a gain of five seats from the Conservatives.
Only 16 seats were up for election. This left the town, a traditional Tory
bastion, with only 24 Conservative councillors, balanced by 20 Liberal
Democrats, three Labour councillors and one independent. This appeared to
boost the Liberal Democrat claim that it could pose a genuine threat to the
Conservatives in the south.
Liberal Democrats won overall control of Eastleigh, Hampshire, which will be
the scene next month of the by-election caused by the death of the
Conservative MP Mr Stephen Milligan. However, four gains were not enough to
win Weymouth &amp; Portland in Dorset for the Liberal Democrats, which has
suffered from defence cuts. It remains under no overall control.
Congleton, in Cheshire, also saw the Liberal Democrats take overall control,
having taken three wards from Labour and four from the Tories. The council
had previously been hung.
Liberal Democrats also took Bath in Somerset, Colchester and Rochford, both
in Essex, St Albans in Hertfordshire and Winchester in Hampshire - all
targeted and previously under no overall control - and Mole Valley in
Surrey. Liberal Democrats also inflicted heavy losses on Labour in
traditional strongholds such as Southampton without wresting con-trol.
In spite of its high base of seats from 1990, Labour managed a gain from the
Conservatives in Welwyn Hatfield, and from no overall control in West
Lancashire.
Two gains each for Labour and the Liberal Democrats were enough to deprive
the Conservatives of overall control of Hertsmere in Hertfordshire.
Liberal Democrats also scored a number of gains from Labour in northern
authorities, robbing them of control in Kirklees, Oldham and Pendle.
Labour celebrated a morale-boosting victory in Derby where it won enough
wards to take overall control.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: A mathematical conundrum for
Hillingdon's voters - Campaign Diary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strange goings-on in west London, where Labour put up three candidates in
the Hillingdon East ward. Nothing odd about that, except that Hillingdon
East elects only two councillors. Two of the hopefuls - Walter Kennedy and
Len Smith - were described on the ballot paper as 'Labour party' nominees,
while the third, Herbert Binding, as an 'official Labour' candidate. John
Bartlett, Labour's Hillingdon agent, put the phone down when asked about the
discrepancy. 'I don't answer questions about the elections,' he said. Less
touchy officials said Binding was asked to stand by party HQ after it
refused to endorse Kennedy because of alleged links with Militant Labour,
the former Militant Tendency. The local party, which ran Hillingdon with a
1-vote majority, refused to disown Kennedy, a councillor since 1990. There
may be more confusion. Kennedy's party membership will be reviewed shortly
by Labour's National Constitutional Commission which takes a dim view of
Militant activity.
* * *
Nobody emerges terribly well from the equally strange, but potentially
tragic, goings-on north of the border, where two Labour MPs and a
Conservative dignitary have received death threats. Tony Worthington, MP for
Clydebank &amp; Milngavie, was born in Lincolnshire but has lived in Scotland
for years. He was warned to 'leave Scotland or die'. George Robertson,
shadow Scottish secretary, received a warning inscribed 'Traitor Scot RIP',
and Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservative party, also
received a threat. The warnings, taken seriously by the police, purport to
come from a shadowy organisation called Flame, and appear to be targeted at
unionists and Englishmen. Some non-Scots living in the Highlands have
recently received hoax letter bombs from Flame. Unfortunately, Labour's
knee-jerk response was to urge the Scottish National party, probably
Europe's most peaceful and least racialist nationalist movement, to
disassociate itself from the threats. The SNP justifiably called that a
blatant attempt to make political capital out of a dangerous situation.
* * *
Selective memory is a vital political tool. But it was a bit brazen of
Islington's Liberal Democrats to claim in election literature that the local
council has been Labour-run for 20 years. What about the Social Democratic
party administration of 1981-82? It must have slipped the collective Lib Dem
memory - rather like the SDP itself.
* * *
Spare a thought for Liberal Democrat campaigner Doris Ford, a South Tyneside
councillor, who will have a painful permanent reminder of the local
elections. Canvassing in the village of Boldon Colliery, she posted a
leaflet through the letter box of an apparently empty house, only to have
the tip of a middle finger bitten off by a dog. A neighbour retrieved the
fingertip, but it could not be sewn back on. In spite of her injury, the
doughty Mrs Ford, a 69-year-old retired publican and dog owner, was out
yesterday encouraging potential Lib Dem voters. Labour has a majority of 50
on the 60-seat council, but the Lib Dems hope to give their rivals a nasty
nip. Mrs Ford has not lost her sense of humour. 'Lots of people have asked
me if it was a Labour dog,' she says.
* * *
It seems that Ken Clarke, the beer-drinking, football-watching chancellor,
really does have those man-of-the-people tastes to which Tory spin-doctors
are always drawing attention. Clarke issued a list of food prices this week,
intended to show how much more things would cost if inflation had continued
at the average rate in Labour's last four years in power. The list is full
of things such as sliced bread, sausages, baked beans, instant coffee and
teabags. By chance, Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, also
released a shopping list, designed to show what could be bought with the
Pounds 40 difference between average council tax bills in Labour and Tory
areas. No baked beans on Straw's list, but he won't starve. His modernist
menu includes wholemeal bread, prosciutto, tagliatelle, Costa Rican coffee,
extra virgin olive oil, carrot and coriander pate, Somerset Camembert, fresh
ravioli with salmon . . .
* * *
Why are there no Conservative election posters in all those grand
Westminster houses where Tory MPs have their London homes? Teresa Gorman,
the rightwing MP for Billericay, put it down initially to the tardiness of
deliveries by local Conservatives to her Lord North Street terrace, hard by
the Houses of Parliament. But further inquiries suggest a more basic reason:
Westminster South Conservative association didn't print any. Donald Stewart,
the agent, says posters are a waste of time in a borough where most of the
passers-by on any given street are likely to live somewhere else. The
association has distributed leaflets displaying the candidates' names and
the Conservative colours, but not many supporters bother to display them,
says Stewart. The results will tell us whether Westminster Tories are shy or
just over-confident.
* * *
Mike Summersby, leader of the Conservative group on Newcastle City Council,
is clearly something of a dragon slayer. Not content with fighting a losing
battle with Newcastle's overwhelmingly strong Labour group, Summersby is
also a campaigner for proportional representation in council elections - a
subject which gets short shrift from Conservative Central Office. Undaunted,
Summersby points out that the Conservatives took 30 per cent of the vote at
the last elections - in 1992 - for a return of six seats, or 8 per cent of
the total. Labour took 44 per cent of the vote, but picked up 61 of the 78
seats, or 78 per cent. So complete is Labour's monopoly of power, says
Summersby, that Conservatives are not even allowed a turn at being mayor.
Given the hostility of the Conservative hierarchy, Summersby has few hopes
for a rapid conversion to PR. But his hand may be strengthened by the
procession of Tory councillors going into opposition, some in areas which
have been blue for decades.
* * *
Hands up anyone who understands the council tax row. One of the features of
a generally lacklustre local elections campaign has been the statistical
dispute between John Gummer, environment secretary, and Jack Straw, his
Labour shadow, over the size of bills in Labour and Tory areas. Labour got
in first with a claim that average bills from Labour councils are Pounds 40
lower than in Conservative areas. Meaningless, says Gummer, who points out
that averages simply demonstrate that houses in Conservative-controlled
areas are generally more expensive than in Labour areas. Gummer prefers a
band-for-band comparison, which works in the Tories' favour. Gummer won the
intellectual battle, because his figures make more sense. But Labour's
campaign team think Straw won the political campaign, if only because he
succeeded in confusing everybody.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Rotherham runs true to form
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour last night held Rotherham with a reduced but rock-solid majority in a
by-election result that augured badly for the Conservatives.
The Tory candidate, Mr Nick Gibb, polled only 2,649 votes and was pushed
firmly into third place by the Liberal Democrat candidate. The Tory share of
the vote plummeted to 9.9 per cent from 23.7 per cent at the general
election in April 1992.
In previous elections, the Conservative vote in this recession-hit South
Yorkshire coal and steel town had never fallen below 8,500.
The turnout was low, however, at only 44 per cent, compared with nearly 72
per cent two years ago.
In last night's poll, caused by the death of Mr Jimmy Boyce, Mr Denis
MacShane, a former journalist, easily held the seat for Labour with a
majority of 6,954 - down from 17,561 at the general election.
Labour's share of the vote fell by more than 8 percentage points from 63.9
per cent to 55.6.
A feature of the poll was the stronger-than-expected performance of
Screaming Lord Sutch and the Monster Raving Loony party, which won 1,114
votes - its highest tally ever and only 1,500 votes fewer than the
Conservative candidate.
For the Liberal Democrats, Mr David Wildgoose made significant headway,
lifting the party from third to a distant second with 7,958 votes. This
represented 29.7 per cent of the vote, against 12.3 per cent two years ago.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Historic Labour victory in Croydon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour campaigners in Croydon were ecstatic last night after the party took
control of the council from the Conservatives for the first time in the
borough's 120-year history.
In one of the most devastating results for the Tories in the local
elections, Labour won six marginal wards in the south London borough and
looks set to have a 10-seat majority on the council.
Shortly after midnight Sir Peter Bowness, who has led Croydon council for
the past 18 years, acknowledged defeat. 'Our vote did not collapse,' he
said, but he added: 'It's a bad result for the Conservative party and does
give a sense of loss and foreboding.'
Ms Mary Walker, a former union official who is set to become council leader,
said it was a historic achievement for the Labour party and a referendum on
Mr John Major's government.
'I just didn't think we would do this well,' she said, against a background
of cheering crowds. 'Stealing Croydon from the Tories confirms Labour's
supremacy in the leafy boroughs of south London.'
Labour campaigners said last night that their victory had all the hallmarks
of a remarkable blow for the government.
The borough, with a population of 350,000, is the largest in London. Sir
Peter's administration has remained popular throughout the campaign,
underlining that Mr Major's difficulties had played a large part in the Tory
defeat.
In the early part of the evening Labour had been cautious of its prospects.
But at 12.20am a succession of Labour candidates walked on to the platform
at Croydon's Fairfield Hall waving their fists in jubilation.
'I simply can't believe it,' said an exhausted Mr Jeff Dixon, who has
masterminded Labour's campaign. 'We have won every target we went for.'
However, Ms Walker, who will now take charge of a Pounds 235m annual budget,
seemed to take victory in her stride. 'I'm not particularly daunted about
the job,' she said, running through a series of meetings that she has
already planned to hold this weekend.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Rain damps high turnout hopes - Main
parties refuse to be cowed / Polling off to sluggish start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's bad weather weakened the chances of a strong turnout in the
local elections.
More than half the nation's total electorate had the opportunity to vote in
contests for 32 London boroughs, nine Scottish regions and three Scottish
island councils - where all councillors faced re-election - and in 36
metropolitan councils and 114 English and four Welsh shire districts where
only a third of council seats were contested.
In all, around 15,000 candidates ran for about 5,000 seats in the biggest
test of public opinion since the general election two years ago.
But by late afternoon, the Association of London Authorities said turnout in
the capital - where Labour hoped to make several gains - was still low and
affected by the bad weather. Partisan posters in London windows remained
almost totally absent throughout the campaign, leading many canvassers to
fear that the elections had failed to ignite public interest.
It was a similar story in Birmingham, where the Tories hoped to take
control. Leaden skies and drizzle cloaked Birmingham for most of the day,
deterring early polling. The initial impression of party officials was that
voting was slow, although not painfully so for local elections. By 5pm, one
polling station in Edgbaston, a marginal ward, had drawn in only 250 of a
potential 950 voters.
The general prediction was that the turnout would be between 35 per cent and
40 per cent. The slow polling was subject to contrary interpretations:
either that there was not a massive anti-government protest vote, or that
Conservatives were so fed up that they had stayed at home.
In London, also, Conservative campaigners wanted a big turnout as they
feared their greatest danger lay in usually stalwart Tory voters protesting
against the government by staying at home rather than voting for an
opposition party. In Croydon, which Labour had made a significant target,
Tory campaigners believed the election would be 'won and lost in the last
two hours' as their canvassers tried to take residents to the polling
stations.
All three parties took the risk of predicting that they would do well. Sir
Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, predicted net gains for the party.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, believed his party would make considerable
gains in spite of cautious talk from the party's local government spokesman,
Mr Jack Straw, at the beginning of the campaign.
Meanwhile, Mr Paddy Ashdown said the Liberal Democrats expected an 'historic
breakthrough', with local activists predicting high-profile captures in
Kingston and Harrow.
Few authorities expected significant logistical problems counting the votes,
but Lambeth, a leftwing Labour stronghold in south London, expected to be
the last to declare its results. Its chances of a speedy count were hampered
by a range of fringe-left candidates, along with candidates styling
themselves 'ex-lecturer in community education' and 'official no-nonsense
Conservative candidate'.
Two London authorities will not even start counting until this morning.
Kensington and Chelsea is regarded by Mr Tony Travers, director of the
London School of Economics' greater London group as the Conservatives'
single safest London stronghold in spite of a small pocket of safe Labour
wards in the north of the borough.
The other is Westminster, rocked by allegations of political
'gerrymandering' earlier this year. Local Labour politicians have
steadfastly refused to predict that they will take the borough because they
are scared of raising expectations, but some council officials believe a
Labour victory is possible.
One Labour campaigner was more sanguine, suggesting that voters would need
'the moral fibre of the angel Gabriel', to vote against the Conservatives in
an area with such a low council tax - although the party claims that
Westminster's figure is only so low because of favouritism in awarding
government grants.
Other councils which will not start counting until this morning are
Grampian, Orkney, Shetland and Strathclyde in Scotland, and South
Cambridgeshire.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: E London is urged to reject BNP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Voters on the Isle of Dogs, east London, yesterday came under strong
pressure to reject the far-right British National Party as they went to the
polls in an unusually tense atmosphere.
An increase in racial violence since the BNP won its first local authority
seat - in a Tower Hamlets council by-election on the island last September -
led to voting taking place under conditions of tight security. Large numbers
of police were visible near polling stations and on the streets of the
island.
Fears of intimidation led to a measure remarkable in a British election  -
legal monitors at polling stations. Liberty, the civil liberties
organisation, took the decision to station a team of 30 lawyers on the Isle
of Dogs after complaints by Asian residents that they had faced abuse and
threats during the by-election.
Party representatives, community workers and clergy yesterday all offered to
accompany voters who might fear intimidation.
The Rt Rev Richard Chartres, Anglican bishop of Stepney, and the Rt Rev
Victor Guazzelli, Roman Catholic bishop of East London, joined a vigil for
racial harmony at the Isle of Dogs parish church which included Christian,
Jewish and Islamic prayers. The bishops were among east London clergy who
put their names to a strongly-worded statement expressing concern at the
BNP, but adding: 'As church leaders in the East End we feel for all the
people of the area and their disillusionment with the political process,
which so far seems to have failed them.'
Part of the reason for the BNP finding acceptance, said the statement, was
that Tower Hamlets - one of the poorest areas in Europe - suffered high
unemployment and lack of housing. There was a stark contrast between office
development in Docklands and poverty and deprivation in the community.
The editors of the East End's two newspapers urged their readers to consider
the potentially negative consequences of voting BNP.
Mr Tom Duncan, editor of the Docklands Recorder, wrote: 'Vote if you feel
you must for the British National Party - but do so in the knowledge that
you are voting for people who have nothing to offer you other than hatred
and even more misery.'
As the polls closed and police reinforcements moved in, two fears hung over
east London. The more immediate was that the BNP might strengthen its
position, provoking further racial disharmony and violence in a borough
where a third of the population is from ethnic minorities.
The second was that the BNP would be resoundingly defeated - and that the
government and national political parties would see last year's by-election
result as an aberration with no lasting lessons. The problems facing east
London were 'beyond the capacity of local resources to solve,' warned the
clergy statement.

If the Conservatives do lose in Westminster, it won't be the fault of Sir
Edward Heath, the former prime minister. Sir Edward, who knows all about
close elections, came to the aid of the party yesterday afternoon, rushing
off to the polling station, and missing the beginning of an arts debate in
consequence. Every vote counts.
Reports that Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, is emerging as a
front-runner to replace Jacques Delors as president of the European
Commission caused palpitations in Downing Street, where Sir Leon Brittan is
regarded as a much more acceptable candidate than the arch-federalist
Dehaene. But the disclosure came as no surprise to readers of The European
Journal, monthly magazine of the European Foundation, the Euro-phobic
organisation chaired by arch Euro-sceptic Bill Cash, MP. The journal,
clearly well plugged into the drift of federalist thinking, tipped Dehaene a
whole month ago. Only trouble is, no-one seems to have noticed.

FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Discord in the shires hampers councils
review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Voters went to the polls in 114 shire districts in England and Wales
yesterday not knowing whether the councillors they elected would ever be
asked to face re-election for the same council.
In four years, if government plans go according to timetable, most of the
district councils will have been abolished - along with the county councils,
which control education and social services - to be replaced by all-purpose
unitary authorities.
But developments in the last month have made it clear that this process will
not be easy. Counties and districts disagree fundamentally over how the
reorganisation should be carried out.
Most districts want small unitary authorities, ideally based on old district
boundaries. Meanwhile, counties tend to favour either large unitary
authorities or a continuation of the present two-tier system, perhaps with
some minor reforms to clarify responsibility in areas where local citizens
are confused. However, the government denies that this option is allowed
under the legislation.
Disagreements could seriously delay the review. The process of reviewing
counties has been slower than scheduled, and the government has announced
firm proposals for only two - Cleveland and the Isle of Wight.
Under the government's current guidance, the Local Government Commission,
chaired by Sir John Banham, the former CBI director-general, must give
priority to reorganisation plans that have been agreed by all local
politicians. The aim of this is to accelerate the review.
During April, councils in 26 counties submitted proposals for restructuring
to Sir John. He is due to announce a series of proposals - including a
favoured option and at least one alternative - for 13 in the second week of
June, and for a second 13 in July.
But in none of the 26 did the county agree with all the districts, and in
most counties the districts disagreed with each other. Under district plans,
the 234 authorities involved, including counties and districts, would be
replaced by 130 unitaries. Counties favour a variety of different plans.
Ill-feeling between the local authority associations has intensified over
the past 12 months, and boiled over in April when the Association of County
Councils received a leaked copy of the Association of District Councils'
lobbying strategy for the review and passed it to the press. The strategy
suggested concentration on forming small unitaries to the exclusion of
almost all else.
The implications of such strong rivalry in a supposedly consensual process
have not been lost on the government.
One official for the commission said that both counties and districts had
behaved 'increasingly childishly', and suggested they would need to show
more realism if the review was to be a success.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                      AUTHORITIES AT LOGGERHEADS
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposals Sir John and the commission are studying with preliminary
decisions due next month are:
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Berkshire: county wants four unitaries, districts prefer five
Bedfordshire: districts want three unitaries, county wants a unitary
county
Cambridgeshire: county wants two unitaries, districts four
Cheshire; districts want six unitaries, county prefers existing
two-tier system
Cumbria: districts aim for five unitaries, county wants two-tier system
(with some transfers of responsibilities)
Devon: districts want six unitaries, county prefers unitary Plymouth
and a two-tier system for the rest of county
Hampshire: districts want five unitaries, county prefers 'improved'
two-tier status quo
Kent: districts want seven unitaries, county wants improved status quo
Lancashire: districts want nine unitaries, county wants improved status
quo
Leicestershire: county wants improved status quo, districts disagree
between unitary and two-tier
Notts: county wants improved two-tier system, while all eight districts
want unitary status
Oxfordshire: county wants one unitary, districts want four
Staffordshire: county prefers unitary Stoke-on-Trent with two tiers
elsewhere, districts want six unitaries
Suffolk: county wants improved status quo, districts want four unitaries
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The commission's reaction to the remaining 13 councils is due in July:
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Buckinghamshire: county wants status quo, districts prefer four
unitaries
Dorset: county wants three unitaries, districts four
Durham: districts want four unitaries, county prefers unitary
Darlington and two-tier elsewhere
East Sussex: districts want 3 to 5 unitaries, county suggests range of
options including 3 unitaries
Essex: districts want 8 to 9 unitaries, county prefers improved status
quo
Hereford &amp; Worcester: districts want 6 unitaries, county wants unitary
Herefordshire, two-tier Worcestershire
Norfolk: districts want 5 unitaries, county wants status quo
Northants: county wants improved two-tiers, districts want four
unitaries
Northumberland: county and 5 of 6 districts want status quo
Surrey: county wants improved status quo, districts want 5 to 6
unitaries
Warwickshire: county wants improved two-tier, districts want 3 unitaries
West Sussex: county wants improved two-tier, districts 3 to 4 unitaries
Wiltshire: county wants unitary Thamesdown (which includes Swindon) and
two-tier the rest, districts want 3 unitaries

The Association of British Travel Agents is launching a crackdown on tour
operators and travel agents - including the use of private detectives - to
safeguard customers against companies going bankrupt.
Members voted 9-1 at the association's annual meeting last weekend to give
the secretariat more powers to look into companies' accounts and activities
at any time - for example, if it suspected a company of engaging in
activities of which it was not aware.
Previously it had to wait until the end of each financial year to examine
accounts.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Go-ahead likely soon for Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A government go-ahead within the next few weeks for a new television channel
for the UK looks increasingly likely, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The Independent Television Commission hopes to be able to take the decision
on Channel 5 at its meeting on May 16.
The government is pursuing what it sees as the ideal solution - setting up
Channel 5 using existing analogue technology without prejudicing in any
significant way the future of digital television.
Following a ministerial meeting last week, the Radio Regulatory Agency has
been asked to carry out further work to ensure that this is practicable. The
agency is being helped by NTL, the privatised former transmission and
engineering arm of the old Independent Broadcasting Authority.
It is believed NTL will report that a middle way is possible, although
compromises may be needed.
The old Channel 5 plan envisaged coverage of 70 per cent of the UK
population. This may have to be reduced by a few percentage points to ensure
that adequate frequencies are retained for the development of new digital
services.
The plans also involved making two channels available - 35 and 37. One
possibility being examined would be to concentrate Channel 5 on channel 35
and leave channel 37 as a core of frequencies reserved for the development
of digital television.
Three potential bidders have declared an interest in Channel 5 - NBC, the US
network, Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group and a consortium linking Time
Warner, MAI and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Students spurn accountancy jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of students entering chartered accountancy has slumped to the
lowest level in 20 years, a report on education within the profession says.
There were just 4,074 trainees with the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales joining firms in 1992-93, reducing steadily from a peak
of 7,063 in 1988-89. The figure was last this low in 1974.
Mr Phil Armitage, director of education and training for the institute, said
the decline reflected a reduction in demand for new entrants by the UK's
accountancy firms, which have been cutting numbers since the start of the
recession.
The decline poses a considerable threat to the finances of the institute,
which relies for a substantial proportion of its income on new recruits.
More than 90 per cent of entrants were graduates, and 61.5 per cent joined
firms with more than 100 partners. Women comprised 37 per cent of the intake
and 9 per cent were non-European by ethnic origin.
'There is absolutely no shortage of people who would like to become
chartered accountants,' said Mr Armitage. 'There are a good number of
applications for each place.'
Mr Armitage said the quality of student entrants had increased, so that 92
per cent of those taking the final PE2 exams eventually qualified for
membership of the institute. He expected demand to rise in the current year
by about 5 per cent.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Computer company bids to run Crest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoskyns, one of the UK's leading computer services companies, is to compete
with the London Stock Exchange to become the independent supplier of full
operational facilities for the Crest paperless share settlement system.
The Bank of England, which is overseeing the development phase of Crest, has
said there will be a role for an operator of the system but has not spelt
out whether that role is technological, administrative or both. The Stock
Exchange was rebuffed this week in its request for a significant minority
stake in Crest but the Bank said there was a good case for awarding it the
operator's contract.
However, several groups of prospective Crest users have expressed concern
about appointing the exchange as operator, saying it may use its role to the
advantage of its own members.
It is thought that, in addition to Hoskyns and the exchange, potential
competitors for the Crest contract include American Telephone and Telegraph,
British Telecommunications and EDS.
Yesterday Hoskyns released results of a survey of 27 prospective Crest
shareholders showing that 19 of them preferred an independent operator or
staff of a newly formed CrestCo. Only three preferred the Stock Exchange and
another three preferred the Bank of England.
Mr Ian Jackson, head of Hoskyns' financial sector operations, said the
company was qualified to run Crest because of its track record in managing
computer systems for financial services groups. Its customer list in the UK
includes TSB, the London Clearing House, the European Clearing House
Operation and National Westminster Bank.
Hoskyns is one of the UK's oldest computing services companies. The French
company Cap Gemini Sogeti, Europe's largest computing services group, took a
majority stake in the company in 1990 and now has the entire equity.
Hoskyns, along with EDS of the US, was the pioneer of facilities management,
the business of managing and running a customer's computer operations to an
agreed level of service for a fee.

THE US must go further in opening home markets to European goods and
investment if it is to live up to its self-claimed title of 'still the most
open trading nation in the world,' the European Commission said yesterday.
In an annual report on US trade barriers to European business, the
Commission highlighted 'unreasonable' application of anti-dumping and other
duty measures against exports from the European Union, and increasing
application of domestic trade legislation to companies operating outside the
US, as particular obstacles to European industry and investors.
'All these measures are anathema to an open world trading system which
should be based on one set of negotiated multilateral rules and procedures
fairly applied to all contracting parties in the Gatt,' the Commission said.
The main barriers highlighted in the report include:
Growing use of unilateral or bilateral trade measures, in particular renewal
of Super 301 legislation, giving wide discretion to act over trade practices
deemed unfair to US commerce.
Extraterritorial application of national trade provisions which clash with
trading partners' sovereignty and lead to insoluble legal conflicts. The
report cites the Cuban Democracy Act as an example.
Use of national security considerations to justify curbs on trade and
investment such as a 20 per cent limit on foreign investment in radio
communications.
Discrimination against non-US controlled companies for certain public
contracts tendered at Federal and state level, and 'buy America' laws.
High tariffs on textiles, clothing, footwear, tableware and glassware.
Tax legislation such as state unitary taxation and car taxes which are the
subject of a Gatt panel request by the EU.
Multiplicity of standards at federal, state and municipal level as well as
protectionist labelling requirements.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US is threatening to tear up its bilateral aviation agreement with the
UK in frustration at the lack of progress in negotiations between the two
countries over a new agreement.
'The possibility of renunciation will be one of the tools that will be on
the table,' Mr Federico Pena, the US transportation secretary, told a
congressional committee yesterday.
'We see it as an option of last resort, but it is an option,' Mr Pena said.
The US walked out of talks with the UK last year in protest at what it
viewed as the inadequacy of British proposals to increase US airlines'
access to coveted landing slots at London's Heathrow airport.
The UK, in exchange, wants greater access to the US domestic market, and in
particular an easing of restrictions on foreign ownership of US airlines.
This is important to British Airways, the principal UK carrier, because of
its large investment in USAir.
A US transportation department official said yesterday no talks had been
held since December, and none were scheduled.
Renunciation of an aviation agreement is not unprecedented - France, for
example, renounced its agreement with the US last year - and need not lead
to any immediate disruption of air travel between the two countries. It
would, however, raise the likelihood of a serious trade crisis between the
two countries.
Mr Daniel Kasper, an aviation expert said the US-UK row was dispiriting
because both countries shared an interest in much broader liberalisation of
air traffic worldwide.
'Instead of looking at the existing pie, the parties need to focus on the
expanding pie that would be available to them,' he said.

FT  06 MAY 94 / World Trade News: ABB grant bid opposed by GE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A bid by Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's biggest electrical engineering company,
to participate in a US energy department programme to develop the next
generation of turbines is running into opposition from General Electric, its
largest US competitor.
The dispute has set off a wider controversy in Washington about a concept
called 'conditional national treatment', under which subsidiaries of foreign
companies are treated differently from US companies depending on conditions
in their home countries. The issue has been discussed in US government
inter-agency groups and may soon get an airing by the Clinton cabinet.
GE and Westinghouse, another US power engineering company, have already won
approval to take part in the programme, under which the energy department
provides matching grants - in this case around Dollars 4-5m (Pounds
2.7-Pounds 3.4m) - to participating companies.
Although the initial funding of such projects may be small, companies like
ABB believe it is important that they are not excluded from key research
because they are foreign companies, said Mrs Nancy McLernon, a spokesman for
the Organisation of International Investment.
Under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, there are two criteria in awarding
grants: an economic benefits test, to determine that the award will benefit
the US, and a reciprocity test.
The latter requires that a company's home government allow participation in
similar programmes and protects intellectual property rights.
General Electric has circulated a paper implying that the Swedish-Swiss ABB
should not be allowed to participate because its home governments do not
protect intellectual property rights.
The paper also suggests that if ABB were involved in the programme, it would
use the fruits of the research not to create employment in the US but to
strengthen its technological capacity in Europe.
ABB already has a substantial presence in the US, where it has expanded
through acquisitions of companies including Combustion Engineering, a
leading maker of boilers for power generation. In the Americas as a whole,
ABB had sales of Dollars 5.6bn last year and employs about 35,000 people,
many of them in the US.
It is understood that the US Energy Secretary failed to determine that GE
and Westinghouse were eligible for the scheme on the basis of the economic
benefits test. That process is now underway retro-actively.

Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs

on Chinese membership of the world trade body, writes Frances Williams in
Geneva.
During his visit Mr Sutherland is due to meet President Jiang Zemin, Prime
Minister Li Peng and top trade officials. There is widespread backing among
Gatt members for China to be readmitted to the organisation, which it left
in 1950, but most western governments are insisting on special terms and
Washington's position remains equivocal.

FT  06 MAY 94 / World Trade News: China looks beyond MFN horizon - Beijing
sets sights on Gatt accession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China, signalling confidence that the US will renew its Most Favoured Nation
trading status, yesterday urged Washington to speed up negotiations on
Beijing's bid to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Long Yongtu, Beijing's chief Gatt negotiator, said in an interview that
the US should follow the European Union and adopt a 'practical and
realistic' approach to China's accession to the world trade body.
China and the US are due to resume bilateral talks on the Gatt issue in
Washington early next month, just after the deadline for President Bill
Clinton's decision on whether to renew China's preferential trade access to
the US market.
Beijing and Washington have been at loggerheads for months over the Clinton
administration's demand that China improve its behaviour on human rights to
secure MFN renewal. But this week, President Clinton softened the US line,
saying that withdrawing MFN status would harm both China and the US.
Mr Long's call for a new push on China's Gatt accession shows Beijing is
looking beyond the MFN decision to the far-reaching question of China's
formal reintegration into the world economy. China is anxious to be a
founder member of the new World Trade Organisation, to be formed out of
Gatt, when the Uruguay Round agreement comes into force next year.
The Chinese official praised the EU for what he called its constructive
approach to China's Gatt application, explicitly contrasting European and
American attitudes. He said a draft protocol for Chinese membership
presented when Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner, visited Beijing
in February contained 'many positive elements'.
The protocol includes provision for a transitional phase after China
re-enters Gatt, safeguards against sudden surges of Chinese imports, and
arrangements for a regular review of Chinese compliance with the trade
body's rules.
Mr Long, a vice-minister in the foreign trade ministry, said China was
prepared to negotiate a transitional period - to the end of the century -
during which it would remove most non-tariff barriers, align its technical
standards with international norms and make its currency, the renminbi,
fully convertible.
He added, however, that there should be no need for further special reviews
of China's performance after the end of the transitional period. On
safeguards, Beijing reserved the right to retaliate against attempts to
'single out' China for trade penalties, by withdrawing some of its
concessions on market access.
Further negotiations with the EU on these issues are due later this month,
before the next meeting of Gatt's China working party in Geneva towards the
end of June. Mr Long stressed that China's attempt to rejoin Gatt was 'part
and parcel' of its economic reforms, but that there was a limit to
concessions China was prepared to make.
'Western negotiators should understand that China's transition from a
planned economy is a great experiment,' he said. 'If you ask for things to
be done immediately, we have to say No. We're not looking for Gatt entry at
any price - at the cost of social stability, or of throwing a lot of workers
out of jobs. 'If the US can also find the practical, realistic approach
adopted by the EU, we can make progress.'
During the eight years of negotiations on China's Gatt membership, the US
has generally taken the lead. But recently, with US policy-makers
preoccupied by the MFN issue, the Europeans have assumed a higher profile.
Last year, the US notched up a record Dollars 22.8bn bilateral trade deficit
with China, while the EU's deficit with China fell from Dollars 12bn to
Dollars 10bn.
Mr Long acknowledged that the Gatt negotiations had been overshadowed by the
MFN dispute, but expressed hope that the two issues could soon be separated.
'Trade is trade, and politics is politics,' he said.
He said it was in the world's interests as well as Beijing's to ensure that
China joined the World Trade Organisation at its inception. The WTO, he
said, would be 'incomplete' without a country containing one fifth of the
world's population and its 11th largest trading nation.
'We are trying to get into Gatt not because we see immediate economic
benefits but because we want to make our economic system compatible with the
world trade regime, so that foreign businesses have more confidence in our
economy,' he stressed. 'If we really wanted to damage the world trading
order, why would we bother trying to get into Gatt? It will put a
straitjacket on us.'
A European diplomat in Beijing agreed the EU had won points with Beijing by
coming forward with its own Gatt proposals. There was no fundamental
difference between Brussels and Washington on market access, transparency of
import rules, and intellectual property rights. 'We are competitors, but we
all have the same interest: breaking open the Chinese market,' he said.

Piaggio, the Italian scooter manufacturer, aims to produce 500,000 motor
scooters a year for the growing Chinese market by 1998, through a local
joint venture set up near the port of Guangzhou.
The privately owned Italian company announced yesterday that the Chinese
authorities had approved the venture, which will require a total investment
of Dollars 100m (Pounds 68.4m) up to 1997 by Piaggio and its partners,
backed by international banks.
The new venture, Piaggio Lyman Foshan, is 75 per cent controlled by Hong
Kong-registered Piaggio Lyman China, and 25 per cent by Fosti Motorcycle of
China. The Hong Kong company is itself 51 per cent-owned by the Piaggio
parent company and 49 per cent by Satya Djaya Group of Indonesia.
Piaggio should export 40,000 vehicles this year to China. The new joint
venture in Foshan, in the province of Guangdong, will produce about 7,000
scooters this year, and 100,000 next year.

FT  06 MAY 94 / World Trade News: India warns over labour controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Pranab Mukherjee, India's commerce minister, has warned the US and other
industrialised countries against putting plans for controls on cheap labour
on the agenda of international trade talks.
Suggestions that developing countries should be penalised for providing
workers with inferior social and other benefits than industrialised
countries amounted to 'introducing protectionism through the back door',
said Mr Mukherjee this week.
Mr Mukherjee was referring to proposals advanced by the US to insert 'social
clauses' into the brief of the newly-formed World Trade Organisation, which
will next year replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in
accordance with the Uruguay Round pact signed on Marrakesh last month.
American and European politicians are concerned that the high social welfare
payments made in industrialised countries reduce their competitiveness
vis-a-vis the Third World. Mr Mukherjee said: 'It raises doubts about
whether some of the industrialised countries are serious about liberalising
trade.'
The social clause proposals made it more difficult for the ruling
Congress(I) party in India and other developing country governments to enact
legislation to bring the Marrakesh agreement into effect.
These problems are particularly acute in India, where there is a long
tradition of economic self-sufficiency and of hostility to foreign business
interests. Opposition parties - including the right-wing Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata party and the parties of the left - have seized the Gatt
accord as a stick with which to beat the government. They have taken their
case on to the streets, calling rallies in Delhi which were attended by
hundreds of thousands of people.
The opposition parties have tried to whip up support by lumping together
criticism of the Gatt accord with attacks on the government's economic
liberalisation. They have exploited fears of Indian farmers, some of whom
have been led to believe the Gatt accord threatens agricultural subsidies.
(In fact poor countries are exempted from the subsidy-cutting clauses of the
agreement.)
Mr Mukherjee said the protests would not stop the government from getting
legislation through parliament. The opposition was trying to build support
before state elections later this year. He hoped the opposition parties
would eventually accept the wisdom of the Gatt deal, despite their public
posturing.

The Mexican government and Zapatista rebels said yesterday they would reopen
peace talks aimed at formally ending the conflict in the southern state of
Chiapas, Damian Fraser writes from Mexico City.
Mr Manuel Camacho, the government peace negotiator in Chiapas, met leaders
of the Zapatista movement at a secret location in the Chiapas jungle on
Wednesday afternoon. A joint statement pledged to push on with peace
efforts, but no date was given for a start to new negotiations.
The Zapatistas launched their rebellion on New Year's Day, pressing for land
reform, indigenous peoples' rights and more democracy.
The government and the Zapatistas last met on March 2, when the government
presented a peace offer. The Zapatistas have still not responded formally to
it, and temporarily broke off consultations with their supporters on their
response after the assassination of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
party's presidential candidate, Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio.
In recent weeks tensions in Chiapas have eased as peasants have largely
ended land invasions that led to violent confrontation with rich landowners.
Mr Ernesto Zedillo, chosen to replace Mr Colosio as the PRI's presidential
candidate, was in Chiapas yesterday, and gave unconditional support to the
peace process.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Subpoena for White House over aide's suicide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Fiske, the special counsel appointed to investigate President Bill
Clinton's involvement in the Whitewater financial affair, yesterday issued a
sweeping subpoena to the White House for documents relating to the death
last year of Mr Vincent Foster, deputy White House counsel.
Mr Fiske's investigation is reported already to have confirmed the US Park
Police's conclusion that Mr Foster's death was a suicide, but the subpoena
appeared to be intended to determine whether any documents were taken from
his office after his death.
Mr Lloyd Cutler, the White House counsel, promised to cooperate 'fully and
promptly' with the subpoena, and some documents are expected to be handed
over by Tuesday.
Separate allegations against Mr Clinton, meanwhile, were surrounded in
mystery yesterday after a lawyer who had threatened to file a lawsuit
accusing the president of sexual harassment did not appear at a press
conference he had scheduled in Little Rock.
The White House has denied any encounter with Ms Paula Jones, a former
Arkansas state employee, but has hired a prominent Washington lawyer to
defend Mr Clinton.
Ms Jones accused Mr Clinton at a press conference earlier this year of
making sexual advances to her in a Little Rock hotel room in 1991.
A senior White House official said Mr Fiske's subpoena requested all
documents written by, sent to or referring to Mr Foster, but that the
special counsel's priority was to examine all the files that were in his
office when he died, and find out where they went.
Besides his other White House duties, Mr Foster had worked on some personal
legal matters for the Clintons, including their involvement in Whitewater,
an Arkansas real estate company in which they invested in partnership with
the owner of a now bankrupt savings and loan institution.

FT  06 MAY 94 / US vote brings sharp defeat for gun lobby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US gun lobby suffered a stunning defeat last night when the House of
Representatives passed by two votes a bill banning the manufacture and sale
of 19 types of semi-automatic assault weapons and large-magazine guns.
The final tally, 216-214, cut across party lines, with Democrats splitting
177 to 77 in favour and Republicans 137 to 38 against (the sole independent
voted in favour of the ban). After a spirited, day-long debate, many
congressmen from rural districts, where hunting is most common and gun
ownership most prevalent, voted for the first time in their careers against
the powerful National Rifle Association
Within half an hour of the vote, President Bill Clinton was on the White
House lawn proclaiming a great victory. His administration, faced with
apparent defeat earlier in the week, had lobbied furiously for the bill,
bolstered by supportive letters from former presidents Ford, Carter and
Reagan.
The House action does not yet mean the bill is law. The Senate included a
similar ban, though couched in different language, in its omnibus crime bill
last year, but it was excluded from the House bill at the insistence of
Congressman Jack Brooks, the Democrat from Texas and chairman of the
judiciary committee.
Differences between the two crime bills still have to be reconciled by the
two houses. The probability is that the final bill will include the ban,
offering a last opportunity for its opponents. Anti-crime legislation is so
popular, however, that the chances of removing the ban must be slim.
The bill, sponsored by Democrat Congressman Charles Schumer, emerged as a
serious test of the power of the gun lobby. But earlier this week it
appeared that the legislation would fall 15 to 20 votes short of securing a
majority in the 435-member House.
Some conspicuous converts to the gun control cause were achieved in the last
24 hours, including two congressmen from Texas, where the NRA has long been
a powerful political force. But the Democratic party leadership was sharply
divided. Mr Brooks's opposition was offset by support from Congressman
Richard Gephardt, the majority leader.
All evidence suggests overwhelming public and police support for the ban,
particularly in the suburbs, the most populous political constituency.
The NRA relied heavily in its lobbying on its conventional arguments that
the ban on assault weapons is merely the beginning of the slippery slope
which ends with the banning of all privately owned firearms, thus, in their
view, violating the constitutional right to bear arms.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Treasury takes risks to back dollar: US will be heavily
exposed if this week's intervention proves insufficient
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
This week's massive concerted intervention by central banks around the world
to stop the fall of the US dollar has pushed the US Treasury a long way out
on a somewhat fragile limb.
In an effort to break the financial markets' perception that the US, to
increase its leverage in trade negotiations with Japan, is actively pushing
or passively permitting the dollar's slide against the yen, Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, said the Clinton administration saw 'no
advantage in an undervalued currency'.
'Recent movements in exchange markets have gone beyond what is justified by
economic fundamentals,' Mr Bentsen said.
But that bold statement leaves the US heavily exposed if Wednesday's central
bank purchases of dollars turn out to be insufficient to turn the foreign
exchange markets.
Currency intervention has worked on many occasions in the past, especially
when, as now, it is intended not so much to defend a particular currency
level as to send a more general message to the markets about policy.
It has failed just as often, however, particularly when governments tried to
fly in the teeth of economic reality.
'The key criterion is whether intervention is moving in the same direction
as the underlying fundamentals would suggest, or is trying to buck them,'
said Mr Fred Bergsten, a senior Treasury official in the Carter
administration, who now heads the Institute for International Economics, a
Washington think tank.
An examination of the US economy, which continues to grow steadily and much
faster than either Japan or continental Europe, lends considerable weight to
the administration's analysis of fundamentals.
In addition, the general direction of US interest rates is widely perceived
to be upwards, as the Federal Reserve continues to tighten monetary policy
to choke off any signs of inflation that may emerge with the recovery.
Although Japanese interest rates are not thought to have any more room to
move downwards, continental Europe is still expected to see further cuts in
interest rates.
The relative trends of interest rates should, therefore, make the dollar
more attractive to investors.
But currency markets' expectations are built not just on the relative
strengths of different economies, but on changes in those relative
strengths. Forecasts of US growth are now lower than they were at the
beginning of the year, while the German economy, though still much weaker
than the US, is now thought to be a little stronger than it was.
That, in turn, could mean that the Fed will not raise its interest rates as
much, and the Bundesbank not lower its rates as much, as markets previously
expected.
In either event, the Clinton administration is virtually powerless to do
much about this. It does not want to stimulate an economy which it views as
growing quite satisfactorily, without overheating; and it certainly does not
want the Fed to raise rates further to defend the currency.
The question is whether the US is equally impotent to dispel the markets'
expectations of a further dollar depreciation against the yen.
Senior Treasury officials believe their actions and statements should now
have dispelled the markets' perception that the US was pursuing a policy of
depreciating the dollar, whether actively or through benign neglect.
Mr Bergsten argues, however, that the benign neglect is not American but
Japanese.
He says the only way to redress Japan's large and growing current account
surplus not just with the US but with the rest of the world is through
stimulating the domestic economy, lowering barriers to its markets or a
further appreciation of the yen.
The US has been urging the first two policies for some time, in vain. Its
chances of success have not been improved by the recent change in the
Japanese government.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Call for tighter derivative regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The activities of all US companies which use derivatives should be subject
to close regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to
the draft of a long-awaited report due to be published on May 18.
The proposal, from the US's General Accounting Office, would impose new
rules on many of the US's biggest companies, which use derivatives to manage
exposure to interest rate, currency or other risks.
The GAO report is likely to add to pressure in Washington for early
legislation on derivatives - financial instruments whose value is based on
some underlying asset or market. The rapid growth in the use of such
instruments has caused concern among regulators and policy makers.
Industry trade groups, derivatives exchanges and other interested parties
were this week given a brief opportunity to read the 200-page draft report.
According to one person who read it, the tone of its conclusions was
'unremittingly negative'.
The report's main conclusions are believed to be that regulation should be
extended both to companies that use derivatives, and to the unregulated
subsidiaries of securities companies, among the biggest traders in such
instruments.
The report is understood to propose that companies which use the instruments
report their derivatives exposures to the SEC, and that the SEC lay down
requirements for boards of directors to control their activities in this
area.

FT  06 MAY 94 / NY art auctions end hopes of upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's New York auctions of leading works of contemporary art have
shattered some of the growing optimism that the international art and
antiques market was making a strong recovery.
At Sotheby's on Wednesday night the most important work on sale this week,
'Highway' by Jasper Johns, expected to make around Dollars 8m (Pounds 5.4m),
was unsold, while at Christie's on Tuesday almost half the lots on offer
failed to find buyers. This was a disappointment after the success of last
winter's contemporary auctions in New York.
Sotheby's had the better experience. Apart from the failure of the Johns the
auction did quite well, totalling almost Dollars 20.5m, and with over 70 per
cent of works on offer selling.
'Cubi V', a sculpture by David Smith, went to a private American collector
for a record Dollars 4m. It is one of a series of 28 such sculptures, most
of which are already in museums. 'Dark Green Painting' by Arshile Gorky, his
last important work before his death in 1948, made Dollars 3.5m. Both works
were sold from the collection of Mr and Mrs H. Gates Lloyd: he was the
former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
In contrast Christie's sold its main offering, a drip painting by Jackson
Pollock, for Dollars 1.76m. This was well below its Dollars 2m-Dollars 3m
estimate. It seems the good results last time round encouraged some leading
works into the saleroom, but with reserves higher than the market could
stand.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Panama party of dictators set for victory: Stephen Fidler
looks at the main runners competing in Sunday's presidential election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The party of Panama's two military dictators, Omar Torrijos and Manuel
Noriega, is heading into Sunday's presidential elections as favourite to
provide the country's next head-of-state.
Front-runner is Mr Ernesto Perez Balladares, 47, who has in the past four
years masterminded the rebuilding of the Revolutionary Democratic party
(PRD) which was shattered by the December 1989 US invasion which ousted Gen
Noriega, now serving 40 years in a Miami jail for drugs offences. He was a
financial advisor to Gen Torrijos and campaign manager for Gen Noriega's
candidate for the 1989 elections, which the dictator later annulled.
Although it invaded the country less than five years ago, Washington has
made it plain it can live with whichever of the seven candidates wins the
one-round election. But Mr Balladares, a former banker with Citibank and a
Wharton School MBA, has only been partly successful in distancing himself
from the party's militarist past.
His task was made tougher by a videotape shown nationally last month by
President Guillermo Endara which reminded people of the military-sponsored
violence surrounding the last election.
If any of Mr Balladares's six opponents has gained from the tape, it seems
to have been a political outsider, Mr Ruben Blades, and none of the past or
present members of Mr Endara's anti-militarist coalition.
Mr Blades, now the closest contender to the PRD, has spent most of the last
two decades in the US, acting - he appeared in Robert Redford's Milagro
Beanfield War - singing and qualifying as a lawyer. His absence appears to
be, on balance, an electoral asset because he - if not all of his party -
has no association with government corruption.
The main question over his candidature is what he and his makeshift
political movement, Papa Egoro - it means Mother Earth in a local indian
dialect - stand for. Its broad themes are issues such as improving popular
participation in government and improving peoples' self-esteem, but what
this would translate into in policy terms is far from clear.
The fact that the two front-runners are outside Mr Endara's civilista
coalition is widely seen as testimony to the government's unimpressive
performance.
The government of Mr Endara, who cannot by law stand in the election, has
been seen as indecisive. Although, it has overseen rapid growth that has
brought the economy back to its level of 1987, before US sanctions on the
Noriega government sent the economy into a tailspin, his government has not
received much credit for it.
In part this is because growth has been concentrated in a few sectors -
including the free zone at Colon which now does an annual Dollars 11bn of
business - and the trickle down to the poorest has been limited.
Unemployment stays high at 14 per cent. A construction boom is under way in
Panama City, for example, but it has been financed in part by drugs money
and is largely of high-priced apartments.
While allegations of corruption and involvement in drugs trafficking have
been less prevalent than in the military years, the probity of the
government has also been called into question. The president's reputation
was not helped when his young wife, Ana Mae Daz de Endara, won the jackpot
in one Christmas lottery - the biggest of the year.
Rising crime is also perceived as a problem. 'Endara's government has failed
to adhere to the old PRD maxim of keeping the country safe and stealing
everything themselves,' said one banker.
The main achievements, say bankers, have been some movement towards
settlement of the Noriega-era foreign debt defaults and strict control over
the budget, though neither has much electoral appeal.
Critics say the coalition united around only one issue - ousting Noriega and
the military. Once that was achieved and the military abolished,
factionalism took over. The civilistas could not agree on a common
presidential candidate. Their leading contender is probably Mr Ruben Carles,
73, the budget minister in the current government and a former Chase
Manhattan banker, but he is widely considered to be too far behind in the
opinion polls to be in contention.
None of the candidates is promising much new on the economy, which has been
one of the few in Latin America where there has been no significant move
towards lower tariffs and market-oriented reforms. There is some talk of
privatisation of the telephone and electricity systems, the ports and the
hardly-functioning trans-isthmus railway, but it has not been an important
campaign issue.
The centre-left PRD lays more emphasis on government spending and popular
public works projects. But its ability to spend will be constrained by the
government's inability both to print money (the economy is dollar-based) and
to borrow it, because of a continuing default on its bank debt. Mr
Balladares's supporters say he is more likely to confront the local business
oligarchy, which favours a continuation of protectionism.
The central issue facing the new government will be how it handles the
takeover of some 80,200 acres of land and facilities - including 4,800
buildings, schools, houses and airports - which will be handed to the
Panamanian government as the US pulls out of the country in 1999. The 10,000
US troops there now contribute an estimated Dollars 250m to the economy,
around 5 per cent of GDP.
These properties - which are full of infrastructure that the rest of the
country desperately lacks - are valued anywhere between Dollars 8bn and
Dollars 30bn. Some Panamanians worry the handover will be managed badly and
the prizes will be allotted to the cronies of the next government.
Mr Ricaurte Vasquez Morales, treasury and then planning minister between
1982-88, says: 'This is at the core of what the real political struggle is
about: who takes control of these properties. It's like winning a war.'

FT  06 MAY 94 / Close vote on US gun ban law expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US House of Representatives was facing the tightest of votes yesterday
on the bill banning sales of 19 different types of semi-automatic assault
weapons and large magazine guns.
The bill, sponsored by Congressman Charles Schumer, the New York Democrat,
has emerged as a serious test of the power of the gun lobby, which has
experienced some unaccustomed setbacks around the country in recent months.
Earlier this week it appeared that the legislation would fall 15-20 votes
short of securing a simply majority in the 435-member House. But a ferocious
lobbying effort by the Clinton administration, bolstered by supportive
letters from former presidents Ford, Reagan and Carter, had narrowed the gap
by yesterday morning.
Some conspicuous converts to the gun control cause were achieved in the last
24 hours, including two congressmen from Texas, a state in which the
National Rifle Association has long been a particularly powerful political
force. Yesterday morning, President Bill Clinton personally welcomed in the
Rose Garden Congressman Steve Neal of North Carolina, who is retiring at the
end this session, as the latest convert.
However, the bill finds the Democratic party leadership divided. Congressman
Jack Brooks from Texas, chairman of the House judiciary committee, opposes
the ban and kept the provision out of the omnibus crime bill passed by the
House last month (the Senate version, passed last year, does outlaw the
assault weapons).
Mr Tom Foley, speaker of the House, is also on record as opposing it, mostly
out of deference to his constituents in the state of Washington, where
hunting is popular. But on Wednesday he hinted that he would only vote 'in
case of a tie', leaving open the prospect that he might choose not to oppose
his president on the issue.
The bill places many members in severe dilemmas. All polls suggest
overwhelming public support for such a ban, also desired by police
authorities. Support is strongest in America's suburbs, the most populous
political constituency.
But the opponents of gun control, directed by the NRA, are well financed and
organised.
Their argument is that the ban on assault weapons is merely the beginning of
the slippery slope which ends with the banning of all privately owned
firearms, thus, in their view, violating the constitutional right to bear
arms.
Congressman Jim Chapman, the Democrat from east Texas, said: 'If you polled
my district, it would be a toss-up. But all the calls are against it.'

Mexico's probable next president, Ernesto Zedillo, outlines his plans to
Damian Fraser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ernesto Zedillo, presidential candidate of Mexico's governing party, comes
from the same cadre of US-trained economists that has dominated public
policy in Mexico over the past six years, so it is not surprising that he is
a staunch supporter of the pro-market economic and social reforms that have
marked the presidency of Mr Carlos Salinas.
Nevertheless, Mr Zedillo insists that if, as is probable, he wins the
election in August, there will be some significant changes in economic and
social policy. Mr Zedillo diplomatically says the current government has not
had time to embark on all the reforms necessary to make the economy more
efficient, and the country more prosperous.
In an interview, Mr Zedillo highlighted three areas where new policies could
be expected. However, he was careful to support the government's current
conservative macro-economic policy, and underlined his commitment to a
stable currency and low inflation.
Legal reform. Mr Zedillo called for a fundamental reform of Mexico's
notoriously inefficient and corrupt legal system. This is an issue that Mr
Salinas has hardly touched. But after the assassination of Luis Donaldo
Colosio, the late presidential candidate, and the rise in organised crime
highlighted by recent kidnappings, legal reform has become a central theme
of Mr Zedillo's presidential campaign.
Mr Zedillo said he would seek to modernise criminal laws, reform the
judiciary and police and change the role of public prosecutors in the
justice system. Judges, he said, should be more independent of the
government than they are now and more responsive to the public. He hinted at
some form of citizen or congressional input into selection of judges.
Mr Zedillo said that the absence of a strong legal system not only affected
the administration of justice but was an impediment to economic efficiency.
'I believe that one of the essential conditions of sustainable economic
growth is that a rule of law prevails. I am sure that respect for the law
will lead to more investment.'
Micro-economic reform. Mr Zedillo promised to continue deregulation of the
economy, which he believes has not gone far enough. 'Despite the efforts
that we have made in this administration, there are still regulations at the
national and state level that impede the flow of investment and obstruct the
productive process.' Specifically, Mr Zedillo pointed to a simpler tax
system to help medium-sized and small businesses, and significantly would
not rule out a change to the current restrictive federal labour law.
However, the candidate also talked about a more active role for the
government in business. He said that his government would do more to help
business train workers, acquire modern technology, and borrow at low
interest rates than has the current administration.
Democratic and governmental reform. Mr Zedillo insisted that it was
'indispensable to move ahead with democracy - it is an essential condition
for the development of the country.' Disagreeing with those who argue that
recent social and democratic reforms have contributed to current instability
in Mexico, Mr Zedillo said more democratic changes would strengthen the
government's capacity to govern.
Mr Zedillo proposed a decentralisation of Mexico's government, giving more
powers to states to run their affairs. In this he was following closely the
policies outlined by Mr Colosio, for whom he worked as campaign manager. Mr
Zedillo further said he believed that Mexico's impotent congress should be
given more authority to scrutinise legislation.
However, Mr Zedillo appeared to shy away from a reform of the Institutional
Revolutionary party (PRI), which many consider a critical step in the
democratisation of the country. He said: 'The problem of democracy is not
just of the PRI - it is a problem of all the society, of citizens of all the
political parties. What is important for democracy in Mexico is that there
is equitable competition between all the parties.'
Mr Zedillo seems determined to keep the PRI united in the run-up to the
election and apparently sees no contradiction between reaching out to the
more unsavoury elements in the party and promising more democracy. He
vehemently defended Mr Carlos Hank Gonzalez, agriculture minister, who has
been accused of using public funds to rally support for Mr Zedillo, saying
the attacks were orchestrated by the opposition to discredit the PRI.
While Mr Zedillo's campaign is more austere than those of the PRI in the
past, the competition between the political parties is hardly equitable. Mr
Zedillo far outspends opposition candidates and, unlike the others, flies
around the country in a private jet lent by a businessmen and enjoys highly
favourable television coverage.

Brazil's congress has failed to approve a constitutional amendment designed
to make Brazilian and foreign companies equal before the law. Under the
widely criticised 1988 constitution, Brazilian companies enjoy some
advantages over foreign-controlled competitors, and these will now be
maintained.
The decision, which foreign and business interests said was disappointing,
is the latest in a series of setbacks for Brazil's constitutional revision,
under way since last October. The revision process, seen by many analysts as
crucial to restoring the government's ability to govern, has so far failed
to make any meaningful changes.
Congress voted on the latest proposal late on Wednesday but fell three votes
short of the necessary 293 for the measure to be approved. As a result, it
will lapse. The lack of support, blamed on congressional apathy and internal
party politics, also threatens other proposals to modernise the economy,
such as allowing entry to foreign controlled mining companies.
Proposals to open up Brazil's petroleum and telecommunications monopolies
have virtually been shelved.
Party leaders, who have been unable and sometimes unwilling to mobilise
their parliamentarians to vote because of electoral considerations, were due
to meet again yesterday to try to agree a basic list of constitutional
amendments. But the period reserved for the revision, which lasts until the
end of this month, is nearly over and few if any important changes are
likely.
The law which Wednesday's vote maintained establishes that Brazilian
companies with Brazilian capital are assured benefits and protections,
theoretically temporary, to develop 'activities considered strategic'. It
also establishes that government agencies buying goods and services should
give preference to Brazilian companies.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Nigeria fuel distribution recovers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Nigeria's domestic fuel distribution is slowly recovering from the
near-paralysis of last week, as the government's ultimatum for its
state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to ease the
shortages has expired without further comment from the military regime, Paul
Adams writes from Lagos.
NNPC's two oil refineries in Port Harcourt are back in operation and large
imported fuel shipments have arrived, but NNPC and the private-sector fuel
marketers warn the relief is temporary and fundamental problems remain
within the industry.
The low price of N3.25 (6 US cents) a litre of petrol imposed by the
government is half the cost of importing the fuel or producing it in
Nigeria, depriving the domestic oil industry of working capital and giving
black market operators, who smuggle it abroad or hoard it in Nigeria for
sale during shortages, 500 per cent margins.

Nearly half a million people have fled Rwanda to escape tribal massacres in
the central African country, Medecins sans Frontieres, the medical charity,
said yesterday, Leslie Crawford writes from Nairobi. The upheaval has
created the largest makeshift refugee camp in the world at Benako, in
northern Tanzania. MSF says between 150,000 and 200,000 destitute and
exhausted refugees have gathered at Benako. A nearby river marking the
border between Rwanda and Tanzania has become polluted with corpses. Aid
workers fear the outbreak of disease. Rebels of Rwanda's Tutsi minority have
been fighting the dominant Hutu ethnic group for control of the country. But
Tanzania said Rwanda's interim government yesterday signed a pact to stop
the fighting and massacres. It said rebel forces had also agreed to
implement it from tomorrow.

FT  06 MAY 94 / India share sale raises Rs23bn

<TEXT>
India has raised Rs23bn (Pounds 483m) from its latest round of sales of
shares in state-owned enterprises, securing much-needed funds for the
government and extending its economic liberalisation programme, Stefan
Wagstyl reports from New Delhi.
Foreign institutional investors, permitted to bid for the first time,
snapped up part of the offering, the fifth since launch of economic reforms
in mid-1991. Stock in seven companies was on offer, including Mahangar
Telephone Nigam, the domestic telecommunications carrier serving Delhi and
Bombay, which accounted for nearly 60 per cent of the total sale.
The total raised falls short of the original target of Rs35bn for
disinvestment in 1993-94. Since 1991, the government has raised Rs73bn and
hopes for another Rs40bn in this financial year.
The government, which has sold shares in 31 out of 230 centrally owned
enterprises, intends to retain control of most by maintaining a minimum
holding of 51 per cent. Foreign institutions which successfully bid for
stakes include funds managed by Morgan Stanley of the US, the investment
management arms of Britain's BZW and of Hong Kong-based Jardine Fleming.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Clinton protests at Singapore caning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore yesterday carried out a caning sentence on Michael Fay, 18, a US
citizen convicted by a local court of vandalism offences, including
spray-painting cars. President Bill Clinton said bluntly that Singapore had
committed 'a mistake', write Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur and Jurek Martin
in Washington.
The error was 'not only because of the nature of the punishment related to
the crime but because of the questions raised about whether the young man
was in fact guilty and involuntarily confessed'.
Mr Clinton promised a more definitive reaction later. Meanwhile, the
Singapore ambassador was summoned to the state department to receive US
protests.
Fay received four strokes of the rotan, a 4ft cane. He had originally been
sentenced to four months' jail, and fined SDollars 3,500 (Pounds 1,489),
with six strokes of the cane.
The Fay case has caused considerable controversy in the US. Singapore has
accused the US media of orchestrating a campaign against it and has insisted
no one has the right to interfere in the workings of its judicial system.
Official figures show Singapore (population under 3m) canes about 1,000
people each year.

FT  06 MAY 94 / South African Elections: Politicians take over where the
ballot failed  - Patti Waldmeir on vote swapping in northern Natal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Black South Africans, especially in the troubled province of Natal/ KwaZulu,
can be forgiven for wondering what elections are all about. Last week they
queued for hours to cast their votes in the country's first democratic
elections. This week, their political leaders have been trading votes like
football cards, openly fixing the result of the poll to try to keep the
peace.
In Empangeni, centre of the much-disputed voting area of northern Natal, Mr
Senzo Mchunu, African National Congress regional secretary, makes no effort
to hide what is going on. 'To us, the priority is peace,' says the man who
heads the ANC in this stronghold of the rival Inkatha Freedom party.
'Obviously, the elections were not free and fair. There has been rigging,
extensive rigging,' he says. (The IFP won 73 per cent of the provincial vote
in this area, against 16 per cent for the ANC.) 'But we think it's a very
narrow line of thinking to say, just reject the results. That would not
resolve anything.'
'Based on the reality in Natal, the ANC should have emerged as the winning
party, and whatever deal is made should reflect that. But you must remember
these people (IFP) have been told they are winning so any deal you make must
make it less shocking to them.'
Mr Mchunu hints he would approve a deal which shared voting totals equally
between the two parties, whatever the official electoral tally shows. Each
would gain some 40 to 45 per cent of the vote with the outgoing National
party holding the provincial balance of power.
Under South Africa's constitution, they would be forced to share power in
the provincial executive in any case, with seats allocated proportionately.
'But there can only be one premier,' and it cannot be the IFP's candidate,
Dr Frank Mdlalose, he maintains.
Mr Mchunu believes the ANC has found a way to bridge these two positions and
is preparing to announce what it is. The Independent Electoral Commission,
charged with conducting the poll and certifying its outcome, appears to be
holding back the results of the Empangeni count to give the politicians time
to do their work.
Mr Mchunu has his own complaints about the IEC: 'Chaotic right from head
office to the last man; unable to find information which they want; unable
to ensure elections are free and fair.'
He refers to a confidential ANC report to the IEC detailing voting
irregularities in the northern Natal region, which includes lists of ballot
boxes improperly marked, sealed, or registered.
Mr Mchunu acknowledges there is no way of knowing how many irregularities
can be explained by human error. Only in the case of the small number of
boxes filled with pre-stacked papers could one confidently assert fraud.
Given some 119,000 people voted out of a voting population of 150,000 in the
Empangeni area, there is no evidence of massive voter inflation.
That does not mean fraud did not take place on a large scale - it simply
means with no voter rolls and no record of votes cast, it will be impossible
to draw the line between fraud and error.
That, in the end, is the real problem: South Africa's electoral process has
failed to confer legitimacy on the result. Only politicians can do that now.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Jets strike at rival Yemen strongholds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Middle East Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yemen edged towards civil war yesterday, as soldiers from the feuding
northern and southern regions clashed and as aircraft pounded rival
strongholds.
Aden radio said northern jets launched air raids against Aden's airport, oil
refinery, port, power station and television station. It claimed gunfire
brought down three of the attacking jets.
Earlier, the military command in the northern capital, Sanaa, said its
forces shot down five southern aircraft when they raided three airports in
the northern region. Residents of Sanaa said southern jets struck the
international airport and the presidential palace.
The northern command also reported pitched battles in several areas along
the former border between south and north Yemen, which merged four years ago
to form a unified country of 14m people.
Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East, with modest oil
production of about 335,000 barrels a day, of which 140,000 barrels come
from the south. Up to 30 foreign oil companies are operating in the main
oilfields.
Concern that fighting might endanger Yemeni oil exports, along with new
signs of firm oil demand, sparked a rally in petroleum prices. London June
futures for the benchmark Brent blend traded as high as Dollars 15.83 a
barrel, up 35 cents from Wednesday's close. New York light crude futures
also stood higher by nearly 40 cents at one point.
Oil companies lifting Yemeni crude said earlier in the day that operations
continued normally despite the attacks.
Yemen has been plagued by political rivalry since the merger between marxist
South Yemen and the tribal, conservative North Yemen.
Differences over power-sharing has prevented integration of the armed forces
and led to a fierce power struggle. Clashes broke out last week, with the
south conceding that one of its brigades in the north had been defeated in a
two-day tank battle near Sanaa.
Panic spread among Sanaa's 1.5m people yesterday as waves of aircraft flew
overhead at daybreak and as heavy gunfire and explosions rocked the city.
Diplomats said the southerners' attack on Sanaa airport slightly damaged
runways and the control tower. But a northern official denied there was any
damage. The southerners said their raid was in retaliation for an earlier
northern raid on Aden.
Diplomats said they believed the airport in Aden, capital of former South
Yemen, was badly damaged in air attacks and had been closed. Shipping and
trade sources said Aden port was shut.
In Sanaa, President Ali Abdullah Saleh declared a 30-day state of emergency.
The Yemeni news agency said the US assistant secretary of state for near
eastern affairs, Mr Robert Pelletreau, met President Saleh in an attempt to
mediate in the crisis.
France said it would evacuate French and European Union citizens from Aden.

Yemen edged closer to civil war yesterday as northern and southern army
units battled each other in the streets and air force jets pounded rival
capitals.
Residents in Sanaa, Yemen's federal capital, said southern air force jets
struck the international airport and the presidential palace.
Explosions rocked the northern capital again later in the day and warplanes
flying over the city drew anti-aircraft fire, residents said.
It was not immediately clear if the explosions were from a further air raid
by rival southern fighter jets. The anti-aircraft fire continued for 15
minutes and came from the southern and eastern parts of the city.
The northern-based, government-run Sanaa Radio declared a one-month state of
emergency. It ordered all Yemeni citizens to keep off main roads.
France said it would evacuate French and European Union citizens from
Yemen's port of Aden because of fighting between rival northern and southern
troops.
'Because of deteriorating conditions in Yemen, particularly in the region of
Aden, France has decided to evacuate its nationals living in Aden as well as
those from European Union member states who wish to leave the city,' the
Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
The southern military command reported that northern warplanes had blasted
the airport in Aden and other districts in the capital of the former South
Yemen on Wednesday night. European diplomats in Sanaa also reported northern
air attacks on Aden.
The southern command's statement said two raiding jets were shot down during
the attacks, but did not give their types.
Yemen has been plagued by political rivalry since Marxist South Yemen and
tribal, conservative North Yemen merged four years ago to form a single
republic with a 14m population.
Differences over power-sharing prevented integration of the armed forces has
led to a power struggle with renewed confrontations erupting last week when
the south said one of its brigades in the north had been defeated in a
two-day tank battle near Sanaa.
Clouds of smoke rose yesterday from the vicinity of the presidential palace
on the outskirts of Sanaa. A diplomat said southern forces were shelling the
compound with artillery. It was not clear if President Ali Abdullah Saleh
was inside. There was shooting on the road to the Red Sea port of Hodeida,
while sporadic fire clattered on the northern outskirts of the capital where
the airport is located.
Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East with a modest oil
production of about 335,000 barrels per day, of which 140,000 barrels come

FT  06 MAY 94 / Jordan piqued at being left out of Gaza deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMMAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jordanians had to sit through five news items on Wednesday evening before
state-run television presented a report on the historic signing ceremony in
Cairo which makes way for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to
have their first taste of self-rule.
The occasion was brushed aside by an official spokesman as an 'independent
Palestinian affair' and criticised by others in government for the lack of
co-ordination with Amman. The Lower House of Parliament cut short a debate
on a draft sales tax law to issue a statement which condemned 'the sale of
Palestine'.
Again, Jordan is in a fit of pique for being overlooked by the Palestine
Liberation Organisation in its plans to govern the occupied territories.
Despite numerous pledges between Jordan and the PLO to co-ordinate over
implementing the self-rule agreement, Jordan's fears of marginalisation are
growing stronger.
There is a general feeling of conspiracy in Amman that the long and bitter
rivalry between PLO chairman Yassir Arafat and King Hussein is causing Mr
Arafat to sideline Jordan.
The kingdom's frustration at being left out is based mainly on historical
precedent and demography. Jordan ruled the West Bank from 1948 to 1967, when
that region was occupied by the Israelis following the six-day war; only in
1988 did King Hussein decide to sever legal and administrative links with
what was half of his kingdom west of the Jordan River.
Out of Jordan's population of about 4m, over 60 per cent are of Palestinian
origin and many have strong family ties in the West Bank. As a result,
Jordan feels it has a natural role to play in any resolution of the
Palestinian problem.
So far, this looks increasingly unlikely. Not only have the promises of
co-ordination with the PLO failed to bear fruit, but agreements signed by
the PLO and Jordan have been overtaken by PLO talks with Israel. Last week's
PLO/Israeli economic agreement, for instance, negated in many ways the
economic accord signed with Jordan in January.
A free trade policy between Jordan and the self-rule areas was replaced by
quotas and taxes now to be levied on Jordanian goods. Newly-opened banks
which were to be run by the Central Bank of Jordan are now to be under a
Palestinian monetary authority. The Jordanian dinar seems to have been
replaced by the Israeli shekel as the main legal tender.

FT  06 MAY 94 / PLO denies being unready to take control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE GAZA STRIP, CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Palestine Liberation Organisation officials said yesterday the full
deployment of Palestinian police would take at least a week longer than
expected, but denied the PLO was unready to assume their new powers under
the Gaza-Jericho agreement, as suggested by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime
minister.
Mr Nabil Shaath, the chief PLO negotiator, said the first 22 'leading police
officers' were already deployed in Gaza and that further 'district
commanders' would arrive today.
The PLO said arrival of the first 1,000 police, which should have been in
place by today, had run into 'technical problems' and that they would not
now arrive until next week.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, seeking to bolster Israeli
support for the peace process vowed the Jewish state would never return to
the teeming Strip packed with refugee camps and squalid townships which have
been in open revolt against Israel for the past seven years.
'There is no testing period. The die is cast and there is a decision,' he
said. 'There is no going back. We won't go back to Gaza, Gaza won't come
back to us.'
Mr Shaath said the remaining 6,000 policemen, who will be arriving from six
Arab countries, would be in place within two weeks, rather than the
scheduled seven days to police the 800,000 Palestinians in Gaza.
Mr Shaath said the fact that the PLO had not yet handed a final list of the
24 Palestinians to serve on the Palestinian authority, which will assume the
powers accorded under the new deal, was allowed for under the terms of the
agreement. He was referring to the period within which Israel is committed
to complete its military pull-out.
Nevertheless, as the second day of self-rule passed, Palestinians and
Israelis woke up to the fact that the PLO is hopelessly ill-prepared to take
over the complex administrative and security functions of running the Strip.
The lack of planning on a more serious policy level was confirmed yesterday
by Mr Hassan Abu Libdeh, the PLO official in charge of the 'Technical
Committees' which were supposed to have in place a full scheme for
Palestinian control over all services.
'We are not ready to receive authority,' he said yesterday. 'For example
environmental questions are really new to us. It is not a matter of being
weeks away but it may take three to six months before we are really ready.'
Many Palestinians said the problem lies with Mr Arafat's authoritarian style
of leadership, his inability to delegate and tension between the leadership
in exile and those who have emerged in the seven year uprising against
Israeli rule. Institutions were created at PLO headquarters in Tunis and in
the territories but did not co-ordinate their activities.
Delay in implementing the agreement will further erode Mr Arafat's fragile
support base. In Gaza many Palestinians appeared disappointed and frustrated
at the little concrete signs of an immediate change in their lives.
Israel, however, continued yesterday to wind down its occupation in Gaza,
completely emptying the city's notorious central prison. But despite the
snail's pace of implementing self-rule many in Gaza still had hopes for the
future. Moustapha Sawafiri, a taxi driver said he didn't care whether it
took the police days or weeks to deploy. 'We have been waiting all our
life.'

FT  06 MAY 94 / Sri Lanka shares fall on fears for government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI, COLOMBO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sri Lankan shares have fallen sharply this week amid concerns about the
stability of president DB Wijetunga's government.
The sell-off was prompted by Mr Wijetunga's decision late last week to
cancel a visit to China to deal with the turmoil in the ruling United
National Party, and by a big May Day rally organised by a united front of
opposition parties and attended by over 100,000 people.
Evidence of the dwindling popularity of the UNP and strong support for the
left-inclined opposition parties, headed by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party,
unnerved investors. Even though share prices rallied on Wednesday and
yesterday, after a 4.5 per cent fall in the all-share index on Tuesday, the
mood remains nervous.
Businessmen and brokers fear that political turmoil could continue for
months, with presidential elections due later this year and a general
election in early 1995.
Mr Alavi Mahroof, a Colombo stock exchange broker, said: 'Local investors
are worried about current political trends'.
Share prices rose sharply last year, fuelled by strong economic growth and a
surge of foreign investment caused by the worldwide fashion for investing in
emerging markets. The market gained more than 70 per cent in dollar terms in
1993, according to data by the IFC, a member of the World Bank, but so far
this year it is down 3 per cent.
Equities have since fallen back, heavily influenced by the increase in US
interest rates and domestic political upheavals. Mr Stanley Jayawardena,
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the market watchdog,
said: 'A correction was bound to come. But this is also a reaction to
political events'.
The political storm began in March when the UNP suffered its first electoral
defeat in 17 years in provincial polls in the island's southern province. Mr
Wijetunga, who succeeded the assassinated president Ranasinghe Premadasa
last May, reacted with a string of populist financial hand-outs, including
tax cuts and food-stamps for schoolchildren.
But he could not take the wind out of the sails of the opposition parties,

Meanwhile, a temporary change of leadership has breathed new life into the
Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike, the former president who
heads the party, has been forced to go to hospital, leaving the field open
for her firebrand daughter, Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunge, the main speaker at
the May Day rally.
Colombo has also suffered an unwelcome reminder of the continuing war with
the Tamil Tiger separatist guerrillas in the north.
Terrorists planted bombs in luxury hotels in the capital last month, causing
little damage but potentially harming the tourist industry.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Hata tries to defuserow over Nanking gaffe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
China and South Korea yesterday reacted angrily to claims by Mr Shigeto
Nagano, the new justice minister, that one of Japan's worst wartime
atrocities was a 'hoax.'
In an effort to defuse the row, Japan's prime minister Tsutomu Hata,
condemned Mr Nagano's claim that the 1937 massacre of Nanking was a fiction
as 'not appropriate.'
Mr Nagano is expected to issue a public apology today, according to reports
in the Japanese press.
Mr Hata said Japan's wartime actions 'including aggression and colonial
rule, caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for many people; thus it is
essential ..to face the history squarely and share the determination not to
repeat them.'
China, Japan's second largest trade partner after the US, was 'shocked and
indignant,' said a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman. He urged the Tokyo
government earnestly and seriously to treat the issue with a view to
safeguarding bilateral relations,' an implied demand for Mr Nagano's
dismissal.
Japan last year stepped up a gradual campaign to improve relations with
Asian neighbours when former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa issued a
series of apologies, admitting that the war was aggressive and wrong.
Officially, the new government wishes to continue that process, though a
right-wing minority supports Mr Nagano's stance, as reported in the Mainichi
newspaper.
Mr Nagano's gaffe has far more impact today than it might have had a few
years ago and damages Japan's current attempts at a reconciliation with
former colonies at a time when Tokyo is seeking to increase trade and
investment with them.
It also provides ammunition for the minority government's numerous
opponents, only a week after the Hata administration took office.
According to a post-war tribunal, Japanese troops killed 155,000 people in
the six weeks after taking Nanking, though Chinese accounts put the figure
at 300,000.
Mr Hata, on a European tour until the weekend, said he would ask Mr Nagano
what he meant by his remarks.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Multi-tier rate puts Iran in reverse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Iran's government late on Wednesday to re-introduce a
multi-tier exchange rate is a backward step for President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafasanjani.
Mr Mohammad Adeli, governor of Bank Markazi (the central bank) has said
state banks will sell dollars at 50 rials below the open market rate for
certain imports from tomorrow. He has not specified to which imports the new
rate would apply.
The official floating exchange rate set by Bank Markazi is about 1,750 rials
to the dollar but the rial has weakened on the open market since the
beginning of the year to 2,800 yesterday because of low oil prices and high
demand for foreign exchange.
Reintroduction of a new rate undermines the difficult decision the
government made last year when it unified three different rates in favour of
a single floating rate in line with International Monetary Fund
recommendations. At a stroke, the rial was effectively devalued from 70
rials to the dollar to 1,540. At the time, Mr Adeli hoped that the currency
would strengthen to IR1,000=Dollars 1.
The rial has steadily declined and Bank Markazi has been following behind,
re-pegging its floating rate to reflect the open market value. The
devaluation has fuelled price rises and inflation is thought to run much
higher than the official 22 per cent.
The price of utilities and transport all rose steeply earlier this year but
the Majlis (parliament) has vetoed moves by President Rafsanjani to reduce
the expensive burden on the state of fuel subsidies because of fears of a
public outcry.
Last month, transport workers in the southern city of Shiraz went on strike
demanding pay increases. Falls in the price of oil towards the end of last
year have meant Iran earned only Dollars 13.5bn (Pounds 9bn) in the Iranian
year recently ended (March 21) instead of a budgeted Dollars 17bn.
This has increased its debt burden, although Dollars 5.5bn of its estimated
Dollars 14bn short-term debt has been refinanced since February with its
main trading partners, including Germany and Japan.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: France trims key interest rate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of France yesterday took a further step in its policy of edging
interest rates lower, trimming the intervention rate, the floor for money
market rates, by 10 basis points to 5.6 per cent. The move was the third in
three weeks and is consistent with the central bank's policy of gradually
lowering borrowing costs to support emerging economic recovery. Inflation,
currently at an annualised rate of about 1.5 per cent, poses little
constraint. The Bank of France has been tracking the downward trend in
German interest rates and is targeting the Bundesbank's repo rate.
Yesterday's cut brought the margin above the repo rate to just under 0.2
percentage points. The Paris stock market welcomed the move. The CAC-40
index of leading shares doubled its morning gains following the news,
closing up 0.98 per cent at 2,162. The French franc took the rate cut in its
stride, trading at about FFr3.428 to the D-Mark. John Ridding, Paris.
The Polish finance minister, Mr Grzgorz Kolodko, said yesterday the country
was on course for minimum growth in the economy of 4 per cent this year, and
forecast that 4.5 per cent to 4.7 per cent could be achieved. Car deliveries
in Italy fell by 2.8 per cent in April year-on-year against a 1.5 per cent
rise in March, the carmakers' association, Anfia, said. Anfia said 169,945
cars were sold in Italy last month, against 174,758 in the same period last
year.
Spain's official currency reserves fell Dollars 126.1m to Dollars 44.73bn in
April from March, according to provisional figures released by the Bank of
Spain.

Senior US and Russian military officials have revealed unprecedented details
of each other's nuclear forces and strategies - and have laid plans for
further disclosures and co-operation.
Mr Ashton Carter, assistant US defence secretary for international security
policy, said last night that in two days of talks in Moscow covering issues
from Bosnia to making inventories of each other's missile materials, the two
military establishments had talked freely about systems, procedures and
strategies which have hitherto been reserved for the attention of spies.
These included: the operational procedures for deploying strategic nuclear
forces; the steps taken by both sides to implement the Start I and Start II
nuclear treaties; the weaponry and strategies of short-range nuclear missile
defence systems - the area in which both sides are now concentrating because
of the shared perception that this constitutes a larger threat than
strategic missiles.

Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French politician and businessman, has
been fined FFr1m (Pounds 110,000) by the Paris stock market authorities for
disclosing inaccurate information about Testut, a company he chaired from
1987 to 1992. Mr Tapie was criticised for releasing information in 1990
which 'did not seem to be either accurate, precise or sincere'. The fine is
the latest in a long line of brushes between Mr Tapie and the French
financial establishment. It comes at a time when Mr Tapie, who was briefly
minister of urban affairs in the last socialist cabinet, is leading the
European election campaign for MRG, a group of left-wing parties dubbed Les
Tapistes by the French press. So far Mr Tapie's political fortunes seem to
have been helped rather than hindered by his scuffles with the authorities.
MRG has recently risen rapidly in the opinion polls to reach around 10 per
cent.

Mr Pierre Guichet, chairman of Alcatel CIT, the French telecoms equipment
manufacturer, has been placed under judicial investigation in a case
concerning alleged overcharging of France Telecom, one of the group's
principal customers, the company said yesterday. Alcatel CIT, a subsidiary
of Alcatel-Alsthom, one of France's largest industrial groups, said in a
statement it had not overcharged or forged billing for France Telecom and
expressed surprise at the investigation.
The origins of the affair date back to last year, when two employees of
Alcatel CIT were accused by the company of manipulating prices for equipment
ordered by France Telecom. Alcatel CIT agreed in November to pay France
Telecom a sum of about FFr60m (Pounds 7m) to compensate for the losses
arising from the manipulation of prices and the damage to relations between
the two companies. Alcatel CIT said it had written a letter to the
investigating magistrate criticising the procedure being followed in the
case. Mr Guichet was placed under judicial investigation for the
overcharging case immediately after having being questioned about
allegations that he had work done at his home by companies working for
Alcatel CIT. Alcatel CIT said that Mr Guichet had himself paid for the work
at his home and that no charges had been brought concerning this subject.

Privatisation of Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni (Ina), Italy's
state-owned insurance company, is still on schedule in spite of the fact
that Rome prosecutors are investigating the group's chairman, Ina advisers
said yesterday.
Magistrates revealed on Wednesday night that they had warned Mr Lorenzo
Pallesi that they were conducting inquiries into alleged falsifying of
accounts and fraud, following up their earlier inquiries into the operations
of the Rome branch of the company's Assitalia subsidiary between 1990 and
1992. Ina has played down the significance of the inquiry. The company
pointed out that Mr Pallesi had only been targeted by the magistrates
because he was formally responsible for the group at the time, though not
directly involved in management of the Rome branch.
Four other Ina-Assitalia executives were warned about the inquiry in March.
Even before Wednesday's events, delays in the formation of a new Italian
government had begun to cast doubt on the timetable for the Ina
privatisation. The sell-off is scheduled for the end of June, but most of
the important political decisions about privatising Ina have still to be
taken.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Swedish interest rate reduction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, yesterday cut interest rates to their
lowest level for 20 years to consolidate the country's recovery from its
deepest recession since the 1930s.
The bank's marginal rate, which steers short-term interest rates, will fall
to 7.0 per cent from 7.25 per cent from May 9. The bank said falling
European interest rates and the krona's stable performance during recent
financial market turbulence had provided scope for the cut. The krona has
fallen by 20 per cent since late 1992 but this year it has strengthened amid
clear signs of an export-led recovery.
Mr Thomas Franzen, Riksbank deputy governor, said that with Swedish
inflation subdued, 'there is scope for lasting lower interest rates in
Sweden'. He also noted that there was a general acceptance that Sweden would
have to pursue tighter fiscal policies to promote growth and employment.
The Riksbank has attracted criticism for not cutting rates more aggressively
over the last 18 months, despite the country's deep economic problems. Real
interest rates remain high, with inflation running at less than 2 per cent.
The government expects Sweden's GDP to grow 2.4 per cent this year, the
first increase since 1990.

   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Austrian state prosecutor has launched an investigation into the
country's large trade union bank Bawag - the country's fourth largest bank -
and its chairman, Mr Walter Floettl, following allegations made anonymously
by two of the bank's senior officials.
The officials have alleged that Mr Floettl concealed from the bank's
supervisory board high-risk trading activities undertaken by his son with
money from the bank and that he evaded taxes. The prosecutor's inquiries
follow another investigation launched just over a week ago by the finance
ministry after it was alleged that Mr Floettl had authorised loans worth
almost Sch21bn (Pounds 1.16bn) to Caribbean-based offshore companies run by
his son Wolfgang. The latter Floettl is said by the finance ministry to have
used the money for high-risk speculative financial operations on the
international debt market. The loans were not clearly disclosed in the
bank's annual report, say the authorities. Last Friday, Mr Anton Stanzel,
who is responsible for bank supervision at the finance ministry, said that
nothing had been found during the ministry's own investigation to suggest
criminal activity by the Floettls and Bawag (Bank fur Arbeit und
Wirtschaft).
Nevertheless, the ministry decided that further investigations were needed
to assess the risk and propriety of the transactions.
'There is no evidence of criminal activity, but investigations continue to
check that (all transactions) were done according to the banking act,' Mr
Stanzel said this week. 'There were very high risks involved,' he said. The
ministry's investigations are expected to be completed by the end of the
month.
The financial authorities are particularly concerned that the bank's
standing should not be damaged by the affair. The 70-year-old Mr Floettl has
strongly rejected any suggestions of impropriety on his or his son's part,
though he admitted the transactions that had taken place for nearly six
years were unconventional.
The bank, however, had not lost any money as a result, and he promised all
such positions would be closed by the end of this month, and the business
ended.
Mr Stanzel, said on Wednesday that about half of the money had been
returned, and he hoped the remaining positions could be closed without loss.
'We'll sleep better if this (the rest of the money) comes back,' Mr Stanzel
said. Ironically, until now the bank, with its traditional strong ties to
the unions and the social democrats, was regarded as one of the most
successful and conservatively run banks in Austria.
The social democrats, who pride themselves on their ability to be better
managers than their conservative rivals, now face damaging publicity which
comes only a few months before general elections due in October.

Andrianopoulos, are accused of breach of faith, overstepping the bounds of
their duty and violating the law on responsibility of ministers for their
part in the sale of the AGET-Heracles cement concern to Italian cement
company Calcestruzzi. The proposal, signed by 42 of the 170 Socialist
deputies in the 300-member parliament, is sure to be accepted in a vote
within the next two weeks. A 20-member committee with deputies from all
parties will then decide whether to indict the three, sending them to trial

Bosnian Serb leaders again quashed hopes for a settlement by yesterday
rejecting a previously agreed arrangement which traded land for peace.
Referring to EU plan for Serbs to keep 49 per cent of Bosnia and Moslems and
Croats to control 51 per cent, Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the Bosnian
Serb assembly, said: 'Moslems and Croats do not have the moral right to such
a percentage of territory since they never have controlled such an area.'
Earlier, Mr Douglas Hogg, British foreign office minister, in Belgrade to
meet President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, stressed the importance of the
'land for peace' deal. Mr Hogg said: 'The allocation of 49 and 51 per cent
is very firm. We do not want to see firm points shifted.' In Sarajevo,
another earlier arrangement was buckled. Mr Yasushi Akashi, UN envoy, agreed
to allow seven Serb tanks to pass through the 20km exclusion zone around the
city despite Bosnian government protests. Laura Silber, Belgrade.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The December 12 referendum which approved the Russian constitution was
invalid because the required 50 per cent of voters did not take part,
according to a report by a team of experts working for the presidential
administration. The report, whose main author yesterday insisted on its
accuracy, alleges massive corruption at every level of vote counting.
The potential importance of the findings - if shown to be correct and if
acted upon - is great. The report's author, Mr Alexander Sobyanin, claims
that only 49m voters out of 106.2m took part in the referendum on the
constitution - a percentage of only 46.1, well short of the 50 per cent
minimum and even further down on the 54.8 per cent claimed by the Central
Election Commission very soon after the voting ended.
The findings could tear the heart out of the efforts by President Boris
Yeltsin to place the constitution as the foundation stone of Russian
democracy. He has persuaded most of the Russian party leaders to sign a
'treaty on civil accord' which pledges that no efforts will be made to amend
the constitution for two years. The treaty was signed yesterday by 141
representatives of Russian enterprise unions and associations. The report,
excerpts of which have been printed in the daily newspaper, Izvestiya, also
said that extensive stuffing of ballot boxes and rewriting of results at the
regional voting headquarters resulted in huge distortions.
It alleged that the Liberal Democratic party (LDP), the ultra-nationalist
group led by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, whose victory in that part of the
parliament chosen from party lists was the main shock of the elections,
received 6m unwarranted votes - with the Russian Communist party gaining
1.8m, the pro-communist Agrarians receiving 1.7m and the Women of Russia -
also pro-Communist - 1m.
The main loser among the parties, said the report, was Choice of Russia,
which suffered a shortfall of 2m votes.
However, the present signs are that the report will not be allowed to
receive much attention. Both Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's
chief-of-staff and Mr Nikolai Ryabov, the head of the electoral commission,
rejected the report's findings. Mr Filatov is reported by Russian
journalists to have deprived Mr Sobyanin's group of its working dacha on the
outskirts of Moscow, and to have had it sealed.
Mr Ryabov told Izvestiya: 'I cannot say that nothing of this sort took place
. . . (but) to talk of massive falsifications and breaches of the rules in
this way has no grounds in reality.'
However, Mr Sobyanin, in an interview from his Kremlin office, stood by the
report: 'I am certain the facts are right because many of the breaches were
so obvious. It was quite obvious that in some regions the results were way
out of line.' Mr Sobyanin said that he had not discussed the report with Mr
Filatov, but had with other officials and 'there is some concern'. Following
publication of parts of his report, Mr Sobyanin said his contract with the
government had not been renewed.
A separate report on expenditure of the parties during the election alleges
that Choice of Russia spent almost 30 times more on the campaign per deputy
elected than the LDP - Rbs47.9m per deputy against Rbs1.7m. The former won
40 seats, the latter 59.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Turkey takes emergency action to stave off run on banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Turkish government yesterday moved to restore public confidence in the
banking system in the wake of recent bank collapses, announcing it would
provide unlimited deposit insurance cover, in the case of a bank going
under.
The move follows public criticism of the handling last month of the closure
of three small private banks - Turkish Tourism and Investment Bank TYT,
Marmara Bank and ImpexBank.
It also reflects growing official concern that other banks could be hit by a
run on deposits in the wake of a 50 per cent depreciation of the lira and
the recent bank closures.
Announcing the new scheme, Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, said
constant press speculation about the health of the banking sector had
'created an uncertain atmosphere.'
IBCA, the London based rating agency, estimates that around 12 per cent of
total foreign exchange deposits were withdrawn in the first six weeks of the
crisis. Bankers say it is considerably more today.
Until now, under the central bank's deposit insurance a depositor would be
paid up to TL150bn. The new scheme, which does not cover the three failed
banks, will have no upper limit, and will cover lira and foreign exchange
deposits.
The move was criticised by some bankers, who pointed out that without the
risk that depositors may lose their money, competition between banks would
now be decided not by the quality of the management but the interest rates
being offered.
However a shakeout seems unavoidable. This week, Garanti Bank, one of the
stronger private banks, took over the troubled Bank Ekspres, and brokers say
a number of other banking assets could soon be up for sale.
Yesterday's move on deposit insurance comes in the wake of earlier moves to
introduce a lifeboat system for banks suffering a run on deposits. It
coincides with a mission by the International Monetary Fund to discuss Mrs
Ciller's recently unveiled austerity programme. If the Fund approves the
package, Turkey will sign a letter of intent, paving the way for agreement
on a stand-by facility, and allowing Turkey to return to international debt
markets.
Turkey's creditworthiness is certain to be affected by the way the
government settles the foreign liabilities of the three failed banks, which
are estimated at Dollars 200m. Twelve of the leading bank creditors were
told by the Treasury last week there would be no repayment guarantee, and
settlement would be made as part of the liquidation of the banks, which may
take months.
The creditors group includes UBS and SBC of Switzerland, National Bank of
Australia, Commonwealth Bank, the Australian state bank, and the French
banks Paribas and the state owned Banque Francaise Commerciale Exterieure.
Half of the liabilities represent letters of credit and pre-export financing
for Turkish importers. Isbank and Emlak Bank, the two state banks in charge
of administration, have informed foreign creditors that these liabilities
will be recovered direct from the importers.
The World Bank has approved a Dollars 100m credit to support Turkey's
privatisation plans, in a clear signal of support for the government's
recently announced economic austerity programme.
The bank loan, repayable over 17 years with a five year grace period, will
cover the cost of foreign bank consultants, legal advisers and public
relations experts. It will also help finance a labour restructuring
programme including work on a social safety net, and a feasibility study for
the Zonguldak region, where the government has earmarked the coal mines for
closures.
The government plans to raise Dollars 3.5bn in 1994 to help close the budget
gap. With international debt markets all but closed to Turkey in the wake of
repeated downgradings by international credit agencies, revenues from
privatisation are critical to Turkey's balance of payments.
In 1994, the government is aiming to sell Tupras, the state oil refinery
corporation and Petrol Ofisi, the retail operator, either to a strategic
industrial buyer or through an international share flotation or a
combination of the two. Turk Hava Yollari, the Turkish airline is also up
for sale this year, together with Erdemir iron and steel works.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Recovery lifts Kohl's poll chances
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, appears to have reversed the trend of
declining popularity for both himself and his Christian Democratic Union, in
line with a series of important indicators of reviving economic activity.
The latest opinion polls show a revival in the fortunes of Mr Kohl and his
party for the first time since 1992, while the worsening trend of
unemployment also seems to have stabilised.
Figures for the capacity utilisation of German industry, published
yesterday, confirm the upward trend in the economy indicated by industrial
production and industrial orders' statistics this week.
The turn in the fortunes of Mr Kohl and the CDU may well have come too late
for the party to avoid further setbacks in the European, state and local
elections in June and September, but it suggests that he may have a chance
of hanging on to power in October's general election.
It is also looking increasingly likely that Mr Kohl's party candidate for
the German state presidency, Mr Roman Herzog, will defeat Mr Johannes Rau,
the former leader of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), in the electoral
assembly vote for the presidency on May 23. The outcome depends on the votes
of the minority Free Democratic Party, whose leader, Mr Klaus Kinkel, is
inclined to support his current partners in the ruling coalition.
Yesterday's moderately good news on the economy included a slight drop in
unemployment - down 93,800 to 3.8m - although on a seasonally adjusted
basis, that still amounted to a slight 16,000 increase. Nevertheless, the
underlying growth of unemployment - the single most negative factor for Mr
Kohl in his election campaign - has clearly slowed. All predictions hitherto
have suggested that unemployment would continue to rise through the year, in
spite of economic recovery.
The latter trend was confirmed by yesterday's capacity utilisation figures
published by Ifo, the Munich economic research institute, showing a recovery
in March to 80.3 per cent, from 79 per cent the previous December.
Capacity utilisation in German industry reached a peak of more than 90 per
cent at the end of 1990, coinciding with the economic boom of unification,
according to Ifo, since when it declined steadily until the middle of last
year.
The improvement seems to be having a direct effect on Mr Kohl's political
rating, with a reversal in the popular view that the SPD would handle the
economy better than the CDU. According to Die Welt, the conservative
Berlin-based daily newspaper, 36 per cent of voters now trust the CDU to
solve the country's economic problems today, compared with 32 per cent for
the SPD.
In January, the positions were reversed, with 35 per cent supporting the SPD
and 29 per cent for the CDU.
As for absolute levels of voter preference, most polls still put the SPD in
front, but with a declining lead. A poll from the Forsa institute published
yesterday puts the CDU on 38 per cent, up 2 per cent on the previous week,
and the SPD on 42 per cent, down 2 per cent.
At the weekend, one poll put the two parties neck and neck, on 38 per cent.
The Forsa poll suggests that the personal popularity of Mr Kohl has also
recovered to a rating of 31 per cent, only 1 per cent behind Mr Rudolf
Scharping, his SPD challenger.
The popularity of the Social Democrats has undoubtedly been hit by
publication of their plans for major tax reforms, which would increase the
tax burden on higher income earners, in order to relieve the low-paid.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Socialist Euro-MPs' boycott infuriates Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG, ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Socialist Euro-MPs yesterday provoked a furious reaction from Italy's
president after voting to boycott any Italian neo-fascists taking part in EU
institutions. The action follows last month's election victory by Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's three-party coalition, which includes the far-right
MSI/National Alliance.
The Socialists, set to dominate the increasingly powerful Strasbourg
assembly after next month's Euro-elections, say they will withhold
co-operation from the Council of Ministers of the 12 on vital issues like
the EU budget if Italy is represented there by neo-fascist ministers.
They have also decided to block parliament's mandatory endorsement of the
new European Commission - due to take over in 1995 - should a Berlusconi
government seek to send a neo-fascist Commissioner to Brussels.
The move brought an instantaneous angry reply from Italy's President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro and cast a cloud over the formation of the next Italian
government.
President Scalfaro was so furious over what he regarded as an unwarranted
interference in internal affairs of an EU member that within eight minutes
of the vote he had issued a formal reply.
The lapidary tone of the reply made his feelings clear: 'Italy's adherence
to principles and values that form the basis of Europe is crystal clear and
beyond discussion, and we need no one to either tell us this or offer to
give us lessons.'
The full parliament, in which the Socialists are already the largest bloc,
voted late on Wednesday night to remind Italy that it 'must be faithful to
the fundamental values which lay behind the foundation of the European
Community.'
The motion - an unprecedented intervention in the politics of a member state
 -was carried by 189 to 188. The Christian Democrats, now the second largest
bloc at Strasbourg, including the parliament's president, Mr Egon Klepsch,
voted against.
Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of the Socialist MEPs, said yesterday: 'This
Union was founded on the ashes of fascism.' He denied interference in
Italy's internal affairs, saying that 'we are delivering a warning that this
Union is a partnership which depends on shared fundamental values.'
Italian opposition parties exploited the vote to remind Mr Berlusconi he
faced problems in allying so openly with the MSI which had yet to dissociate
itself from its fascist roots.
The Strasbourg vote comes at an awkward moment for the media magnate turned
politician. Mr Berlusconi's efforts to form a government are foundering on
the insistence of the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi on the
key portfolio of the interior ministry.
Mr Bossi has threatened to stay out of the government unless this post is
given to the League. If the deadlock is not broken within the next 24 hours,
Mr Berlusconi could well have to rely for his main support outside his Forza
Italia movement on the MSI. The League would merely offer unstable external
backing in parliament.
In Strasbourg the Socialists also decided to expel from their bloc any MEP
seen as siding with Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia group. They have three to
four MEPs in their sights, including Ms Maria Magnani Noya, a vice-president
of the Parliament for the nearly defunct Italian Socialist Party.
Last week, the so-called Rainbow Group of regional parties in the parliament
asked its two members from the Lombard League - the third element in Mr
Berlusconi's coalition - to leave their bloc, because of their alliance in
Italy with the neo-fascists.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Markets recover after going to brink

<TEXT>
Jittery stock, bond and currency markets were belatedly giving Spain's
embattled prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the benefit of the doubt
yesterday as he struggled to regain the initiative in the face of a series
of corruption scandals that have rocked his government.
The stock market began the day by plunging to a one-year low and the peseta
depreciated sharply until investors' nerves steadied as Mr Gonzalez, in a
pre-lunch press conference, pledged to regain the initiative.
A succession of scandals, which have prompted the resignation of two cabinet
ministers and turned the former head of the paramilitary civil guard into a
fugitive from justice, claimed their most senior political victim yesterday
when Mr Carlos Solchaga, former finance minister, resigned as parliamentary
leader of Mr Gonzalez's ruling Socialist party.
Hours earlier Mr Mariano Rubio, twice appointed by Mr Solchaga as governor
of the Bank of Spain, was arrested and imprisoned on fraud charges along
with his friend and former broker Mr Manuel de la Concha, a former head of
the Madrid stock exchange.
Mr Gonzalez's announcement that he would neither resign nor call a snap
election checked an early morning run on the peseta that brought it down to
Pta83 against the D-Mark from Wednesday's Pta82.1 fix and the currency ended
the day at Pta82.3.
The prime minister's move also reined in a widening spread in benchmark
10-year bond yields. The spread for the domestic bonds pushed up to 320
basis points against Germany's long-term bonds before falling to close to
300 basis points amid considerable volatility.
The Madrid stock market general index, which had dropped to a year-low of
307 in early trading after a fall of nearly six points on Wednesday, rallied
in the afternoon to close at 316.25, 1.5 per cent up on Wednesday's close.
Analysts stressed that the beleagured Mr Gonzalez may have only gained a
passing relief for the Spanish markets. 'It could be only a temporary
respite,' said Mr Antonio Pulido of Madrid broker's FG. 'We have not seen
volatility like this since the general elections last June.'
The consensus view is that the political uncertainty which fuelled the
volatility will not be wholly resolved until after the European elections on
June 12 when the government's popularity will be tested.
'On June 13 we will know whether Gonzalez is really strong enough to ensure
stability,' said Ms Monica Morales, a senior broker at Societe Generale in
Madrid.
The markets still appear to perceive Mr Gonzalez as living on borrowed time
and as a hostage of the Catalan nationalists in parliament who have so far
supported his government. They forecast that a humiliating defeat for his
Socialist party next month would prompt the Catalans to withhold their
support and trigger an October election.
The markets also fear, in particular, that a further bout of corruption
disclosures by the press could rock Mr Gonzalez's credibility once more.
'There are still a few loose cannon on the Spanish deck,' said Mr Robert
Maxwell of Madrid brokers Maxwell and Espinosa.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Nationwide to form its own life and unit trust subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nationwide Building Society is to set up wholly owned life insurance and
unit trust subsidiaries, weakening its links with Guardian Royal Exchange,
the composite insurance group.
The move, due to take effect in mid-1995, marks a further unravelling of the
links between life insurance companies and building societies.
In taking this step, Nationwide is joining most of the larger societies.
Halifax, the UK's largest society, announced last autumn that it was
severing its link with Standard Life.
Nationwide, the UK's second largest society, currently acts as a 'tied
agent', selling only GRE insurance products through its branches, for which
it receives a commission.
Nationwide Life will sell a range of products from term assurance to unit
trusts and personal equity plans, which it claims will be tailored more
closely to customers' needs. The new arrangement should also be more
profitable to the society than merely taking commission from a life company.
GRE has been retained on a contract for the first five years of the new
operation, to provide Nationwide with technical and administrative support.
The society has yet to select its fund manager.
Though the announcement yesterday had been expected, it is still a blow to
GRE. In 1993, 30 per cent of its new life business came through Nationwide.
GRE said the end of the 'tie' had been expected and it would be looking to
build up the business sold through independent financial advisers to fill
the gap.
Some industry analysts were sceptical, however, that this would prove
immediately successful, with one describing the company as having 'a
credibility problem' because of the previously poor performance of some of
its products.
Mr Brian Davis, due to become Nationwide's chief executive in August, said
there was scope for increasing sales of insurance and investment products to
the society's 8m customers.
Of the 10 largest societies, only Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth largest,
and Bristol &amp; West, ranking tenth, will have ties - to Scottish Amicable and
Eagle Star respectively. A further change could occur this autumn when
Woolwich, the third largest society, reviews the arrangements for its life
subsidiary.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Tory poll rout threatens PM: Conservatives sink to record
27% low as Lib Dems surge and Labour strengthens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's government suffered an unprecedented electoral battering
early this morning as a nationwide anti-Tory protest brought a surge in
support for the Liberal Democrats and a strong performance by Labour in the
local elections.
In a poll that will fuel the doubts about Mr Major's leadership just weeks
before the critical European elections on June 9, the Conservatives appeared
set to end up in their weakest position in local government for 50 years.
Amid growing speculation at Westminster about a challenge to the prime
minister, Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, dismissed suggestions
that Mr Major would be forced from office. 'I don't think there is any
question about the position of John Major as the leader of the party and as
prime minister,' he said.
As results flooded in it appeared that despite a dismal performance when the
same council seats were last contested at the height of the poll tax row in
1990, the Conservative vote had sunk even further to a record low of 27 per
cent. The Liberal Democrats had about the same share, while Labour was
comfortably above 40 per cent. Among damaging defeats, the Tories lost
control of Basildon, the barometer Essex seat in successive general
elections.
They also lost Tunbridge Wells, Woking, Basingstoke, Hertsmere, North
Hertfordshire, Epping Forest, Southend and Stratford upon Avon. The party
failed to win its two target seats in the west Midlands - Labour-controlled
Birmingham and the hung council at Wolverhampton. As expected, Labour held
Rotherham in the Parliamentary by-election but with a reduced majority.
In London, the crucial electoral battleground between the two biggest
parties, the Conservatives suffered the damaging loss of Enfield, Harrow,
Ealing, Bexley, Redbridge and Croydon, London's largest borough and
Conservative-controlled for over 100 years. As expected,
Kingston-upon-Thames fell to the Liberal Democrats. There was some comfort,
however, with the retention by the Tories of their flagship Wandsworth
council.
In terms of seats, the Liberal Democrats, who fared badly four years ago,
appeared to be the biggest winners of the night, with gains from both the
other main parties.
They took control of Congleton in Cheshire and a string of councils across
southern England, including Bath, Colchester, Rochford, Mole Valley,
Worthing, Winchester and St Albans. They held Brentwood, Cheltenham and
Gosport.
Foreshadowing the likely outcome of June's Eastleigh by-election, the
Liberal Democrats won the council, which had previously been hung. Labour's
chances of wresting the seat from the Conservatives in the by-election ebbed
with the loss of two council wards to the Liberal Democrats.
The London borough of Tower Hamlets provided a rare setback for the Liberal
Democrats, with Labour taking control. The far-right British National party
lost the single seat in the docklands Millwall ward won in a by-election in
September.
Despite losing some seats across the country, Labour took control of
Wolverhampton, Barrow-in-Furness, West Lancashire and Welwyn and Hatfield.
The party consolidated its grip on Amber Valley, tightened its hold on Derby
and retained its position as largest party in Liverpool. Labour camp over
the capture of leafy London suburbs such as Croydon and Enfield. The party
also held metropolitan areas such as Sheffield and Newcastle upon Tyne,
although in both the Liberal Democrats made gains at the expense of Labour.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, declared it had been a 'splendid' night
for his party, adding: 'John Major and his government have been humiliated.'
But Mr Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, insisted that with expected
gains of more than 350 council seats his party was the 'clear winner'.
North of the border, the Conservatives' share of the vote fell to 14 per
cent, while the Scottish National party made gains. Labour held control of
Lothian and Strathclyde, winning seats in the latter from both nationalists
and Scottish Militant.
In Wales, Labour held its dominant position, but lost three seats to Plaid
Cymru in Rhondda.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Euro election poses crucial challenge for Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major knew it was going to be bad. But it was worse, much worse. The
only question now is whether his divided, demoralised government can pick
itself up before the European elections on June 9.
If it cannot - and there has been nothing in the past few weeks to suggest
it has either the political will or the competence to do so - Mr Major's
premiership may well be over.
His authority is as diminished as that of any prime minister in living
memory. His enemies on the backbenches are already plotting a mid-summer
coup, furtively collecting names for a leadership challenge.
The government had clung to the hope that its traditional supporters would
show some loyalty to the Tory stalwarts who run the town halls. If not, they
might have felt their wallets and heeded the central message of the campaign
 -Conservative councils cost you less. After all, they do.
But instead the once-faithful stayed at home, or worse still, voted Liberal
Democrat. A few even supported Labour. They were much keener to punish the
government for the economic recession, for higher income taxes, for VAT on
fuel, for its incompetence than to save Pounds 50 or so on their council tax
bills.
The middle classes in Kingston-upon-Thames, Sutton and Mole Valley in
Surrey, and Worthing in Sussex joined the skilled working classes of
Basildon, Croydon and Enfield in deserting Mr Major's government. At about
27 per cent, the Conservative share of the vote was the lowest this century
in a nationwide election.
Cabinet ministers who sat last night in television and radio studios had
their excuses ready. It was a mid-term protest vote. The impact of the
economic recovery had yet to be felt. The government has nearly three years
to recover before a general election.
But Mr Major has barely more than a month before he must face the voters in
the elections to the European Parliament and in the Eastleigh by-election.
If last night's results are replicated on June 9, the Conservatives'
representation in the Strasbourg parliament will be all but wiped out. There
are 32 Conservative MEPs now. That number could fall below 10.
The European campaign always promised to be much more difficult than the
local one. The fault line in the Conservative party over Britain's place in
Europe will be impossible to conceal.
Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, may well regret reopening
the divide at the weekend with his incautious comments about a single
European currency. Many in his party will blame him for the scale of the
local election defeat.
But on past form others will find it hard, if not impossible, to stop
fighting the civil war over Europe. Mr Portillo and his allies on the
Eurosceptic right see salvation in a new, nationalist, Conservative party
which would unshackle Britain from the chains of Brussels.
Never mind that the pro-Europeans in the cabinet and on the Tory backbenches
(and there are still plenty of them) would never stand for it. Never mind
that Mr Michael Heseltine, the most likely successor to the present leader,
is as committed a European as you can find in the Tory party.
Mr Major is being cast as the scapegoat. The word around the bars of
Westminster is that humiliation in the European elections will destroy his
premiership. He has five short weeks to prove his enemies wrong.

FT  06 MAY 94 / Respite for dollar as markets wait for jobs data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US won some respite in its battle to defend the dollar yesterday as many
investors took to the sidelines ahead of the release of important US April
jobs data today.
The dollar was firmer in quiet trading on the foreign exchanges, with some
traders clearly chastened by Wednesday's concerted round of intervention by
more than 15 central banks to back the ailing US currency.
'The market's clearly taking a pause to see what happens with the (jobs)
numbers,' said Mr Steve Geovanis, head of foreign exchange trading at
Merrill Lynch in New York.
In late trading in New York, the dollar was up just over 1 pfennig against
the D-Mark at DM1.6665 and nearly Y1 at Y102.835. Dealers said the market
appeared to have established a temporary 'floor' for the currency at DM.
6550 and Y102.50.
The consensus among observers was that while the intervention had succeeded
in breaking the bearish dollar psychology, supportive policy measures in the
form of lower German interest rates, higher US rates and market access
measures in Japan, would be necessary to turn the dollar around.
Traders said the Golden Week holiday in Japan - markets were closed from
Tuesday to Thursday - had contributed to the success of the intervention as
trading was thinner, making it less expensive for central banks to achieve
their purpose.
Today, the focus will be on the US employment report. Dealers think that
there is a chance the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to support
the US currency and prevent the economy from overheating if the figures show
strong growth in jobs.
Weak figures, however, could throw the dollar into renewed difficulties. US
Treasury prices rose slightly yesterday, but gains were limited by concern
about the weak dollar and another possible monetary policy tightening.

FT  06 MAY 94 / ANC heads for crucial two-thirds majority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission is expected to release final
results today confirming the overwhelming victory of Mr Nelson Mandela's
African National Congress in last week's all-race poll.
Any further delay in the count could upset the timetable leading to Mr
Mandela's inauguration as president next Tuesday. Leaders of all parties
regard it as unthinkable that the event, expected to be attended by more
than 40 world leaders, should be postponed.
The latest official count, based on figures made available last night,
showed the ANC edging further towards a two-thirds majority in the
400-member National Assembly that would give it the power to draft the
country's constitution.
The commission's latest batch of figures, encompassing more than 70 per cent
of the estimated electorate, showed the ANC consolidating its lead with 65.4
per cent of the vote. The National party, led by outgoing president F. W. de
Klerk, was second at 20.3 per cent and the Inkatha Freedom party third on
7.9 per cent.
The assembly is required to draw up a new constitution which will be the
basis of the next election, due to take place by 1999. The principles of
this constitution, however, have already been agreed in the course of
multi-party negotiations which ended late last year.
The strong support for the ANC will also reinforce its dominance of the
cabinet, where posts will be allocated according to the parties' electoral
showing. Mr Mandela has hinted, however, that he will offer ministries to
the conservative Freedom Front, the liberal Democratic party and the radical
black Pan Africanist Congress, although none is likely to achieve the
minimum 5 per cent of the vote that cabinet representation requires.
The Freedom Front's share stood last night at 2.2 per cent while the DP had
1.6 per cent and the PAC 1.3 per cent. This was based on 16.4m votes counted
out of an estimated turnout of close to 23m.
The decision on Wednesday by Mr Justice Johann Kriegler, head of the IEC, to
allow the parties to interpret disputed ballots according to a complicated
weighting system attracted vigorous criticism yesterday.
In a front-page editorial, Business Day newspaper accused Mr Justice
Kriegler of 'dissembling' and hiding 'the full truth of the political deals
he has helped cut with major parties from the millions of voters whose
commitment and hope gave the election its value.'
Jittery markets dropped further on the lack of new information. The
financial rand, the main barometer of international investor confidence,
shed 6 cents in London to close at R4.79 to the dollar, a decline of nearly
5 per cent over the past two days. The stock market's overall index finished
22 points down at 5,231.

FT  05 MAY 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Mexican banker faces
civil action - A now-defunct US trade finance group alleges fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 9th May 1994) appended to this article.
The chairman of Mexico's fourth-largest banking group is being sued by a New
York trade finance company, which alleges it was defrauded of about Dollars
70m.
Mr Carlos Cabal Peniche, head of Banco Union, Banca Cremi and Fresh Del
Monte Produce, one of the world's largest fruit companies, was last month
served in Mexico City with a summons and complaint by Eastbrook Inc, a
now-defunct trade finance company, according to lawyers.
The suit, first filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York last
November, alleges that between 1986 and 1991, Mr Cabal and two former
employees of Eastbrook directed more than Dollars 70m of loans to Mr Cabal's
personal bank account or to shell companies controlled by Mr Cabal. Of the
total, just Dollars 30m was paid back, it is alleged.
A criminal investigation into alleged bank fraud by former employees of
Eastbrook - including an investigation into transactions between Eastbrook
and Mr Cabal - was set aside last week, according to sources familiar with
the case. While Mr Cabal was not the target of the criminal investigation,
his companies were Eastbrook's largest clients, and he had been requested
'to co-operate with the District Attorney', according to a statement of
April 8 by Mr Stephen Kaufman, Mr Cabal's lawyer.
Eastbrook Inc is owned and controlled by Mr Khalid bin Mahfouz, a former
director of Bank of Credit &amp; Commerce International, the international bank
which collapsed with huge losses after widespread fraud was discovered. Mr
Mahfouz pleaded guilty, and with other defendants, paid fines amounting to
Dollars 225m on charges arising out of the BCCI investigation.
Separately, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accounting firm, has issued a statement
casting doubt on the future of Fresh Del Monte Produce (previously known as
Del Monte Fresh Produce), the fruit company Mr Cabal and other Mexican
investors bought for Dollars 536m in 1992, out of the UK bankruptcy
proceedings of Polly Peck International.
Coopers said Fresh Del Monte's problems with its shippers - it is out of
compliance with charter agreements on six ships - and recurring operating
losses 'raise substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a
going concern'. The company has also been hit by low fruit prices.
The Coopers statement is attached to a filing with the US Securities &amp;
Exchange Commission, as required by Del Monte's private placement last April
of Dollars 300m of 10-year notes with institutional investors, managed by
Morgan Stanley. It shows Fresh Del Monte had losses of Dollars 22m last
year, after losing Dollars 21.1m the year before.
The civil suit brought against Mr Cabal by Eastbrook and the financial
problems of Fresh Del Monte Produce are not related.
Mr Cabal, 37, rose to prominence after buying, with a group of investors,
Banco BCH (now known as Banco Union) for more than Dollars 300m in November
1991 from the Mexican government. In 1992, Mr Cabal and investors took over
Fresh Del Monte Produce. Last year, he took control of Banca Cremi. Banco
Union helped Mr Cabal finance the purchase of Fresh Del Monte Produce.
Last month, Mr Cabal was on the verge of acquiring Del Monte Foods Corp of
San Francisco for about Dollars 1bn (including company debt), when the deal
collapsed at the last moment. He was advised by Morgan Stanley in the
aborted acquisition.
The suit brought against Mr Cabal says two former employees of Eastbrook, Mr
Lus Vicente Arce and Mr Noushir Hasan, channeled more than Dollars 34m to Mr
Cabal's personal account, and more than Dollars 35m to shell companies,
without fully informing Eastbrook. The suit says the officials received
substantial financial benefit from Mr Cabal in return for making the loans.
Mr Kaufman said: 'The claim against Mr Cabal is without foundation and is
unwarranted because Mr Cabal has an unconditional release from Eastbrook'.
Mr Kaufman was referring to a settlement between Eastbrook and Mr Cabal or
the companies he represented, in which money was paid to the US company,
although there was no admission of any wrongdoing.
Mexico's finance ministry said no investigation was being opened into Mr
Cabal. Mexico's state development bank, Nafinsa, helped finance Mr Cabal's
purchase of Fresh Del Monte Produce; the ministry said it looked into Mr
Cabal's affairs when he bought BCH in 1991 and found nothing amiss.
Eastbrook's lawyers said the settlement between the finance house and Mr
Cabal only covered certain Cabal companies, and not Mr Cabal personally.
They maintained the settlement did not release the Mexican businessmen from
the current suit.
CORRECTION
In an article in the International Companies and Finance section of May 5
1994 headed 'Mexican Banker Faces Civil Action', we wrongly described Mr
Mahfouz as having pleaded guilty to charges arising out of the 'BCCI
investigation'.
We accept that last December the New York County District Attorney and the
Federal Reserve dropped all federal and state criminal and civil charges
against Khalid Bin Mahfouz in connection with their BCCI investigation.
We apologise to Mr Mahfouz for any distress or embarrassment that may have
been caused to him and his family by the error.

FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Cereal gains help raise Tate &amp; Lyle to
Pounds 131m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher profits from cereal sweeteners and starches helped Tate &amp; Lyle
increase interim pre-tax profits by 21.7 per cent to a better-than-expected
Pounds 130.9m.
The improvement in the cereal side more than offset lower profits from cane
and beet sugar operations. Mr Neil Shaw, chairman, said that profits in the
half-year to March 26 were greater than in the whole of 1988.
The outlook for the rest of the financial year to September 'remains
encouraging', he added. The interim dividend has been raised by 7 per cent
to 4.6p.
Group sales were up 7.5 per cent to Pounds 1.98bn, and operating profits
rose 14.5 per cent to Pounds 145.6m. Associate profits were ahead from
Pounds 4.8m to Pounds 6.2m. Net interest fell by Pounds 3.5m to Pounds
20.9m, with net borrowings down nearly Pounds 10m from Pounds 755.2m to
Pounds 745.4m.
Debt remained high as a proportion of net assets of Pounds 882.4m, up from
Pounds 820.9m, and will rise as a consequence of the Pounds 63.8m purchase
of a majority stake in Orsan, the French food additives business, announced
on Tuesday.
Mr Shaw said the Orsan deal was an important strategic move for Tate, taking
it into a new area - monosodium glutamate - and linking it with Ajinomoto,
the large Japanese food group.
Mr Paul Lewis, finance director, said that Pounds 100m invested in eastern
Europe was now beginning to see a return as activities there more than broke
even.
During the half-year, there was a further recovery in profits at Staley, the
US starches operation, which had suffered badly in 1992 from industry
overcapacity and the loss of Pepsi as a customer, as demand increased and
prices improved. Operating profits rose 39.5 per cent to Pounds 48.7m. 2
European cereal starch and sweetener profits rose 39.1 per cent to Pounds
29.9m, with an even greater margin gain, from 8.9 to 12.2 per cent.
Sugar refining profits fell although sales rose. In North America sales rose
9.6 per cent, but lower profits in Canada cut operating profits for the
region 4 per cent to Pounds 16.6m, as a sugar surplus affected prices.
Within that Domino, the US beet sugar refiner, increased profits.
In the UK, sugar refining profits were down from Pounds 33.7m to Pounds
30.6m, hit by a Pounds 3.3m pension provision.
After a higher tax rate, fully diluted earnings per share rose 12.6 per cent
to 17.9p.

Mr Giorgio Benevenuto, a former union leader who briefly led Italy's
Socialists after Mr Bettino Craxi was forced to step down in February 1993,
was told yesterday he was under investigation for alleged corruption related
to overseas aid contracts. Milan magistrates, meanwhile, have asked for
passports to be withdrawn from 22 former politicians, mostly members of the
previous Andreotti government and former party leaders. They include Mr
Craxi, who is currently in temporary 'exile' at his Tunis holiday home.

<TEXT>
The populist Northern League led by Mr Umberto Bossi is holding up the
formation of Italy's 53rd postwar government by insisting on his party being
given the key Interior Ministry portfolio. The dispute over the post was due
to have been settled on Tuesday night at dinner hosted by Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the premier-designate and Forza Italia leader, for Mr Bossi and
Mr Gianfranco Fini, head of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance. The
MSI/NA is the third main partner in the Freedom Alliance that won the March
general elections. Yesterday, however, the issue was still unresolved and Mr
Bossi called for a 'period of reflection'. He threatened earlier this week
to stay out of the government if the League failed to get the post for one
of its members; the principal candidate is Mr Roberto Maroni, the movement's
number two. Mr Bossi is gambling that Mr Berlusconi will not wish to form a
government with the neo-fascist MSI as Forza Italia's main ally.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Italians stall deal to purchase Ekostahl

<TEXT>
The future of eastern Germany's largest steel mill was yesterday thrown into
jeopardy after Riva, the Italian privately-owned steel company, said it
could not acquire the plant under the current arrangements.
Officials from the Treuhand privatisation agency said however, that a new
round of talks would take place next week. Earlier in the day, Ms Birgit
Breuel, Treuhand president, and Mr Emilio Riva had met in Berlin in an
attempt to solve the dispute between Riva and IG Metall, Germany's large
engineering union. At issue is the way in which Riva will reduce the
workforce this year, what it will do with Ekostahl's subsidiary companies,
and the composition of the supervisory board.
If Riva decided at this late stage in the negotiations not to buy Ekostahl,
it would further weaken attempts by the Treuhand privatisation agency to
privatise the loss-making mill, as well undermine chances for securing 3,000
jobs at the plant.
It would also represent an acute embarrassment for Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the
German economics minister, who had last year successfully lobbied the
European Commission to back a DM1bn (Dollars 500m) modernisation package for
Ekostahl. That deal undoubtedly made Ekostahl a more attractive proposition
for Riva, but at the same time it enraged the west German steel
manufacturers, who have had to make substantial cuts in order to reduce
over-capacity.
It had been earlier agreed that Riva would reduce the 3,000 workforce by 700
by the end of this year. IG Metall had assumed the workers would be phased
out. But Riva intended to put them on 'zero' short-time work from May 1,
effectively removing them from the mill altogether.
Moreover, both sides cannot agree on the 11th person on the supervisory
board. Ten seats are equally divided between workers' representatives and
Riva, while the 11th is supposed to be neutral.
'A serious clash between two different cultures has taken place at this late
stage,' a Treuhand official said. He denied that Riva, faced with
overcapacity in the steel industry throughout the European Union, was simply
using the dispute with IG Metall as an excuse to pull out of buying Ekostahl
altogether.
'We do not see any hidden motive in this dispute,' the Treuhand official
continued. 'Riva has been confronted with a tradition of seeking consensus
within German industry, while the unions have been confronted with a typical
medium-sized private Italian company which is used to making its own
decisions as it sees fit,' he added.
Riva, however, has had previous experience with Germany's industrial
relations. It bought the east German steel plant at Hennigsdorf in 1992.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
West German industrial orders rose for the third month in a row in March,
showing an increase of almost 3 per cent over the previous month, and
reinforcing expectations of economic recovery.
Export orders rose by 5.8 per cent and domestic industrial orders by 1.2 per
cent, but domestic consumer demand continued to flag, with consumer goods
orders declining by 3.7 per cent in the same period.
The best performing sector was capital goods, with orders up 5 per cent,
according to economics ministry figures. Orders for raw materials and
intermediate goods were up 3 per cent.
Industrial production figures for March are expected to show an increase of
between 1.5 and 2 per cent, after a rise of 1.3 per cent in February, the
first rises in nearly two years. They suggest that the rise in export orders
is already feeding through into production.
Some economists suggested yesterday that the strength of the improved
figures and indications of growing confidence in the economic outlook might
prompt an upward revision of growth forecasts. Most economists expect the
west German economy to grow between 0.5 and one per cent this year, while
the government forecasts a rise of 1 per cent.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Scientists fight bill on French language
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's scientific establishment yesterday made a last-ditch effort to
water down the government's controversial new language bill by appealing to
the national assembly not to make French compulsory in conferences where
non-French speaking scientists are in the majority.
Mr Jacques Toubon, the culture minister, has presented his language bill -
requiring the use of French in contracts, product labelling, advertising and
the media as well as in conferences held in France - as essential to
preserving the French language from the onslaught of what he calls
anglo-marchand, or business English.
Otherwise, French would eventually go the way of Latin and ancient Greek, he
warned MPs this week.
The national assembly was due late last night to take a final vote on the
bill, which passed the Senate last month.
One of its clauses, Article 5, would require the interpretation and
translation into French of papers and proceedings of any conference
organised by French citizens in France, though other languages could equally
be used. An amendment to limit this requirement only to conferences
receiving government support was defeated in the senate.
The Toubon bill has pitted France's august 'academies' against each other.
The Academie Francaise strongly backs the bill but its sister institution,
the Academie des Sciences, yesterday returned to the fray against Article 5,
urging deputies to limit it to conferences where French scientists are 'in a
large majority'.
French scientists, notably the Pasteur Institute and the science academy
itself, already carry articles in English as well as in French in their
publications. The science academy said yesterday that in big conferences
which France has promoted in cities such as Paris and Nice, 'it would be
practically impossible to ensure a French version of resumes and financially
impossible to ensure simultaneous translation'.
The whole point of such conferences was to spread the findings of French
science throughout the world, the academy said, and this was often only
possible through the medium of English.
Though the bill is sure to go through in some form, the conservative
government ironically finds itself backed solidly by the communists, but
with many sceptics about the bill among its own backbenchers, as well as
among opposition Socialists.
Mr Pierre Lellouche, a Gaullist RPR deputy whose English is excellent, said
that while French undoubtedly needed to be saved from further 'degradation',
he doubted that the use of it could be legislated.
Mr Didier Mathus, a Socialist deputy, queried whether the image of French
needing to be 'protected by a policeman with a big stick' was the right one
for the health of the language.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (35): Grounds for guarded optimism - Although
there is as yet no cause for real celebration, encouraging signs for
exporters are beginning to emerge / Guest Column, Malcolm Stephens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a common - and, indeed very human - trait to feel that you are living
and working in more difficult conditions than any previous occupant of your
desk. This has certainly been true of the exporters, trade and export
finance bankers and credit insurers among whom I have worked for more than
30 years.
Yet perhaps now a number of things are looking a little better than they
have done for some years.
Most people who export or provide export services have seen a decade or more
where few of the many changes have seemed for the better.
From the norm of one or two countries being unable to pay their debts at any
one time, the international debt crisis has rapidly led to not only more
than 50 countries in serious default and rescheduling their export credit
debts with the Paris Club, but also to the spread of what is euphemistically
called 'debt forgiveness'.
Some see the latter as an insidious trend to rewarding poor performing
debtors, while others see it as coming to terms with reality. Whichever is
true, it is expensive for those who pick up the bill.
For many, things went from bad to worse when debt problems in the developing
world coincided with deep and prolonged recession in OECD countries and the
collapse of a whole trading system in eastern Europe.
As a result, ministries of finance and treasuries sought to control the
provision of export credit by state agencies and enforce significantly
higher premium rates (some, such as those in the UK Treasury more vigorously
and 'successfully' than others). Credit committees of banks also decided
that cross-border lending was no longer an activity they found attractive.
In addition, exporting companies found unprecedented competition in those
relatively fewer markets combining demand and creditworthy buyers.
In wondering if things are now looking a little brighter, I am not among
those who feel that the debt crisis is over. The debtor queue has got
longer, rather than shorter in the past year and some of those joining it
have uncomfortably large debts.
My reasons for suggesting some optimism are partly psychological, but they
also arise from that fact that the depth of the problems have forced changes
of policy in many institutions, not only public and private, but also among
multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
There are clear signs that the recession in the OECD is lifting. This is of
special importance to those countries whose exports are concentrated on OECD
buyers. Low interest rates also help. While the overall picture is patchy,
the next year should see exports rise and buyer insolvencies and defaults
fall.
Another encouraging sign for exporters in OECD countries should be the
increasing competition between credit insurers, especially in the vital area
of short-term business. The traditional role of government in this area is
being questioned and is changing.
This is not restricted to the UK - where the worst fears of exporters over
the privatisation of ECGD's short-term business have simply not been
realised. Indeed, privatisation has opened up the whole market and more than
10 insurers - including some of Europe's biggest - now claim to offer credit
insurance in the UK. This increase in competition is improving service to
exporters, but is exerting downward pressure on premium rates.
There are also signs that capital goods exports to non-OECD markets are
picking up, although there is some 'skewing' in the concentration of demand
in Asia and the Far East. It is for these sort of exports that the infamous
'level playing field' is of most significance and it is arguable that
cross-border differences in facilities have lessened in most areas, apart
from that of premium rates.
Greater discipline has been attached, via the OECD Consensus, to the
application of interest rates, long-term credit and mixed credits.
Indeed, some would argue that, as interest rate subsidies have been phased
out, some flexibility in the length and repayment profile of projects should
be allowed (even encouraged), particularly on limited recourse projects. No
one, for example, expects say a Metro system in Belgium to pay for itself in
six or seven years, so why should it do so in a non-OECD country?
Even in the sensitive area of premium rates, some of the high rate countries
(especially the UK) have reduced many of their rates and increasingly
determined efforts are being made within the European Union and the OECD to
find a standard for premium rate-setting to reduce current disparities.
Another encouraging sign is the greater willingness of the international
financial institutions, especially the EBRD and the World Bank, to work with
the export credit agencies (ECAs).
A more flexible approach is needed if co-financing is to take place on any
scale. The international financial institutions have not been alone in
misunderstanding the ECAs' role (and how it differs from that of aid
administration agencies) and in underestimating the financial and other
pressures ECAs are under from ministries of finance and, increasingly, from
legislators to avoid claims and losses of the past.
The EBRD is looking at what needs to be done for and with the ECAs to
produce co-financing and thus improve the gearing international institutions
can achieve from sharing in the financing of a project. Some of the signs
are good, but there is a long way to go.
Another helpful trend is the greater emphasis on project financing and
limited recourse financing. This is a useful technique for some projects and
some buyers and buying countries.
Translating the theory into practice is not always easy but provided banks
and contractors are willing to share risks with the ECAs the willingness of
institutions to put time, effort and money into areas such as developing
skills to handle such financings will bear valuable fruit.
The key may well be to steer clear of unrealistic expectations and to look
more kindly at those who lend and take risks rather than those who simply
advise.
In suggesting that there are grounds for guarded optimism among exporters, I
stop short of euphoria. This is partly because a number of the factors
mentioned above represent signs of change, rather than fully-fledged
developments.
Optimism must, therefore, be tempered by the fact that all involved with
exports and the financing and insuring of trade must face up to a series of
difficult questions, the solution to many of which will involve the
slaughtering of sacred cows.
Who, for example, is going to finance sales, especially of capital goods and
projects to the poorest countries? Who is going to finance large but vital
infrastructure (non-foreign exchange earning) projects, not only in Russia,
but also in a long list of developing countries? How long will it take to
invent and develop mechanisms for export credit and export finance which
facilitate multi-sourcing for large projects? Are the capital markets a
reliable source of finance for projects and do they have any appetite for
risks or risk sharing? Will the availability of such funds for projects
survive either a rise in US interest rates or the first signs os a debtor
going to the Paris Club?
With the spread of privatisation and the desire of an increasing number of
governments to withdraw from commercial and industrial activities and
involvement of many kinds, what is the future, for example of the World
Bank's traditional insistence on government guarantees and preferred
creditor status? How long will it take for a legal and financial
infrastructure to develop in Russia and other former Comecon countries such
that it is possible to make credit rating judgements on individual buyers
and to find acceptable commercial banks to extend guarantees?
Until we have begun to find answers to some of these questions, I doubt it
is possible to be really optimistic.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (33): Global inspector keeps a low profile -
Profile of the world's largest provider of import-export services for both
public and private sector organisations / Societe Generale de Surveillance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Geneva based Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS) is the world's largest
international trade inspection, testing and verification organisation,
operating in more than 140 countries through 1,170 offices and 309
laboratories staffed by 31,000 people.
The group claims its services facilitate the execution of transactions,
increase the safety and long-term reliability of plant and equipment and
prevent the disruption of delivery and production schedules.
SGS and its competitors are best known for providing import and export
verification services for governments and aid organisations to ensure goods
delivered are what the customer ordered and that they are delivered to the
proper recipient and invoiced at a fair price.
In the mid-1980s, these activities were occasionally contested. In 1987, the
US's International Trade Commission (ITC) took up complaints from US
exporters that SGS and other inspection companies used unfair trade
practices in their pre-shipment inspection of US exports.
SGS had been hired by 25 developing countries that suspected they were being
overcharged for what they ordered. The ITC eventually backed away from the
case.
In 1985, the Indonesian government hired SGS to overhaul its notoriously
corrupt customs service and inspect all imports in countries supplying them.
This had an immediate impact on the speed with which goods cleared
Indonesian customs and on costs. The Indonesian government has since renewed
the contract, probably SGS's largest, several times.
SGS was founded in the 1870s when Mr Henri Goldstuck, a young Baltic
refugee, persuaded a French oats merchant to pay him a commission for
improving the handling and storage of his grain.
The agriculture sector accounts for an eighth of the group's SFr2.6bn
revenues last year, and its expertise now covers 250 commodities and
products. The group's services to the natural resources industries centre on
quality inspections supported by sophisticated laboratories. These sectors
account for about a fifth of group revenues.
SGS drew attention in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Some of its directors
wanted it to diversify into higher value activities. Others felt it had to
avoid conventional manufacturing or service businesses because of potential
conflicts of interest. They enlisted Elisabeth Salina Amorini, a leader of
the younger generation of the controlling families, in their cause. Four
directors resigned in 1989 and Mrs Salina, a lawyer with London investment
banking experience, became chairman.
The group's recent expansions have been into insurance adjusting and
inspection and monitoring services for the environment, health care and
biosciences industries. SGS officials say these fields are consistent with
group policy. 'All of our businesses assess values or technical conditions
on new or used goods,' a spokesman says.

France's leading inspection company, Bureau Veritas, is one of those
discreetly private organisations that rarely, if ever, make the headlines.
Seventy per cent of its equity is still in the hands of the families that
founded the company in 1828 and the remainder is held by French financial
institutions and members of staff.
No single spectacular project marks the bureau's widening business
portfolio. Even its low-rise head office in the modern Parisian business
district of La Defense is shielded from too much direct view by the
glass-sided tower blocks that surround it.
Originally created as a certifying agency for new ships - an activity that
still accounts for 26 per cent of total turnover - Bureau Veritas is today
diversifying into areas such as the certification of corporate quality
assurance systems and civil and environmental engineering. Exporters and
importers especially know the Veritas name because the company carries out
pre-shipment inspections for half a dozen governments in Africa and Latin
America, as well as inspecting export merchandise for private sector
customers.
'At first sight what we do looks like a very mixed bag of tricks, but in
fact throughout our operations we exercise the same basic central task. This
is to anticipate and limit business risks by checking and helping to improve
quality and security,' says Gerard Coffinet, executive vice-president and
chief executive for France of Bureau Veritas.
The Bureau Veritas Group employs about 5,000 staff and maintains more than
500 offices in around 100 different countries. France accounts for more than
a quarter of this total, with the rest of Europe contributing roughly the
same percentage. Some of the group's activities, particularly supervision of
public works and construction projects, are centred on the local French
market. Most of the rest are increasingly international.
In 1992 - the most recent year for which figures are available - net
post-tax profits for the group came to FFr48.8m (Pounds 5.6m) on a total
turnover of FFr1.7bn (Pounds 197.6m). Fourteen per cent of 1992 sales
revenues are derived from the commodities and international trade sector, 29
per cent from civil and environmental engineering, 21 per cent from the
industrial sector and 10 per cent from aeronautics and space.
'Our strategy is not to be number one in terms of size, but to strive to
maintain the highest standards of quality in our work and gain an
international reputation for offering the most reliable services in our
sectors of activity. This reputation is our main capital,' says Mr Coffinet.
'In our line of work it is particularly important to be - and to appear
clearly to be - independent. Partly for this reason, our different sectoral
activities are split off into separate operating subsidiaries,' he says. 'We
are also helped in this respect by the fact that, because of the nature of
our work, we have no dominant client who could exert pressure on our
decision making processes.'
International trade provides one of the fastest growing areas of activity
for Bureau Veritas, second only to the industrial sector. In 1992, for
example, sales volumes for the former increased by 9.3 per cent over the
total for the previous year. Moreover, within this sector a specialised
subsidiary called Bivac International handles import supervision programmes
on behalf of client governments.
At present, Bureau Veritas has such contracts with the governments of
Nigeria, Kenya, Madagascar, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Peru. Recently, it
obtained a contract from Mexico. 'In view of the risk situations involved,
including political and payment risks, we would not want the percentage of
our total turnover earned from this activity to rise much above, say, 15 per
cent,' says Gilles Minard, chairman and president of Bivac International.
This means increasing turnover in other fields rather than restricting
import supervision work.
'Our basic objective under import supervisory contracts is to ensure that
goods are in accordance with the stipulated quality and quantity
specifications and that the price falls within normal parameters,' says Mr
Minard.
At the same time, Veritas is trying to extend its service into related areas
by providing developing country customs authorities with technical
assistance to secure customs receipts. Madagascar provides one example of
this approach.
'Contrary to the suspicions of some exporters, our import supervision fees
are based solely on the contract value of the goods, and we are not paid a
percentage of any price reductions that may be obtained as a result of our
checking procedures,' Mr Minard says.
'I can understand why some companies dislike this procedure, since it makes
it difficult for them to charge different prices in different markets as a
matter of commercial policy rather than on the basis of objective cost
differences.
'At the same time, I would say that as a result of the growing use of import
supervision programmes since the 1970s, cases of outright export frauds
against developing countries have become much rarer. Today, one of the main
problems is the tendency of manufacturers and sellers in industrialised
countries to get rid of products that no longer comply with increasingly
stringent local safety and environmental regulations by dumping them in the
third world,' Mr Minard says.
An important strand in Bureau Veritas's overall strategy in recent years has
been to move upstream from inspection of finished products to handling risk
control at the design stage.
One example is the group's British subsidiary, BVQI. This certifies
corporate quality systems in accordance with the so-called international ISO
9000 standard. 'In this area we do not inspect the product. We certify the
quality of the company's procedures,' says Mr Coffinet.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (31): Not everyone has come aboard - Efforts to
create a level playing field for exporters have a long way to go /
International standards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The emergence of global trading blocks and the opening of frontiers to the
freer flow of goods have given impetus to the view that international
standards can help trade grow, while protecting consumers from unsuitable
products.
Standardisation is an important consideration in a company's development
plan, but it generates mixed emotions. Ignored by many companies until they
find their product is outside the specifications of the export market they
seek, some non-European exporters say Europe-wide standards are a block on
their business.
Within Europe, there are complaints that multinationals show little
enthusiasm for introducing standards which would allow a much wider number
of companies to trade across Europe.
The EU strongly denies that standards are a block on trade. It allocates
funds and technical assistance to strengthening standards bodies in
developing country trading partners. It has also started work on the
difficult process of bringing standards closer together. This centres on the
mutual recognition of certification and testing bodies in the different
European countries.
The introduction of standards usually follows a period of industry
consultation. Except in the most controversial cases, it rarely makes
headlines. So quiet is the process that a lack of lobbying by consumer
groups is, arguably, apparent in the drawing up of European standards.
Few industry groups, for example, have bothered to reply to EU requests for
ideas in drawing up mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) with the US, Japan
and other leading trading partners. The EU argues that industry input is
essential in drawing up lists of priority products to be included in the
planned MRAs.
The Geneva-based International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) is
responsible for drawing up international standards, including the ISO9000
quality assurance standard. CEN, the European Committee for Standardisation,
is responsible for introducing identical standards across Europe - a key
element in the EU's single market initiative.
While Europe has taken a lead in the move towards international standards,
other trading blocs, including the North American Free Trade Area and Japan,
are taking a closer interest. But, even in Europe, the move to international
standards remains a long-term process. 'It took Germany 50 years to build a
strong caucus of standards,' says Jacques Repussard, CEN secretary general.
'To replace this and construct them at a European level will take 30 to 40
years.'
Mr Repussard expects 80 per cent of national standards included in the EU's
single market directives to be harmonised in 1995-96. But these account for
only about 10 per cent of the standards covered by CEN. Mr Repussard says
CEN's long-term plan is to produce 10,000 standards, of which 1,200 are
published and 2,000 more are under way.
The aim of all this, Mr Repussard says, 'is to have a level playing field
for the economy'. The main beneficiaries are small and medium-size companies
(SMEs) who, when they only have to take one standard into account, can trade
more easily across borders. Multinationals have invested to meet national
standards in a range of markets. In some cases, they have tried to block
measures 'which would allow SMEs into their garden,' Mr Repussard says. 'A
more level playing field means more people playing in it.'
The EU plans to go further by concluding mutual recognition agreements
(MRAs) authorising bodies in countries with reciprocal agreements to certify
that goods meet EU requirements. Exploratory talks on MRAs with 10 leading
trading partners were held in 1992-93. Full negotiations recently started
with Australia, New Zealand and Canada and are planned shortly with the US.
The EU has identified four areas in which MRAs could reduce barriers:
differing technical requirements at national, state, provincial and local
levels; a lack of transparency in the operation of standardisation and
certification systems; labelling, marking and intellectual property
barriers; differences in product liability requirements.
In spite of the willingness of countries to enter into talks on
standardisation, the process could take a long time, officials say.
'Australia and New Zealand know the European market is important and are
ready to make their systems evolve to meet ours,' a European official says.
US agencies are active in CEN and other European committees and have
observer status in the ISO. But when it comes to more profound change,
powerful opposition exists among federal agencies, industrial associations
and local government.
Japan has proved most reluctant to enter talks, and has only recently made a
first step by opening negotiations on a good laboratory practices agreement.
Outside Europe and the OECD, exporters often complain that the
implementation of rigorous standards blocks their access to markets.
Developing local standards bodies and mutual recognition capacity is
essential. In many cases, including Russia, technical assistance is seen as
more important than immediate agreements.
Bodies such as the certification agencies SGS and Veritas, and Resource, a
British Standards Institute affiliate, have been active analysing these
countries' needs and, in some cases, helping to establish testing and
certification bodies to meet international standards.
Studies have been financed through the Commission's Phare Programme for
central and eastern Europe and the Tacis programme for the former Soviet
Union. Studies have been carried out in Latin America, the Asean region and
India. Under way are projects in Singapore, Vietnam and Indonesia.
Mr Repussard says that CEN's emphasis on promoting standards bodies in
emerging markets has been much appreciated in eastern Europe, where
'governments say for the first time we have something European'.
Poland and other ex-communist countries still work under the old Comecon
standards system known as Gost, but Poland and Hungary are now involved in
about 100 CEN technical committees and will probably be full members by the
end of the century.
Similar radical change is expected even in the most advanced economies. In
the next few years standardisation procedures will increasingly be required
for fast-developing information technology and services industries.
'The challenge for CEN is to get everyone on board for the massive
negotiations ahead,' Mr Repussard says. It may not prove an easy task.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (30): Trade mixed with trade and aid under
scrutiny - The OECD's 'Helsinki rules' aim to distinguish projects that
should be aid-funded from those that are commercially viable. But in
developing country infrastructure deals, this is not always easy /
Subsidised credits
</HEADLINE>

TRADE ISSUES: harmonised European export credit insurance terms,
standardisation and quality controls must be in place to permit fair play
Telecommunications contracts in developing countries have followed a pattern
in recent years. Companies such as Ericsson, Siemens or Alcatel would bid
for the order. The client would then press for the most advantageous
financing package, as well as the best price and most appropriate
technology.
The suppliers' government - either where the mother company or its bidding
subsidiary is based - might then offer a mixture of export credit and
subsidies linked to its aid programme to secure the order.
Until recently, this has been standard practice in North Africa, Asia and
other regions where 'mixed credits' are common and without the use of grant
aid a contract could be beyond the reach of even the best qualified bidder.
When Tunisia issued tenders for 880,000 new telephone lines, companies
rushed in as usual. Ericsson offered soft credits backed by BITS, the
Swedish Agency for International Economic and Technical Co-operation.
Alcatel offered French credit and Siemens bid with mixed credits through its
Belgian subsidiary ATEA. Other bidders included the US arm of Northern
Telecom and AT&amp;T. Letters of intent were awarded to ATEA Siemens for 360,000
lines, Ericsson and Alcatel Tunisie each for 80,000 lines.
However, the start of work was delayed when other bidders intervened to
argue that subsidised credits were ruled out by the so-called Helsinki
rules, introduced by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) in 1991 to limit the use of aid to non-commercial
projects.
The 'Helsinki rules' are based on the conviction that there must be a level
playing field in international trade and the allocation of aid must be based
on developmental criteria alone and attempt to control the use of subsidies
for projects which could be viewed as commercial.
This assumes that the mobilisation of aid-assisted funding disadvantages
bidders in what are essentially commercial contracts. The leading advocates
of this view are the US and Britain.
The annual Development Co-operation report for 1993, published by the OECD's
Development Assistance Committee, opens with the assumption that 'the
context in which donors administer aid is altering dramatically'.
Donors are confronted with much greater demand for their aid than even a few
years ago, the OECD says. They must scrutinise their use of export credits
and stop linking aid to exports.
For Tunisia this has meant renegotiations of pricing and financing.
Diplomats complain that their companies who offered the usual mixed credit
packages have been disadvantaged.
Meanwhile, another bidder who offered industrial offset, the North Carolina
arm of Northern Telecom, has secured a 360,000-line order, underlining the
potential for securing orders by offering other forms of incentive.
Under its offset proposal, Northern Telecom committed itself to purchasing
equipment worth at least Dollars 25m from local firms and will invest
locally to create a network of subcontractors.
The critical issue in Helsinki is what constitutes a commercially viable
contract which should not now receive aid funding. Given the way that
previously soft financing has been mobilised to support large-scale
infrastructure and capital goods contracts, the ramifications of this could
be enormous.
'Helsinki provides a whole set of terms the outside world has not yet taken
into account,' says Malcolm Stephens, secretary-general of the Berne Union,
the International Union of Credit and Investment Insurers.
'The development of the Helsinki package will be a major trend in the OECD
over the next few years, in particular clarification of what is
'commercially viable' as a practical matter,' says Brian Willott, chief
executive of the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD).
Can, for example, an infrastructure project be a development project,
eligible for aid funding, if a private company erects and runs a project,
such as a power station, which must eventually earn revenue from the scheme?
Interpretation of what should be aid-funded and which projects are
commercially viable appears to focus mainly on two important sectors,
telecommunications and energy.
The trend towards privatised companies entering non-OECD infrastructure
projects suggests that such schemes are commercial, even if they also have
well-defined developmental goals and might also be funded by agencies such
as the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank.
'The eventual idea must be to leave aid and mixed credits to large
infrastructure projects which no-one else will fund,' says one observer.
'The problem is agreeing how you move to this ideal state. There is
obviously a fair degree of bad feeling within the OECD committee.'
The move to Helsinki rules is also posing problems for non-OECD recipients
of finance. China has differed with the OECD over telecoms contracts.
Beijing insists these are not commercially available and qualify for mixed
credits.
This forms part of China's wider policy to secure the maximum financing at
the lowest possible cost, which has also brought Beijing into conflict with
the OECD over its call for sub-consensus interest rates.
Application of the Helsinki rules is the responsibility of an OECD group
which meets 11 times each year. Twenty-two of the OECD's 24 member nations
subscribe, and consider themselves bound by the group's conclusions. It is
for member governments to present any potentially aid-funded projects for
consideration.
According to an official in Paris, if the project 'smells like a rose',
agreement is given to go ahead. If the project 'smells of something else,
they the group talk about it'.
A growing number of countries have found their offers of aid to back
contracts rejected. Trade officials say that Austria has lost out on several
recent orders, including contracts in Indonesia, after Helsinki rules were
invoked.
The US, UK and some other governments are looking for more still. 'We would
expect to see a further stage of Helsinki, eliminating the subsidised
interest rate for the least-developed countries and a number of other
elements in that package,' says Mr Willott.
The mixture of aid and trade is a difficult area in which to find consensus.
One European official comments that even a staunch commitment to the level
playing field 'does not stop the US or Britain using their own war chests
when the contract suits them'.
Application of the Helsinki rules can no longer be ignored by exporters  -
who, like the bidders for Tunisian telecommunications orders, are learning
that the rules themselves can also become an active element in the struggle
for international contracts.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (28): Better the devil you know - Western
bankers are reluctant to do business with new banks in eastern Europe /
Credit watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JON MARKS

<TEXT>
Eastern European import demand for capital and consumer goods is prodigious.
But so are the problems facing exporters seeking secure payment across a
range of markets in the region. The availability of - particularly -
confirmed letters of credit (l/cs) is, at best, patchy.
Fundamentally, exporters and their bankers remain concerned about doing
business with new corporate and financial institutions, rather than the old,
familiar state-backed giants of the communist era.
'The further east you go, the more the newer banks have no correspondent
relations,' says the London-based trade finance manager of a leading eastern
European bank. 'Fewer and fewer western banks will confirm l/cs involving
the growing number of new banks - on most of which they have no
information,' he says.
The number of banks involved in east-west trade is growing, providing a
much-enhanced network which is helping l/c-based business where conditions
are appropriate. Availability and terms of l/cs varies from market to
market.
Poland: the recent agreement between Warsaw and its London Club of
commercial creditors has helped to boost western confidence. And, in any
case, in recent months exporters have been willing to do business on an open
account basis - after balancing improved risk perceptions against the cost
of l/c cover.
But where l/c cover is required it is generally available for up to 180
days, although longer deferred payments are being requested and arranged.
Confirmations are still mainly on state-owned banks.
Hungary: reports suggest confirmed l/cs are less commonly mobilised than in
most other east European markets. 'It is generally seen as a happy market',
says the export finance manager of a big UK company. Much business is
focused on a sight (immediate payment) l/c basis. However, for those
Hungarian buyers seeing credit, deferred payment l/cs tend not to pose a
problem - depending on the individual risks involved.
The forfait market may also provide a solution. The London-based Hungarian
International Bank and other specialist operations are offering up to
360-day funding - and more in some cases - depending on the specific risks.
Romania and Bulgaria: in spite of these countrys' structural economic
problems, confirmed l/cs of up to 180 days are available for selected
buyers.
Russia: eventual debt deals with the country's Paris and London official and
commercial club creditors will help to ease difficulties associated with
l/c-based business with Russian clients. Arrears on some debts have risen
beyond two years with banks unwilling to participate in l/c arrangements.
Ukraine: Deals are possible backed by confirmed l/cs, but payments problems
and the exhaustion of credit lines makes the confirmation component highly
problematic. Kazakhstan: a short-term (up to 180-day) market is emerging,
encouraged by Kazakhstan's hydrocarbons and minerals income. Confirmations
on Alembank, formerly the local branch of the Soviet Vneshekonombank, are
reported.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (29): Iranian arrears a worry for banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Payments arrears on Iranian l/cs remain one of the most pressing issues
facing exporters and their banks. Arrears are conservatively estimated at
Dollars 7bn.
It is now accepted that these problems require a structured debt deal, but
Teheran rejects Paris Club rescheduling. Export credit agencies (ECAs) and
creditor banks in four countries have recently recognised this by agreeing
debt relief worth an estimated Dollars 5.6bn on a bilateral basis. Arrears
on l/cs of up to 14 months are reported by European banks, although
collection experience is mixed. Long-established suppliers with priority
state clients, for example, still tend to be paid on time.
Germany has led the way with a ground-breaking debt agreement on debts
covered by official export credit insurer Hermes worth Dollars 2.3bn. This
contradicted US opposition to trading partners providing additional support
for Teheran. The deal gives two years' grace, with repayments over 48 months
for completion on 31 December 1999. Three agreements, announced in March
with Japan, Austria and Switzerland, follow a similar pattern.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (27): Not all the news is good - While Latin
America is a rich source of business, interest rates are a concern /
Forfaiting market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JON MARKS

<TEXT>
Export credit agencies (ECAs) and commercial banks are meeting a growing
proportion of Latin America's huge appetite for capital goods. But there are
still many occasions when a lack of 'capacity' among conventional financiers
make the funding of exports problematic. It is then a forfaiter may step in.
'You can get export credits in countries like Mexico, Brazil and Argentina,
but even then the price may not be right,' a forfaiting specialist says. 'At
those times the margins offered by forfaiters are competitive and exporters
come to us'.
Hungarian International Bank (HIB), a leading forfaiter in the London
market, reports a large number of Latin American transactions. HIB says most
of these are for capital goods worth up to Dollars 5m. Heavy demand for such
funding is reported from EU companies. HIB notes increased interest from UK
exporters, notably into Uruguay.
Forfaiters are active in countries such as Colombia and Ecuador, which lack
ECA capacity, and in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil where they compete with
banks offering other financing instruments.
Forfaiting can answer an exporter's need to generate cash flow and avoid the
payments risks. The forfaiter, usually the specialised department of a bank,
buys the exporter's debt at a discount, providing the exporter with cash
up-front. The forfaiter must be sure the debt is a good risk and thus worth
buying. In this respect it seeks good quality guarantors (in market jargon
avalisers) for the debt. Also it often spreads the risk by selling all or
part of the debt in the secondary market.
Forfaiters were involved in a steady flow of Latin American business even
before the bond market boom made the region fashionable again. Forfaiters
have re-emerged, even in Peru - an 'exotic' market in banker's parlance,
where it is difficult to finance deals. In markets such as Brazil it has
become much easier to do longer term deals.
But all is not good news. The desirability of transacting forfait deals
depends on wider market conditions and these seem more adverse in 1994 than
in 1993.
Forfaiters are reluctant to give details of transactions, but market
soundings suggest the number of larger deals, worth over Dollars 10m each,
they will be prepared to accept will be less this year than last. Deals of
Dollars 500,000 to Dollars 5m remain the norm. Smaller than that and costs
are usually prohibitive.
While operations in Latin America give forfaiters some satisfaction, some
have expressed pessimism about the level of funding they will be providing
this year.
There are concerns over interest rates. The forfaiting market traditionally
responds negatively to higher rates because most deals are transacted at
fixed interest rates. If rates rise, the forfaiters' profits are cut; if
they fall profits rise.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (24): Britain: taking initiatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK FORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opportunities to produce international consultancy work funded by
multilateral lending agencies are being seized by UK firms. In addition to
consulting engineers - which have long formed the backbone of the UK
consulting sector - new markets are emerging for firms which can provide
expertise in a range of disciplines, including architecture, electronics,
urban and rural development, agriculture and human resource management.
Still more opportunities exist for consultancy firms working in EU
programmes, such as Phare and Tacis, where a multilateral approach was
considered the most effective way to give technical assistance and know-how
to the new democracies in eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet
bloc.
The UK consultancy sector generates some Dollars 2bn each year in invisible
earnings and evidence that some of the business comes from firms successful
in bidding for work funded by multilateral lending agencies is demonstrated
by the sector's share in key markets. In procurement work financed through
the World Bank, for example, UK firms are among the top providers of
consultancy services.
Tony Boam, director of the British Consultants Bureau which promotes UK
consultancy firms abroad, points out that UK consultants have featured
strongly in a large number of Tacis initiatives and, at one time, accounted
for 50 per cent of Phare projects.
Consultancy firms are naturally reticent when it comes to divulging their
recipes for successful bidding strategies, but there is clearly a store of
commonly used ingredients. Careful preparatory work is essential:
Scanning publications such as the United Nations' Development Business, the
World Bank's Monthly Operational Summary of Proposed Projects or the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's Procurement
Opportunities;
Registering on consultants' rosters maintained by the funding agencies and
keeping abreast of their activities;
Researching the local markets in which opportunities might occur;
Establishing which local organisations will ultimately commission work;
If possible, visiting these organisations. With the exception of some
small-scale consultancies, the local organisation decides which firm will be
commissioned, although the multilateral lending agencies or EU programme
administrators define the method of selection and may influence the
decision-making process.
Some larger consultancy firms have opened local offices in markets where
opportunities are likely to arise. Being close to the customer strengthens a
bid and if it is proposed that local as well as UK staff are used and, even
better, trained in new skills, then the commissioning organisation may well
feel there is added value in such a bid. Howard Moody works for the
consultancy firm Eastern European Enterprise in the Czechinvest initiative
within the Phare programme which aims to attract foreign direct investment
to the Czech Republic.
As one of three UK consultants working alongside 15 Czech nationals, Mr
Moody feels that a characteristic of UK consultants is their ability to
transfer knowledge to their national colleagues in a way that is applicable
in a local context.
'The common thread among UK consultants is that they are very practical,
able to get their sleeves rolled up and work alongside nationals . . .
unless a consultant has practical experience, forget it.'

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (26): Germany: wary of global work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ironically, given Germany's world economic status, its consultants remain
wary about bidding for contracts backed by international development
agencies, such as the World Bank. They argue such institutions use
unfamiliar working practices, many of them Anglo-American.
Some German consultants concede that their Dutch and Danish counterparts
play a more important role internationally, while others admit that having
to submit bids in English - often the working language of European Union
institutions and international agencies - makes them reluctant to seek
international work.
Some even say they steer clear of funding organisations such as the World
Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD),
because of what one consultant describes as a culture 'heavily dominated by
Anglo-Americans'.
Another agency which often tends not to find favour with German
consultancies is the Asian Development (ADB). The latter's curricula vitae
requirements, for example, tend to be longer and more complex than many
German consultants usually provide. The ADB will generally require a
document running to about 15 pages for its tenders, a procedure which
baffles German consultants who usually present their case in two or three
pages.
Such apparently mundane German complaints often cloak more important
factors, including a possible lack of political support when it comes to
competing against, for example, French companies working closely with
government agencies and embassies. Overall, they add up to a picture of
German consultants apprehensive about treading the international
consultants' catwalk.
However, another reason for German consultants' low profile with the
development agencies is that many receive substantial amounts of work
through the Gesellschaft fuer Technische Zusammenarbeit.
This is a government-owned body which hands out consultancy work generated
by bilateral deals signed between Germany and other countries, according to
Peter von Oy, a spokesman for the Association of Independent Consulting
Engineering Companies (VUBI).
Also, many companies have shifted their focus to eastern Germany, where the
fall of communism has generated large amounts of lucrative German or private
contracts.
However, international business represents a mere 2 per cent of turnover for
eastern German companies, most of whom comprise the left-overs of planning
divisions of former state-owned 'combines', whose international experience,
if any, was mainly limited to work in other Comecon countries.
One area where German consultants feel they do have significant a presence
is in eastern Europe and the CIS, where funding is provided by the EU's
Phare and Tacis technical assistance programmes respectively.
While much of the consultancy work in Poland, the Czech Republic and the
more developed areas of eastern Europe is already privately financed, German
companies have also won bids for Tacis projects, including a recent energy
conservation study in the Urals.
But overall the international presence remains relatively limited.
Mr von Oy says that VUBI is trying to raise the profile of German firms by
organising, among other things, a workshop with the World Bank and the EBRD
in June, to examine prospects for improving co-operation with German
consultants.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (25): Focusing on official funding -
Multilateral aid for technical assistance projects in areas such as the
former Soviet Union and eastern Europe offer considerable opportunities for
international consultants / Consultancy contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JON MARKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Multilateral development agencies are a critical source of funding in
regions where commercial finance is difficult to obtain. Technical
assistance (TA) is a vital component of the multilaterals' operations,
generating an annual volume of financing estimated at Dollars 12-15bn by the
Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
TA provides support for physical investment and for the institutional
development the World Bank and other agencies now see as their priority.
'We bid all the time for World Bank contracts and try to get our pricing
right,' says the operations manager of a leading French company. 'What we
are finding is we must also try to understand the wider developmental
context, to meet the more refined requirements now demanded by agencies.'
The World Bank calls TA for infrastructure contracts 'hard technical
assistance'. The bank's Annual Report 1993 says that 'almost all investment
projects now contain a technical-assistance component for
institutional-related issues.' This links conventional project finance with
'soft TA' support for institutional reform.
Projects are increasingly being structured to mix hard and soft TA,
according to the World Bank. Thus in Laos, hard TA, to provide computerised
planning for rural electrification, was coupled with soft TA for training in
accounting systems and financial systems for the state power company.
Countries with a hard TA tradition of consultant engineers and strong
financial sectors to exploit the newer soft TA opportunities dominate the
market.
World Bank data shows that in the year to 30 June 1993, US companies were
paid Dollars 108m, French firms Dollars 92m and those from the UK Dollars
91m for consultancy orders financed by the bank.
The US took 16.1 per cent of total consultancy contract payments worth
Dollars 672m. German and Japanese consultants received payments of Dollars
49m and Dollars 29ms respectively in fiscal 1993.
Japanese firms received only 4.2 per cent of consultancy orders, but 15.2
per cent of a total of Dollars 4.1bn equipment payments, worth Dollars 618m.
In contrast, UK firms took 13.5 per cent of consultancy contract payments,
but only 8.8 per cent of equipment disbursements. For larger contracts,
international competitive bidding (ICB) is the norm with companies
presenting sealed bids for public opening.
Because of the nature of the projects, TA generally involves smaller orders
and these contracts are usually placed under restricted tendering
procedures, involving bidding by companies which are specialists in the
areas concerned.
Fundamentally important are monitoring projects and tenders in specialist
publications such as the World Bank's Monthly Operational Surveys and
registering for prequalification on restricted tendering lists such as the
European Commission's central consultancy registers.
Facilities such as the EU's Phare programme for eastern and central Europe
have evolved decentralised decision-making. 'In countries like the Czech
Republic and Hungary we are little more than an audit office,' says Phare
official Patrick Worms.
Projects are proposed and implemented by project management units (PMUs) in
the recipient countries, usually run out of state bodies.
'For anyone interested in Phare contracts there is really no way to avoid
going to the country and getting to know the PMU head,' Mr Worms says.
Agency officials recommend:
Focusing on a defined market or markets where information can be gathered
and contacts made on a systematic basis. Random bidding for a wide range of
contracts can waste resources for all but the largest firms.
Providing a clear view of technical capacity - which can be as important as
pricing. The EU's Tacis programme, which provides TA for the former Soviet
Union, awards contracts after a system of evaluation in which technicals
factors account for about 70 per cent of the scoring and financial factors
account for only 30 per cent.
For companies that are looking towards eastern Europe - where donors have
concentrated on providing TA - the World Bank and its agencies, the
London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the
EU's Tacis and Phare programmes for central and eastern Europe all offer
considerable potential.
The pace of EBRD financing for TA is accelerating, with recent examples
including a Ecu479,971 order for Belgium's Transurb for railway studies in
Slovenia and a Pounds 38,977 order for the Hampshire-based Gaffney Cline &amp;
Associates to carry out fuel supply contracting assistance in Armenia.
Tacis has a Ecu460m budget for 1994, pending European Parliament approval of
the programme's tendering procedures. Phare has a Ecu990m budget allocation
for 1994. Competition to access these funds is high. One Tacis contract for
military conversion work saw 200 companies apply for prequalification. A
growing trend is for consultants in a recipient country to bid for
contracts, often in the form of a joint venture.
This practice is encouraged by agencies, to keep more of their funds flowing
in recipient countries. The World Bank is supporting training for domestic
consultants. The EU's Tacis programme gives bids that include a local
consultant a bonus in its evaluation procedure, Tacis information officer Dr
Gerlinde Niehus says.
Out of 1,150 contracts awarded by Phare in 1993, 76 went to eastern European
firms, 6.6 per cent of the total. This compares with only
4.4 per cent in 1992, reflecting progress. But there is a long way to go
before the US, UK and French consultancy industries lose their grip on the
global TA market.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (23): Unfamiliar ground - Company profile, KOC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Europe Koc is not a household name. Few outside Turkey are aware that
this is the country's largest conglomerate with a turnover of more than
Dollars 10bn, putting it in the Fortune 500 top international companies.
The reasons are twofold. Firstly Koc is privately-owned and still relatively
inward-looking. Secondly, the company has been less interested in exports
than in the Turkish domestic market where the group has 45 per cent of car
sales in a link-up with Fiat of Italy, and more than half the market in its
two other main activities - household gas and consumer electronics.
But all this is changing. With import tariffs coming down as Turkey moves to
complete a customs union with the European Union (EU) in 1995, even the most
conservative Turkish groups are having to find new markets through links
with foreign partners.
For Koc the move to expand its overseas trade is taking it on to unfamiliar
ground. Exports still account for barely 10 per cent of group turnover.
Consumer electronics, one of the more dynamic export sectors, embracing
brown goods such as television and white goods, such as refrigerators, is a
good illustration of the problems facing the group in expanding its markets.
Export business started in the 1970s, when the company bought washing
machine and other technology from General Electric of the US, and Siemens of
Germany. Today, Koc is producing refrigerators to its own design.
Koc exports around 30 per cent of its brown goods production. Exports
accounted for 50 per cent three years ago before the current recession in
European markets. The white goods sector is also increasing from a smaller
base.
To strengthen its position, Koc is now looking for strategic partnerships in
both its brown and white goods industries, while trying at the same time to
develop its own brand name. It is willing to offer a share of Turkey's
growing domestic market in exchange for a link up with a big foreign name
which would allow Koc access to technology, capital and new markets in
Europe and elsewhere.
Feelers have been put out to a number of European companies, including Nokia
of Finland and the Siemens Group, but a suitable partner has so far not been
found. Mr Hasan Subasi, the director of the electronics division and a
member of the executive board at Koc Holding, says the company is looking at
a share partnership or a joint venture.
Some in the industry believe concerns such as Koc will get left behind as
European manufacturers consolidate. Mr Subasi is more optimistic.
'Consolidation is slowing down. Locals enjoy the biggest margins, offering
competitively priced value for money products.'

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (22): Germans stand a good chance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL MELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Payment is a sore point everywhere in Europe but one country where small
companies still have a good chance of collecting their money on time is
Germany.
Social pressures and strict legal procedures combine to ensure speedy bill
settlement, inspiring envy among businessmen in the rest of Europe.
Even so, according to a recent survey by accountancy group Grant Thornton,
two thirds of small companies in Germany say that over the past year their
customers have been slower in paying up.
Nevertheless, most German businesses reported shorter delays than their
counterparts across the rest of the EU. The average waiting time in early
1994 was 43 days - less than in any other member state except Denmark (36
days).
Cultural factors help to explain this enviable situation. In Germany, names
of firms that have received a third request for payment - effectively a
warning of potential legal action - are published in local company
registers, which are open to public scrutiny.
'It is,' says one credit analyst, 'a question of mentality. The German
mentality is, for the most part, concerned with what the neighbours think.
And if a name appears on the debtors register that is really embarrassing.'
Cashflow also comes into play: because shorter payment delays are the norm,
businesses receive income earlier than in many other countries and thus have
funds available at an earlier stage to pay their own suppliers.
Tight regulatory controls on bank credit help indirectly, limiting the
borrowing commitments that banks allow firms to take. The structure of the
economy - where medium sized companies play an important role - also means
big conglomerates treat smaller companies with more consideration than in a
market where supply is dominated by big enterprises.
Court procedures are also a factor as it is relatively easy to enforce
payment. If money is overdue, the seller can go to a court, which orders
payment within two weeks. Unless the buyer raises a formal objection - which
would then be adjudged in a normal court hearing - it is regarded as having
accepted the legal obligation to pay.
The system does not cut the number of genuine trade disputes, but it acts as
a strong discouragement to those who routinely pay late as a means of
cashflow management.
Even so, there is clear evidence that payment delays in Germany are getting
longer, reflecting economic strains imposed by relatively high interest
rates, and national reunification.
Recession is a novelty for many German managers and and many firms have
found themselves short of the cash needed to maintain their normal payment
timetables. By most countries' standards, this year's 43-day average payment
period may seem good. But it is poor news for Germany, where the average was
a mere 34 days in 1993.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (21): Small UK businesses suffer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL MELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Officials at the Department of Trade and Industry are sorting their way
through a mound of suggestions on how to reduce business payment delays. As
well as its own ideas, which include a statutory right to interest, the
government requested other comments, provoking vigorous response from the
60,000-member Federation of Small Business (FSB).
Dr Bernard Juby, the FSB's trade and industry spokesman - dismissing the
idea of a right to levy interest charges because 'nobody has bothered to
think through how to enforce it' - cites a string of alternatives.
One of the main problems facing a small firm in collecting money owed by a
large company is the risk of alienating that customer, particularly if the
business involved represents a big share of the seller's turnover. Several
of Dr Juby's proposals give buyers an incentive to improve payment
performance in rather than granting individual suppliers rights that they
may be reluctant to enforce.
He advocates stronger legal underpinning of terms of trade, such as a
regulation that, unless specified otherwise, payment is due within 30 days.
Another option is to make access to the courts easier, perhaps by increasing
the size of debt a small claims court will consider.
Firms sometimes lose out if a customer goes out of business before paying
for goods he has received. At present such goods may be seized by the
liquidator and sold (as part of a going concern or in an attempt to raise
funds to pay creditors). Dr Juby believes suppliers should have a right to
reclaim such unpaid goods.
But many of those suffering from late payments contribute to their problems,
by failing to sort out the payment details beforehand. 'Small businesses are
their own worst enemies. They are so pleased to get the order that they
don't bother to ask about the nitty gritty,' Dr Juby says.
Small business make up a large chunk of the trading community: 97 per cent
of Britain's businesses employ fewer than 20 people, 91 per cent employ less
than 10 people and 61 per cent have one or two staff. With such limited
resources many lack the time or money to bring legal action to collect money
owed them. And although right to interest on overdue payments exists if
specified in the original sale contract or awarded in court, it can be
difficult and expensive to collect the money.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (19): Settlement delays a source of pain - While
recession has played its part in slowing payments, for many companies it is
a matter of policy, aimed at strengthening their own cash flows and saving
on borrowing costs / Payment problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL MELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's small business community is never short of worries. Bureaucracy,
taxes, training, recession, inflation, interest rates - the list of concerns
is a familiar one, although their relative importance may vary from month to
month or country to country.
But one an issue arouses particular bitterness, perhaps because it is seen
as an unnecessary problem: late payment by customers, especially large
companies.
Many buyers, as a matter of policy, systematically delay settlement of
invoices in order to strengthen their own cash flow positions and save on
borrowing costs.
'It is commonplace for large companies who have got a decent accounting and
finance set-up to introduce a system to slow outflow of cash,' says Martin
Williams, commercial director of the credit information company, Graydon
(UK). 'Recession does have an impact on the large companies. Cash management
becomes very important to large organisations. And, as a consequence, you
get financial directors telling their account managers to actually slow down
on payment. Obviously it is small companies which always suffer'.
When interest rates are high there is a greater incentive to hang on to cash
as long as possible. Small firms are more likely to be kept waiting because
they are usually in a weak position to confront big customers.
Statistics present a mixed picture but spokesmen for small business feel
that over the past few years payment standards have generally declined.
'Ethics have deteriorated in the UK and in others as well,' says Brian
Prime, president of Europmi, the European Committee for Small and Medium
Independent Companies.
'Once upon a time you had a code of honour in business, and you honoured
your bills and paid on time.'
Europmi administrative director, Bruno Wattenbergh, believes that the fear
of payment delay is deterring many firms from taking advantage of the EU
single market and developing their export sales.
Many already have difficulty collecting money on time from buyers in their
own countries and realise that barriers of language and distance could make
for even worse problems if they start trading abroad.
The brake that payment worries exert on the potential growth of
intra-European trade is also a concern for the European Commission, which
last July organised a conference in Brussels to discuss the issues, bringing
together representatives of small and large firms, banks, factoring houses
and government.
Nevertheless, analysis by the credit reporting group Dun &amp; Bradstreet
suggests that the overall incidence of payment delay in the business world
has not changed much over the past five years.
Between 1989 and 1994, the average number of days delay actually fell in
France from 28 to 24 and in the UK from 51 days to 49. In Ireland it
remained the same, at 34 days. There was also no change in Sweden or Norway
(both 18 days). But delays did worsen in Germany from 18 days to 19 and in
Italy from 34 days to 37.
Other survey results suggest that recession has increased payment pressures,
particularly for small businesses. Bruno Wattenbergh cites figures that show
declining respect for contractual payment terms in Germany during 1991 and
1992.
During 1993, he says, enquiries in Denmark found 35 per cent of companies
reporting payment problems, while in France 48 per cent of companies had
difficulties. In the UK problems were reported by as many as 67 per cent of
businesses.
According to some analysts, there are sectors - such as pharmaceuticals and
high technology - where late payment is less common. This may reflect long
standing differences in attitude and a smaller choice of suppliers, which
makes big firms more aware of the need to keep those they buy from in
business.
On the other hand, there are sectors where payment performance appears to be
worse than average, such as construction, retailing and, in Germany, steel.
Governments have begun to pay more attention to the issue and much
discussion has taken place over whether granting suppliers the legal right
to charge interest would pressure buyers into paying early.
UK credit insurers Trade Indemnity have reluctantly concluded that other
methods having failed, legislation granting an automatic right to interest
may be the only option for governments.
But Colin Foxall, chief executive of NCM Credit Insurance is sceptical. He
fears that such a move might easily give formal status to late payment - big
firms might just pay the interest willingly, as a cheaper form of credit
than bank overdraft. The small business representatives also take this view.
Suppliers already enjoy a right to interest in Scandinavia. But, as one
analyst points out, the Nordic economies are relatively small. Companies
often develop close interdependent relationships and big firms may have a
fairly restricted choice of suppliers. They cannot easily switch procurement
to another firm that is less pushy in demanding to be paid on time.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (20): French performance slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL MELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Payment performance in France has deteriorated markedly over the past year,
in spite of government initiatives to deal with the problem.
According to the EU small business association Europmi, 48 per cent of
French companies report difficulties in collecting monies owed them. A
survey by the UK accountancy group Grant Thornton found that only 4 per cent
of French firms interviewed reported an improvement in payment performance
by their customers over the previous year.
The recession is partly to blame for trading customers' reluctance to settle
their bills on time. Many have themselves suffered from poor sales and a
shortage of income with which to pay suppliers. Another factor may have been
the high interest rates that prevailed during recent years, as the French
government battled to maintain the value of the Franc against the Deutsche
Mark.
Bruno Wattenbergh, administrative secretary of Europmi, says delays worsened
during 1993 as small firms began to pile up debts to their suppliers even
faster than large companies had done.
A study commissioned this year by the French government warns that payment
delays will undermine competitiveness in the domestic market and weaken
French firms' ability to take advantage of the EU single market. The
government responded by launching further studies and putting pressure on
industries to sign professional agreements setting out payment norms.
Credit information group Dun &amp; Bradstreet identifies a number of long-term
trends that may have contributed to the increased number of payment delays
and insolvencies.
Privatisation in the banking sector means banks are tightening up on
overdrafts and loans, putting pressure on customers short of cash.
Insolvency laws in France impose fewer penalties on the directors of failed
companies than on those in other European states, giving those facing
difficulties less incentive to battle on to try to save their firm rather
than shutting down and setting up afresh. The generation that founded many
family firms during post-war economic recovery is now retiring, selling up
or handing over the reins to offspring. For many in the new generation of
small company bosses, this recession is their first and they often lack the
experience to cope.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (18): A new chapter for the EDC - As it enters
the domestic credit market, debate is hotting up over how broad the agency's
mandate should be / Canada's Export Development Corporation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's Export Development Corporation is about to enter uncharted - and
potentially turbulent - waters. Under a law passed by parliament last year,
the government-owned export credit and insurance agency has for the first
time gained the power to write capital leases and domestic credit-insurance
policies, and to take an equity participation in foreign projects.
The EDC thinks it should be applauded for improving and expanding its
services to Canadian exporters and their foreign customers. But the new
powers have raised questions about how broad a government agency's mandate
should be, especially when its activities bring it into head-to-head
competition with the private sector.
Just how much of a threat the EDC will be to the private sector will not be
known for another month or two. Although the new law was passed last June,
regulations implementing the changes have yet to be promulgated. Paul Labbe,
EDC's president, says the new powers are the culmination of a process begun
more than five years ago to make the EDC more responsive to the needs of its
customers.
'We adopted the vision that we want to be the best in the world in providing
those financial services to our customers,' he says.
Besides the new law, the EDC has stepped up in-house training programmes,
modernised its computer systems, and brought in new skills. Its senior ranks
include a general manager for quality and customer satisfaction.
The fruits of these efforts are evident in a rapid growth in the EDC's
business. Its export finance commitments have more than doubled since 1991,
including a 54 per cent surge last year to CDollars 3.2bn (Pounds 1.57bn).
Insurance volumes climbed by 30 per cent last year to CDollars 8.6bn.
To its credit, the EDC also enjoys wide respect in international capital
markets for its innovative debt strategies. It has become a sizeable player
in derivatives markets.
But Canadian banks and insurance companies make no secret of their
nervousness at the prospect of stiffer competition from an institution which
pays no taxes and is subject to less stringent capital and provisioning
rules. The private-sector groups are withholding final judgement until the
regulations are finalised. But Mr Parker Gallant, who heads Toronto-Dominion
Bank's trade-finance division, says that the EDC 'should be there as a
lender of last resort, not doing everything for everybody'.
Tom Leonard, president of Trade Indemnity, a private-sector credit insurance
underwriter whose business has grown even more rapidly than the EDC over the
past five years, notes that no other government agencies in developed
countries are going into the domestic-credit market: 'Why should the EDC?'
Mr Leonard asks.
Critics complain that the EDC's moves are based on its own selfish
ambitions. Instead of being a facilitator of private-sector financing and
insurance such as the US's Eximbank, the EDC 'wants to be a bank, and it
wants to be an insurance company to the detriment of a strong private
sector,' Mr Leonard says.
Especially galling to its critics are signs that the EDC operates under
different rules to its private-sector competitors. Its credit and insurance
losses have climbed to levels which would be unacceptable to most banks or
insurance companies. Non-performing loans, totalling CDollars 2.3bn,
amounted to 30 per cent of its total assets at the end of 1993. Loan losses
last year were more than four times the original projection. Insurance
claims paid out soared to CDollars 47.7m from CDollars 18.4m, due largely to
higher claims on shipments to Iran, the US and Cuba.
Mr Labbe acknowledges that, when the new rules come into force, 'there's
going to be a little shaking-out period on both sides, from the banks, the
insurance companies and ourselves.' But he notes that the new law provides
for a five-year review of the EDC's activities. By then, he hopes that the
corporation and private lenders will be collaborating more closely in joint
financings.
According to Mr Labbe, the EDC has come under growing pressure to provide
capital lease facilities and other types of off-balance sheet financing,
especially for purchases of Canadian aircraft and power-generation
equipment. The EDC's presence in the domestic credit-insurance market, Mr
Labbe says, will help exporters who want to deal with a single provider of
export and domestic receivables insurance. Its move into pre-shipment
financing is also designed to make life simpler for the exporter.
In the past, the corporation had to confine these facilities only to the
export portion of a company's output. Mr Labbe promises that the EDC will
not rush into equity partnerships 'just for the sake of increasing volumes'.
But the privatisation of many infrastructure projects, such as power
stations, highways and airport terminals, has created new opportunities for
exporters.
'The ability to take an equity position at the front end, which would
securitise to a certain degree the other lenders, enhances the chances of a
project coming off,' Mr Labbe says. The EDC has gripes of its own against
some of the multinational lending agencies with which it would like to
collaborate. For instance, the corporation has so far done relatively little
business in eastern Europe, and none in partnership with the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
The security assigned to each lender in a joint financing is one of the
stumbling blocks which still needs to be ironed out between the EDC and
EBRD. 'We don't particularly want somebody to rank ahead of us if we're
sharing the risks,' Mr Labbe says.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (17): Bargains still to be struck - The various
obstacles to reaching agreement on harmonising national systems of credit
support / Credit harmonisation
</HEADLINE>

GETTING PAID: reports on the way exporters tackle the problems of collecting
debts, identifying sources of revenue and securing payment
Weeks, perhaps months, of haggling still lie ahead as European governments
try to reach an accord on harmonising their national systems of medium term
export credit support - a crucial issue for capital goods exporters and
their sub-contractors across the region.
Although much progress has been made towards agreement on some of the fine
technical details, it will probably take direct negotiation at ministerial
level to break the deadlock between Britain and the other 11 member states
over the level of cover to be allowed for buyer credits.
A compromise could be hard to achieve because most EU states see the capture
of large projects and capital equipment customers overseas as an important
part of their trading strategy and a legitimate national interest justifying
government intervention.
Over the past few decades, individual countries have evolved different ways
to provide this support. All are wary of sacrificing those aspects of
national schemes that seem to give them a particular competitive advantage.
Exporters want to see a system that combines the most supportive aspects of
all the different national schemes, but European Commission officials trying
to draft a compromise are also under pressure from national finance
ministries to reduce the public expenditure cost of export credit by
limiting the scope of cover or raising premiums.
Everyone agrees that a middle path must be struck. But there are fierce
arguments over how that should be done and which aspects of existing
national systems should be sacrificed.
Most contentious of all remains the level of cover for buyer credits. At
present, Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) is alone in
the EU in providing 100 per cent cover.
All the other 11 states would like to set a maximum limit of 95 per cent -
they believe that the exporter and his bank should have to take at least a
minority share of the risk on any deal. They are willing to allow 100 per
cent only where a European exporter's bid is in competition with a non-EU
tender backed with a 100 per cent credit guarantee, usually from Japan and
the US.
UK banks and industry are strongly supportive of the UK government's
argument for maintaining the right to offer 100 per cent. 'British exporters
are determined to ensure that there is no erosion in the cover available
from ECGD, as they are acutely aware of America's determination to compete
effectively with 100 per cent cover and competitive premium rates,' says
Keith Johnson, chairman of the British Exporters Association.
'We must wake up in Europe to the fact that this type of introspective
legislation will only diminish job opportunities and reduce foreign earning
capacity.'
Elsewhere, views differ markedly. The Dutch, for example, are keen to
minimise any government subsidy for capital goods exports. 'What we would
favour is 95 per cent, because the exporter should have a certain amount of
own risk,' says Anne van't Weet, managing director at national credit
insurer NCM and the company's representative at the EU negotiations.
Although project and capital goods business is less important for the
Netherlands than for the EU's larger economies, France and Germany also
favour a maximum 95 per cent ceiling.
For German companies, 95 per cent cover would actually represent an increase
in support above the 85 to 90 per cent currently offered them by export
credit agency Hermes (on behalf of the government). Furthermore, the
proposed EU scheme would cover interest charges to foreign buyers who pay
late, an extra protection not offered under the existing German system.
In France the plans for export credit reform seem to have aroused little
concern, perhaps because the proposals discussed so far are quite similar to
the existing French scheme.
'Our members have more pressing problems to worry about,' says an official
with the Club des Exportations, the association representing more than 1,000
exporting firms.
'French companies have never been opposed to European harmonisation,' says a
representative of the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 'Banks are
generally satisfied with the proposals,' adds a spokesman for the AFB, the
French banking association.
Dominique Tuffrau-Barriant, who chaired the EU group of experts that has
been discussing the options for export credit harmonisation, is an executive
of French credit insurer Coface. Speaking as a Coface representative, she
argues that the new suggested cover conditions are not much different from
those already offered in most of the EU and do not favour any national
approach over another. She maintains that the expert group recommendation
represents the opinion of most member states.
'I can understand the concern felt by British exporters who can currently
obtain up to 100 per cent cover from the ECGD in eligible cases. However,
the fear of losing out to Japanese and US exporters does not justify
rejecting the expert group's proposals,' Ms Tuffrau-Barriant says. 'Many
different elements come into play in such cases and the 5 per cent
difference in maximum cover is unlikely to be the determining factor.'
French and Dutch concerns appear to centre mainly on premiums. They are
relieved that Germany is abandoning its flat rate system - under which
Hermes charged the same premium for all countries, from OECD markets to
struggling African economies. On July 1 this year, Bonn will introduce a
structure that categorises markets into five risk bands, with different
levels of premium to match each band.
This will mean higher premiums for difficult markets, but cheaper cover for
sales to low risk countries. This is broadly similar to the proposed
harmonised system for the EU as a whole.
The EU scheme will also probably include a sixth category for markets that
are 'off cover', although most governments will want the right to guarantee
deals for category six markets where they have special 'political' concerns.
For example, France may want to support key trade partners in sub-Saharan
Africa or the Maghreb, while Britain also has special interests in Africa
and the Middle East. Germany is anxious to assist markets in eastern Europe.
The Dutch would like a much tougher interpretation of 'off cover'. If
governments have special interests, they should support them with grants or
aid-based loans, says Mr van't Veer. 'Call it aid and not credit insurance.'
But even the Dutch have some national advantages they want to retain and
which are opposed by other EU governments. The Netherlands is still arguing
for the right to retain its 'negative risk description' in export credit
policies. This puts the onus on the insurer to show that a claim is
ill-founded rather than leaving the exporter to justify his right to a
compensation payment. Clearly hard bargaining lies ahead before any
harmonisation deal is done.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (16): Patchy co-ordination a hindrance -
Regional efforts to promote trade abroad have gained some ground but
duplication and rivalry between the various national and local bodies need
to be tackled / Using regional networks, France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA CASSASSUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twelve years of decentralisation in France has given regional authorities
and agencies an important role in promoting overseas trade. Although this
strategy has undoubtedly brought success, it has been played out against a
backdrop of patchy co-ordination verging in some cases on chaos.
Two reports commissioned by industry and trade minister, Gerard Longuet, and
due to be published soon will call for a greater synergy between the
different national and regional bodies to try to halt duplication and
rivalry.
'We have no time to waste as we have a lot to do to catch up with the Dutch,
the Germans and the British,' says Thierry Bernard, general manager of
Entreprise Rhone-Alpes International (Erai).
Recommendations in the report will include drawing up a new national export
charter to follow the first five-year one which expired on March 14.
It is not difficult to see how lapses in co-ordination can occur,
considering the profusion of agencies involved in trade promotion.
They include the regional governments or councils themselves; separate
development agencies financed totally or partially by the councils; and
chambers of commerce and industry and trade associations working nationally
and regionally. That is quite apart from an array of national organisations
and the 160 offices in French embassies abroad that promote companies.
In spite of the shortcomings, however, the various efforts of the
organisations seem to have paid off. Small and medium-sized enterprises,
with payrolls of between 50 and 500 employees have not previously been
active abroad, but they have gradually increased their share of French
exports from 21.1 per cent in 1984 to 26 per cent in 1992.
Moreover, one of the bright spots in the French economy today is the trade
surplus. This reached a record FFr87bn francs in last year. Although this
has been achieved partly through a fall in imports, it is generally
acknowledged to be due also to the improved competitiveness of French firms.
Even so, the whole question of the role that the regions play in trade is
sensitive. The independence of the regions and instances of over-spending or
even mis-spending have raised questions about whether the move to
decentralise has not become out of hand.
Several of the 22 French regions have structured their efforts to ensure
that those involved co-operate at all levels. These examples include
Aquitaine, Nord Pas-de-Calais, Ile de France, Provence-Alpe-Cote-d'Azure,
the Pays-de-la-Loire and Lorraine.
The wealthy Rhone-Alpes-region is one of the most dynamic in promoting
French enterprises overseas. It was the first to open its own offices abroad
and now has a total of nine, in Barcelona, Brussels, Milan, Montreal,
Shanghai, Stuttgart, Tokyo, Toronto and Turin. London and Atlanta may be
next, but not before 1995 at the earliest.
The days when general market studies and lists of addresses were enough to
equip firms in their search for overseas business are gone, says Erai's Mr
Bernard. 'Now we have to adopt a customised approach.
'We can no longer look through a trade prism, but must sell a company
abroad. This has become the only means of survival since France went into
recession.'
Since Mr Bernard took up his post in 1991, Erai has helped 209 companies
start operations outside France and in 1993 helped firms sign FFr37m worth
of contracts in China alone. This was out of a total of FFr75m worth of
contracts for the region and is explained by the high proportions of
expensive heavy industrial deals in China.
For Maurice Baudoux, deputy general manager of the Nord Pas-de-Calais
Regional Development Agency, the aim is to help small and medium-sized
enterprises learn how to operate abroad, whether by exporting, transferring
technology, appointing commercial agents, or entering into co-operation
agreements. The autonomy of the region gives France 'at least equality' with
other decentralised competing nations, such as Belgium and Germany.
The chambers of commerce and industry also play a key role in helping French
companies to expand abroad. As public agencies, they have greater resources
at their disposal than their counterparts in countries such as the
Netherlands, where the chambers are financed entirely by the public sector.
Excluding staff at Delphes, the largest French language data base in the
world, the 183 French domestic chambers have a total of 500 experts
operating abroad and are backed up by 69 chambers in 50 other countries,
information centres peppered across France and 147 language training
centres.
Organised trade missions are fewer these days than in the past, now that
smaller French firms have become more accustomed to working in other
countries, according to Annie Arsaut-Mazieres, international economic
relations director of the Assemblee des Chambres Francais de Commerce et
d'Industrie. But meetings are organised regularly by zone to ensure that all
efforts are going in the same direction, she says.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (14): Sales pitch is more convincing - While
Budapest has failed to live up to its promise as a regional base, recent
investments show renewed faith in Hungary's potential / Trading hubs,
Hungary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON

<TEXT>
Hungarians have rarely been shy about selling themselves. In the early 1990s
the pitch was that Hungary could be a springboard - bridgehead and base were
also popular terms - for western companies set on doing business in eastern
Europe.
No other nation combined experience of trade in the communist bloc and
familiarity with the west. Hungary, while a member of Comecon, began to open
up its economy in 1968 and further in the 1980s.
Budapest had many of the geographical qualifications to act as a regional
base. It is the largest city in central-eastern Europe and lies at the heart
of the Carpathian basin at the confluence of road, rail and river routes.
But little of Hungary's promise has been fulfilled. Talk of springboards is
'passe', a Hungarian trade and investment official says privately. 'It was
quite fashionable and trendy three years ago. Now it's not such a hot
issue.'
Few international companies have set up regional headquarters in Budapest.
Vienna remains the location of choice. Multinationals such as Suzuki Motor
Corporation of Japan which set up production in Hungary to sell to the whole
region have had to think again.
Suzuki, which with its partners is committed to an investment of Yen32bn to
produce an eventual 60,000 Swift cars a year, has shifted its sales focus
from eastern to western Europe.
Investors' and exporters' plans went awry when Comecon, the Soviet-led
trading bloc, came apart in 1991. Suddenly, exporting from Hungary gave no
extra access to eastern markets. Demand collapsed as economic restructuring
and recession began to bite.
Closer inspection has shown up Budapest's drawbacks as a regional business
hub. Backward financial services remain a constant source of irritation for
international businesses. Financial institutions in Budapest cannot even
conduct some bilateral trade with the former Soviet Union, let alone handle
complicated east-west transactions.
Hungarians often, fairly or unfairly, also lack credibility as
intermediaries. 'For western products everybody wants to buy from a
westerner,' says Philip Santens, director of the European office of trade
development agency ITD Hungary.
But not all dreams are dashed. Hungary last year agreed to establish a
Central European Free Trade Association (CEFTA) with Poland, Czech Republic
and Slovakia. That accord abolished barriers on about half of trade in
industrial goods. A new initiative this year will speed up tariff reduction
with the goal of fully free trade by the end of 1997.
East European economies are turning up too, promising plumper markets for
exporters. Poland's GDP grew by 4 per cent in 1993, and the Czech Republic
and Hungary are expected this year to follow their larger neighbour into
recovery.
Recent investments show a renewed faith in the value of Hungary as a
regional base. A subsidiary of Siemens, the German engineering company, last
December took over Hungary's MKM and intends to use the telecommunications
cable maker to supply Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine.
Budapest is becoming a more efficient business hub with western banks such
as Creditanstalt, ING, Commerzbank and Credit Lyonnais establishing branches
there. Domestic banks have improved their regional reach. Magyar
Kulkereskedelmi Bank has, for instance, this year opened offices in Kiev and
Almaty and Budapest Bank one in Moscow.
Telecommunications services have improved dramatically for business users
with the installation of new digital exchanges. The Dollars 875m investment
by Deutsche Telekom of Germany and Ameritech of the US in Hungarian national
operator Matav promises further development.
Ironically, it is just as Hungary's international salesmen are giving up the
springboard pitch that it is beginning to sound more convincing.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (15): Bruised but not yet broken - The break-up
of the Soviet Union was a painful experience for Finland's state-owned
chemicals group. But Christopher Brown-Humes finds that it is preparing to
rebuild its operations in the area / Company profile, Kemira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Most big Finnish exporters were caught out by the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991 and Kemira, the state-owned chemicals group, was no exception
to the rule.
Particularly painful for the Finnish company has been its experience with a
plant at Kokkola in western Finland, which was commissioned in 1987 with the
sole aim of supplying crop protection chemicals to the Soviet market.
The plant - a Dollars 100m investment - had to be shut down last year after
the agreement with the Soviet side broke down and demand for the chemicals
in their intended market dived.
The bruising experience has not deterred Kemira from seeking to rebuild
sales and operations in the former Soviet states and eastern Europe.
Although its sales to both regions fell sharply between 1989 and 1992, the
group has already begun building up business again.
Exports from Finland to the Commonwealth of Independent States rose by FM30m
to FM220m between 1992 and 1993, while exports to other East European
countries increased to FM75m from FM42m.
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet bloc accounted for 3 per cent of total
group net sales of FM11.8bn in 1993, up from 2 per cent a year earlier.
But Kemira today is facing a new business climate. Gone are the days of cosy
Finnish/Soviet government-to-government trade pacts when the Soviet market
accounted for as much as 25 per cent of Finnish exports.
Although the barter agreements that characterised that period do still
exist, they are looser arrangements, and there are few guarantees that they
will be honoured in full.
Kemira has been forced to adjust to a rapid change in business structures.
Having previously dealt with just one organisation on the eastern side -
say, the fertilisers ministry - it is now involved with a much broader range
of agencies, such as import/export companies, plant protection agencies and
chemical formulating plants.
One positive result is that the company can influence the development of its
eastern business more directly than in the past. 'We are now working very
closely with formulating plants to develop new formulations for the CIS
market.' says Mr Risto Keranen, vice-president of Kemira Agro's technical
products division.
But crop protection is just one aspect of the group's effort to build up
eastern business. It has also been developing water treatment and paint
operations, and is investing in facilities and joint ventures in a way that
was not possible in the Soviet era.
One Kemira water treatment plant is already operating in Poland, and the
group is currently investing some FM30m on building a similar facility in
Estonia. There are also well-advanced plans to construct water treatment
plants in both St Petersburg and the Czech republic.
In contrast to these direct investments, the preferred method for building
up paints operations has been through joint ventures. Initially, the group
took an 80 per cent stake in an Estonian company, but it has since taken 100
per cent control. In St Petersburg it has a 70 per cent stake in a joint
venture with Lenbythim, which should start producing paint at the end of the
year, while in Latvia it is involved in a paint producing joint venture with
the Swedish group Alcro Becker and Latvian interests.
As a complement to this, the company has been forced to devote much greater
resources to sales, marketing and distribution operations than it did in the
past.
Sales of Kemira products in the CIS are still only half of what they were in
1990, although in some markets, such as Estonia, they are higher. The group
attributes the decline to the fact that many of their potential customers in
the CIS are chronically short of money.
'The farmers don't have any money, and there isn't any working credit system
for them. If they do have money, it is more likely that their first priority
will be spare parts for their tractors or fuel,' says Mr Keranen.
But the group is confident that the situation will eventually change. Crop
protection, water treatment, industrial chemicals and paints will remain the
main areas of emphasis for Kemira in eastern Europe, while the geographical
net will be spread far beyond the neighbouring regions of St Petersburg and
the Baltic states.
While waiting for the upturn to materialise, the group has been giving
additional emphasis to its principal European markets. But there has been no
dramatic change in sales. Kemira notes that it is already strongly
established in the European Union, with 40 per cent of production based
there, and 46 per cent of sales in EU countries.
Its broader strategy is to give increased emphasis to chemicals for water
treatment and the pulp and paper industry and to titanium dioxide (a key
ingredient in paints). At the same time the relative share of fertiliser
sales in group business is expected to decline. To assist these ambitions,
the company is planning an initial public offering and stock exchange
introduction, although the timetable for them has yet to be specified.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (13): Providing potential buyers - While
investment rather than trade dominates, rapid economic growth means a new
market for exports / Country profile, Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many of the companies excited by prospects in Vietnam following the
communist government's decision to liberalise the economy in the late 1980s
have hitherto concentrated on investment opportunities rather than trade.
This is partly a reflection of Hanoi's own priorities, which include
creating jobs and increasing exports, and partly because the widespread
poverty in Vietnam makes it more attractive as a low-wage location for
manufacturing than as an immediate market for foreign products.
'Investment has been the main preference of the government, while the
purchase of goods and services has received low priority,' says a guide to
Vietnam and the region published by Canada for the benefit of its investors
and exporters. 'Rules and regulations applying to agents and distributors
have not received high priority.'
But the rapid growth of the Vietnamese economy - currently expanding at
about eight per cent a year - and the substantial population of 70m make
Vietnam an increasingly attractive market for exports. Vietnam's merchandise
imports are expected to rise to around Dollars 4bn this year, nearly double
the Dollars 2.2bn recorded in 1991, according to the Asian Development Bank.
In these early days of Vietnam's development, the most promising buyers of
imports are the foreign investors themselves and their joint venture
companies, along with international institutions, such as the World Bank
which are helping to rebuild Vietnam's transport and communications
infrastructure after decades of war and neglect.
There are good opportunities, for example, to sell machinery to the new
breweries, food-processing and textile factories, and equipment for the new
hotels springing up in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) and other
big towns. And already there is intense competition to sell telephone
equipment, power generating and transmission systems and aircraft to
Vietnam, as infrastructure is steadily upgraded. According to one estimate,
the construction machinery market will be worth Dollars 500m over the next
five years.
Looking further ahead, the US Department of Agriculture reckons that
Vietnamese agricultural imports from the US alone could eventually rise to
Dollars 300m a year, compared with Dollars 213m in 1992 from all sources.
That is based on an assumption that per capita Vietnamese imports reach the
present level of other south-east Asian countries such as Thailand, bringing
Vietnam's total annual agricultural imports to Dollars 1.7bn, and that the
US has a 16 per cent market share typical for the region.
Given that Vietnam is itself a leading agricultural exporter, second only to
Thailand and the US for rice exports, other sectors could perform even
better than agriculture.
Competition in Vietnamese markets, previously confined mainly to Asian and
European exporters, has intensified since President Bill Clinton lifted the
US trade embargo at the beginning of February.
The big Japanese trading houses have been working in Vietnam for years,
importing machinery to Vietnam and sending out seafood and agricultural
produce to Japan. Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Thai prime minister, visited Vietnam
recently with an entourage of 60 businessmen in a bid to increase Thai
investment and trade with Hanoi.
Trading with Vietnam, however, is not something to be undertaken lightly. A
number of bureaucratic, financial and physical obstacles must be overcome
for the enterprise to be worthwhile.
Vietnam has limited foreign exchange resources, imports are licensed and
only authorised companies are permitted to import goods. In the past the
government has suddenly suspended imports of non-essential products to save
money. Although Vietnam's creditworthiness is improving, those who trade
regularly with the country say it is advisable for exporters to check
whether their banks will accept a letter of credit from a Vietnamese bank.
While the demand for capital goods is likely to remain strong, the consumer
market is limited by poverty. The average per capita annual income is about
Dollars 250, although that figure hides wide regional variations. Some
villagers in central and northern Vietnam are very poor, while the residents
of Ho Chi Minh City are relatively prosperous.
Cross-border smuggling has also caused severe problems for bona fide
exporters of consumer goods to Vietnam, since avoidance of customs tariffs
allows the smugglers to undercut the price of the legally-imported products.
Importers of high-value electronic goods have been particularly affected.
Corruption is rampant in Vietnam, despite the government's public attempts
to punish corrupt officials. In February Mr Vu Ngoc Hai, the former energy
minister, was sentenced to three years in jail for embezzling money from an
electric power line project, but government employees still routinely demand
 -and receive - bribes in exchange for purchase contracts and other
transactions. Companies dealing with the health ministry, for example, say
over-invoicing is standard practice when selling pharmaceuticals.
Vietnamese ports and roads are congested and slow, although the government
and foreign donors have plans to improve them. Difficulties with
distribution - to achieve nationwide coverage a company is likely to need
three different distributors - and the confusion surrounding official
regulations make it imperative for an exporter either to open an office in
Vietnam or to appoint a good local agent.
'There are no clear channels of distribution for consumer products,' says Mr
Raymond Eaton, chairman of Export Development Trading Corporation, which has
offices in Vietnam and Thailand. 'There is a very definite demand for
products in Vietnam, but you can only be totally effective if you have some
sort of serious representation.'
Several multinational companies are showing a keen interest in exporting
directly to Vietnam, according to Mr Eaton, whether they want to sell
construction machinery or stationery. Others, such as Castrol, the British
lubricants company, or US soft drink producers Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola,
have invested in joint ventures that prepare and package the product
locally.

EXPORT STRATEGIES: various means are being employed to gain market access,
from using one trading centre to enter another to exploiting regional
networks
With its 1.2bn population, developing wealth and growing middle class, and
its strong appetite for both consumer goods and machinery, China is the
exporters' dream. But it can also be a nightmare, replete with all the worst
things that can be imagined about trading with a communist country:
bureaucracy, restrictions applying to foreigners, reliance on personal
connections and petty corruption.
A growing number of multinationals - and smaller businesses - are setting up
shop in Hong Kong, which they see as a springboard into China. A presence in
the colony allows them to operate in an internationally-accepted financial
and legal framework while at the same time tapping the massive emerging
market across the border.
The trend is evident from Hong Kong's trade statistics: last year, some 79
per cent of the colony's total exports were re-exports and one third of
these re-exports, which in total accounted for some HKDollars 823.2bn, went
to China.
Anna Lai, assistant executive director at the Trade Development Council  - a
semi-governmental body promoting trade in the colony - says more and more
overseas companies are setting up networks in Hong Kong as a platform for
doing business in China.
'To do business in China you need to take part in a lot of personal meetings
and to make guanxi (connections) so you know who you are dealing with. It is
not enough just to communicate by fax, mail or telephone.' Hong Kong scores,
she argues, because of its closeness to important business areas within
China.
When Anixter, one of the world's leading distributors of wiring systems for
data, voice, video and multimedia networks, made the decision to tackle the
China market, its first step was to set up in Hong Kong.
'This is going to be our hub,' says Mr Joshua Barton, a sales executive for
Anixter in Hong Kong. 'Everybody is here. It is the meeting place for Asia.
It is central, the business environment is permissive, it offers a
well-trodden path, as well as a well-understood one.'
The freedom which is available to those operating in Hong Kong is thrown
into sharper relief by the restrictions which persist across the border in
mainland China. Business ventures can find themselves facing a string of
curbs: unexpected laws and taxes can hinder even the best-laid plans.
As Mr Barton puts it: 'You can have a good idea, but if you are the first,
you can also face a lot of unpleasant surprises. The only unpleasant
surprise in Hong Kong is the escalating costs.'
Alan Ho, director of medium sized garments company, Lim Ying Ying in Hong
Kong, says China traders can face sudden changes in the law on both the
exporting and importing sides.
'The rules change without our knowing, so we have to be able to respond
quickly, and in Hong Kong we are able to. For instance, sometimes there are
restrictions on the geographical distribution of garments that we can sell.
'Frequently you do not know in what way and at what time the rules have
changed, so the only way to sort it out is to send someone to the
distribution point to be there to react. Again, it is a question of Hong
Kong's geographical proximity and culture,' he says.
Hong Kong offers businesses, both domestic and foreign, a level playing
field and clear-cut laws on key issues such as tax, investment and
unemployment, which are accessible to everyone. Backing this up is a dense
legal and financial infrastructure offering support, and a range of
capital-raising facilities.
While establishing a network in Hong Kong is not cheap - spiralling wage and
rental costs reflect the property boom and severe constraints on land and
labour in the colony - traders who have chosen this route say it is a cost
well worth bearing as it eliminates the expensive errors that can come about
by trying to approach China directly.
There is also the question of distribution: a company looking to sell its
goods to both Beijing and Shanghai - respectively, the Washington and New
York of China - as well as the coastal boom provinces and greater China -
Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao - will be plagued with difficulties if it sets
up shop in either Beijing or Shanghai.
Distribution within China is hampered by poor transportation as well as the
fluctuating lines of power. Quotas allotted by the individual provincial
governments may the next month re-emerge under central government control,
and vice versa.
Beyond mainland China, political sensitivities are a handicap to trade
between Taiwan and China trade. Conversely, a Hong Kong base is both a free
port and a well functioning one which will only improve when the new airport
and container terminals come on line.
However, delays in shipping and the loss of goods mean that companies such
as Anixter are still keen to establish distribution bases in China in the
future. Sales offices in the mainland also feature on long-term agenda,
highlighting the need to maximise face-to-face contact. For the time being,
Hong Kong-based directors make frequent visits across the border.
Anixter, which has an annual turnover of USDollars 1.6bn and some 3,400
employees worldwide, is further capitalising on its Hong Kong base to launch
a personnel drive: picking up trilingual staff (speaking Mandarin and
Cantonese Chinese, plus English) who are used to working within more Western
style corporate structures.
These bi-cultural staff will be ideally placed to play key roles in offices
in China when these are set up.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (11): Business continues to flow in - Confidence
among western national export credit agencies in the region has remained
relatively untouched by political uncertainties in South Africa / Country
profile, Southern Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL MELLY

<TEXT>
Less than two weeks before South Africa's recent elections, the UK's Export
Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) announced a new financing line for
supplies for the Alusaf aluminium plant at Richards Bay, Natal.
The decision to go ahead exemplifies ECGD's underlying confidence in South
Africa, in spite of the uncertain political prospects and a continuing
recession. While many sub-Saharan countries remain off cover, recent years
have seen a continuing flow of business in South Africa.
Indeed, there are only three markets worldwide for which the ECGD exposure
is higher. ECGD now has more than Pounds 1.3bn at risk in export credits it
has guaranteed; and in 1992/93 it underwrote a Dollars 225m project line of
credit for Davy International's supply of hot and cold mills for the
Columbus stainless steel development. Its confidence is underpinned by a
good payment record - by the end of the 1992/93 financial year, ECGD was
trying to recover a mere Pounds 0.5m in claims paid out on South African
business. Credit insurers still take a positive view of South Africa,
although they may be worried about longer term prospects should
post-election upheaval provoke a fresh wave of disinvestment.
Investment Insurance International, a leading UK broker, reports that the
private credit and political risk market is still willing to cover new
deals, with premiums averaging between 2 and 4 per cent of insured value.
In the past, confidence among western national export credit agencies
underwriting project and capital goods contracts has also been bolstered by
the state's role in guaranteeing part of the risk. The parastatal Industrial
Development Corporation has played a key role, with finance often channelled
through its subsidiary Impofin.
The prospect of an ANC-dominated government taking over this system does not
appear to worry foreign credit underwriters who believe that it will follow
middle-of-the-road, market-oriented policies, backed up with judicious
intervention in support of key projects.
Attitudes to other southern African markets are more varied. Zimbabwe has
attracted considerable interest from international export credit agencies.
ECGD covered Pounds 23m of business there in 1992/93. France has put
together an Dollars 11m financing package to support Aeroports de Paris'
(ADP's) plan for development of seven domestic airports ADP also hopes its
design for a new international terminal at Harare airport will be accepted,
in spite of tough competition from a Cypriot group, Air Harbour
Technologies.
Zimbabwe is now on the road to recovery after a devastating drought that hit
farm output hard and strained foreign exchange reserves. The country has a
good payment record although some underwriters are treating it with caution
until they see developments in South Africa, an important market for
Zimbabwean firms.
Angola and Mozambique are still regarded as high risk markets with few
foreign credit insurers willing to cover deals unless they are already
secured with confirmed irrevocable letters of credit. The one exception to
this cautious stance is the Angolan oil sector - medium term credit is
occasionally available when secured against petroleum earnings.
Zambia used to be something of a pariah in the financial community because
of the massive payment arrears it had accumulated. But the past few years
have seen the introduction of vigorous free-market reforms, in line with IMF
demands. This has pleased foreign aid donors and strengthened foreign
confidence. In February this year, the UK restored ECGD 'national interest'
insurance cover for trade deals on short term credit.
The surprise market for many newcomers to southern Africa is Botswana,
which, because of its diamond reserves, has sufficient foreign exchange to
pay for more than a year's imports. Payment performance is good and
Investment Insurance International finds that most insurers charge premiums
in the 2-4 per cent range.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (10): When precision is everything - JIT is
aimed at manufacturers of goods with limited shelf-life where delivery
promises are critical. The service also reduces stocks of finished goods and
cuts operating costs / Just-in-time-delivery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY BUSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just-in-time delivery is often thought of as an express service. It may well
be on occasions but essentially JIT is a method of distribution - tailored
to customers' individual requirements - that ensures goods arrive at a
specific destination at a specified time, whether the following day or the
following month. What counts is precise arrival.
'The essence of just-in-time is to deliver with ultra efficiency. It is
about cutting dead days out of the distribution system,' says Peter
Brougham, logistics director of scientific suppliers Life Sciences
International. 'It is about carriers doing what they promise - that,
effectively, is just-in-time.'
The system fails if one of three things occur: production lines become idle
for lack of required parts; a perishable product arrives too late to be of
any use; or items turn up too early and have to be stored and, possibly,
re-transported.
JIT was created to reduce stocks of finished goods and warehousing capacity
and to allow manufacturers to be more responsive to changes in demand.
According to Anthony Lock, marketing manager of TNT Express Worldwide,
products suited to JIT are those 'where delivery promises are critical',
particularly in areas such as electronic components and sub-assemblies,
vehicle production and items that have limited shelf-life.
Health-science company Amersham International, for example, manufactures
products containing radio-activity, which has a limited lifespan, making
fast delivery paramount.
'It is essential for our products to reach customers, especially hospitals,
in time for them to be of any use,' said Martin Goodwill, the group's
distribution manager. 'For most people dealing with carriers there is a
clear split choice between service and cost. For us, the former is
everything. A cheap service that fails is pointless.
For JIT to be effective, carriers must be prepared to look at customers'
individual needs rather than trying to fit them into services that they
already provide.' In the end, their promise has to be based on the one
suppliers have made to their customers.'
Amersham International's approach is to start with the client and work
backwards. Having discovered when a delivery is needed, it looks at its own
internal procedures and operational factors governing its carrier and gears
everything to fit. 'For JIT to be effective, carriers must be prepared to
look at customers' individual needs rather than trying to fit them into
services that they already provide,' says Mr Goodwill.
'In the past,' says Mr Goodwill, 'the wisdom was that you had to hold stock.
The great improvement in carrier services, especially JIT now means that
isn't so essential.'
Mr Lock says that TNT Express Worldwide's air network in Europe normally
delivers material (collected late in the afternoon) before the start of a
shift the next morning.
TNT Express's European road service collects material from suppliers and
delivers on a daily basis, usually within 48 hours, according to Mr Lock,
'enabling minimum inventory to be held outside materials in transit'.
He says TNT Express Worldwide's involvement in JIT is increasingly in
industries with pan-European multi-site operations.
These, he explained, 'are built to increase efficiencies and take advantage
of economies of scale but, as a result, require a cost-effective solution to
the logistical demands of moving component parts between sites and from
component factories to final assembly plants.'
Life Services International, as a manufacturer and supplier of laboratory
equipment to hospitals, universities and pharmaceutical companies around the
world, needs both planned and emergency cover from the express sector.
'We don't want any fat in our manufacturing process,' says Mr Brougham. 'We
schedule our production into the distribution chain.
'Everything leaves our door to fall in line with the carrier. But if they
say delivery will take place on the 40th day or the next day, that's what we
expect.
'When delivery fails, it's manufacturers and distributors who end up footing
the bill. The ultimate penalty is that you lose the trust of your
customers,' he adds.
But Mr Brougham believes that in general carriers' reliability is improving.
'Ten years ago, expectations were at your own peril if you took every
promise literally.'

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (9): Implications a matter for debate - Mushtak
Parker finds that, while the opening of the tunnel provides an important new
route to continental Europe, many question to what extent it will alter
cross-Channel freight patterns / The Channel Tunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Channel Tunnel presents exporters and freight hauliers with an imposing new
transport medium, but the extent to which cross-Channel freight patterns
will be altered in the short-to-medium term is subject to keen debate.
These patterns will be affected by a number of factors such as transit times
through the Channel Tunnel, relative freight rates, reliability of services
and the extent to which road hauliers switch from ferry services to the
Channel Tunnel's Le Shuttle HGV service.
A survey released in March by truck maker Scania suggests that most British
hauliers do not know how the Channel Tunnel works and have yet to be
convinced of its competitive advantages.
The delayed opening of freight services has helped the tunnel's competitors
such as the ferry operators, who are already restructuring and trying to
improve cost-effectiveness.
According to Brian Rees of Stena Freight Lines, if Eurotunnel, the tunnel
operator, offers 'a good product and comparable rates to haulage firms, I
think they will maybe take about a fifth of the freight market.
'But freight transport is a finely tuned operation and it will take the
tunnel a while to gain experience. It is going to be several years yet
before we can judge the effect of the Channel Tunnel because it will
progressively build up capacity.'
A concern of Colin Beaumont, divisional manager of the freight industry's
professional body, the British International Freight Association (Bifa), is
that Eurotunnel and the ferry operators may become embroiled in a price war
 -with no winners. 'As far as our members are concerned, it will be a
question of trying out the service - its novelty value - the question of
price and quality of service. Whether or not it is successful in freight
movement, only time will tell.'
But Eurotunnel and the ferry companies tend to talk down the prospect of a
freight price war. Eurotunnel's freight director, Christian Zbylut, is
adamant that Eurotunnel is not going to enter into a price war as the tunnel
is a unique transport system which cannot be compared with a ferry service.
'We are not aiming for 100 per cent market share. That would be damaging',
says Mr Zbylut.
He argues that competition needs to remain in the short-sea (specialised
freight crossing) sector, but he says there will be no space for all the
current cross-Channel operators, which include the ferry companies. 'Some
might have to redeploy on other routes or they might face serious financial
consequences.' Eurotunnel is, he says, aiming at 25 per cent of the total
cross-Channel ro-ro (roll-on roll-off) market and at 9m tonnes on its Le
Shuttle service for HGVs at the end of 1995.
The British Road Haulage Association (BRHA), however, remains sceptical
about the latter figure and says that 'it remains to be seen whether that
target is realised. We are not privy to the information on which it is
based.'
The total volume of freight moved in and out of mainland Britain by hauliers
in 1992, including movements between Scotland and Northern Ireland,
according to the Department of Transport (DoT) amounted to around 52m
tonnes. HGV and trailer movements are usually measured in units. In 1992,
according to the DoT, about 2.83m units were moved in cross-Channel haulage
traffic.
Stena says it is not worried about the Channel Tunnel, arguing that extra
freight capacity will increase overall market volume. The Channel Tunnel
could survive just by taking business from the airlines and ferry companies,
says Stena. It must create its own market as well.
As far as short-sea freight operators are concerned, Ipswich based Geest
North Sea Line sees the Channel Tunnel as a complementary transport medium
to its own shipping operations. 'Our intention is that we will use the
tunnel if the price is right,' says UK general manager Perry Glading.
Longer-term, some see the tunnel creating two distinct freight patterns
between the UK and continental Europe. While short-sea operators and ferry
companies are still expected to dominate north European routes into such
areas as Germany and Scandinavia - especially from Hull, where ferries in
particular are gearing up to faster transit times and improved loading and
unloading services - the tunnel is set to become the main conduit for
France, the Benelux countries, Italy and a range of southern European
locations.
Eurotunnel's Mr Zbylut, however, believes the tunnel will attract
pan-European traffic from a broader spectrum of countries and UK regions.
Geest's Mr Glading reiterates that speed of transport through the tunnel is
a vital for distance traffic.
'The Channel Tunnel will come into its own in three or four years time -
that is when manufacturers and buyers realise that the tunnel can cut their
stock levels and enforce quicker re-stocking, which means more money to
them.'
Ferry operators query whether speed will be essential. Stena's Mr Rees
argues that the 45 minutes or so that the tunnel saves in time is
'irrelevant' on the longer routes. But the tunnel has advantages over the
ferries. As Eurotunnel's Mr Zbylut points out, the ferries are sometimes
unable to run because of bad weather.
The tunnel is also seen by Mr Zbylut as a spur for intermodal (combined)
transport between road, rail, sea and canal transport media. Both the UK
government and the EU are committed to increasing the volume of intermodal
trade by encouraging the building of more intermodal terminals. At the
moment 90 per cent of freight traffic in the EU is still carried by road.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (8): Expanding in all directions - While
Jordan's leading pharmaceuticals manufacturer has ambitious plans for its
international network, its regional roots have not been neglected / Company
profile, Al-Hikmat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAMELA DOUGHERTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'By the year 2000 we want to be a genuine multinational', says Al-Hikmat
Pharmaceutical Vice-President Ali Al-Husry. The company, Jordan's leading
pharmaceuticals manufacturer, is certainly making the right moves to reach
its goal.
Al-Hikmat Pharmaceuticals has been export-oriented since its establishment
in Amman in 1971 and about 70 per cent of its production, which includes a
full range of prescription and over-the-counter medicines, has gone both to
regional markets and further afield to Africa, the former Soviet Union and
eastern Europe.
It is in the top 15 suppliers to the rich and highly competitive Saudi
Arabian market and maintains representative offices in Moscow, Bratislava,
Beijing, Tunis and Cairo. Exports in 1993 reached Dollars 41m, close to
two-thirds of Jordan's total pharmaceutical exports of Dollars 68m.
However, Mr Al-Husry says that by the late 1980s, the company had realised
that to maintain growth, it needed to expand its vision and find its way
into western markets in Europe, the US and Japan. Its chosen approach was
through the establishment of a physical presence rather than just a market
share.
Portugal is the entry point for the European Union and Al-Hikmat's 60,000 sq
m plant outside Lisbon began production of injectibles in September 1993.
The company is now setting up a marketing network in Europe which includes a
mixture of representative offices and joint ventures, both with distributors
and with manufacturers whose products complement their own. EU and Federal
Drugs Authority requirements were built into the plant's design and the
company hopes to begin exporting to the US by late 1994 or early 1995.
Al-Hikmat moved into the US market in 1990 with the purchase of New
Jersey-based generic specialist West-Ward. West-Ward is being developed as
the US marketing arm of Al-Hikmat's plants in Portugal and Jordan and will
also sell into Al-Hikmat markets outside the US.
In its moves to new markets, the company has not lost sight of its regional
roots. It has a manufacturing agreement with the Kahira Pharmaceutical and
Chemical Industries Company under which it is providing technical support
for the manufacturing and marketing of selected products in Egypt, the
largest single market in the Arab world.
In Tunisia, a joint venture of Al-Hikmat Investments, now the parent company
of all Al-Hikmat subsidiaries, and 1bn Al-Baytar of Tunisia, set up in 1993,
will produce cephalosporins and penicillin under the Al-Hikmat name for sale
in all the French-speaking markets of Africa.
A third joint venture, to be located in Saudi Arabia, is now under
development and with prospects for a revival in West Bank industry
improving, the company is looking for co-operation with its pharmaceutical
sector.
At home, Al-Hikmat's emphasis is on vertical expansion. Al-Hikmat Chem was
established in 1980 to produce raw materials for Beta lactam antibiotics and
cephalosporins. With the purchase of a majority share in Arab medical
containers in 1989, the company started producing health-care related
plastics, including polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bottles.
Next will be the establishment of a company to carry out bio-equivalency
studies, both for its own products and for other Jordanian and regional
manufacturers.
Mr Al-Husry says that the rapid expansion in local pharmaceutical
manufacturing capacity - Jordan has five established companies and seven
under development - is making such ventures increasingly attractive. He
believes that Al-Hikmat now has all the elements in place for a major
expansion. Al-Hikmat Investment's turnover in 1993 was Dollars 60m. 'Within
two years it should jump to Dollars 100m,' he says.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (7): Formalities bring drivers to a halt - Rod
McNeil tests border bureaucracy from the cab of a container truck and
experiences at first hand the formalities that are required when crossing
Europe's frontiers / The trucker's tale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROD MCNEIL

<TEXT>
TRANSPORT: to what extent has the single market actually reduced border
paperwork and what are the implications of the opening of the Channle
Tunnel?
Bantering with grizzled truckers in Dover as they registered their mandatory
rest periods, there were plenty of tales of recurring delays and excessive
bureaucracy at various border bottlenecks in central and eastern Europe.
Tom Jones, driving a 10 tonne consignment of dry goods from Rosslare in
Ireland to Innsbruck, Austria, said: 'If Dover took the attitude of the
Poles and the Austrians, this place would be at a standstill in hours, not
days.' Mr Jones was to be my trucking host for the journey into central
Europe to get first-hand experience of border bureaucracy.
We left Dover on a Sunday evening, crossing to Calais and then heading for
the German border at Saarbrucken, via the Reims to Metz highway. The
crossing at Saarbrucken proved, as expected, an uncomplicated affair: a set
of traffic lights, green at the time.
We arrived at the German-Austrian border at Kiefersfelden on Tuesday
morning, only 80 kilometres from the delivery point on the outskirts of
Innsbruck.
Here it was a different story. Documents, five in total, were presented by
Mr Jones to the German customs officer at the entry point. He handed Mr
Jones an additional form, which was subsequently checked, stamped and
initialled on four separate occasions during the 1km border crossing.
Traffic was light and as we approached an Austrian officer sealed our
container within minutes.
The next task was to sort out the paperwork. In a building on the right
side, housing both German and Austrian Customs officers, two tachograph
cards from the previous two days along with the transit documents were
presented to a German officer at a central booth. These cleared and stamped,
Mr Jones approached about ten different counter points, a couple German, the
rest Austrian.
At the first hurdle, German Customs officers insisted on inspecting the
container. Two officers broke off the Austrian seal, put on minutes earlier,
and the original container seal, checked the load and then secured the
container with another seal.
We returned to the building and shuffled down to the next counter. In all,
five or six different officers were presented with the paperwork, which was
variously checked, stamped and returned. Three extra forms were filled out.
At the final counter, Mr Jones completed yet another document detailing the
delivery point in Austria, for calculation and payment of the necessary road
tax.
With these formalities completed, we drove the short distance to the final
barrier, allowing access to the Austrian highway. On presentation of the
forms, we were waved through. In a rare oversight for Austrian Customs, the
diesel level was not checked. A maximum of only 200 litres of fuel may be
imported into Austria duty free.
In all it took about two and a half hours to cross the border from Germany
into Austria - and that was without a queue. We finally arrived at the
customs clearing point at 2.30pm in Hall, just outside Innsbruck. The
container took an hour to unload.
The second leg of my trip was smoother by comparison. Boarding another truck
loaded with empty beer barrels, we left Vienna on Thursday morning destined
for C Budejovice in the Czech Republic, a drive of about three to four
hours.
At the Nagelburg border, the Austrian officers took only five minutes to
clear the truck, stamping the driver's permit allowing access into and out
of Austria.
Driving on to the Czech border point of Hlamky, the load and the paperwork -
one delivery note and a consignment note - were swiftly checked. Neither
appeared to check the driver's tachograph cards.
Taking, in all, 20 minutes to clear, we had time for refreshments at the
Czech border cafe. By 1.40pm we were cruising the short leg through the
Czech Republic to the famous Budweis brewery, less than an hour away.
Talking to the other drivers and hauliers along the way, both journeys were
surprisingly trouble free by normal standards.
Seamus Bradley recounted his experience on a recent trip to Warsaw. Mr
Bradley arrived at the German-Polish Frankfurt-Oder border crossing at
1.00am. Having had his passport and paperwork checked by Polish border
guards, he drove a further 2km and pulled up into the appropriate lane. 'It
was two hours before I moved. Twenty-four hours later I still only had 8
kilometres on the tachograph. During the wait you have got to stay awake,
otherwise the customs guards pass you by.
'The truck left Ireland on Saturday, tipped Thursday in Warsaw at 10am. It
turned one week's work into two weeks' work. You can do Greece and back as
quick as you can do Poland and back'.
Jan Chejlava, director of P&amp;O TransEuropean in Prague, formed in October
1993 to strengthen the company's eastern European presence, argues that much
of the central European region's transit difficulties centre on entering and
leaving the European Union through Germany.
'The main difficulty we experience is crossing the Czech-German border of
the European Union because of customs formalities obliged to be made on the
German border. The worst case in terms of crossing time is 24 hours -
towards the end of the year it can be worse. Normally it takes four to six
hours'.
Mr Chejlava blames insufficient facilities at the border, the road network,
traffic congestion and the restricted hours of forwarding agents on the
German border.
In spite of the problems some truckers have their own way of handling such
problems. For example, one hour into Spain, one driver was stopped by
police. He was breathalysed, the diesel was dipped to check whether he was
'running red' (using agricultural diesel, available for a fraction of the
cost) and his tachograph card was scrutinised.
Found to have run over time, and been speeding, the police confiscated his
keys and demanded payment of a Pounds 2,000 fine. Within three hours that
was reduced to two bottles of Scotch and Pounds 25 cash, with the tachograph
card destroyed.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (6): Making the most of growing opportunities -
In spite of continuing obstacles such as protected sectors, pent up consumer
demand is a magnet to exporters / Country profile, Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY

<TEXT>
Exporters to Brazil have one person to thank for new market opportunities:
former president Fernando Collor, who resigned amid corruption allegations
but began the process of opening up the economy to world markets in 1990.
Since then tariffs have continued to fall and imports in many sectors have
boomed.
With a population of 150m, 'the potential here is enormous and there's a lot
of pent up consumer demand', says John Byers, general manager for Land Rover
in Brazil, which expects to treble its vehicle sales to nearly 400 this
year.
But in spite of the continuing tariff reduction, duties of 35 per cent for
products including computers and some machinery are still higher than
neighbouring countries. And obtaining export financing for more than a year
can be difficult because of Brazil's high country risk, mainly because of
political instability and inflation of 40 per cent a month.
Last year Brazil's trade totalled Dollars 65bn, about 15 per cent of gross
domestic product. Imports increased by a quarter to about Dollars 26bn.
According to Tullo Vigevani, a political scientist, trade is expected to
reach Dollars 100-Dollars 110bn by the end of the decade. This growth will
depend partly on the future speed in lowering tariffs, which in turn will
may be affected by presidential elections at the end of this year.
A victory by Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, believed to favour protection for
certain sectors, could slow the process down but, 'there is a consensus in
favour of internationalisation', says to Mr Vigevani.
Another example of Brazil's move to a more open economy is its planned
membership of the Mercosul trading bloc, which will also include Argentina,
Paraguay and Uruguay. Although the Mercosul is not scheduled to come into
effect until the beginning of next year, Brazilian exports to Argentina have
soared in recent years.
The Mercosul has spurred many Brazilian companies to import equipment and
technology, not just in the industrial heartland of Sao Paulo but also
southern states such as Rio Grande do Sul and Parana. Other capital
investment has been taking place in the pulp, auto, petrochemical and steel
sectors as Brazilian industry restructures after the economic opening.
Capital goods accounted for imports worth Dollars 5.3bn last year and
consumer goods Dollars 3.3bn. Brazil imported 23 per cent of total goods
from the European Union, particularly from Germany, Italy, France and the
UK, although the US remains Brazil's biggest trading partner.
With such an inflation-ravaged local currency, bankers advise exporters to
Brazil to be cautious of sales to companies that do not have a dollar cash
flow. Another potential problem is sudden changes in regulations. Mr Byers
says: 'I've got a 1992 import guide but it's already completely obsolete
because of changes in regulations.'
As an example, he points to an attempt last year by the national fuels
council to ban sales of diesel for imported off-the-road vehicles, a
decision later overturned in the courts after a challenge by vehicle
importers. This uncertainty means that exporters to Brazil should have a
local representative to hear of changes before they happen, says Mr Byers.
Another problem is the existence of protected markets in sectors such as
telecommunications. AT&amp;T, the US telephone company, was blocked last year
from selling imported equipment to the government-controlled telecom company
Telebras after pressure from the local manufacturing operations of
international rivals.
In spite of these drawbacks, business people say a taboo surrounding
imported goods has been broken and that local bureaucracy is more
manageable. There are other positive signs such as a planned reduction in
port charges this year.
One company trying to take advantage of the opening is UK chemical firm
Allied Colloids, which opened an office in Brazil just over a year ago to
increase its exports of polymer-based products for water treatment. General
manager Granville Miers says the company expects sales of Dollars 3m-Dollars
4m this year but faces strong competition, not just from other foreign
companies such as BASF, but also from local firms.
Tariffs for Allied Colloids' products are a maximum of 20 per cent, says Mr
Miers, who adds that many Brazilian exporting companies prefer to import the
chemicals directly from the UK because they can then claim back the tariff
under a drawback system.
The US Eximbank and most of the large European export credit agencies (ECAs)
provide cover for sales to Brazil. The UK's ECGD, however, is not active.
According to Carlos Brigagao, a manager at Banco Frances e Brasileiro, which
is linked to Credit Lynonais, ECA financing has been increasing in the past
two years, although from a very low base. He notes that a large part of
capital goods imports is second-hand equipment, which is not usually covered
by ECAs financing.
Many Brazilian companies are rejected for ECA cover because of the country
risk. 'A company seeking a loan for more than a year or two has a tough job
in today's environment,' says a banker.
Most importers are forced to pay in cash, usually with a documentary letter
of credit, or obtain 360-day financing. Credit for more than 360 days runs
into uncertain territory because it is regarded by the central bank as
medium term financing. This means a deferred payments system may be adopted,
causing the exporter problems.
According to a British banker in Sao Paulo, most ECAs are not that active in
Brazil and ECA financing will not increase substantially until Brazil
becomes more stable and reschedules its debt to the Paris Club of creditor
nations. The US Eximbank rate for export financing, including charges such
as the exposure fee, works out at about Libor +5 per cent, says Denis Mori,
a director at Banco Itamarati in Sao Paulo. Eximbank tends to work more with
bank-to-bank credit lines than the European ECAs, he says.
A director at the Sao Paulo office of a large German commercial bank says
that usually Brazilian companies only use ECAs for imports of very large
equipment. But he says commercial banks cannot provide financing for more
than a year, or in some cases two, because of the country risk. Commercial
banks offer rates of Libor + 3-4 per cent, he says.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (5): The three regions go it alone - Flemish
hopes for independence worry those who believe regional promotion will
result in duplication / Belgium, A devolved trade strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five minutes walk from the King of Belgium's palace in the centre of
Brussels stands a modern building whose most arresting quality is its name:
the Flemish Foreign Trade Board.
Entering this state within a state, the visitor is presented with a stack of
glossy literature, pens, key-rings, and other paraphernalia whose purpose is
to promote Flanders as a separate international business centre within
Belgium.
The FFTB is a symbol of Flemish political aspirations toward full political
independence, but it also claims a practical role as defender and promoter
of Flemish exports. These account for nearly 70 per cent of the Flemish
gross national product, with a similar percentage going to Belgium's overall
foreign trade.
The question is whether this regionalisation of trade strategy within
Belgium is a model for the rest of Europe, or whether it is merely a special
case dictated by Belgium's complex domestic politics where linguistic and
cultural tensions are contained in a loose federal framework.
Similarly, how is the present system in Belgium working now that the three
regions - Brussels, Flanders, and Wallonia - all have their separate trade
and export promotion responsibilities? Can it maintain or improve Belgium's
position as the ninth largest exporting nation in the world, or does it risk
jeopardising that position through duplication?
The drive toward greater devolution of political and economic power in
Belgium started in 1970, and it has been gathering pace ever since, largely
because of pressures from within Flanders. Between 1988-91, all three
regions accumulated power steadily over external commercial relations; but
the most important shift took place as a result of the Saint Michael accords
in mid-1993.
These agreements between the national and regional authorities strengthened
the responsibilities of the regions at the expense of the Belgian Office of
Foreign Trade. The regions gained access to more money, through
regionalisation of the external commercial fund with the exception of
subsidies for Belgian chambers of commerce overseas; but the crucial step
came with the transfer of the Belgian government's overseas network of about
120 commercial attaches to the regions.
On January 1, 1994, the FFTB, set up three years before, picked up 61 new
attaches, boosting its present number to 69. Wallonia, whose foreign trade
relations are run from within a ministry for external relations, received 53
new commercial overseas attaches. The balance went to Brussels region.
Alain Crespinet, diplomatic counsel in the Wallonian government, believes
that the present system can work well, especially now that commercial
attaches have agreed to handle inquiries from all regions.
Flemish and Wallonian trade officials also argue that they are closer and
therefore better placed to help the small and medium-sized companies who
need to be encouraged to export.
Language barriers play a role, too. Most Belgians, particularly the younger
generation, are bilingual. But tension between the Flemish and Wallonian
communities tempts the politicians to argue that the regions need separate
trade functions in order to assure fair treatment for all.
Here is the rub. The present arrangements in Belgium look more like a
creation of politics rather than markets. The establishment of three
separate power-centres in foreign trade in addition to the existing national
body looks like a recipe for confusion, rivalry and inefficiency, whatever
the inclination of all the parties to make the new system work.
Regionalisation looks too rigid a formula to apply to overseas diplomatic
missions. At a time when the US is pursuing an 'export-or-die' trade
strategy and urging all diplomats from the ambassador down to drum up
commercial business, the St Michael accords restricting trade promotion to
regionally-controlled commercial attaches looks quaint if not ridiculous.
Similarly, there are widespread concerns that the regions will be tempted to
duplicate trade missions or requests for information when visiting important
overseas trade centres. 'The political reforms have created an octopus,'
says one Flemish observer.
Jean-Francois Levaux, commercial director of Cockerill Mechanical Industry
(CMI), a Wallonia-based exporter of heavy equipment such as loco-diesels,
argues that big Belgian companies working the European markets bypass the
regional trade promotion bodies and plug into their own networks. 'Companies
need support when they are trying to break into Asia and Latin America and
that is when you need the support of the Belgian government. Belgium does
not have as much leverage as, say, Britain. But it surely has more leverage
than the regions.'
In spite of the devolutionary trend, significant external trade instruments
remain in the hands of the national government such as the export credit
guarantee system, the provision of soft loans and subsidies for export
outside the European Union and the possession of a central data bank
containing a register of Belgian exporters and business opportunities in
foreign markets.
However, Flanders is starting to compete even in these areas. The Flemish
Foreign Trade Board already provides interest-free loans and grants to
companies exporting outside the European Union. It is also operating a
Flemish interest subsidy scheme parallel to existing national mechanisms.
Marc Servotte, managing director of the Belgian Office of Foreign Trade,
argues that regionalisation was useful as an internal instrument because it
brought government closer to the companies; but he is less sure about its
impact abroad. 'We have to make sure everybody plays the game,' he says.
One upcoming test of co-operation will be a special 'Belgium week' in
London, including a food show at the Harvey Nichols store, promotion of
Flemish diamonds, health care technology and fashion from the Brussels
region. The promotion will run from September 19-23.
It would be unwise, however, to write off regionalism as a political force
in Europe. There is a new European committee of the regions based in
Brussels, alongside the European Parliament and the European Commission.
What is unclear is how far this new body is a force which will lead to
further fragmentation, or whether it can prove a useful building block in a
Europe which has rejected the idea of a European super-state run from
Brussels but which instinctively grasps that the nation state is not strong
enough to compete on its own.
In Belgium, the test of the regionalisation of trade strategy is similarly
political. If efforts to co-operate fail, the result will be further strains
inside the Belgian state and a weakening of Belgian's performance as an
exporting nation.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (4): Making sure the word gets out - Italy's
minister for foreign trade is keen not only to let the world know about the
country's high quality consumer goods, but also to promote its reservoir of
technical and managerial skills / Italy, A flexible response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Don't be surprised to find special promotions of Italian goods in stores
like Harrods,' says Paolo Baratta, minister for foreign trade in Carlo
Ciampi's outgoing government.
With high quality consumer goods a high priority in the trade promotion
policy developed by Mr Baratta's ministry, the red, white and green flag
will increasingly be decorating the cheese counters and wine bins of food
halls and the clothes and shoe racks of fashion departments of shops in big
foreign cities.
While food and agriculture are priorities, Mr Baratta emphasises the need to
avoid a broad brush in promoting them. The Italian authorities are
encouraging the creation of quality marks, such as those that give premium
status to Parma ham and Grano Padana hard cheese and distinguish them from
lesser products.
But Mr Baratta approach is wide. He believes promotion of the 'Made in
Italy' label should evolve into support for the 'Italy System'.
'Italian fashion is much more than Valentino and other big-name designers.
Textiles, textile machinery and supporting activities all contribute to a
very strong situation in inter-related sectors,' he says.
'Our machine tools makers are very successful abroad, and we should also
promote the electronics industry that contributes much to their
achievements.
'And more effort should be dedicated to promoting the country's capabilities
in areas like urban planning, urban renewal and restoration, as well as
infrastructure design, construction and operation.'
Mr Baratta even sees an export role for the state electricity corporation.
'Enel has a great reservoir of technical and managerial skills in the
design, building and management of power plants, electricity grids and
distribution systems. These assets should be exploited. Enel could follow
the example of the state hydrocarbons holding, Eni, which is very active
abroad.'
Partly to to help Italy's exporters, Mr Baratta has reorganised the ministry
into two divisions. One covers international relations and trade
negotiations. The other is responsible for trade promotion and inward
investment, and it directs the activities of ICE, the foreign trade
institute - the body responsible for implementing Italian trade promotion
policy.
Current policy recognises ICE's value but, says Mr Baratta, it must tackle
four main tasks.
First, it must exploit its foreign network more efficiently. Second, it must
improve the sales of its services to Italian exporters. Third, it must
develop a fuller range of information services and assistance. Finally, it
must reshape its Italian network, by scaling down its Rome head office and
strengthening the provincial structure.
ICE organises promotional activities such as participation in trade fairs,
outward and inward missions, seminars and shows. It also offers Italian
business a range of information services, for which charges are made.
Mr Baratta says that ICE must respond to what business wants, and provide
flexibility and quality in response to demand from users of its services.
February's appointment of ICE's new chairman demonstrates the government's
commitment to this objective. Flavio Radice goes to ICE from managing
directorships at two medium sized machine tool companies, Carnaghi and Ispa.
He has been a member of the board of the industrialists' confederation
Confindustria since last May.
'Who better to have his finger on the pulse than someone who has frontline
experience in the size of company and in a sector that has been prominent in
Italian export success?' asks Mr Baratta.
Mr Radice has to fight a two-sided battle. On one side, he needs to
introduce important changes at ICE, about whose structure and the
possibility of effecting the necessary changes quickly Confindustria has
reservations. On the other, he must convince industry that ICE offers good
services and that users should be charged for them. The industrialists'
confederation says that there is resistance to paying for services that were
previously free.
However, Confindustria has few doubts about the programme of fairs that ICE
supports. This is probably because exporters are themselves involved with
ICE in deciding which markets should be targeted and which initiatives
supported.
This autumn, shoppers in Inno stores in Brussels, Antwerp and Liege will see
Italian goods under the spotlight. At the same time food and drink, and
textiles will be promoted in France and machine tools and motorcycles in
Germany. In October, Italy will host inward missions of US businessmen from
the electronics industry as well as US motorcycle journalists. And while
these are under way, Japanese footwear buyers will be able to visit a show
of Italian shoes in Tokyo.
ICE has a full calendar with a lengthy and wide ranging promotional
programme. Assigned 25 per cent of 1994's total budget, mechanical
engineering machinery has the largest slice. Fashion and similar goods
follow, taking 20 per cent. ICE's funding for promotion is L100bn (Pounds
41.64m) this year, in addition to which it has L190bn to cover operating
costs.
Just over 45 per cent of promotional expenditure is budgeted for efforts at
home, on activities such as bringing Japanese journalists and businessmen to
visit the jewellery and leather goods industries in Italy, and Argentinians
to the EIMA farm machinery show in Bologna. Nearly 20 per cent of ICE's
budget for trade promotion activity is spent elsewhere in the EU. The other
two main regions where efforts are concentrated are the Pacific basin and
North America.
But while Confindustria believes the funds for promotion are insufficient
and Italy's industrialists say purse strings should be loosened, Italian
trade promotion activity has been hit by government efforts to improve the
gruesome state of public sector finances. 'There has been a significant
erosion of the real value of funding, and we ought to aim to return to
previous levels,' said Mr Baratta.
The promotion budget was L130bn last year, plus L200bn to cover operational
costs. On these two items alone it therefore has L40bn less to spend than in
the previous year, and there has been no increase in money terms compared
with funding in 1991.
But while Mr Baratta advocates increased spending he says: 'An increase
should be accompanied by careful monitoring of how funds are spent. We need
to be able to put a value on what is achieved. An unconditional increase in
funding is certainly not wanted. Spending on trade promotion must be sharply
focused.'

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (2): The shift towards intervention - Merging
the work done by the Foreign Office and the DTI is at the heart of the
government's approach. James Blitz looks at changes which may represent a
new era of British trade policy / The UK, Active Government Involvement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Talk about British exports with any official from the UK government, and the
conversation is likely to be punctuated with sighs, groans and moans.
But Ray Mingay, the Director-General of Export Promotion at Britain's
Department of Trade and Industry, is unusually enthusiastic when he talks
about the UK's trade balance, which has been in the red for nearly a decade.
'We are engaged in the biggest export promotion initiative that this country
has ever seen,' he says. 'Our continental rivals have a competitive
advantage over us in this field, but we are doing everything we can to make
up the ground.'
Mr Mingay's predecessors rarely talked with such optimism. For most of the
past 15 years, Britain's business men and women have complained about the
conservative government's lax, hands-off attitude to promoting the country's
business interests overseas.
For many industrialists, the British government has a crucial role to play
in helping find export markets in an increasingly competitive world. And
economists believe that the balance between imports and exports must be
redressed if Britain is to enjoy a sustained economic recovery.
But recent secretaries of state at the DTI, in particular the late Nicholas
Ridley and Peter Lilley, now Social Security Secretary, have been keen
Thatcherites and advocates of laissez faire, arguing that export promotion,
like everything else in the economy, should be regulated by the market - and
that government has no role.
Enter Michael Heseltine, Britain's latest incumbent in the post of Trade
Secretary. Two years ago, he promised to intervene in trade policy over
breakfast, lunch and tea. Both he and Richard Needham, the trade minister,
believe the state can and must promote business overseas. They have
pioneered new policies, galavanising their department's officials and
introducing bold new initiatives.
At the heart of Mr Heseltine's new approach has been a merging of the work
done by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the DTI. Until recently,
both departments operated separately, with the DTI promoting policy
initiatives while trade counsellors in British embassies helped businessmen
on the ground. By co-ordinating their functions, the information DTI now
gives to businesses about trading conditions has been sharpened up, and a
far more comprehensive service is offered. The merger of FCO and DTI
operations has also been crucial in promoting several other schemes:
More than 70 'export promoters' have been hired from the private sector on
two-year secondments to travel to countries which offer business
opportunities for Britain, and advise Britain's companies on how to operate
there.
The DTI has further enhanced its expertise on potential markets by ensuring
that at least one official is in charge of promoting trade opportunities in
each of Britain's top 80 markets. The number of 'one-stop shops' retailing
the Export Promotion Department's products in the UK is increasing. Eleven
regional offices in Britain now advise local companies on how to export.
Officials say that this number could rise to 40 by the end of the year.
The enthusiasm in the department is impressive. But results are difficult to
assess. The main indicator of success is, of course, the trade balance,
although this has been clouded in recent months by the lack of statistics on
UK trade with the EU. DTI officials say they have internal targets for the
'export promoter' initiative but it is too early to say what has been
achieved in this area.
But that has not stopped some businesses picking holes in what the DTI is
doing. Some say that the two-year secondment period for export promoters is
too short, and that once they have achieved their expertise, they are
required to return to the private sector.
Others are perplexed by the aim of having one DTI expert for every country
with trade potential. 'Do we really need a DTI expert on Iceland?' asks one
businessman. 'Wouldn't it be better to concentrate more efforts on the
really big markets, especially south-east Asia?'
Mr Mingay, acknowledges, too, that there is little net new cash for export
promotion. Spending on staff costs and services has hovered around the
Pounds 170m per annum mark for several years. 'What we don't believe in is
improving things by just throwing money at them,' he says.
But at the heart of exporters' concerns is the belief that Britain has much
to do to catch up with European competitors such as France and Germany,
where state support for exporters has been a way of life for decades.
Angela Conning, who is in charge of export promotion at the Confederation of
British Industry, also maintains that British premiums for export guarantee
cover are often more expensive than in France and Germany. Strong traditions
of regional government in Europe mean that export promotion help is more
carefully filtered to companies outside the big cities. Rules for granting
funds from Britain's Aid and Trade Provision to help trade with developing
countries are also far more stringent than in Germany.
'If a French company wants help winning a contract order for the glory of
France, then their government will find that money,' says Miss Conning. 'In
Britain's case, there is more likely to be less help, and, more often than
not, two companies competing for a single bid.'
But, however justified, the complaints are not as vehement as they used to
be. And even the most dynamic export promotion scheme could not compensate
for a long tradition of laissez faire in only a couple of years. 'Whether we
should have been here before is simply of no interest to me,' says Mr
Mingay. His concern is to ensure the new approach of his ministers works as
well as possible. Only time will tell whether it has ushered in a new era of
British trade policy.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (3): The partnership strengthens - Britain's
president of the Board of Trade aims to work closely with industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN SPENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK government policy has witnessed a sea-change during the past two years.
While this may not add up to the level of intervention which some exporters
had hoped for, indeed expected, from president of the Board of Trade Michael
Heseltine, exporters are generally happier with the level of support they
receive from government than during, particularly, the autumn years of the
Thatcher era.
At that time some Treasury officials, for example, even spoke darkly of
abolishing altogether what remained of the Export Credits Guarantee
Department (ECGG) after the latter's short-term insurance division had been
sold off to the Dutch insurer NCM.
In the event ECGD survived and its former short-term insurance section run
by NCM in Cardiff enjoys considerable government reinsurance support to
underpin its operation.
Meanwhile, Mr Heseltine and minister for trade Richard Needham are
continuing to build a government and industry export partnership - a theme
which these days also resonates around Downing Street - to help UK-based
companies maximise overseas sales.
'I have always believed that a partnership between government and industry
is vital to improve Britain's competitiveness, a matter I have put at the
top of my department's agenda as the key to winning in markets and thereby
achieving greater prosperity,' Mr Heseltine told the FT Exporter.
'My colleagues and I have restructured the Department (of Trade and
Industry) to get closer to industry and to serve it better,' he adds.
For years British exporters have complained that many of their competitors -
French exporters have been habitually singled out - have received greater
export credit insurance support, whether in the form of the greater
availability of cover or lower premium rates - or both.
'The export credit cover and premiums available are now broadly competitive
with our rivals,' says Mr Heseltine.
In the past three years, the active promotion of UK exports has been
reflected in a rising level of credits provided by the ECGD and in the
active targeting of ECGD cover.
It was announced in the last November budget that the level of available
ECGD cover would be raised to Pounds 3.2bn for 1996/97. This represents a
near doubling of the level of cover available since 1991/92. Cover in
1993/94 was Pounds 2.7bn.
To make best use of this, a significant proportion of the cover has been
targeted on the so-called amber zone markets - areas where risk is
significant or the ECGD's exposure is most concentrated.
These markets include China, India, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico,
Oman, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Turkey and Zimbabwe.
This policy, coupled with judicious premium reductions where possible, is
especially close to the heart of Richard Needham, who has placed a
particularly strong emphasis on building UK competitiveness in high economic
growth markets, such as China and Indonesia.
In order to enhance the availability of short-term insurance, primarily
through NCM, the government has also provided substantial reinsurance
support because of a perceived lack of capacity in the private reinsurance
market.
According to Keith Johnson, chairman of the British Exporters Association, a
lobby group comprising representatives from industry and the banking sector,
the government is 'embracing pragmatism and realism'.
'Since the arrival of Michael Heseltine and Richard Needham, the DTI has
started to give encouragement to firms to go out there and win export
orders,' he says.
Mr Johnson says three main factors have emerged:
more flexibility for ECGD to come on cover quicker for difficult risks, such
as Kazakhstan and Vietnam;
a gradual reduction in premium costs; and
willingness by government to match support provided by foreign governments
to their exporters - a policy he terms 'competing government to government,
leaving the way clear for industry to compete on an even basis'.
However, he argues that 'we still have some way to go' and warns against
complacency. 'The Americans have the Eximbank (Export Import Bank) 'war
chest' with Dollars 900m with a mandate to 'compete and win'.
The French government has a continuing capability to keep French industry
competitive and elsewhere, for example, emerging tigers such as Taiwan and
South Korea have vast resources to effectively compete on the medium term
finance front.
'The UK government has to be continually aware of these competing pressures
and respond appropriately in terms of ECGD premium rates and cover
availability,' says Mr Johnson.

FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (1): The drift towards managed trade - Economic
downturn has forced governments to rethink export strategies and take a more
interventionist line / Exporting policy
</HEADLINE>

GOVERNMENT POLICY: FT Exporter analyses recent changes made by western
governments in their approach to promoting and supporting exports
A government's dedication to free trade often looks better on paper than it
does in practice. This is especially so during recessions.
Faced with a rising toll of job losses it is all too easy for beleaguered
administrations to look for ways of raising barriers to foreign imports in
an attempt to protect domestic industry.
Hardly surprising then that over the past few years there has been a
perceptible drift towards managed trade measures in the world's
industrialised economies.
Most of these have been afflicted by economic downturns from which they are
only just recovering. In the member countries of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development unemployment has risen to 8.2 per cent
of the labour force.
In European OECD countries, where unemployment rates exceed 10 per cent, the
problems are even more acute. The last set of forecasts from the
organisation predicted that the jobless total among its members would rise
to 35m by the end of this year.
The big differences in output growth in the industrialised world have had a
marked effect on current account balances. In Japan, for example, the trade
surplus - measured in US dollars - has continued to grow, reflecting weak
domestic demand because of the recession, and continued growth in exports,
particularly to East Asia.
Even so, compared with 1992, growth in export volume declined significantly,
while growth in the volume of imports picked up.
Meanwhile, the US trade deficit increased last year. As its economic
recovery gathered speed, imports rose while exports grew only slowly, with
sales to other OECD countries virtually stagnant.
Figures on trade between European Union countries need to be treated with
caution - a new system for measuring trade flows in the single market is
still suffering from teething problems. However, even with the understanding
that the figures are likely to be revised, the data suggest that the EU
moved back into surplus on its trade balance last year as the four biggest
EU economies recorded an improvement. Of these, only the UK continued to run
a deficit, albeit a smaller one than in 1992.
Four months in, and initial projections for this year suggest that the EU
trade surplus will increase while its current account deficit will almost
disappear. However, a widening of the US trade and current account deficits
is also expected, with only a slight decline in Japan.
The trends in trade brought about by the varying fortunes of the
industrialised world as it has weathered recession have worked against the
momentum for trade liberalisation created by the Uruguay Round trade
agreement.
A report from a working party of the OECD's trade committee* says: 'It is
feared that these could lead to further protectionist pressures.'
The working party is right to be concerned. There has been a move away from
the aggressively laissez-faire policies of the past decade towards more
interventionist trade strategies.
According to the report, over the past few years the following trends have
been observed:
the continued recourse to bilateral measures involving quantitative
controls, operating outside the framework of established multilateral rules
and disciplines. For example, the US's attempts to seek numerical goals for
reducing Japan's trade surplus.
the continued use of anti-dumping investigations as a protectionist tool.
According to the report, the number of anti-dumping investigations jumped to
a record in the year to July 1993.
an increase in the number of unresolved, long-standing trade disputes.
Even where direct protectionist measures have not been adopted, governments
appear to be rethinking their export strategies, placing a greater emphasis
on government assistance, whether through helping companies win big overseas
contracts, tied-aid, or the extension of export credit guarantees.
In the US the Clinton administration is mobilising the resources of the
federal government in order to help US business compete aggressively for
large overseas contracts.
Earlier this year it announced plans to establish a commerce department
advocacy centre, to co-ordinate all US government support on behalf of US
companies and mobilise resources for nearly 100 important government
procurement projects abroad. The idea is that it will devise the same kind
of intense intergovernmental strategy for economic ends as the government
does for political and security objectives.
Indicative of the change in attitudes was a comment from Jeffrey Garten,
commerce department undersecretary for trade, that under the new
administration, government advocacy would go beyond the usual
representations by ambassadors or visiting senior officials to making
strenuous efforts 'involving everything from financing to foreign policy
pressure'.
'The US has ceased to be a peerless defender of completely free trade,' says
Gerry Holtham, international economist of Lehman Brothers, the investment
bank. 'They now see their strategy much more in terms of 'if you free your
trade, we'll free ours'.'
In France a series of reforms and the introduction of new policies has
increased the flexibility of Coface, the French export credit agency, now
gearing up for privatisation.
In the UK, the department of trade and industry has put a more
interventionist stamp on its dealings backing, for example, a 10-year
strategic research effort by the aerospace industry.
These developments reflect the importance that governments have attached to
exports as economic downturns have taken their toll on domestic industry.
Such efforts do not threaten to undermine recent efforts to liberalise
trade. But there is still a danger that as domestic industry wakes up to the
implications of free trade, and presses governments for protection, the
world will lurch back towards aggressive unilateral policies and managed
trade, moves which would strike at the very heart of these recent gains.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (1): Spring tide
for US capital abroad - The search for higher returns has taken pension and
mutual funds overseas, into areas unknown to them. This has become the
driving force of the international corporate finance business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US capital has become the lubricant that oils the wheels of corporate
transactions around the world.
The privatisation of a telephone company in Europe, the construction of a
new power plant in China, or the completion of a multibillion-dollar
takeover in the US itself, all have come to depend on the ready supply of US
finance. And the country's investment bankers, acting as the handmaidens to
this flow of capital, have become familiar figures in the offices of finance
directors and treasury ministers alike in most corners of the world.
The outflow of US investment has been a much-remarked phenomenon of the
1990s. The search for higher returns has led the country's pension and
mutual funds overseas, into areas previously unknown to them. This has
become the main driving force of the international corporate finance
business. Companies around the world have taken the ready supply of cash and
moulded it into a thousand creative uses.
The most public aspect of the corporate finance business - takeovers and
mergers - has so far failed to rise back to levels seen in the late 1980s.
Then, cheap finance and buoyant economies in most of the developed world
fuelled corporate ambitions on a grand scale.
Many cross-border acquisitions in the late 1980s were prompted by the
approach of the European Union's deregulated internal market. European
companies huddled together to get the economies of scale they thought they
would need to survive in the new Europe: US companies rushed to buy before
the supposed lowering of barriers that would create a Fortress Europe.
The process ran out of steam along with the European economy. Largely as a
result, cross-border merger and acquisition activity has sagged. The value
of transatlantic deals - takeovers of European companies by US companies, or
vice versa - recovered a little last year, to Dollars 26bn, but was still
well below the peak of Dollars 47bn hit in 1989, according to figures from
Securities Data. The value of cross-border acquisitions of European
companies by other European companies dropped to Dollars 38bn, from a peak
of Dollars 57bn in 1990.
While such international transactions have declined, the US takeover market
has roared back to life. The Dollars 10bn acquisition of Paramount
Communications, completed earlier this year, is the most obvious sign to
date that the inhibitions brought on by the perceived abuses of the 1980s -
over-paying and over-borrowing by acquisitive companies - have receded.
Cheap finance and a growing economy - two of the factors which fuelled the
1980s takeover boom - have a lot to do with the rebound in the US M &amp; A
business. Leaping share prices provided the springboard for many
acquisitions in 1992 and 1993.
At the same time, falling bond yields enabled many companies to refinance
their debt at lower rates, reinvigorating their internal cash flow. Along
with the resurgence of the US economy after two years of fitful recovery,
these factors have spurred a rebound in corporate confidence and fuelled the
takeover business.
There are other forces at work, though, that make it different this time
around. Most of the activity has been concentrated in domestic industries
which are in the throes of technological or regulatory change.
Banking and healthcare are the clearest examples of the latter,
communications and entertainment the former. These forces promise to reshape
many US industries, prompting a restructuring of some of the country's
biggest companies.
The resurgence of the takeover as a weapon of corporate strategy is likely
to spread once Europe's economies come out of recession. The exaggerated
expectations generated by Europe's single market programme - that the
European market would begin to resemble the US one in its openness and
homogeneity - may not recur.
Nevertheless, European acquisitions seem likely to follow the US pattern.
Cheap finance created by low bond rates and high share prices are likely to
combine with a perception of rising economic activity and a strengthening of
corporate cash flow to spark renewed interest in takeovers.
In the meantime, the European corporate finance business has been more
concerned with clearing out the debris created by an earlier era of
corporate expansionism than embarking on a new one. Restructuring is the
buzz word of the moment: the process of stripping down struggling corporate
giants to their essentials, enabling them to focus management and financial
resources on rebuilding their core activities. Often, such actions are
accompanied by some form of recapitalisation.
Here, again, the US is some two years ahead. Having gone into recession
earlier, companies on that side of the Atlantic were the first to discover
that conglomerates assembled in the 1980s were often not resilient to the
harsher business climate of the 1990s. At the same time, many big companies,
ranging from IBM to American Express, made the painful discovery that they
had failed to adapt to fundamental changes in their 'core' markets.
The sale or spin-off of businesses no longer considered central to a
company's future has provided a constant supply of transactions for the deal
makers and opportunities for cash-rich companies looking to expand. American
Express, for instance, sold off three substantial businesses last year -
Shearson, a broking firm, the Boston Company, and First Data. Within weeks,
it plans to spin off Lehman, its investment banking arm. Like many, American
Express has decided to refocus its energies on a core business it neglected
for too long.
The first wave of restructuring at many US companies is over - though most
company bosses now preach the mantra of constant restructuring and change.
According to this view, the pace of technological change and the openness of
most markets to worldwide competition mean that big companies will
henceforth be in a constant state of flux, regularly adapting their
organisational structures and business profiles to changing conditions.
If restructuring has been one of the most notable themes of the
international corporate finance business, capital-raising has been the
other. Domestic sources of capital, whether in Europe or in the emerging
markets of Latin America and Asia, have been unable to keep pace with the
demand. The result: a growing proportion of capital-raising transactions now
either takes place outside a company's home market, or is structured to
include an international (usually US) element.
In Europe, the main demand for capital has come from privatisations.
Labouring under high social security costs and burdened by debt, many
European governments have turned to privatisation as a way to raise cash
while at the same time reduce demands on the public purse from
under-performing corporations. If the UK served as the model in the 1980s,
France and Italy have become the main proponents in the 1990s.
Elsewhere in the world, US capital is in demand to back the sort of
infrastructure projects - telecommunications networks, power plants - on
which emerging economies depend if they are to fulfil the optimistic growth
expected of them. In the 1970s, such projects were backed by bank lending,
much of which fell into default in the 1980s and was subsequently
restructured. In the 1990s, the capital markets have become the conduit.
The rising tide of international corporate finance activity has lifted the
fortunes of investment bankers - particularly those based in the US. Five of
the US's biggest investment banks which disclose figures (Merrill Lynch,
Salomon, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers and Paine Webber) generated Dollars
5bn of investment banking revenues between them last year, up from Dollars
3.9bn the year before.
Much of this came from underwriting the flood of equity and debt issued in
the US markets. This year, as new issue activity has receded in the face of
turbulent financial markets, advisory business of all kinds will be a more
important source of income.

FT  05 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Food retailers busy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading food retail stocks took centre stage yesterday, making strong
advances as a number of factors acted on the sector.
BZW was prominent among these, the investment bank issuing a positive note
on the sector which argued that the recent weakness in some stocks made them
look good value. Among them were J. Sainsbury and Wm Morrison Supermarkets,
which rose 7 to 378p and 2 to 123p respectively.
Elsewhere, there was talk of a large US hedge fund buy order being tidied up
in the sector, as well as more general interest from cyclical funds coming
into consumer stocks. Tesco advanced 4 to 215p and Argyll gained 10 at 238p.
Profit-taking and a more sober consideration of its Dollars 2.3bn
acquisition of Diversified Pharmaceuticals saw SmithKline Beecham 'A'
retrace 16 to 399p. Most analysts welcomed the deal but some, including
Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, are concerned at the increased
risks prompted by the trend for consolidation. The house adjusted its 1994
forecast by Pounds 40m to Pounds 1.235bn to take into account the
anticipated earnings dilution resulting from the deal.
Elsewhere, Glaxo, which is seen as one of the most likely UK companies to
follow the lead set by Merck, of the US, and SmithKline, retreated 17 to
571p.
Wellcome held up against the trend as it was announced that the US Food and
Drug Administration had granted limited approval for the company's lung
cancer treatment Navelbine. However, analysts said the approval was only an
interim measure ahead of an impending decision by the FDA and made no
material difference. The shares closed 3 better at 550p.
Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries saw its shares turn around
from a gain of 11 to a closing net fall of 4 at 455p. The shares responded
more to concern over the dollar than to first-quarter profits of Pounds
424m, up from Pounds 354m previously.
The latest quarterly output figures from RTZ helped shares in the world's
biggest mining group rise 4 to 844p. Copper and iron ore output had
improved, the group said.
Another impressive monthly new subscriber performance by Vodafone, the UK's
leading mobile phones group, saw the stock move up 3 to 545 1/2 p.
The latest steep fall on the Hong Kong market produced further big losses in
the Far Eastern-influenced banks. HSBC fell 10 more to 669p and has now
dropped almost 40 per cent from its February 4 high point of Pounds 11.
Standard Chartered, off 23 at 936p, was additionally unsettled by the
oft-repeated story that Lloyds Bank is about to unload its 4.7 per cent
stake in Standard, the legacy of its failed bid to take over the bank in the
1980s. Yesterday's rumour suggested that the stock would be placed at a 10
per cent discount to the ruling market price. The stake sale story is one of
the longest running in the market and was shrugged off by dealers and bank
specialists alike. Lloyds dropped 16 to 559p.
BP outpaced the rest of the oils, with a number of UK institutions said to
be keen to build positions ahead of first-quarter figures expected around
11.30am today. The shares closed a penny firmer at 383p after 7.5m traded.
Analysts expected more good news from BP on reduced costs, an area in which
the oil company has made startling progress in the past two years. Shell
lost 7 at 706p in turnover of 3.8m following switching into BP.
Burmah Castrol moved up 6 to 850p ahead of a presentation to analysts on May
27.
Reports that Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel may ask bankers to refinance
existing borrowings hit the stock just days before the tunnel's official
opening. The shares dropped 26 to 468p.
A sharp increase in full-year figures boosted Danka Business, 5 higher at
335p.
Trading between BTR's ordinary shares and warrants brought closing volume in
the ordinary stock of 8.6m as the price shed 7 to 387p with the market.
James Dickie relinquished 18 to 145p after an announcement that the chief
executive had reduced his holding in the company to 28.5 per cent.
Trading news and results from two of the food manufacturing sector's biggest
companies prompted slides in the share prices, although turnover was
surprisingly thin. Unilever retreated 18 to 1049p on volume of just over
800,000 shares following remarks made by Sir Michael Perry, the chairman,
who said economic conditions in 1994 were likely to be uneven and patchy. He
also railed against own label retailers whose product designs ape those of
the brand producers. Analysts said the remarks underlined the seriousness of
the threat to branded products by supermarket own label goods.
Results from Tate &amp; Lyle came in ahead of market expectations, which had
been tempered by last September's profits warning. However, news of the
acquisition of a loss-making French food ingredient group hit sentiment and
the shares slid 8 to 434p on turnover of 1.7m.

Courtaulds Textiles shed 9 to 546p in spite of a confident annual statement
from a traditionally cautious chairman. The shares have traded within a
50-point range for more than a year and underperformed the FT-SE-Actuaries
All-Share Index by 10 per cent over 12 months. They held up well for most of
the day but reacted to the sharp fall in the FT-SE 100 Index late in the
afternoon.
Smith New Court has highlighted the stock as its key recommendation in its
latest sector review, arguing that general concerns over the rising price of
raw materials are overstated. Coats Viyella, which is to hold its annual
meeting today, lost 6 at 232p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was plenty of activity but no real share price performance in Lasmo in
spite of a spate of rumours that a cash bid of 155p to 160p from either
Enterprise Oil or a counter-bidder is imminent. There was also very heavy
activity in Lasmo traded options, where the equivalent of 4.5m shares
changed hands.
Atlantic Richfield, the US oil group, was the name most frequently mentioned
in the market but was regarded as unlikely by some analysts.
Lasmo ordinary stock closed unchanged at 148p after turnover of 8.1m and was
held up by the stable performance of Enterprise shares, also unaltered at
410p. Lasmo nil-paid shares settled a penny off at 43p with 4.7m traded.

FT  05 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures fell back sharply on renewed worries over UK and US
interest rates, together with political uncertainity ahead of today's local
elections, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,089. But for an early and
brief bout of buying that took June to 3,091 in the first half an hour,
active selling dominated the session.
Dealers remained particularly concerned about the outcome of today's local
elections, one saying: 'I think we shall see few buyers until we know the
outcome.'
June traded at a discount to cash for most of the day, and broke through the
3,050 support level to hit the day's low of 3,047 just minutes before the
close. But it picked up to finish at 3,057, down 34 from its previous close
and at a 12-point discount to cash. Volume was 14,370 lots. A further
decline in after-hours' trading indicated a poor opening today. The June Mid
250 traded 198 contracts and closed at 3,074.
Volume in the traded options improved substantially from Tuesday's poor
levels to reach 36,825 contracts. That total included 13,836 lots dealt in
the FT-SE 100 option and 6,951 in the Euro FT-SE option. Bid candidate Lasmo
was the most active trader among the stock options with a day's total volume
of 4,476 contracts.

FT  05 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie at year's low on renewed rate
worries - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK securities markets crumbled yesterday as the round of support for the US
dollar brought fears that the Federal Reserve might add its own touch by
raising its interest rates, a prospect calculated to increase worries over
the near term outlook for rates in the UK. The FT-SE 100 Index ended at a
new closing low for the year of 3,070.5 and sentiment was generally cool,
with Mr John Major's government widely believed to be heading for a setback
in today's local elections.
Equities closed only a touch above the day's lows, with an early fall of 15
points on the Dow Average and losses of 1 1/2 points in long-dated UK bonds
completing a picture of unrelieved gloom. Traders believed that institutions
were switching some investment cash to European markets.
The day started slowly as the pound steadied on the cut in repo rates in
Germany and a comment from the Bundesbank that further strength in the
D-Mark might not be good for the German economy. But share prices were soon
overwhelmed by renewed selling of stock index futures and the slide in
gilt-edged securities. Weakness in Hong Kong markets upset those London
quoted stocks with involvement there.
Rumours of an impending rise in Federal Reserve rates increased in the
second half of the session in the wake of the intervention by central banks
to support the dollar. Selling gathered pace, although the day's Seaq total
of 571.3m shares was only mildly better than Tuesday's figure, which had
been worth Pounds 1.25bn in retail worth.
At worst, the FT-SE 100 dipped to 3,067.6 before steadying to a show a loss
of 29.5 at the closing reading. The Footsie had traded as low as 3,047 in
April but had not finished below 3,086 this year.
The index is now nearly 13 per cent below the year's peak, which was reached
at the beginning of February when the stock market was taking a highly
optimistic view on domestic inflation and interest rate prospects.
Once again, the downwards push came from the stock index futures, where the
June contract on the Footsie fell to a discount of around 20 points after
the official close.
At Panmure Gordon, Mr Robin Aspinall described the breach of 3,090 on the
Footsie as 'ominous', pointing out that equities have done well compared
with gilts - 'an out-performance which will be corrected in the coming
months'.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index lost 17.6 points at 3,757.7, spared from the
pressure exercised from the futures markets. On the speculative front,
shares in Lasmo, the oil exploration group, continued to hang fire as the
market confidently predicted that Enterprise Oil, the bidder, would change
its terms to offer cash, and that a rival offer was waiting in the wings.
Company results had a more mixed impact than in some recent sessions, with
BAT Industries firm at first on good first-quarter figures but later
overwhelmed by the weakness in the blue chip sector. Unpromising comments at
the annual shareholders meeting brought a fall in Unilever shares.
Analysts expressed disappointment at yesterday's steep falls in UK bonds,
which drew no benefit from the steadier trend in sterling. Many securities
trading houses are believed to have suffered a further round of losses on
bond trading over the past week and this may have caused some forced selling
of equities.

FT  05 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Telecoms bid brightens weak
session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks tracked the downward direction in bonds yesterday morning but
failed to follow them back up during the afternoon, writes Frank McGurty in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 16.66 lower at 3,697.75 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.31 at 451.72. NYSE volume was 267.9m shares.
Secondary markets were firmer, the American SE composite gaining 1.40 at
443.79 and the Nasdaq composite adding 0.93 at 740.30.
In the morning the co-ordinated intervention by the Federal Reserve and
other central banks to support the dollar in the currency markets had no
discernible impact on stocks, even though a stronger dollar would make
US-denominated equities more attractive investments.
The Fed's action may have helped equities, if it had first given a lift to
bonds. However, the US Treasury market could not muster much confidence in
the Fed's ability to sustain its interventionist strategy, and bond prices
fell back.
The session also brought a bit of bad news from the Commerce Department,
reinforcing the cautious mood prevailing ahead of Friday's employment data.
It announced that March factory orders had risen 1.1 per cent, more than
double the rate forecast by economists.
The figure heightened expectations that Friday's employment data would
indicate an acceleration of the economy in April and an early and perhaps
aggressive move by the Fed to still higher interest rates. The dollar
intervention, ironically, was seen as enhancing the likelihood of an early
strike by the Fed, as higher rates could help prop up the value of the US
currency.
Amid these cross-currents, the Dow industrials fell nearly 30 points by
mid-morning, while other market indices held relatively steady. As the
afternoon began, the blue chips trimmed their losses. But a rally never
materialised even though news of weaker than expected April car sales gave a
late lift to the sagging bond market.
Telecommunications took over from pharmaceuticals as the straw that stirred
stocks. Speculation about takeovers in the drug sector gave way to the
possibility of activity in the telephone field after LDDS Communications
offered to buy WilTel Communications, an arm of the Williams Companies, for
Dollars 2bn.
Williams, which said it would explore its options, climbed Dollars 3 1/2 to
Dollars 29. LDDS put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 23 3/4 on the Nasdaq.
Time Warner, which jumped on Tuesday amid speculation it would become a
takeover target, added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 39 1/2 . TCA Cable TV rose
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 21 3/8 after disclosing plans to buy back up to 1m
shares.
Canada
Toronto weakened in moderate trading as volatile bond markets continued to
weigh on equities and investors awaited today's Ontario budget.
The TSE 300 composite index ended 14.4 off at 4,269.2 and falls outnumbered
rises by 381 to 325. Volume came to 75.0m shares valued at CDollars 579.2m.
The golds group bucked the trend, advancing 2.0 per cent as the bullion
price in New York rose USDollars 1 to USDollars 376.95 an ounce.
The consumer products sector slipped 1.5 per cent as the heavily weighted
Seagram sank CDollars 1 3/8 to CDollars 40 1/4 amid rumours that it is
preparing to launch a USDollars 17.9bn takeover bid for Time-Warner.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo closed 4.5 per cent down in a market starved for news
and from which foreigners were mostly absent. The Bovespa index shed 745
points to 15,738.

FT  05 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Manila powers 4.3% ahead
after agreement with IMF
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Much of the region was lower in the absence of demand from Japan which
remained closed for the Golden Week holiday. A sharply higher Manila market
was among the exceptions.
MANILA powered 4.3 per cent ahead as Tuesday's agreement on a new economic
programme between the Philippines and IMF provided the catalyst for a wave
of foreign buying.
The composite index moved forward 126.12 to 3,064.05 in volume of 3.6bn
shares, compared with the previous total of 2.5bn.
A sharp overnight rise by PLDT on Wall Street fuelled the rally and the
stock jumped 145 pesos, or 7.8 per cent, to 1,995 pesos in the local market.
Philippine National Bank also attracted foreign interest, which pushed the
price up 70 pesos, or 14 per cent, to 570 pesos.
TAIWAN climbed 1.9 per cent in heavy trade, led by textiles, electronics and
financials as investors focused on improved first-quarter profits.
The weighted index rose 107.19 to 5,907.54 in turnover that surged to
TDollars 89.8bn from Tuesday's TDollars 58.29bn.
Textiles featured strongly in response to rises in the prices of cotton and
polyester. Far Eastern Textile traded the day's limit up to TDollars 39.10
and Formosa Chemical Fibres added TDollars 1.60 at TDollars 36.50.
Financials moved ahead after several business banks reported good profits
for the January to April period. Taitung Bank rose TDollars 5 to TDollars
83.
Some late buying was also seen in electronics, with Acer, Taiwan Liton and
Great Electronics going limit up to TDollars 57.50, TDollars 43.80 and
TDollars 20.70 respectively.
HONG KONG finished near its low for the year after tumbling sharply in the
afternoon. The Hang Seng index dropped 309.69, or 3.6 per cent, to 8,369.44.
The weak trend was attributed to rumours that the Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping was mortally ill, a weakening property market, the postponement of
India's VSNL global offering and a pessimistic report by an investment bank.
The Japanese holiday has also contributed to a lack of demand, with the
result that a few sell orders can have a disproportionate impact on the
market.
SINGAPORE took its lead from Hong Kong, the Straits Times Industrial index
receding 9.48 to 2,301.08.
Speculation that DBS Land, the property group, planned a 10 per cent share
placement also dampened sentiment. DBS fell 22 cents to SDollars 4.70.
AUSTRALIA was weaker for the fourth consecutive day as uncertainty
surrounding next Tuesday's federal budget kept potential buyers at bay. The
All Ordinaries index closed 25.8 lower at 2,018.4 in thin trading, with
institutions reluctant to take fresh positions. National turnover totalled
ADollars 332.41m.
Shares were marked down from the opening, when they fell in tandem with the
overnight drop in the Australian dollar and local bonds, ignoring Wall
Street's rise.
Fosters Brewing, 1 cent easier at ADollars 1.26, topped the actives list, a
hefty 17.69m shares changing hands.
BHP retreated 28 cents to ADollars 16.60. The company is expected to face a
ADollars 4bn law suit over alleged environmental damage to the Ok Tedi
river.
News Corp was the only stock among the 20 leaders to end firmer, gaining 2
cents at ADollars 9.51 ahead of its nine-month figures due today.
NEW ZEALAND continued to lose ground during another day of thin dealing, the
NZSE-40 capital index ending 12.54 lower at 2,073.05 in turnover of just
NZDollars 29m.
The weakness spread to second line stocks, among them Trust Bank, which
closed 4 cents cheaper at NZDollars 2.00, its lowest point since listing on
March 30.
SEOUL saw late institutional selling in primary blue chips bring a halt to
an earlier rally and the composite stock index finished a net 4.78 up at
922.33 after a day's high of 935.42.
Samsung Electronics lost Won2,000 at Won83,500 but Daewoo Securities rose
Won400 to Won31,300.
KUALA LUMPUR was marked down in very low volume, with foreign selling of
blue chip stocks dragging the market to its lowest level for three weeks.
The composite index closed 13.77, or 1.3 per cent, down at 1,028.25.
BANGKOK encountered heavy selling of finance stocks amid worries that
finance and securities companies' operating costs will be higher after the
Bank of Thailand limited their foreign currency debt holdings. The SET index
shed 6.14 to 1,252.37 in thin trade.
BOMBAY fell 1.7 per cent, the BSE index losing 60.75 to 3,611.39, with
selling pressure increasing after the index fell below the 3,646 level which
some technical analysts see as the trigger for a bear phase.

FT  05 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: India experiences turnround in fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision to postpone the planned Dollars 1bn global offering of shares
in the Indian telecommunications group VSNL earlier this week is another
reminder of the turnround in fortunes that has been experienced by many
emerging markets so far this year.
After a near 35 per cent gain in dollar terms during 1993, the Indian stock
market, as measured by the IFC, has shown a rise of just 5 per cent during
the first four months of 1994.
The collapse of the VSNL offer came as no surprise to some analysts. Mr
Nigel Spence of Lehman Brothers in London, for instance, remarked that the
issue was both far too large and too expensive, with few insti-tutions being
prepared to pay even the Rs1,100 to Rs1,200 (Dollars 35 to Dollars 38) per
share which had been sugges-ted in a last minute effort to salvage the
issue. The orig-inal pricing was expected to have been between Rs1,400 to
Rs1,600.
What are the prospects now for other Indian global issues? An issue by the
domestic telephone operator MTNL, which was to have followed VSNL, now looks
uncertain, while the government was expected yesterday to announce that it
was clawing back fund raising by companies this year.
'I think that the stock market will move sideways now,' said Mr Spence.
'There has been heavy selling in recent months by US hedge funds.'

FT  05 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Worries over US monetary
policy upset bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worries that the US might once again tighten monetary policy made its effect
felt on many bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT eased slightly although the utilities went against the trend as
investors continued to search for value. The Dax index weakened 3.27 to
2,249.02, after a session high of 2,259.
The market was unimpressed by a further easing in the repo rate and worried
again by the implications of a weak dollar. Comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer,
president of the Bundesbank, that a strong D-Mark was detrimental helped the
dollar recover some ground later in the day on the currency markets,
assisted by heavy intervention by central banks. He also commented that
inflation was expected soon to be below 3 per cent, but stressed that
further rate cuts must not interfere with the aim of ensuring price
stability.
Fears that the US might raise interest rates hit shares in post bourse
trading, with the Ibis indicated index closing at 2,245.40.
Schering disappointed the market, off DM10 at DM1,123 following first
quarter results.
Among the utilities RWE, which has said that it expects to increase its
dividend payout this year, rose DM1.70 to DM476.00 and Veba DM3.50 to
DM534.00. Lufthansa was suspended at Tuesday's close of DM219.80 after
announcing details of its capital increase and privatisation programme.
PARIS fell sharply late in the day on volatility in the futures market.
The CAC-40 index, which had earlier seen a session high of 2,169, closed off
37.42 or 1.7 per cent at 2,141.57.
While most analysts are expecting the Bank of France to ease interest rates
again today this has already been discounted in the markets.
Goldman Sachs in its latest strategy document said that it maintained a
positive stance on the market in spite of its poor performance so far this
year. The investment bank recommends an overweight position, on the basis of
GDP growth, upgraded from 1.2 per cent to 1.5 per cent, while projecting a
rise in earnings for cyclicals based on 'productivity gains and
restructuring measures taken last year'.
UAP lost FFr2.30 to FFr158, with indications that the public offering had
been two times subscribed.
MILAN remained under pressure as foreign investors took profits and
confidence was dented by a call from Mr Umberto Bossi, the Northern League
leader, for a pause for reflection in talks on a new government. The Comit
index fell 16.28 or 2 per cent to 783.19.
Industrials which have made strong, speculative rises were sold. Fiat lost
L217 or 3.2 per cent to L6,656 and Pirelli fell L99 or 3.3 per cent to
L2,956.
Montedison gave up another L55 or 3.7 per cent to L1,490 in further response
to its worse than expected results.
Fondiaria, 6.8 per cent higher on Tuesday amid speculation that Mediobanca,
the merchant bank, might use some of the cash from its rights issue to raise
its stake, fell L678 or 4.2 per cent to L15,570. Mediobanca fell another
L590 to L17,200.
ZURICH fell 1.8 per cent to its low for the year, even though a firmer
dollar provided some support late in the day. The SMI index fell 50.3 to
2,705.6 with an absence of domestic demand leaving the market unable to
absorb selling by foreign investors, switching to Germany.
The financial sector remained under pressure. UBS bearers fell SFr20 to
SFr1,136, CS Holding lost SFr13 to SFr604 and SBC gave up SFr11 to SFr375.
Winterthur bearers dropped SFr30 or 4.6 per cent to SFr621 as the European
Commission said it would review the Swiss insurer's plans to acquire
Germany's DBV from Commerzbank.
Roche certificates fell another SFr80 to SFr6,610 in further response to its
Dollars 5.3bn bid for Syntex, the US drugs group. Analysts noted that the
fall would have been greater but for the continued support of one private
Zurich bank.
AMSTERDAM was upset by a combination of events: the defeat, although
expected, of the coalition government in Tuesday's general election; a
weaker bond market; and the weaker dollar. The AEX gave up all of the gains
made in the first two days of the week, ending off 4.65 at 411.74.
Philips slipped 40 cents to Fl 56.60 after reporting a significant increase
in first quarter profits but warning that the rest of the year was likely to
remain difficult.
MADRID was 1.8 per cent lower on continuing concern about the the minority
Socialist government's ability to remain in power following allegations of
financial irregularities by former members of the ruling administration.
The general index fell 5.78 to 311.57, also weighed by rumours that the
sovereign debt rating was to be lowered, in spite of denials by leading
rating agencies.
Banesto fell Pta125 or 9.8 per cent to Pta1,155 after its 70 per cent surge
since the start of last week.
Telefonica gave up Pta40 to Pta1,735 in heavy volume.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Banks support dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central banks yesterday intervened repeatedly, in concert and on a large
scale, to support the dollar, writes Philip Gawith.
In what dealers described as the heaviest bout of intervention in several
years, as many as 17 central banks were seen selling D-Marks and yen to buy
dollars.
The heavy support for the US currency, coupled with the comments of senior
officials, provided a clear indication that G7 governments are unhappy with
the recent weakness of the dollar.
The US currency finished in London at DM1.662, up from a day's low of
DM1.6339 and Tuesday's close of DM1.6461. Against the yen, the dollar ended
at Y102.205, off an intraday low of Y100.75 and up from the previous close
of Y101.315. In New York the dollar closed at DM1.6545 and Y101.845.
Elsewhere, the Bundesbank sanctioned a 6 basis-point fall in the German repo
rate to 5.41 per cent. In Belgium the key central rate was shaved by 10
basis points to 5.50 per cent.
Central bank support for the dollar came in two parts yesterday. The first
salvo was delivered by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank. Early
in the morning a comment from a speech he gave later in the day was released
to the press. 'A too strong appreciation (in the D-Mark), for example
against the dollar, is not in the interests of the German economy,' a
spokesman quoted Mr Tietmeyer as saying.
The dollar rose on these comments, which caught the market unawares. With
hindsight, Mr Tietmeyer's comments were clearly setting the stage for the
intervention that followed. Intervention is normally most effective when the
currency is already moving in the central bank's direction and Mr
Tietmeyer's comments helped the dollar off early lows.
The extent of the intervention was difficult to quantify, but one market
source put it at 'several billion dollars'. One bank reported seeing 10
rounds of intervention by the Fed alone. Most European central banks, as
well as the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada, were
also seen in the market.
The first bout of intervention came around midday in Europe when the Fed
bought dollars at about Y101.50. It soon followed up by buying dollars
around DM1.6570. Other central banks had, meanwhile, also started to buy the
dollar.
Mr David Cocker, currency analyst at Chemical Bank, commented: 'It was
pretty heavy. We have not seen anything like it for several years.'
Mr Brian Martin, senior economist at Citibank, said the intervention, taken
with Mr Tietmeyer's comments, was probably explained by concerns about
growth. With European economies still fairly depressed, German economic
recovery is dependent on a good export performance. A strong D-Mark makes
this more difficult.
Another explanation for the intervention is that dollar weakness was souring
the US Treasury market, thus complicating the funding of the US budget
deficit. Mr Cocker, however, disputed this view, arguing that dollar
weakness flows from bond market weakness, not vice versa.
He believes bond market jitters are the result of market uncertainty about
Fed intentions. 'The market has to believe you have reached a plateau in US
rates,' he said.
Mr Martin was sceptical about whether the central bank intervention would
work. 'In the short term, the markets may be reluctant to test the central
bank's resolve, but I do not see that much upside for the dollar.' Others
felt that the intervention would serve to break the market's belief that the
Fed is interested in a weaker dollar to boost exports.
Certainly the broad range of political support for the dollar will give
pause for thought. Commenting on the round of intervention, Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, said: 'This administration sees no
advantage in an undervalued currency . . . these operations reflect our view
that recent movements in exchange markets have gone beyond what is justified
by economic fundamentals.'
This message was echoed by Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy
minister, and Mr Tietmeyer.
Intervention was a mixed blessing for sterling, which lost nearly a cent
against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.4988 from Dollars 1.5085, but
gained against the D-Mark, finishing at DM2.491 from DM2.483.
In the money markets, the Bank of England provided assistance of Pounds
648m, compared to a shortage of Pounds 650m. Sterling interest rate futures
lost more ground owing to pessimism about the outlook for another interest
rate cut. The June contract closed 3 basis points lower at 94.56. Losses in
the longer contracts were greater.
The D-Mark declined against most currencies, although it was stronger
against the Spanish peseta and the Italian lira. Against the French franc it
finished at FFr3.424 from FFr3.426.
German call money eased to 5.45/55 per cent from 5.65/75 per cent after the
repo, while Euromark futures were slightly higher across the board.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (12): Measured
activities - League tables provide evidence of general trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior bankers' views of M &amp; A league tables border on the schizophrenic. If
their bank is doing well, they will happily use the tables as marketing
tools, sprinkling them liberally over every brochure they produce. When
their bank is not doing well, the tables are ignored, if not actively
denigrated. Another view is the pragmatic one: if the tables are going to be
published and publicised, they might as well be accurate.
If properly compiled, the tables are a useful measure of relative and
overall market activity. 'The tables are good for providing evidence of
general trends, showing what's going on and who's doing what,' says Mr Lewis
Lee, a director in Merrill Lynch International's M &amp; A department in London.
There are a number of caveats, however, including excessive geographic and
industry segmentation. 'That tends to give a misleading interpretation of
what's going on and the strengths and weaknesses of the banks,' says Mr Lee.
Another limitation which has to be acknowledged is that the subjective
nature of interpretation means league tables can be produced to bolster
virtually any argument.
The tables feature two principal kinds of distortion, according to Mr Ali
Wambold, head of international, Lazard Brothers, and a partner of Lazard
Freres in New York: misunderstanding the methodology and over or
under-reporting deals. 'We are chronic under-reporters; our whole philosophy
is built on discretion, and our instinct is not to disclose. Not all the
business we do appears in league tables.' Some banks have been known to go
to the other extreme, claiming for deals they might not have been involved
in.
Furthermore, modern deals have become much more sophisticated, and more
difficult for the tables to measure. 'It used to be boy meets girl, boy buys
girl,' says Mr Wambold. 'Today, it's much more multi-faceted than A buying
B. Joint ventures muddy the waters, and there's a lot of restructuring
taking place. How do you capture this in league tables as a measure of
merchant bank involvement in the strategic positioning of a company?'
Mr Robin Broadley, deputy chairman of Baring Brothers, saw the emergence of
league tables around 10 years ago as a good thing, but today joins those
highlighting the need for care in interpretation because of the different
criteria applied by different compilers. 'One clear problem is their
concentration on business involving quoted securities,' he says. 'A lot of
our business is not of that type.'
Barings is among those banks that have been running press advertisements
highlighting recent league table performance. In its case, these have
focused on its success, in tandem with Dillon Read, its strategic partner in
the US, in heading Securities Data Corp's 1993 transatlantic M&amp;A rankings.
Another bank that has been displaying its enthusiasm for the tables with a
series of advertisements is Union Bank of Switzerland.
'Recent league tables showing us in a top-five position in European
cross-border M&amp;A deals are a clear demonstration of our emergence as a
leading investment bank,' argues Mr Stephen Brisby, head of European
corporate finance at UBS.
There is broad agreement then that the tables, while far from perfect, are
useful, if only as a snapshot of which banks are involved in transactions in
one particular period. 'They do not give a true picture of what
relationships really exist between banks and companies; that can only be
judged by looking at the tables over a longer period than one year,' says Mr
Guy Dawson, head of corporate finance at Morgan Grenfell.
Adds Mr Will Samuel, joint head of J Henry Schroder Wagg's investment
banking division in London, 'They are not something that wins you business,
but they can give a buyer confidence that you are a brand leader.'
Students of the tables are further urged to take into account the volume of
deals done as well as their value. Banks can climb the tables very quickly
on the back of a single large deal, the classic example being in 1989 when a
plethora of advisers were involved on the Pounds 13.5bn bid by Hoylake for
BAT Industries. All those listed received full credit in the headline tables
for 1989, even though the bid failed lamentably. This deal also brutally
reinforced the point that league table success in any year is no guarantee
of a rosy future. Who can forget that a prominent adviser on that bid was
one Drexel Burnham Lambert?
Probably the two most quoted tables today are those produced by the UK's
Acquisitions Monthly magazine and by Securities Data Corp of the US.
'Acquisitions Monthly has been compiling league tables for 10 years,' says
Mr Philip Healey, the magazine's editor and publisher.
'We hope we have gained respect for our independence and fairness. Over the
past six months, the league tables have become more and more important in
the market place in Europe. Some banks are stretching the truth, taking
advantage of the growing complexity of some European deals and confusion
over the various degrees of possible involvement.'
The simplest tables are probably those compiled by Crawford's Directory of
City Connections, for financial advisers, stockbrokers and public relations
advisers.
There is no argument about the methodology behind, or fairness of, these
tables which are compiled by awarding one point for each client, and a half
point for joint adviser status.
This relationship-centred method is immune to the huge fluctuations of
fortunes that can be experienced with the transactions-related methods. 'We
feel our tables are a very objective measure,' says Adria Kinloch, editor of
Crawford's. 'The information is compiled and confirmed by the companies
themselves and reflects a long-term relationship rather than short-term
dealing.'
It is difficult to see the rankings compiled by the industry's leading
publications developing into a more formal system. The compilers are
arguably as objective as can be and so long as the different criteria are
understandable, logical, fair and consistent, bankers are generally happy.
A radical step might be for the banks who benefit from the tables in their
marketing to fund the independent production of a new independent set of
tables to an agreed industry standard. As things stand, though, the
international M &amp; A arena is like the world of international boxing,
boasting a proliferation of organisations distributing titles with gay
abandon. While the purists might like to see unification, the marketing men
like the wide range of tables available.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (11): Habit proves
catching - Privatisation programmes are proliferating in eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent dearth of acquisition work in the UK has sharpened the merchant
bankers' appetite for overseas adventures. These days, the archetypal Mr
Ivor Ffyne-Mandate, clad in regulation pin-stripe suit and Ferragamo tie, is
more likely to be rushing round the globe hawking his investment bank's
financial expertise in Paris, Rome or Buenos Aires than advising on the
merger of two Midlands-based metal bashers. The wave of privatsations
sweeping around the world is proving their chief temptation.
The UK was one of the first countries to embark on an ambitious drive to
privatise state-owned assets. But for debt-laden governments, the habit is
proving infectious. Some estimates suggest the value of all privatisations
in western Europe may rise to Dollars 150bn over the next five years. That
is equivalent to about 2.5 per cent of the European Union's total gross
domestic product.
Big privatisation programmes are proliferating in eastern Europe and the Far
East. UK merchant banks, such as SG Warburg, Kleinwort Benson, Schroders and
Rothschilds, schooled in the domestic privatisation programme, are falling
over themselves to cash in on the trend. But mighty US rivals which have
also been active in the UK, such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and
Salomon Brothers, are aggressive competitors for privatisation work, too.
Fat fees can be earned advising governments how to parcel up assets to sell
them to the market. There are also rewards for valuing companies and
distributing their shares across the globe. The banks are hopeful of
developing longer-term relationships with foreign corporate clients after
the first flush of privatisation work is complete.
It helps that many of the privatised companies are in sensitive fields, such
as telecommunications, utilities, energy, and finance, which require some
regulatory disentanglement. UK banks which gained experience helping to sell
British Telecommunications, British Gas, the electricity generators and
water companies are well-placed to sell their knowledge abroad. But US banks
can bring particular skills to bear. For example, Morgan Stanely, which
helped restructure the US telecommunications sector in the early 1980s is
hopeful of winning similar work in Europe. That could prove especially
lucrative given that telecommunications stocks may account for up to 25 per
cent of the value of all privatised assets.
The French and Italian privatisation programmes are attracting the most
attention. The Balladur government had an initial list of 21 companies it
wanted to transfer to the private sector. The big privatisations it has
conducted so far, including BNP, Rhone-Poulenc, and Elf Aquitaine have met
with keen demand from both overseas and domestic investors.
But the current turbulence in the world's equity markets is causing
uncertainty and will make it tricky to price forthcoming privatisations,
such as that of the French insurance group UAP. There is also a fear that
the sheer volume of international offerings over the next few years will
swamp demand.
But some observers believe the quality of recently-privatised companies
should stand them in good stead. Mr Francis Maude, the former Treasury
minister who now works at US investment bank Morgan Stanley, says: 'Last
year was a lovely market to make these offerings and the market this year
does not look as accommodating. But if in difficult markets there is a
flight to quality then privatised companies should do well.'
At present, the international presence and financial muscle of the big UK
and US banks puts them at a comparative advantage against local competitors.
But although European privatisations will open the door to new clients, they
will also help create future rivals. As Mr Maude explains it: 'For most
companies in most countries the right combination of advisers is a local
bank and a foreign bank. But as time goes by the domestic banks become more
skilled and experienced. There is a technology transfer taking place all the
time. We learn more about the local market but they learn more about our
skills as well.'
Other financial companies, too, are keen to muscle in on privatisation
deals. The big accounting and consulting firms such as Coopers &amp; Lybrand and
KPMG have been active in the privatisation market.
Their expertise lies in producing the accounts preparing companies for the
market but they are also keen to advise on restructuring and regulatory
issues.
Ms Vicky Pryce, the partner in charge of KPMG privatisation unit, says: 'We
can do almost everything that the banks can do except distribute the
shares.'
Although that deficiency locks them out of the most prestigious lead work in
western Europe, the consulting firms are rapidly developing a presence in
privatisation work in eastern Europe and the Far East.
Ms Pryce says KPMG has particular expertise at valuing companies,
restructuring them and preparing prospectuses. 'We often work alongside
merchant banks and are involved in the strategy of privatisation,' she says.
For example, KPMG worked alongside Rothschilds to help restructure and
privatise the Hungarian telecommunications company Matav prior to a Deutsche
Telekom-led consortium taking a 30 per cent stake for Dollars 875m last
year.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (9): Foreign
institutions are muscling in - Germany is starting to attract the
international investment banking community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slowly but surely, Germany is developing into a mecca for the international
investment banking community.
This is not because the country has suddenly acquired an 'equity culture' -
this is impossible when there are still only about 665 quoted companies and
most are still owned by families, banks and insurance companies rather than
performance-oriented institutional investors.
But even if the stock market is far from being the centre of German economic
might, some of the long-predicted developments for the German corporate
finance market are beginning to happen.
In M &amp; A, German companies are getting used to the idea of paying for
services they would previously have got for nothing from their house-banks.
In the capital markets arena, foreign institutions are muscling in and
winning mandates which would hitherto have been the preserve of the domestic
institutions.
These developments suggest that the long years of marketing effort in
Germany are beginning to bear fruit. But the surge of business reflects more
than successful selling - a cultural shift is taking place.
'Finally we have arrived in this market,' says Frank Beelitz, joint managing
director of Lehman Brothers in Germany. He is alluding to the success of
investment banks in general, but is proud to point out that Lehman was
retained by the Bavarian government to advise on the recent two-step merger
between Bayernwerk, the state-owned utility, and Viag, a big German energy
and metals conglomerate. The deal, Germany's biggest privatisation, values
the combined group at around DM19bn.
'Ten years ago this would have been a shoe-in for the Deutsche bank,' says
Beelitz. 'It shows how the market is developing. Corporate customers have
become sensitised to at least two issues.
'First, they can see the value of independent advice - cases such as the
near collapse of Metallgesellschaft and the Continental/Pirelli takeover
saga have served to illustrate, in a high profile way, the extent to which
the German universal banking system is fraught with conflicts of interest.
Second, the house-bank just does not have the capabilities to do the job. In
the 1970s a German company's response to my pitch would be 'well, my
house-bank will do that for me for free'. But there is now a growing
recognition that you get what you pay for.
'In all situations involving financial advice major corporations immediately
consider using Anglo-Saxon advisors and the beauty contest has become a fact
of business life in Germany.'
Such considerations have drawn a gamut of international institutions to set
up and expand their German operations. The population of Frankfurt, used to
bankers who wear white-socks (one of the big three German banks that tried
to ban them from the dealing floor, but was forced to give way after it
faced a revolt from staff) is now getting acquainted with the striped shirt
and red-braces brigade: the investment banker has arrived.
One after another the investment banks have signalled their intentions to
increase their presence in the Finanzplatz. Goldman Sachs famously doubled
its staff to 120 over 1992-93; Morgan Stanley has boldly declared it, too,
wants to double the staff in Frankfurt, to 160 by mid-1995; Beelitz - who
defected to Lehman last year with Peter Coym after the two of them built
Salomon Brothers into the most profitable investment bank in Germany - wants
to expand staff at his new firm from 90 now to 125 in the next 18 months.
'The biggest problem for us is not the amount of business, it is getting
hold of the right people,' says Beelitz. Indeed, young Germans and Austrians
who have spent some time abroad and are able to straddle the cultural divide
between Germany and the Anglo-American business environment are in enormous
demand.
This optimism contrasts with the 10 per cent fall in the absolute number of
M &amp; A transactions last year. According to statistics produced by the
Coopers &amp; Lybrand accountancy firm, the number of deals completed last year
fell to 2,231. Looking ahead, C &amp; L concludes that the main buyers of German
businesses next year will be foreign companies looking for bargains after
the recession has reduced vendors' expectations.
Financial transactions are also likely to rise, argues Coopers, with the
management buyout becoming an ever more popular solution to the problem of
management succession at 'mittelstand' or medium-sized companies. It is also
used as a way for big companies to divest themselves of unwanted
subsidiaries.
Whilst the bread and butter corporate finance work in Germany will continue
to be based on transactions involving smaller transactions, the future holds
one enormous piece of business which is already whetting the appetite of the
international investment banking community.
This is the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom. Beelitz at Lehman Brothers
reckons that the first tranche of the shares in the utility will be sold to
the public in early 1996. Between now and then, there is a huge amount of
investment banking work to be done in preparing the company for the markets
and the markets for the company. No appointments have been made yet, but
sources suggest that the mighty Deutsche Bank will be forced to share the
role of 'global coordinator' to the issue with a foreign investment bank. In
addition, a bank will have to be appointed as chief advisor to Telekom
itself and there is likely to be a pair of 'book-runners' for what is
expected to be a substantial tranche of the equity destined to be placed in
the US.
Assuming that the first privatisation is worth DM8bn, and fees amount to 3
per cent of that value, there are fees of DM240m waiting to be earned by the
investment banking community. The competition to get a share of this cake
has already begun.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (10): In search of
an overhaul - European financiers now view restructuring as part of their
staple diet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merchant banks and financial advisers are changing their opinion of
corporate restructuring, long regarded as a byword for redundancies, asset
disposals and a company's reluctant admission that it had failed to
diversify.
European financiers, who in the past told clients to restructure as a last
resort, now view the process as part of their staple diet and a growing
source of mergers and acquisition opportunities.
That change of heart has, to some extent, been forced by the economic
climate in continental Europe, where a raft of industries are struggling
with prolonged recession.
Against that background, restructuring has emerged as preventive medicine
against the worst effects of falling sales and increased competition.
International corporate financiers have become the mechanics of this
operation, with companies turning to them for a complete overhaul rather
than a routine service.
This involves identifying over-extended parts of the business; finding
likely buyers for non-core activities; and, where necessary, underwriting
injections of fresh capital.
Ms Naneen Neubohn, managing director of financial advisory services at
Morgan Stanley, says: 'Restructuring now encompasses a range of strategic
options. It can be as small as a dividend cut to a major change in a group's
debt portfolio.'
For many companies such moves are a precondition to forming international
alliances or, in some cases, making the group a palatable target for an
overseas suitor.
Sweden's Nobel Industries, for example, was forced to embark on a
significant restructuring last year before Akzo of the Netherlands would
proceed with its Pounds 1.38bn merger plan.
Mr Ken Costa, deputy-chairman at S G Warburg, claims the transaction -
creating one of Europe's largest chemical groups - shows how merchant banks
are benefiting from the restructuring process.
'The restructuring had to take place because Nobel's debt levels were too
high. It did that by using London's capital markets - it's proved a
resilient place to get these deals off the ground.'
Similar criteria also led to a radical shake-up and thousands of job losses
at Saab, the Swedish automotive group, before General Motors of the US took
a 50 per cent holding.
Once restructured and revived as part of an enlarged group, these companies
tend to be better placed to compete in international markets.
The restructuring process, meanwhile, has another side effect at least as
lucrative to the merchant banks as refinancing of struggling companies.
Mr John Griffiths Jones, senior corporate finance partner at accountants
KPMG, says disposals by companies undergoing restructuring have now become
the main source of takeover opportunities in the UK - promising sizeable
fees for the financial advisers involved.
He cites British Aerospace's decision to sell Rover Group earlier this year
to BMW of Germany as 'a classic example of restructuring by one group
leading to globalisation by another'.
Faced with strong competition in its main aerospace and defence businesses,
BAe opted to dispose of its automotive subsidiary - realising Pounds 800m in
cash. The deal - although opposed by Honda, Rover's long-term partners -
promised fresh capital for BAe's core businesses, while giving BMW access to
a wider product range and cheaper labour.
Corporate financiers stand to gain not only from fees on the main
transaction, but also from subsequent deals. KPMG, for example, says it has
been consulted by BAe on a large number of joint aerospace ventures, which
it now regards as a safer route to expansion.
'Restructured companies see joint ventures as a low-risk way into particular
markets, and more clients are now coming to us for advice on such projects,'
says Mr Griffiths Jones.
He is one of a growing number of financiers detecting a shift from outright
acquisitions to long-term strategic partnerships. Although there will always
be large one-off purchases, such as BMW's Rover acquisition, these have been
overtaken by mergers and joint ventures.
Mr Piers von Simson, head of corporate finance at S G Warburg, says these
deals are being driven by restructuring. 'Many companies have realised they
need to be more focused and can only progress as global players in
partnership with other groups.'
That realisation has been hastened, he adds, by a recession in Europe which
has forced companies to sell any non-core businesses trading at a discount.
In turn, that has created acquisition opportunities for groups which have
emerged from the downturn with strong balance sheets and healthy profits.
Mr Guy Dawson, head of corporate finance at Morgan Grenfell, says: 'There
are a lot of UK companies on a high earnings multiple and we can see them
making clever justifications for buying new subsidiaries.'
Under this heading, disposals and acquisitions now come under the
restructuring umbrella. Companies are using the process to concentrate on
core activities, while also expanding the business through international
joint ventures or by selecting potential subsidiaries with an obvious
industrial fit.
Guinness, for example, recently restructured its seven-year alliance with
LVMH in a move enabling the UK drinks group to concentrate on the French
company's cognac and champagne activities rather than its luxury goods and
fashion business.
Mr Tony Greener, Guinness chairman and chief executive, says the
restructuring will strengthen the companies' joint trading ventures and
prevent an outside takeover of the Moet Hennessy cognac and champagne
brands.
Such moves show how companies are using restructuring to overcome the
effects of recession and protect their core businesses, according to Mr
Richard Broadbent, director of investment banking at Schroders.
'Companies are now looking four or five years ahead and are putting the
steps in place to get them there,' he says.
'There's much more long-term strategic thinking taking place, and the option
most frequently considered is restructuring.'

FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (6): Insatiable
investment appetite - The reasons for the rush of investment banks to China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trying to call a corporate financier in Hong Kong just now is like trying to
get hold of a sun-worshipping Brit in the middle of December: none of them
is at home. Holidaymakers are where the sun is, bankers are where the debt
is - and today, with Beijing's huge appetite for capital to fund its
emergence into the developed world, China is very much where the debt is.
China has brought the US banks (and, to a lesser extent, their European
counterparts) flocking to Hong Kong despite the colony's rabid property and
wage inflation. Those new to Hong Kong, or beefing up operations there and
in China, include Bear Stearns, Salomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley, Merrill
Lynch, Goldman Sachs and N. M. Rothschild and Sons.
In the past two years Merrill Lynch has raised more than USDollars 4bn for
investment in China. Deals last year included the USDollars 342m public
offering for Shanghai PetroChemical and a role in China's HKDollars 1bn
global bond issue.
Mr Will Dennis, director of China business at NM Rothschild &amp; Sons (Hong
Kong), says: 'There is any amount of appetite for foreign investment in
China, subject to certain industries being restricted by government. In
telecommunications, for instance, two separate government ministers have
made announcements on foreign investment: one saying it was to be welcomed
and one saying it would not be allowed.
'The problem is there are certain industries where the government's desire
to restrict foreign access conflicts with requirements for capital inflow.'
Confusion - an inevitable facet of business in China, where red tape is
exacerbated by the pendulum of power between central and provincial
governments - notwithstanding, the opportunities offered on both the debt
and equity sides are vast. Moreover, bankers and accountants with regular
dealings in China report a slow but steady simplification of processes: from
a historical standpoint, the wheels of business have never been so well
oiled.
On the equity side, underwriting and financial advisory work provide the two
key streams of income. Since the first B shares - stock held by foreigners
in China companies - were launched in 1991 the number of issues has
mushroomed. Foreign ownership has been further swollen since the advent of H
shares - China shares sold on the Hong Kong stock exchange - last year.
Issue sizes range from around HKDollars 100m for a small company in Shanghai
or Shenzhen to the HKDollars 3.93bn raised by Maanshan Iron and Steel last
October. Not all issues are fully taken up - although so far this has not
happened with the H share issues - and the risk to underwriters of being
left with a slug of shares is higher than in Hong Kong.
Other key difficulties revolve around accounting and legal practices in
China, which lag behind international standards and necessitate hefty
reworking before bankers or investors can assess the state of a company.
Often they discover that a seemingly profitable enterprise is barely
breaking even, or vice versa.
The absence of a company law (this will be rectified on July 1) also creates
problems for foreign investors: it is common practice, for example, for
China companies to put a ban on shareholders whose interests fall below a
specified level attending general meetings. (This is for practical rather
than sinister reasons: the Chinese love of meetings means that 99 per cent
of shareholders are likely to turn up.)
On the debt side, the biggest opportunities lie in project financing
although, as Mr Dennis points out, virtually every area of business is
looking for foreign investment - especially as the government is expected to
bring back its austerity drive sometime this year, which will dry up
domestic lines of credit.
'We have our hands full trying to cope with the investment opportunities
offered to us and foreign companies coming in wanting to do joint ventures.
But converting those into completed deals as a percentage is fairly small
compared with the number that start off as a twinkle in somebody's eye,' he
says.
Not all projects bear up to full scrutiny, and investors and their advisers
spend vast resources on due diligence - checking out the assumptions made by
the China side on areas like availability of raw materials and sales.
Projects also require different approvals, and securing the go-ahead at one
level does not necessarily mean the local ministry, or State Planning
Commission, will endorse it. Further, Mr Dennis reckons up to 70 per cent of
the projects put to the bank are ruled out as not being cost effective.
Nor do China bosses always see eye to eye with their potential investors
from overseas. What the former want is investments that bring in foreign
exchange and technology, while the latter want projects that are going to
sell into China and make lots of money.
Virtually all projects are carried out on a pure non-recourse basis, and
guarantees tend to come from institutions such as the Bank of China or the
state's own foreign investment companies (the 'Itics').
Among the most high profile infrastructure projects are those being
undertaken by Hopewell, the Hong Kong property and construction company
which last November spun off its power station interests and is also
building the Guangzhou-Shenzhen superhighway. The power station projects are
on a Build Operate Transfer (BOT) basis, which is proving popular across
China.
The growing demand for capital, in itself reflective of a market economy in
transition, is also a feature of the stage of development under way in
India.
In the past six months Indian companies raised some USDollars 1.2bn
accessing the international capital markets: the USDollars 1bn Videsh
Sanchar Nigam is pending. Between April and December last year, USDollars
3bn was raised from the debt markets.
According to Mr Udayan Bose, chairman of Credit Capital, an investment bank
set up in association with Lazard Brothers, increasing volumes of capital
are flowing into India from overseas, reflecting the country's perceived
potential.
As in China, infrastructure is regarded as one of the biggest opportunities.
India is expected to make great strides in these areas in the coming years,
often starting from a low base (for instance, only 5.5 people out of every
1,000 have telephones; demand for electricity is growing at 8 per cent per
annum; the national highway is estimated to virtually double by the year
2001), creating huge demand for capital.
Mr Bose says the eighth Five Year Plan target to create a capacity of
19,800MW should mean an investment of more than USDollars 20bn on power
supply alone. On top of this, road systems work is expected to devour
USDollars 13bn and the government plans to spend USDollars 13.5bn on
telecommunications over the next five years.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (7): A special
relationship with Latin America - An investment bank operating in another
emerging market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since planting its flag in the New World more than a century ago, N. M.
Rothschild &amp; Sons believes it has now emerged as one of the leading
institutions in Latin America.
The privately-owned banking group, which established its presence by
handling Brazil's first bond issue, has nurtured a special relationship with
the region which has paid off in recent years with its appointment as
advisers to some of the largest privatisations ever undertaken by developing
countries.
Mr Michael Phair, a Rothschild's director with responsibility for emerging
markets, attributes that success to the bank's staying power in a continent
notorious for haemorrhaging money.
When other banks abandoned the region as political regimes developed a taste
for nationalisation, he says, Rothschild reinforced its presence,
particularly in Chile and Argentina.
That persistence brought its reward at the end of the 1980s as politicians
embraced free market principles instead of protectionism and state control.
'The change took place when the voters became so desperate that they opted
for trade liberalisation,' Mr Phair said.
A new breed of finance ministers came to office who had watched the
Thatcherite disposal programme restore some of Britain's economic vitality
in the 1980s, and they turned to merchant banks and advisers which had
handled the big issues.
So it was that Rothschild, adviser to the Department of Energy on the Pounds
5.6bn British Gas privatisation, landed some of the region's biggest
contracts.
The Argentine government appointed it to oversee the Dollars 4.2bn
restructuring and sale of Gas del Estado in 1992 - at the time, the largest
energy sell-off outside the UK.
It reinforced that success last month with its appointment as advisers on
the disposal of Electroperu's Central-North Interconnected System, Peru's
largest state sell-off.
The bank's efforts, however, have not been concentrated solely south of the
Rio Grande. Last year it exported its UK privatisation experience -
dominated by its advisory role in the Pounds 5.2bn sale of the 12 regional
electricity companies - to 18 countries, where it was appointed in 43
transactions.
That record left Rothschild as the world leader in privatisation assignments
for the second year running, according to the 1993 league table compiled by
Privatisation International, the specialist magazine.
Mr Tony Alt, the bank's managing director of corporate finance, believes the
ranking reflects its success in developing expertise in particular
industries.
It has, for example, teams devoted to telecommunications which cut their
teeth on the British Telecommunications sell-off, and its more recent
Dollars 4.3bn link with MCI of the US and the Dollars 2.2bn sale of their
holding in McCaw Cellular.
It has picked up the role as adviser to Hungarian Telecom, of which 30 per
cent was sold last December for Dollars 875m, and is advising the Dutch
government on the forthcoming privatisation of the KPN post and telephone
utility.
'We're deeply involved in this process and we intend to build on our
expertise,' says Mr Alt.
That strategy does not always pay off. Last October, Rothschild was one of a
number of banks which saw a hefty investment and six-month bidding effort
evaporate after the government of Singapore scaled down the privatisation of
Singapore Telecommunications.
It decided the partial sell-off, in which Goldman Sachs was named adviser,
would not be underwritten - depriving the bank of an estimated Pounds 20m in
underwriting fees.
Last autumn, the Greek government also dealt a blow to Rothschild by sacking
it as leading adviser on the privatisation of OTE, the state
telecommunications company.
A senior official in the socialist government, said at the time: 'We're
naive perhaps, but we were shocked at the size of the fees the conservatives
were prepared to pay to foreign consultants.'
Rothschild is coy about privatisation fees. Without naming figures, Mr Phair
says: 'It's very labour intensive and not overly remunerative.'
The bank does not disclose whether it collects 2 per cent of a deal's value
on completion - the prevailing rate in Europe in recent years - or if it's
moving towards charging an hourly rate, as advocated by the European
Commission.
The real reward, says Mr Phair, is the reputation which a successful
privatisation earns for the advisers. 'In the past, many banks regarded
working for governments as rather unattractive, but it has proved an
extremely good springboard to other business.' The spin-offs include rights
issues, divestments, bond issues and acting as 'adviser to several companies
which have achieved considerable growth through successful acquisitions.'
Its clients include Nabisco, Hanson, Revlon and Marks &amp; Spencer.
Mr Alt, meanwhile, says the bank is expanding its activities in largely
untapped markets such as South Africa and China.
He led a delegation recently to South Africa, where the bank told 38
companies that its experience - initially through handling mining stocks and
subsequently through secondary market-making by its associate brokers Smith
New Court - made it well placed to offer access to international capital.
The bank is also about to set up an office in Shanghai to build up its
corporate finance and bullion finance operations.
'These countries are aware of outside finance, but they're not focused,'
says Mr Alt. 'What we're offering is access to international capital markets
and the ability to guide them through cross-border mergers and acquisitions
 -that's what N. M Rothschild is all about.'

FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (8): Insecurity at
securities houses - The reluctance of UK investment banks to integrate
activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In mid-March, it was announced that Kleinwort Benson and Barclays de Zoete
Wedd were teaming up to bid - ultimately successfully - for the role as the
British government's adviser on the next stage of electricity privatisation.
To some observers, it was a clever combination of two companies who realised
they were far more attractive together than either of them were
individually. But to others, the implications were ominous.
If companies, which already have reasonable expertise in advising,
distributing and underwriting securities transactions cannot compete on
their own for government privatisation business, what future is there for
the non-integrated securities firm?
In analysing how the US securities firms have transformed the business on
the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, investment bankers say the most
important contribution has been the structural role model; the integrated
investment bank.
In the years immediately following London's Big Bang, deregulating the old
divide between those who broked securities for retail clients and those who
traded them, firms made a mad dash to consolidate.
UK and Continental banks bought up capacity, much of it at exorbitant
prices, only to find the newcomer's business culture was alien to his own
and could not be integrated.
In Britain, some companies, such as Barings and Schroder, have determinedly
stuck to their core businesses, declining to follow the US model and have
done so highly successfully.
Other Continental players follow the model of Dutch-based ABN-Amro. The bank
acquired UK stockbroker Hoare-Govett in 1992 and says it wishes only to act
as stockbroker, not market maker in securities. That approach, it says, has
made it more attractive to corporate clients who fear the potential
conflicts of interest at an integrated company.
In the UK, industry participants point to the success of Cazenove, the
family-owned stockbroking firm which dominates corporate broking in Britain.
It has never made any pretense of integration and although its profits are
not published, is said to have made steady progress all through the years of
the latest UK recession.
Another company which has eschewed the integrated route is Schroders, which
posted record pre-tax profits in 1993, at Pounds 195.8m, an 85 per cent rise
on the previous year. It also revealed its hidden reserves for the first
time, showing it had some Pounds 102m in capital on its books.
However, Schroders has relatively little capacity to distribute securities -
a shortcoming which some analysts believe may undermine its ability to
attract the corporate clients who contributed so much to its success last
year.
But the question for companies such as Schroders is whether the changes in
the way companies are financed is so fundamental that only the multi-purpose
securities house will be able to compete effectively.
'If you look around the globe outside Britain, you will see that the
business is going the other way. It's all integrated - it's all singing, all
dancing securities houses,' said a director at a leading UK merchant bank.
Aside from reasons of tradition, City officials say there are some anomalies
which make the non-integrated investment bank in Britain more resilient to
competitive pressures than it would be elsewhere.
For one thing, capital raising exercises for existing UK companies are
almost always subject to the pre-emptive rights of current shareholders.
That means the current shareholders get to buy new shares at a discount and
those who help underwrite an offering earn a fee which bears no relation to
the risk involved. In that environment, companies may seek the services of a
separate corporate adviser and stockbroker.
But if US-style book-building exercises ever came into play, merchant bank
advisers would be risking their own capital in bringing issues to market,
requiring them to have advisory, underwriting and distribution capacity.
Integrated investment banking now encompasses the origination, structuring,
issuing, trading and distribution of debt and equity securities at home and
abroad.
Other functions such as corporate finance advisory and mergers and
acquisitions activities, as well as fund management are usually part of the
core activities as well.
'The principal driver of most of these strategies is defensive,' analysts at
Salomon Brothers, the US-based securities house, said in a recent research
report.
Because banks fear the loss of corporate clients to the securities markets -
rapidly replacing traditional bank loans as the principal source of finance
 -banks have had to alter their strategies.
But increasingly, the Salomon report notes, integration means geographical
integration - not just product integration.
Indeed, the US investment banks, who top the league tables in almost every
aspect of the securities industry, say it is their international expertise,
not just their command of their home market, which has made them serious
contenders for European corporate finance and merger and acquisition
business.
'We can sell a German steel producer to an Indonesian buyer,' said one
official at Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank which has been among
the most successful in cracking the European markets.
But that kind of global integration is simply not possible without a cash-
generating home market, securities industry officials concede. 'To the
extent that we have a significant presence in the US market we have been
able to afford running an office, in say, Hong Kong at a loss for 10 years,'
said one Goldman Sachs official.
But outside the US, it is difficult to find a domestic capital market
capable of generating that kind of cash.
'My greatest disappointment has been the realisation that we (in the UK)
will never get the kind of home market out of the EC that we had hoped. At
least not in my lifetime,' said a board member at one leading UK merchant
bank.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (5): Playing host
to foreign issuers - There has been a move to come direct to the US for
capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US capital markets have been playing host to a steadily growing number
of foreign issuers. While US investment has fuelled the growth in many of
the world's stock and bond markets since 1992, with pension and mutual funds
in the vanguard, there has been a less noticed move by many foreign
companies and governments to come direct to the US for capital.
The pick-up is notable from all the barometers of market activity. The
supply of new Yankee bonds, for instance - bonds sold in the US market by
non-US issuers - jumped to nearly Dollars 42bn in 1993, according to figures
from Securities Data.
The previous record, reached the year before, had been just Dollars 27bn,
and the rate of capital raising was running at an even higher rate in the
first quarter of this year.
Foreign companies also sold Dollars 9bn of common stock in the US last year,
well above the previous high point of around Dollars 5bn, reached in 1992
and 1987.
Private placements, meanwhile - which under Rule 144a are exempted from many
normal disclosure requirements - jumped to Dollars 24bn, from Dollars 11bn
in 1992.
Each of these market indicators suggests that a growing list of issuers
believes it is worth coming direct to the US for capital, rather than
waiting for US capital to seek them out in other financial markets.
The Yankee bond market has attracted sovereign borrowers such as Thailand,
Korea, Hungary and Indonesia, each of which chose to make their first steps
abroad in the US arena, rather than in the international (or 'eurobond')
market more often used for such borrowing. 'US investors have been
particularly open to look at new borrowers and new credits,' says Charles
Berman, of Salomon Brothers in London.
The US private placement market, meanwhile, has long provided a source of
long-term, fixed-rate funding which many foreign companies cannot get
anywhere else. Usually, foreign companies raise such capital to match dollar
liabilities. Wertheim Schroder, which has handled many of the private
placements in the US by European companies, says that the market is also
being used increasingly to raise money which is then swapped into another
currency - a clear sign that demand in the US for some securities has
reached a level at which more foreign issuers are likely to be tempted out
of their domestic markets.
For all the activity, though, there has been a notable lack of high-profile
foreign listings in the US.
A year ago, the debut of Daimler Benz on the New York Stock Exchange seemed
to herald a new era for the US's biggest stock market. Having overcome
German reluctance to disclose the sort of financial information demanded by
the US Securities and Exchange Commission, it seemed that the US exchange
had at last found a way of establishing itself on the map as a serious
international market place. But few other companies have shared the view
that the attractions of a US listing are alluring enough to overcome the
burdens of meeting US regulatory rules.
What demand there has been from foreign issuers has come mainly from Latin
America. Led by the Dollars 2bn depository receipt issue by the Argentine
company YPF - the largest deal of its kind ever in the US - Latin American
borrowers raised Dollars 5.5bn last year, compared with the Dollars 4.3bn
raised by European issuers, according to figures from Citibank.
The SEC, while not budging from its position that protecting US investors
remains its overriding goal, has been trying to smooth the way for foreign
issuers.
In April, it relaxed many of its regulations for foreign companies, for
instance by allowing them to use a short-form registration document and
permitting cashflow statements which comply with international accounting
standards (the first time the US regulators have countenanced anything that
does not meet the US's own accounting regime).
'As our experience with foreign issuers grows, (we) will continue to
discover ways to assist them with the transition to our disclosure system,
and therefore to our markets,' said Mr Arthur Levitt, the commission's
chairman.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (3): Dominating
'beauty parades' - US investment banks are seizing the initiative in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The power of US investment banks waxed and waned in Europe in the last
decade, but their corporate finance business have taken a decisive step
forward in the 1990s.
Despite the big fees which banks such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and
Salomon Brothers demand, the US banks have now achieved such influence that
they often dominate 'beauty parades' for new business in Europe.
The pattern of appointments to originate offerings of stock in
newly-privatised European companies illustrates the point. 'A government
usually appoints its flagship bank in the lead role, and then to make sure
the transaction gets done, almost every time it appoints a US firm second,'
says Mr Kevan Watts, head of European investment banking for Merrill Lynch.
This means that even European investment banks with pretensions to become
world-class players such as S G Warburg and Swiss Bank Corporation find
themselves competing hard simply to retain blue chip work in their domestic
markets.
There are a number of factors why the large US investment banks have become
so influential in Europe over the past five years:
They have been able to invest both capital and people in expanding European
operations because of the strong underlying profitability of US businesses.
The large equity underwriting fees still earned by the 'bulge bracket' US
firms are largely unchallenged in their home market, despite S G Warburg's
success in underwriting an equity offering for Cummins Engine.
They dominate access to large US investing institutions which have become
increasingly important for European companies seeking capital. European
governments have consistently used US firms to gain access to the US to
ensure the success of privatisations. 'The US represents 40 per cent of the
world's capital markets, and we really control that market,' says Mr Watts.
US banks have brought innovations such as book-building in equity offerings.
They have also introduced new methods of valuing companies, and an
innovative approach to structuring deals. 'We do a lot of financial
modelling to give our clients comfort, but some European competitors do not
do that,' says Mr John Studzinski, a managing director of Morgan Stanley.
European companies have increasingly tended to view the hiring of a US firm
alongside their traditional merchant bank as being a means of getting a
wider view. 'For a British company, having a banker in the room that does
not think about the world simply from the perspective of the south-east of
England, can be quite a useful stimulus,' says Mr Watts of Merrill Lynch.
US investment banks that were schooled in the era of 'financial engineering'
on Wall Street in the 1980s are used to the idea of bringing new ideas to
company chairmen. 'We do a lot of initiating of ideas, whereas if a chief
executive wants advice from his merchant bank, he often has to ask them to
come round,' says Mr Alan Gillespie, a Goldman Sachs partner.
Apart from the demand for US firms, the US banks themselves see Europe as
fertile territory. Mr Walter Gubert, chairman of J P Morgan's European
advisory committee, says that Germany is one country where companies need
more advice. 'The country has not had a mergers and acquisitions culture in
the past, but companies now have a new set of challenges,' he says.
Other firms also view Europe as a set of markets which are increasingly open
to a US approach. As institutional investment grows, they believe that
European firms will need sophisticated advice. 'Europe companies are
entering the world economy having been shielded from it for a long time.
They face a different environment,' says Mr Studzinski of Morgan Stanley.
The US firms also argue that blue chip European companies which acquire US
shareholders will have to take care to manage the relationship rather than
assuming goodwill. 'There are more sensitivities now. If you have Fidelity
(the large US asset management company) as an investor, it means you have to
think a little differently,' says Mr Studzinski.
The US firms have benefitted strongly from the wave of cross-border work in
Europe, which allows them to bring to bear their strong networks in putting
together deals. Mr Gubert of J P Morgan argues that this 'global capability'
is an even more important factor in giving the US firms an edge, rather than
their innate access to the US capital markets.
Yet it has not all been plain sailing for US firms. They have to show
European firms that they have a true feel for local markets and ways of
doing business in addition to possessing skills. Competitors of J P Morgan
in Spain were quick to portray the removal of management at its client Banco
Espanol de Credito as an example of a US bank misunderstanding a local
market.
Mr Gubert says that the bank trains Europeans in US disciplines to achieve a
mix of qualities. 'Europe is not the US, and Berlin is not London. The most
successful firms will be those that combine Anglo-Saxon coverage of
investors with a thorough understanding of the way things are done locally,'
he says.
For the moment, the US firms have made sound investments. But any flagging
of the flow of privatisations could leave them with an excessively high cost
base. This might force them to push further into domestic markets. One US
banker estimates that his firm currently would not bother to compete for 60
per cent of local firms' business even if it could get it.
It would be at this point that the old accusation levelled at US firms -
that they only remain as long as the going is good - could re-surface. Yet
the gradual move towards global flows of capital may keep US firms in place
even in tougher times to ensure their network stays intact. If so, European
investment banks may find that the competition is only just starting.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (2): A much
healthier business than it was - Mergers and acquisitions have shrugged off
the stigma of the 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 1990s takeover market was meant to be a more peaceful, moderate
affair than the superheated version of the 1980s, a number of 'firsts' in
recent months appear to have exploded the myth.
There was the first three-cornered multibillion dollar battle for control of
a US corporation this decade, for instance - the Dollars 10bn struggle
between Viacom and QVC for control of Paramount Communications.
Or the first big bid battle of the 1990s which was entirely bank-financed -
the Dollars 2bn tussle between Martin Marietta and Northrop for defence
contractor Grumman. And the first hostile proxy battle of the 1990s - GE
Capital's campaign to win the support of shareholders in Kemper, which has
so far rebuffed its Dollars 2bn offer.
These, and a host of other transactions announced since the start of last
year, suggest that the acquisition business has shrugged off the stigma it
acquired at the end of the 1980s, when buy-outs and other debt-financed
takeovers became notorious more for their ability to destroy value than
create it. Emboldened by the success of others - and perhaps fearing that
they will be left out in the race for attractive acquisition targets - more
and more chief executives are joining in.
The availability of finance has had a part to play, as it did in the 1980s.
Then, it was the junk bond market and the willingness of banks to advance
big bridging loans that pepped up the market.
Now, it is cheap equity, even after the recent correction in the stock
market. Also, low long-term interest rates have enabled many companies to
cut their interest bills by refinancing debt taken on in the 1980s, in turn
boosting their internal cash flow. And even the banks are back: financing
takeovers is one of the best-remunerated ways for banks to employ what for
many has become an excess of capital.
For all this, things are not what they were. The frenetic battle for
Paramount appeared to have more in common with the deals of the late 1980s
than the 1990s: the corporate tussle, a thinly veiled fight between the big
egos of the protagonists, the suggestions of overpaying, the strained
financial structure that resulted, the asset sales that will now follow to
play down debt. These characteristics have been largely absent from other
recent big transactions.
'It is a much healthier business than it was,' says Mr Felix Rohatyn, a
leading takeover adviser at Lazard in New York. 'We haven't seen the kind of
purely financially-driven transactions we saw in the 1980s - over-leveraged,
poorly financed, driven by a lot of market speculation.' Financial
engineering is out: other forces are at work behind the latest rush of
deals.
First, much of the takeover activity is being driven by a need to cut costs.
This is concentrated in particular in three industries: healthcare, banking
and defence.
In some corners of the healthcare world, mergers and acquisitions have come
to be seen as one answer to the pressure from managed care organisations to
restrain prices. The Clinton healthcare plan may add to this pressure, but
whatever the political outcome, there is little doubt that the healthcare
sector will remain under pressure to cut its costs.
Takeovers remain one solution. Columbia Healthcare - now the biggest
hospital group in the US, following its takeover last year of Hospital
Corporation of America - has made little secret of its aim to close down
excess hospital capacity.
Another service sector with a big cost problem - banking - has also been
subjected to a wave of takeovers and mergers. Typically, taking over a bank
should yield cost savings of around 30 per cent, says Mr John Tugwell, head
of National Westminster in the US. NatWest has been one of very few foreign
banks to get caught up in the consolidation of the US banking industry,
earlier this year announcing a takeover which will expand its presence in
New Jersey.
A second factor behind these and other takeovers has been a changing
regulatory and legal environment. Bank mergers, for instance, have gained
extra impetus from the likelihood that interstate banking will finally pass
into law later this year. The move by the 'Baby Bell' telephone companies
into cable television has been hastened by the threat to their own local
monopolies posed by planned legislation.
A third factor - technological advance - has also been behind the coming
together of what used to be three distinct industries: telecoms, cable
television and entertainment. A coming revolution in distribution - the
much-vaunted 500-channel cable TV, for instance - has intensified
competition between rival distribution channels, while at the same time
helping to bring together the distributors of programming with the
producers.
Says Mr Rohatyn: 'The things that we're doing, that most people are involved
in, are driven by either technological or regulatory or legislative changes
 -whether it is the regulation and technology of communications and media,
the legislation and the changes that are coming in healthcare, or in
banking, or in mutual funds.'
Partly for these reasons, much of the recent takeover activity by US
corporations has been concentrated within the US. At the end of the 1980s,
transatlantic takeovers were all the rage, reaching Dollars 47bn in value in
1989: since then, interest has dwindled. Takeover activity within the US, on
the other hand, last year bounced back almost to the same level reached in
1988 and 1989.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (4): A stately
route to success - Goldman Sachs achieved notoriety in Europe after a record
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Last year was uncomfortably successful for Goldman Sachs in Europe. Although
it has had substantial operations in London for 25 years, it finally
achieved popular notoriety when each partner earned a reputed Dollars 5m
(Pounds 3.4m) profit share after a record year.
For the European partners, this was a mixed blessing. Although the money -
entirely ploughed back into the partners' capital accounts - no doubt came
in useful, the windfall reflected more a one-way bet on bond and currency
markets than their achievement in developing Goldman's underlying strength
in Europe.
Yet it was not just bonuses that made European investment banks talk about
Goldman last year. Along with other US investment banks, there were
increasing signs that Goldman's corporate finance business was providing
uncomfortably fierce competition for the domestic houses across Europe.
Goldman has developed at a more stately pace in Europe than some other US
investment banks. This partly reflects the management style deriving from it
remaining a partnership. The need to reach consensus means that it can take
longer to commit forces than others, but tends to be more consistent.
Mr Artur Walther, co-head of Goldman's Frankfurt office, says this helped
Goldman to avoid over-rapid European expansion in the 1980s. 'We did not
have the bad experience of the 1980s, and there were people waiting in
London to be transferred when things started to change and open up here,' he
says.
In the 1970s, Goldman's London operation was largely confined to being an
arm of the US broking business, selling US stocks to British pension funds.
But the firm made its mark in the 1980s through corporate finance, giving
advice to companies on how to fend off hostile bids.
Mr Rick Sapp, a London-based mergers and acquisitions partner, says that its
valuation techniques, and willingness to restructure companies in defences
marked it out. 'We were aggressive in defending shareholder value against
bad offers, rather than just defending management.'
Mr Sapp adds Goldman has moderated that approach in the 1990s to suit less
aggressive times. 'We offer alternatives, and the clients can choose for
themselves. We do not go around advising companies to rip themselves apart
for fun, and you certainly should not do it at this point in the cycle.'
The most important change in Goldman's business in the 1990s has been the
diversification into continental Europe. After building its corporate
finance arm on UK bid defences and privatisation, and helping European
companies enter the US, it concentrated on cross-border work.
'We realised quite quickly that the European market was relatively untouched
by UK merchant banks, and we could offer an international perspective to
companies which had relied on local banks,' says Mr Sapp. Its targets were
the largest blue chip European companies operating across borders.
Mr Richard Sharp, chief operating officer for European investment banking
services, says that it gained by concentrating on cross-border work. 'We did
not have the natural flow of business in any one country. For us, European
work was everything, and so we went at it with intensity,' he says.
In practice, this has meant a lot of work advising European companies on
cross-border acquisitions and restructuring. Mr Sylvain Hefes, the head of
Goldman's Paris office, says that one of its most important attractions is a
network of contacts with blue chip companies.
'Anyone can produce a book, and say that this company in Hong Kong is a
potential partner because he did this or that deal. But when it comes to
saying it is managed by Mr X and this is how he thinks, and this is how his
board is structured, then it is harder for a local bank.'
By structuring cross-border deals, Goldman can justify fees which are high
compared with some European competitors. 'We believe in repeat business, so
the fee has to be justified. It can be both significant, yet modest in
proportion to the value of the deal,' says Mr Sharp.
This may be a more difficult task as Goldman tries to move more deeply into
Europe in domestic as well as cross-border advisory work. Although it has
managed to persuade many of the large UK companies to employ it alongside UK
merchant banks, it has yet to achieve the same strength elsewhere.
Goldman's partners admit that it is still vulnerable to European competitors
playing on its US roots. But Mr Hefes says it can flourish despite this. 'We
do not have to wrap ourselves in the French flag. We just have to show that
we are competent, and we are here to stay,' he says.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Smelting cuts hit alumina
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent prices of alumina (aluminium oxide) are below the operating costs of
about two-thirds of western world refinery capacity. 'The (alumina) refinery
sector has become a source of concern,' says Alcan, the Canadian aluminium
group.
Alcan points out that 'demand is fading' because producers around the world
are cutting back aluminium output following recent meetings of trade
representatives of the big aluminium producing countries. Delegates agreed
that annual cuts of between 1.5m and 2m tonnes for two years were needed to
bring the market back into balance. That would result in a drop of 3m to 4m
tonnes in alumina usage.
Ironically, many of the industry's bigger groups are vertically integrated:
they dig up bauxite, they refine this ore into alumina, smelt this into
aluminium and then make semi-fabricated aluminium products.
'The disparity between costs and market prices is causing integrated
producers considerable consternation,' says Alcan in its latest Perspectives
newsletter. 'Adding to the consternation is pre-existing dissatisfaction
with the historically poor rate of return on refining assets as well as the
fact that the refinery sector has become one more problem - along with
smelting and rolling - with which management must deal rather than a source
of cash to help offset losses elsewhere.'
Alcan suggests that the price of readily-available alumina has dropped by
about 25 per cent since the middle of last year, from USDollars 160 a tonne
to Dollars 120-Dollars 125 a tonne. It quotes Resource Strategies, a US
consultancy organisation, which estimates that the average production costs
of 12 companies that operate refineries as well as smelters are Dollars 165
to Dollars 260 a tonne, 'before any allowance for a return on the capital
invested in refinery capacity'.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Crop setbacks put cotton market
in a spin - Prices have risen by more than 50 per cent to 3-year highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US cotton exporters and south-east Asian yarn-spinners are benefiting from
sharp falls in production in China, Pakistan and India that have pushed up
world prices for raw cotton by more than 50 per cent in the last five
months.
The Cotlook 'A' index, published by Cotton Outlook, the authoritative
Liverpool-based trade publication, has risen by about 30 cents to 86 cents a
pound since December, its highest level for nearly three years. At the same
time the prompt position at New York's cotton futures market has risen from
62 cents to over 86 cents a pound.
All three Asian producers, along with Turkey, have slapped export
restrictions on cotton to protect their important domestic textile
industries.
The International Cotton Advisory Committee, a Washington-based association
of exporting and importing nations, estimates the production decline will
mean about 480,000 tonnes less cotton reaching the world market from those
countries than expected. World trade in cotton is about 6m tonnes a year.
Dr Terry Townsend, statistician to the ICAC secretariat, suggests that the
US, notably Texas and Oklahoma, which grow coarse cotton like that produced
in India and Pakistan, would enjoy a rise in exports of up to 150,000
tonnes, or 10 per cent.
'The US is the biggest exporting beneficiary, although Uzbekistan and other
central Asian countries will benefit,' he says.
The drop in Turkish exports will mean an extra 50,000 tonnes of the
longer-fibre type produced in Turkey is likely to be exported by the US
states of California and Arizona, along with Australia and countries in west
Africa.
Consumers will not feel the price rise because raw cotton accounts for a
negligible part of the price of finished clothes, he says. But they may
notice fewer items from China, India and Pakistan.
'The real beneficiaries are countries like Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Hong
Kong, whose yarn-spinning industries face less competition from yarn made in
the main cotton-producing countries,' says Dr Townsend.
The main Asian cotton producers are suffering meanwhile. The ICAC has
predicted that the Pakistani cotton shortfall and its impact on the textile
industry will reduce GDP by 2 per cent.
The 1993-94 crop in Pakistan is nearly 40 per cent below expectations
following a severe attack of leaf curl virus, which the ICAC fears could
spread to northern India and central Asia in the next few years. Pakistan,
hit by a second successive bad year, stopped all exports, including
shipments of cotton for which contracts had been signed, in January.
China and India, the world's largest and third largest producers
respectively, have suffered attacks from the bollworm pest. Output in three
key cotton provinces in north east China has dropped to about 1m tonnes from
3m tonnes two years ago.
The shortages have brought many textile plants in China to a standstill.
Avoiding an outright export ban, the government stopped issuing export
licences in mid-January, and since then it has only allowed the shipment of
some 4,000 tonnes of cotton for which contracts had been signed and letters
of credit opened.
However, Mr Mike Edwards of Cotton Outlook says the market's main
preoccupation is with China's purchases abroad, which are just beginning.
'Depending on how large they are, that could send the market a little bit
higher,' he predicts.
The ICAC price model calculates that every 53,000 tonnes of additional
cotton imported by China translates into a rise of 1 cent in the Cotlook
index.
In India, where output is down nearly 400,000 tonnes to 2m tonnes, sales and
shipments were banned in January and February. But shipments registered for
export by February 9 have since resumed.
Turkey, whose crop was hit by poor weather, stopped all exports in January
with a 40 per cent tax, although in March it relented by allowing cotton
registered for sale to be shipped without the tax.
Cotton accounts for 48 per cent of world fibre use, but the drop in
production will push that share down slightly, to the advantage of wool and
artificial fibres, says Dr Townsend. He adds, however, that at current
prices, cotton production is likely to increase in the US, central and south
America, Africa and Australia to make up the decline.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee surges still higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London coffee futures surged again yesterday to touch new 5-year highs above
Dollars 1,700 a tonne in nearby positions as the squeeze on supplies
continued to dominate the market. The July futures contract at the London
Commodity Exchange held on to Dollars 41 of its earlier Dollars 63 rise to
close at Dollars 1,683 a tonne.
However, traders said the rapid price rise over the past couple of weeks had
made many buyers nervous and reluctant to trade and that the price was being
pushed up in relatively light volume.
In New York, July futures on arabica coffee broke through the key resistance
level of 95 cents a pound to touch 97 cents at one stage, but later dropped
back to 95 cents.
'New York has reacted aggressively to London's lead, but although it remains
strong, the market is more tentative today than earlier in the week,' said
Mr Bill O'Neill, softs analyst at Merrill Lynch.
With the July price having risen by Dollars 120 a tonne this week alone, the
market is vulnerable to a sharp correction, but analysts believe the
long-term direction is upwards.

Spot and shipment sales in Liverpool amounted to 149 tonnes for the week

Cutbacks in world aluminium production agreed by the world's main producers
could see the market restored to balance in 1996, according to the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
At the same time, it warns that the outlook for bauxite (aluminium ore) and
alumina (aluminium oxide) producers is 'not encouraging'. Reduced demand
from aluminium smelters will coincide with significant additions to bauxite
and alumina capacity planned for this year and next.
In a report to a meeting of bauxite producers and consumers in Geneva this
week, Unctad says the informal agreement on production cutbacks reached in
Brussels in January could lead to last year's record aluminium stocks of
4.5m tonnes being reduced by 1.15m tonnes this year and another 2m tonnes in
1995.
The Brussels agreement envisages output reductions of up to 2m tonnes a year
compared with late 1992. Cutbacks so far amount to 1.2m tonnes, including
300,000 tonnes by Russian producers. Surging exports from the former Soviet
Union have been chiefly responsible for the massive stock build-up of the
past two years.
Unctad estimates that, assuming world consumption rises by 4 per cent a year
over the next two years, stocks at the end of 1995 will be down to 1.35m
tonnes, a little more than one month's world consumption (excluding eastern
Europe). 'It appears likely that a gradual return to close to full capacity
utilisation in 1996 would be consistent with market equilibrium', the report
says.
In the long term Unctad expects aluminium consumption to continue to grow
faster than industrial output or GDP as the metal increasingly replaces
other materials, especially in packaging and vehicle manufacture. It warns
producers not to retire too much capacity on a permanent basis, so that they
are in a position to meet increased demand when the market revives.

FT  05 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Profit-taking trims base metal
gains at the LME - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Base metal succumbed to profit-taking in late trading at the London Metal
Exchange, but most still finished up on balance after impressive morning
advances.
COPPER was the exception, closing lower after running into heavy overhead
sales near the Dollars 1,980 a tonne upside target for three months metal.
Stop-loss selling stops orders below Dollars 1,970 hastened the retreat,
which left the three months price at Dollars 1,963 a tonne, down Dollars 5
from Tuesday's after-hours 'kerb' close.
'It looked a bit tired around the highs, and there have been two straight
days of gains. There could be a retracement back to Dollars 1,950, but it
still looks good for Dollars 1,980 and above,' one dealer said.
ALUMINIUM's pattern was similar, the market gradually easing back from
mid-afternoon highs after hitting strong selling above the Dollars
1,330-a-tonne level for three months delivery. It closed at Dollars 1,329,
up Dollars 1.
In contrast, ZINC largely absorbed the inevitable profit-taking, with prices
running up close to earlier three-week highs during the kerb on renewed
speculative buying. Final business for three months metal was at Dollars 970
a tonne, up Dollars 17.
At the London Commodity Exchange COCOA futures traded erratically as
technical factors dominated a market bereft of fresh fundamental news. The
July position ended Pounds 4 down at Pounds 881 a tonne, having fluctuated
between Pounds 875 and Pounds 890.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway's North Sea operating
cost forecast to reach record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Oil and gas operating expenditure in the Norwegian North Sea will this year
reach a record NKr40bn (Pounds 3.7bn) in current money, according to a
report to be published by Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based energy
consultant.
But it forecasts that weighted average operating costs will drop 8 per cent
to NKr35 a barrel of oil equivalent, well below the 1986-87 peak of NKr54.
The figures for expenditure and average cost are both net of royalty
payments.
WoodMac predicts that weighted costs in real terms will continue to decline
in the short-term, reaching a low of NKr34 a barrel in 1995, but then slowly
increase to about NKr39 by the turn of the century. 'From the mid- to
late-1990s, rising costs of production from mature fields will not be
compensated by relatively low cost production from new developments,' it
warns.
Norway's operating costs are higher than in other sectors of the North Sea
following the addition in 1991 of a carbon tax to oil companies' costs
burden. This year the carbon tax is expected to account for about 5 per cent
of total operating expenditure, which is expected to increase by 19 per cent
to NKr48bn a year by 1997.
Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest publicly quoted company, this year will
replace Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, as the operator with the
lowest cost production. Statoil faces a rising operating cost profile as
current production is dominated by mature fields while Norsk Hydro and Saga
Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company, have relatively stable
and low operating cost profiles over the medium term.
BP Norway faces the largest increase, with weighted operating costs seen
rising from NKr43 a barrel in 1994 to NKr73 in 1999 because of the maturity
of the Ula and Gyda fields and a high level of oil transport tariffs.
Operating costs are expected to fall for Elf Petroleum Norge and Phillips
Petroleum Norway.
WoodMac foresees the increasing proportion of gas in Norway's production
raising unit operating costs, because gas costs are inflated by high
transport tariffs.

President Bill Clinton this week ended a two-year-old game of musical chairs
at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission by saying he intends to nominate
Ms Mary Schapiro as Chair and Commissioner. The agency has primary oversight
over derivatives trading in the US.
Ms Schapiro's candidacy, which had been expected, was supported by the
futures industry, which believes her broad experience with the CFTC and with
the Securities and Exchange Commission will benefit the inter-agency
co-operation now critical for derivatives regulation.
The CFTC has been without a permanent chairperson since Mr Clinton took
office, and during that period has had three acting Chairs.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries overcome early unease over
interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US bond market regained its poise yesterday afternoon after suffering
earlier from jitters over currency rates and monetary policy.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/32 lower
at 86 13/16 , with the yield rising to 7.346 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was off  1/32 at 99 5/16 , to yield 5.855 per cent.
Earlier, prices were higher as the Federal Reserve and several European
central banks made a co-ordinated effort to support the dollar in the
foreign exchange markets. Traders were encouraged because a stronger dollar
would make US-denominated securities more attractive to overseas investors.
However, doubts soon emerged over the sustainability of the strategy. The
market slumped when traders failed to follow through on the early buying.
The Fed's new activist stance also gave rise to speculation over monetary
policy. Traders considered the possibility that the central bank might raise
the Fed Funds and discount rates by 50 basis points each as a way of shoring
up the dollar's value.
Adding insult to injury, the Commerce Department said that March factory
orders jumped 1.1 per cent, while February orders were revised upwards to a
0.3 per cent decline, against an initial estimate of 1.0 per cent down.
Economists were expecting a 0.5 per cent upturn in March.
But bonds recovered their losses in the final hours, helped by news that
April car sales were weaker than expected.
The Bundesbank lowered its repo rate by six basis points to 5.41 per cent at
yesterday's closely-watched repo operation, continuing its recent trend of
weekly cuts. The cut was within the expected range and the German central
bank accepted bids for DM77bn of the 14-day funds, draining DM2.2bn from the
market.
Comments from Bundesbank council members yesterday morning attracted
dealers' attention. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said he
expected the west German inflation rate to fall below 3 per cent in the near
future and added that the Bundesbank would use all possible scope to cut
interest rates, as long as this did not clash with the bank's aim of
maintaining price stability.
However, Mr Hans-Juergen Koebnick, Bundesbank council member, said he
believed that the pace of German interest rate cuts had been too slow and
that the discount rate (now at 5 per cent) should fall soon.
Meanwhile, the latest economic data to be released indicated that the
Germany economy is seeing an export-led recovery: west German manufacturing
orders showed a better-than-expected monthly rise of 2.9 per cent in March,
giving an annual increase of 9.3 per cent.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 94.82 and reached a high of 94.88
but declined in the late morning and afternoon to a low of 94.07. The
contract settled at 94.26.
The French government bond market followed the bund market lower, apart from
the very short end where the June Pibor contract ended higher.
Germany's repo cut raised hopes that the Bank of France may cut its
intervention rate by another 10 basis points today, from its current level
of 5.7 per cent. 'There's no reason why France shouldn't cut, as the franc
is holding up reasonably well,' commented Ms Marie Owens Thomsen,
international strategist at Midland Global Markets.
However, dealers said the market was focusing on today's FFr19bn to FFr21bn
OAT tender and the US employment data, due to be released on Friday.
Spanish government bonds witnessed another rocky day as the continuing saga
of the country's political scandals hit the market and foreign investors
continued to sell.
In addition, the market was hit by rumours that one of the international
credit rating agencies was considering lowering Spain's debt rating. The
Meff futures contract opened at 96.15 and dropped to a low of 94.60, but
traded at 94.84 by late afternoon.
UK gilts took their cue mainly from the US, although dealers said the gilt
market continued to dwell on Tuesday's M0 figures and the reduced chances of
a base rate cut.
The Liffe long gilt future fell from its opening of 104.20 to a low of
103.11 and settled at 103.22.

FT  05 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Italian Dollars 500m FRN fails to spur
activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Eurobond market came back to life with a handful of dollar issues and
two Dutch guilder deals. However, with continuing volatility in the
underlying bond markets, investor activity remained thin, traders said.
The day's largest deal was a Dollars 500m issue of five-year floating rate
notes for a unit of Italy's IMI Bank via joint leads Lehman Brothers and
Swiss Bank Corporation. The bonds, which pay a coupon of three-month Libor
plus 25 basis points, were priced to give a discounted margin of 30 basis
points over Libor at the re-offer price. While many dealers deemed the
pricing to be fair, they felt the deal's size could make it slow to place.
However, according to one of the lead managers, its size will help make the
issue a new benchmark for the Italian banking sector.
Swedish Export Credit also tapped demand for short-dated debt, issuing
Dollars 250m of two-year notes via SBC. While some traders felt the issue
was tightly priced - yielding 15 basis points over the US two-year note at
re-offer - they said this was compensated by the 6 per cent coupon, which
was especially likely to attract Swiss and Benelux investors.
CS First Boston launched Dollars 175m in a self-led issue of seven-year
floored floating-rate notes. They pay a coupon of six-month Libor less 25
basis points, with a floor at 5 7/8 per cent. According to an official at
the lead manager, the paper saw strong demand from Swiss retail investors.
General Electric added to the recent flow of medium-dated, retail-targeted
deals in the Canadian dollar sector with its CDollars 100m of 8 1/8 per cent
five-year bonds via Wood Gundy. Yielding 22 basis points over the
corresponding government bond at re-offer, the deal was considered fairly
priced and was expected to be placed among continental European retail
investors.
In the Dutch guilder sector, the Republic of Finland's Fl 400m of 6 1/2 per
cent seven-year bonds received a mixed reception, with some dealers
complaining about the deal's aggressive pricing. The bonds were priced to
yield 25 basis points over the interpolated Dutch government bond yield
curve, and some said they felt an extra 5 to 10 basis points would have been
more appropriate.
However, while conceding that the spread was 'not generous' and that the
deal could take time to place, lead manager ING Bank said there was good
investor demand for eight-year paper, and was confident the paper would be
placed.
Aegon, the Dutch insurance company, issued Fl 150m of three-year bonds via
ABN Amro Bank.

FT  05 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Investors focus on risks
involved in Chinese paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The poor performance of China's debut offering in the global bond market in
early February could pose a stumbling block to future issues by government
entities and companies in both the mainland and Hong Kong.
According to traders, a glut of paper is still overhanging the market, three
months after Merrill Lynch, in association with other securities houses and
banks, marketed the USDollars 1bn global bond issue - the Chinese
government's first entry in its own right to the US market since the
communist revolution.
The 10-year bond, on the heels of a Dollars 300m dragon bond issued at a
yield spread of 88 basis points over US Treasuries, was launched at an 85
basis point spread over US Treasuries. It subsequently widened to as much as
160 basis points, according to some dealers.
Traders believe that greater political and economic risk in China has
crystallised in the minds of investors in recent months on the back of
economic and monetary statistics.
Turbulence in bond markets across the world, uncertainty over China's trade
relations with the US, and its own economy have all been proffered as
reasons for the ballooning spreads - the argument being that lower rated
debt takes the worst hammering when the global interest rate environment
turns unfavourable.
However, dealers claim Merrill Lynch was forced to buy back more than half
the issue and proceeded to widen the spreads. Traders, recognising the bond
was under pressure, sold more paper into Merrill's support bid.
Spreads on the smaller dragon bond issue also widened as traders sold to
take advantage of arbitrage opportunities.
The dragon bond, lead managed by Lehman Brothers, has kept to within 10 to
15 basis points of the global bond.
Mr Chris Nicholas, head of trading at Lehman Brothers, says the dragon bond
reaps a 'home advantage' - being placed with Asian bodies, from central
banks to retail investors, who have a greater interest in supporting China
issues.
He said: 'I believe there are a lot of plans for China as a country to
continue to raise debt, and also the government related agencies. Our
experience in terms of the spread widening over the last two months means
the pricing these institutions will be able to achieve has shifted quite
dramatically from what they could have achieved six months ago.
'It affects Hong Kong institutions in exactly the same way, particularly
those institutions which have a very obvious tie with mainland China.'
Other traders point out that Hong Kong companies, which will effectively be
Chinese companies by the time the debt matures post-1997, are automatically
tarred with the same brush and will face higher funding costs. They believe
new issues will come on stream priced at something around 100 basis points
over US Treasuries.
However, investment banks' desires to secure mandates from China may serve
to produce issues which offer less attractive terms to the end investor.

FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: PetroCan posts best first term
since sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PetroCanada has posted its best first quarter since partial privatisation in
1991. Earnings rose to CDollars 73m (USDollars 52.9m), or 30 cents a share,
against CDollars 40m, or 16 cents. The figure were struck on revenues of
CDollars 1.1bn compared with CDollars 1.17bn.
PetroCan is one of Canada's largest integrated oil companies.
Mr James Stanford, president, said the strong performance may help to
persuade the federal government to sell off its remaining 70 per cent
interest in PetroCan.
The group wants to develop the east coast offshore Terra Nova oilfield. The
field, near the Hibernia project, about 200 miles east of St John's,
Newfoundland, has an estimated CDollars 2bn initial development cost.
Reserves total about 400m barrels of light oil.
Mr Stanford said PetroCan wanted to reduce its 49 per cent interest in Terra
Nova to 30 per cent, by bringing in more international partners.
He said although PetroCan could absorb its 25 per cent share of a CDollars
1bn cost over-run expected at Hibernia, hopes of reducing its interest were
now dim.
PetroCan's Hibernia partners are Mobil, Chevron, Murphy and the federal and
Newfoundland governments. Norwegian Contractors, a Norwegian consulting
group, has assumed supervision of construction of the massive concrete
gravity base in Newfoundland.
Hibernia will now start up in 1998 with an initial capital cost of CDollars
6.2bn.
Mr Stanford, speaking after PetroCan's annual meeting in Calgary, said
Hibernia's long-term economics, based on output of 125,000 barrels daily,
remained 'attractive' despite low international oil prices.

FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Mellon Bank clears funds deal
obstacle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mellon Bank yesterday received regulatory approval for its acquisition of
funds group Dreyfus. This removes one important obstacle to the first big
takeover by a bank of a mutual fund company in the US.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates
federally-chartered banks, approved the deal after an unusual public
consultation period, begun in February. The OCC's review had been undertaken
in the wake of Congressional concern about the possible conflicts that could
arise from allowing a bank to acquire a funds business.
The OCC said the deal could go ahead subject to a number of conditions.
These include Mellon's compliance with its own policy statement on mutual
funds which, among other things, establishes procedures to ensure that
customers understand that mutual funds are not covered by Federal deposit
insurance.
Also, the mutual funds will not be able to bear the Mellon name, and the
Dreyfus management team and fund managers will have to remain separate from
the management of the bank.

FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Nynex, Viacom in entertainment
joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nynex, the regional telephone company serving the north-eastern US, and
entertainment group Viacom yesterday announced plans jointly to develop
entertainment services in the US and the UK.
This is the first significant entertainment deal between the two to emerge
from Nynex's Dollars 1.2bn investment in Viacom last autumn. That link-up
helped Viacom win the Dollars 10bn takeover battle for Paramount
Communications, the film and publishing group.
The two companies said they would explore the development of video on demand
 -which gives consumers the ability to summon film entertainment when they
want it - in the north-eastern US. The project would draw on Viacom's and
Paramount's film and television programming libraries.
They would also work to create inter-active versions of Viacom's cable TV
networks, including the MTV music video channel and Nickelodeon, the
children's television channel. They will also look into inter-active
multi-player games which could be delivered over the Nynex network.
In the UK, where Nynex is one of the leading cable television providers, the
two will start by commissioning a study on the potential for services such
as video-on-demand, a new film channel, new basic cable channels, special
event telecasts, and trials of interactive services.
Nynex has been criticised on Wall Street for its investment in Viacom, which
some analysts regarded as a costly way of getting into the entertainment
business, and one which failed to give the company any critical mass.
Meanwhile, Blockbuster Entertainment, the video rental group which agreed to
merge with Viacom during the Paramount bid, has not put the deal on the
agenda for its May 24 annual meeting.
The merger requires shareholder approval, and Blockbuster's inaction
increased Wall Street expectations that the deal would not go through.
Blockbuster agreed in January to pay Dollars 55 a share for Viacom B
non-voting stock, but the market price of the shares has since fallen
sharply.
Viacom had been relying on the Blockbuster deal to bolster its cashflow
following the Paramount takeover.

FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Volvo to expand US heavy truck
operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo, the Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, is to invest Dollars
200m over the next five years to modernise and expand its US heavy truck
operations.
The company, the world's second largest producer of heavy trucks (16 tonnes
gross vehicle weight and above) behind Mercedes-Benz of Germany, is to build
a new cab assembly plant and a high-volume paint shop close to its existing
truck assembly plant in Dublin, Virginia.
Construction is to begin next month, and the plants are expected to begin
operation in 1997.
Volvo's US heavy truck operation, Volvo GM Heavy Truck, is 87 per cent-owned
by the Swedish group and 13 per cent by General Motors of the US.
Production capacity at the Dublin truck assembly plant is also to be
increased by 20 per cent by the end of 1995, to 72 trucks a day from the
present capacity of 60 a day.
The Dublin facility is being developed as Volvo GM Heavy Truck's high-volume
production operation in the US.
The cab assembly plant will have an initial capacity of 70 cabs a day, but
this will be increased to 110. The Dublin facility will also supply cabs to
Volvo GM's other truck assembly plant in Orrville, Ohio.
Volvo Truck's investment in the US production facilities is part of the
ambitious modernisation of its heavy truck range, which began last year with
the launch of its FH series of heavy trucks in Europe.

Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, yesterday announced sharp

attempt to defend them against competition from other brands and own-label
goods.
The reductions are the latest in a series of price-cutting moves by Procter

lower-priced competition, particularly in the US.
The products affected are Metamucil, the best-selling fibre laxative in the
US, and Scope, the best-selling mouthwash in the US after Warner &amp; Lambert's
Listerine.
Metamucil's price will fall by an average of 20 per cent and Scope's by an

FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Equitable result fails to
impress Wall St

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The share price of The Equitable, the US insurer which is 49 per cent owned
by French group Axa, slid further yesterday, despite first-quarter results
showing continued progress in its life insurance activities.
The results also showed the group's investment businesses had held profits
in the face of volatile financial markets.
A darling of the stock market from its flotation in mid-1992, Equitable's
shares have gone out of favour since the US interest rate rise on February
4. In New York, they fell a further Dollars  3/4 yesterday to close at
Dollars 20. The slide reflects general concern among investors about what
are perceived to be interest-rate sensitive stocks.
First-quarter figures were broadly in line with market expectations. Net
earnings were Dollars 82.1m, or 39 cents a share, up from Dollars 31.8m, or
16 cents, a year before.
Post-tax profits in the life insurance operations, before investment gains,
rose to Dollars 44.7m, from Dollars 4.2m the year before.
Two factors were behind the rise: a reduction in the losses from disability
insurance, from Dollars 31.6m a year before to Dollars 5.8m, and higher
investment spreads.
Investment gains in the insurance business were Dollars 6.2m, compared with
Dollars 2.9m the year before.
Mr Joseph Melone, chairman of the group's US insurance arm, said the
company's emphasis on variable life and variable annuity products had
brought strong growth in the period.
He said that new variable and interest rate sensitive premiums were 42 per
cent up on the previous year, while total individual annuity premiums were
30 per cent higher.
Investment operations returned post-tax profits of Dollars 47.8m, against
Dollars 50.3m the year before (before restructuring charges of Dollars
3.9m).
Mr Richard Jenrette, Equitable chairman, warned that recent market
volatility 'has introduced a degree of uncertainty . . . on a short-term
basis'.
However, he added: 'We are confident that our investment businesses are
strongly positioned for long-term growth.'

disappoint

<TEXT>
Canadian Pacific, the rail, shipping, energy and industrial holding group,
has reported net profit of CDollars 17.2m (USDollars 12.5m), or 5 cents a
share, for the first quarter, down from CDollars 21.7m, or 7 cents, a year
earlier.
Revenues were CDollars 1.6bn against CDollars 1.47bn, with the decline due
mainly to disposals.
The 1994 results were lower than most analysts had expected. Contributions
from many subsidiaries, including the rail system, were adversely affected
by severe winter weather in January and February.
Also, the first-quarter results were struck after special items.
Canadian Pacific is now focused on rail, shipping and oil and gas, plus its
investments in hotels, property, telecommunications and in Laidlaw, the
waste management group.
Operating income was CDollars 224m, up CDollars 71m from a year earlier.
Mr William Stinson, president, told the annual meeting in Calgary that CP
Rail recovered momentum in March, and that its operating income was CDollars
77.5m against CDollars 44.7m.
CP Ships, PanCanadian Petroleum and Fording Coal all turned in solid
performances. PanCanadian and Fording face lower world prices for the rest
of 1994, but have the capacity to do well despite this. Telecommunications
would continue to build market share, but profits will be elusive.
Mr Stinson said the biggest challenge was to continue reducing costs at CP
Rail. 'Its results must be brought in line with those of the best US
railroads, with whom it competes,' he said.
'This is possible, given traffic growth potential, productivity gains and
improved market share.' CP Rail and Canadian National Railways have been
discussing rationalisation of their eastern networks.

<TEXT>
A group of Austrian entrepreneurs and companies may take a stake in
Creditanstalt Bankverein, Austria's second biggest bank, in an effort to
thwart a possible foreign bid.
A bank official said yesterday moves were under way to put together an
Austrian-led consortium for a minority stake in the bank. The consortium
could include EA-Generali, the insurance company which is majority-owned by
Italy's Assicurazione Generali.
The government wants to sell part of its 70.5 per cent voting stake in the
bank this year. CS Holding, the Swiss financial group that owns Credit
Suisse, recently declared an interest in buying into Creditanstalt.
The bank yesterday reported a steep rise in earnings for 1993, and is
lifting its dividend to 10 per cent from 6 per cent. Operating results
reached a record, Sch5.4bn (Dollars 465m) compared with Sch3.4bn in 1992.
'Income from securities trading, money market and foreign exchange dealings,
precious metals activities, and trading in claims on rescheduling countries
rose 113 per cent to just under Sch2.6bn,' the bank said.
The bank 'made good use of favourable conditions in the bond, stock and
interest-rate related markets', it said.
Provisions against bad debt rose by Sch3.8bn, of which Sch2.9bn was set
aside for domestic credit risks to cover a record number of bankruptcies.
Provisions are expected to be considerably lower this year.
Profits after tax rose 17.6 per cent to Sch1.46bn. The results for the whole

First National Bank, South Africa's third-biggest banking group, announced a
better than expected 18.7 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to R500.5m
(Dollars 141m) for the six months to March 1994, compared with R421.5m a
year ago.
Total assets rose by R10.4bn to R58.5bn, spurred by a 22.3 per cent increase
in deposits and current accounts and an 18.8 per cent increase in advances.
Net interest income rose by 14.8 per cent to R1.24bn from R1.08bn, while bad
debt charges dropped to R184.1m from R184.8m a year ago.
A sharp boost in other operating income, to R964.8m from R755.4m a year ago,
was due to the inclusion of insurance group First Bowring and Associates in
group results for the first time. Other operating expenditure also rose
sharply as a result of the acquisition, increasing to R1.52bn from R1.22bn.
The dividend has been raised 8 cents to 63 cents despite a 1.2 per cent
increase in the weighted number of shares. The bank has also announced its
intention to pursue a five-for-one share split.

Suez, the French holding company, is soon expected to announce the new owner
of Victoire, its insurance subsidiary which has been for sale since late
last year.
Victoire, one of France's five largest insurers, is valued at around FFr15bn
(Dollars 2.6bn). It was put on the market after Suez's deal last autumn with
the Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) insurance group.
The sale represents a rare opportunity for a foreign company to establish a
significant presence in the French insurance industry.
Several foreign companies are understood to have shown interest in Victoire,
including Italy's Generali, AIG of the US and Commercial Union of the UK.
BAT, another UK group, is believed to have considered making an offer but
issued a statement saying it had decided not to do so.
Suez is thought to have received four bids for Victoire by the end of last
week, the official deadline for the close of offers.
The French government will today announce details of the level of public
subscription for the sale of its 50 per cent stake in UAP, the insurer.

Burns Philp, the Australian industrial group which has been restructuring to
focus on the food and fermentation sector, announced yesterday it was
selling its BBC Hardware retail business to Howard Smith for ADollars 244m
(USDollars 173.7m).
Howard Smith, a diversified industrial group based in Sydney, will also take
on BBC Hardwares' ADollars 216m debt, bringing the total consideration to
around ADollars 460m.
Howard Smith said it saw 'substantial synergy' with its existing J.
Blackwood &amp; Son industrial supplies division. The BBC Hardware business is
reckoned to be the sixth largest retailing operation in Australia with
around 156 outlets, and a further 42 outlets in the North Island of New
Zealand.
Sales in the year to June 1993 were almost ADollars 870m, while earnings
before interest and tax were ADollars 33.6m.
Blackwood supplies engineering, industrial and electrical goods from 79
branches in Australia and New Zealand.
Burns Philp signalled its intention to float or sell the hardware division
last summer. It said it would realise a ADollars 142m profit on the sale
announced yesterday.

<TEXT>
Mr George Trumbull from the US insurer Cigna has been named managing
director of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, Australia's largest
life insurance group and one of the country's biggest institutional
investors.
Mr Trumbull, 49, was president of the individual financial services division
of Philadelphia-based Cigna.
He will join the AMP - which also owns the Pearl and London Life insurance
companies in the UK - in June.
Mr Trumbull will take over as managing director and chief executive when Mr
Ian Salmon, the current AMP chief executive, retires in September. The AMP
declined to comment on the salary package being offered to Mr Trumbull.
The appointment of a US executive to one of Australia's largest institutions
marks a growing trend.
Westpac, the large commercial bank which suffered badly from the property
market's collapse in the early-1990s, appointed Mr Robert Joss, a former
vice-chairman of Wells Fargo, as managing director in January 1993.
Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications group, recently brought in Mr
Frank Blount from AT&amp;T as its new chief executive.
Mr Trumbull has held management positions with Cigna for the past 24 years,
and has previously been the group's chief investment officer.
Six months ago, Cigna took a Dollars 244m after-tax charge to cover
asbestosis and environmental claims and a further Dollars 107m charge to
cover 1,400 redundancies in its health and property/casualty businesses.
Further job losses are expected.
The AMP has been losing some ground to aggressive competitors in its home
market, and Mr Salmon has suggested that growth will have to come from
building a presence in Asia.

North American car plants took more of Algoma's flat rolled products, and

FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Forestry groups find way out of
the woods - Recovery is under way in Nordic paper and pulp sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A long-awaited recovery is taking hold in the Nordic pulp and paper
industry, as first-quarter figures from Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and
paper group, clearly show.
The company reported a SKr1.07bn (Dollars 140.6m) profit after financial
items, compared with a SKr78m loss a year ago. Even after stripping out
one-off items, the group swung to a SKr430m profit from a SKr93m deficit.
The revival is fuelled by rising prices, although the development is so
recent it will only begin to affect Stora from the second quarter.
In the first quarter the improved outlook was reflected in increased orders
and higher deliveries rather than prices. The group also benefited from the
strong dollar, cost-cutting and lower interest rates.
However the market has turned dramatically. Pulp prices, which languished at
Dollars 380 a tonne last November, are targetted to reach Dollars 560 a
tonne in June - a rise of nearly 50 per cent. This has had a direct impact
on fine paper grades, where prices have risen by 20 per cent, and it is
slowly feeding through to other grades.
Mr Lars-Ake Helgesson, Stora president, said one factor in the revival was a
faster-than-expected recovery in European markets. 'The market in Germany
has stabilised and a slight upturn was noted during the spring,' he said.
With Europe swallowing more than 70 per cent of the Nordic region's pulp and
paper, improved demand there will be the quickest way for Nordic companies
to boost output and ultimately lift prices.
This will enable them to build on the momentum which saw a return to
profitability in 1993, after two loss-making years - a turnround achieved
after a three-year cost-cutting drive. Another big factor was the weakness
of the Swedish and Finnish currencies, which sharply improved Nordic
competitiveness.
The recovery is still not fully entrenched, however. Prices for some paper
grades, such as newsprint and coated magazine papers, have risen by no more
than 5 per cent. In the case of uncoated magazine paper, there has been no
price increase at all.
There are also worries that the pulp price has risen too far, too fast. The
surge has been driven by several short-term factors, including disruptions
in hard wood supplies from Russia, stock rebuilding, and fears of strikes in
British Columbia. Many analysts, fearing that overcapacity is still endemic
in the industry, believe there could be a correction in prices later in the
year.
Even more worrying for Swedish and Finnish producers is their strengthening
currencies and the weakening dollar. For some grades, such as uncoated
magazine paper, receipts in local currency terms are lower this year than
last.
'The strengthening of the Finnish markka, which started at the end of 1993,
combined with rising production costs will show in 1994 as poorer results
than for (1993),' Mr Olli Parola, chief executive of United Paper Mills,
warned. He said 'internal arrangements' and a 'clear improvement' in prices
would be needed if the group was to match last year's FM1.25bn (Dollars
234m) profit.
UPM is the world's biggest producer of uncoated magazine paper and the fifth
biggest in newsprint, an unfavourable bias in current conditions.
By contrast, fellow Finnish producer Kymmene, which last year suffered a
FM256m deficit, is well positioned for a strong return to the black this
year. Last year's handicaps - a big exposure to fine paper and a high degree
of production in 'hard currency' countries such as France and Germany - have
turned into this year's advantage.
A key question for Nordic forestry groups will be whether they can hold
costs down. Warning bells have already sounded as producers in Finland and
Sweden have recently conceded increases in wood prices, although they stress
that this was a natural re-adjustment after a drop in prices of up to 35 per
cent in the last three years.
In the past, devaluation benefits have been squandered by explosive costs
growth, particularly in wages. However, Mr Timo Poranen, chief executive of
Metsa-Serla, says Finland will be cost competitive for a long time.
Like most of its competitors, Metsa-Serla expects a better result this year,
but it notes that much of the impact will come from lower financial outlays
following a big reduction in debt. Other groups will see the same effect,
due to improved cash flow, low investment levels, and capital-raising
exercises. Companies will also benefit from lower interest rates and reduced
foreign exchange losses.

FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: LDDS Communications makes
Dollars 2bn bid for WilTel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LDDS Communications, an acquisitive US telecommunications group, has made an
unsolicited Dollars 2bn offer to buy WilTel, which runs the nation's
fourth-largest long distance network and is a subsidiary of Williams
Companies, the Oklahoma-based pipeline group.
Williams, which revealed the approach yesterday, said it was considering
alternative strategies for WilTel, including continued ownership, the LDDS
offer, alliances with other partners and a spin-off of the business.
The LDDS offer forms part of a gradual consolidation of the US
telecommunications industry as it undergoes radical change, due to the
blurring of boundaries between long-distance and local carriers and between
the sector and the cable television and computer industries.
LDDS, based in Jackson, Mississippi, is a long-distance reseller, buying
access to long-distance lines in bulk and reselling at a profit. With
revenues of Dollars 1.14bn last year, it has the fourth-largest
long-distance customer base in the US and specialises in serving small to
medium businesses, mainly in the south-east, south-west and mid-west.
It is the second-largest customer of WilTel and is negotiating a new,
long-term contract for services.
WilTel, which specialises in the business market, operates an advanced
national fibre optic network and had an operating profit last year of
Dollars 89.7m on revenues of Dollars 958.1m. Its Tulsa-based parent is
primarily the owner of a natural gas pipeline system.
Analysts said LDDS's offer showed it wanted to move from being a reseller to
the ranks of the leading US national carriers.
They estimated a merger would give the combined business over 4 per cent of
the Dollars 65bn long-distance market.
That compares with the 10 per cent held by third-ranked Sprint, about 20 per
cent for MCI Communications and 60 per cent for AT&amp;T.
Williams said LDDS had offered to buy WilTel for Dollars 2bn in cash and/or
stock, less the pay-off of WilTel's debt.
Mr Keith Bailey, president of Williams, said the company was pleased with
the recent performance and outlook for WilTel, and was comfortable
continuing to own, operate and invest in the fast-growing business.
However, it would look at the LDDS offer along with other alternatives.
Williams's shares rose sharply to close at Dollars 29, up Dollars 3 1/2 on
the New York Stock Exchange, while LDDS shares ended Dollars  1/4 higher at
Dollars 23 3/4 on the Nasdaq exchange.

<TEXT>
Saab Automobile expects to make its first profit for six years in 1994 after
cutting losses sharply in the first quarter.
The company, which is jointly owned by Saab-Scania and General Motors of the
US, yesterday said it made a net loss of SKr74m (Dollars 9.3m) for the
period, down 55 per cent on last year's SKr166m deficit.
The improvement has been driven by improving markets, cost-cutting, and the
success of the company's new Saab 900 model. However, debt-servicing costs
are one of the factors keeping the company in the red.
Saab sold 21,800 cars during the quarter, up 24 per cent on the same period
in 1993 when 17,600 cars were sold. This year's figure included 11,900 new
Saab 900 cars, although it is still only available in a five-door version.
The new 900 together with rising demand in the company's main Swedish, US
and UK markets has helped the group to reverse a falling sales trend. It has
recently upgraded its sales target for 1994 to more than 90,000 cars,
compared with sales of 73,600 last year. Break-even is estimated at 83,000
cars.
In spite of the improved sales trend, revenues for the quarter were static
at SKr3.99bn.
The company said this reflected the change in model and specification mix
since last year.
The group is expecting to make strong headway during the rest of the year
when the 900 coupe model is introduced in the Asian Pacific and Australian
markets and the cabriolet version is launched worldwide. However, it
declined to say if it would return to profit in the second quarter.
The company has swallowed more than SKr8bn in new capital from its owners
and accumulated losses of more than SKr11bn since General Motors bought into
the group in 1989. Last year losses were halved to SKr1.37bn.

Interbrew, the Belgian brewer that produces Stella Artois, is to buy 23.78
per cent of Zagrebacka Pivovara, Croatia's biggest brewery.
The Zagreb-based operation stands to benefit from Interbrew's plans for
significant technical and commercial investments.
According to the Belgian company, these will amount to the biggest foreign
investment in Croatia.
Zagrebacka-Pivovara, a low fermentation brewery which produces six different
types of beer, holds 28 per cent of the Croatian market.
The Interbrew offer, which valued the brewery at about DM82m (Dollars
48.2m), beat four rival bidders including Brau of Austria, and Castel of
France.
Mr Hans Meerloo, president of the Belgian group's executive committee, said
that the move was in line with the company's strategy to develop in eastern
and central Europe.
The shares sold to Interbrew are owned by the Croatian Privatisation Fund
and two Croatian pension funds.
The brewery was privatised in April last year and most of the shares are
owned by its employees.

Bayer, the German chemicals group, is considering acquiring the
over-the-counter medicines business of Sterling Winthrop, the healthcare
products division of the Eastman Kodak group, Reuter reports from
Leverkusen.
'Bayer . . . will examine the possibilities of acquiring the self-medication
business of Sterling Winthrop,' Bayer said. On Tuesday, Kodak announced
plans to sell its pharmaceutical business, including Sterling Winthrop.
Mr Manfred Schneider, Bayer chairman, has stressed that expansion of
self-medication activities, especially in the US, was one of Bayer's
corporate aims.
Sterling Winthrop has the rights to the Bayer name and its cross symbol in
the US and Canada. Bayer trades in North America under the name of Miles,
its US subsidiary.
Sterling obtained the rights to the Bayer cross and many other trademarks in
1918. Bayer bought back the rights worldwide with the exception of the US
and Canada in 1970.
Elf Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals group, has also expressed interest in
Sterling, saying Kodak's decision to sell presented an opportunity to merge
Sanofi and Sterling.

FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Strong improvement at Seita
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seita, the French tobacco group which is on the government's privatisation
list, yesterday announced net profits for last year of FFr585m (Dollars
99.1m), a sharp improvement over the FFr447m recorded in 1992.
The group, which has a monopoly on the manufacture of cigarettes in France
and produces Gauloises and Gitanes cigarettes, said the result was achieved
in spite of increased sales competition. It forecast continued improvement
for the current year.
Sales last year rose by 2 per cent to FFr14.14bn, with FFr796m coming from
exports. According to Seita, its financial position remains strong, with net
cash of about FFr3bn and cash-flow last year of FFr794m, compared with
FFr567m in 1992.
The French government has not indicated the timing of Seita's privatisation,
but it is considered unlikely to take place this year. Seita said yesterday
that it was prepared for a sale but the timing would depend on the
government's budgetary requirements and the condition of the stock market.
The likely valuation is between FFr7bn and FFr9bn.
The prospect of privatisation has already drawn interest from international
tobacco groups.
BAT Industries of the UK confirmed yesterday that it had had discussions
with the French group, involving a possible stake of around 10 per cent as a
means of cementing a trading partnership.

FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Groupe Bull cuts deficit to
FFr942m

<TEXT>
Groupe Bull, the French computer group which is due to be privatised,
yesterday announced a significant improvement in results for the first
quarter of the year, cutting net losses to FFr942m (Dollars 160m) from
FFr1.72bn in the same period in 1993.
The company, which has lost more than FFr15bn over the past three years,
said the improvement in results demonstrated strong progress in its recovery
strategy.
That strategy is based on three priorities; an increase in revenues, a
drastic reduction in non-salary costs, and improved productivity. It has
been put into effect by Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, chairman, who came to
the group in October.
Turnover grew by 20 per cent in the first three months, to FFr6.15bn. The
improvement partly reflected a strong sales performance at Zenith Data
Systems, the microcomputer division, which increased turnover by more than
70 per cent. Most of Bull's other operating divisions also saw sales
increases.
However, the principal reason for the decline in losses was the reduction in
non-salary costs.
Bull said these costs, which include buildings, supplies and financial
charges, were reduced by FFr453m and represented 58 per cent of the fall in
net losses.
The group said cost-cutting measures were continuing. In April, many
corporate activities were transferred from Tour Bull in the Defense business
district of Paris to a cheaper site in the suburbs. The management teams of
the Bull Europe and the Bull Overseas divisions will shortly be transferred
to the cheaper site.
Bull said orders rose sharply in the first three months. Hardware and
software commissions grew by 27 per cent, while orders for systems
integration contracts increased by 33 per cent.
The company said the improved demand partly reflected the introduction of
new products, such as the DPS 9000/800 business computer developed in
co-operation with NEC of Japan.
NEC, which holds a 4.43 per cent stake in Bull, may increase its investment
as part of the French group's privatisation. Bull is holding negotiations
with industry partners with the aim of reducing the government's holding to
a minority by the end of the year.

FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Electrolux to expand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electrolux yesterday finalised a DM730m (Dollars 429m) agreement to buy
Hausgerate, AEG's household appliance division.
The deal enhances the Swedish group's position as the world's leading
producer of household appliances, ahead of Whirlpool of the US, and
strengthens its position in the European white goods market. Total annual
sales of household appliances will exceed SKr70bn (Dollars 8.9bn).
Electrolux will take over DM400m in debt as part of the deal, which is
subject to EU regulatory approval. The purchase will lift the company's
share of the European white goods market to at least 25 per cent, and take
its German market share as high as 35 per cent.
Electrolux acquired 10 per cent of Hausgerate in 1992 for DM80m and was
offered the chance to buy the rest of the company last December as part of a
shake-up at Daimler-Benz, AEG's parent.
The terms announced yesterday for 100 per cent of the company are a little
lower than analysts expected, reflecting the impact of the German recession.
Electrolux said the acquisition would broaden its product range.

Hafslund Nycomed, the Norwegian group best known for its radiology products,
yesterday reported a decline in first-quarter pre-tax profit to NKr302m
(Dollars 40.8m) from NKr381m in the same period last year, writes Karen
Fossli in Oslo.
Hafslund blamed the setback on higher depreciation and research and
development costs and financial losses. It forecast full-year pre-tax
profits in line with last year's NKr1.57bn. Sales increased by NKr140m to
NKr1.68bn helped partly by higher trading activity by Hafslund Energi, the
group's electricity generator.

FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Nordbanken extends recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nordbanken, one of Sweden's biggest banks, yesterday announced a SKr1.15bn
(Dollars 146m) operating profit for the first quarter, consolidating a
recovery from the crisis which saw it collapse into state hands in 1992.
The result includes a tripling of the bank's own profit to SKr909m from
SKr304m, and a first-time contribution from Gota Bank, another state-owned
bank which Nordbanken acquired at the start of the year.
The government aims to privatise Nordbanken next year to recoup some of the
SKr80bn worth of support which it provided to both Nordbanken and Gota Bank
during Sweden's financial sector crisis. Most of the bad loans in both
groups were hived off into Securum and Retriva, separate 'bad banks', which
has facilitated the strong recovery in their performance.
A reduction in credit losses to SKr567m from SKr1.35bn was the main reason
for the bank's improved performance during the quarter. It also benefited
from higher net interest income, due to the lower cost of financing problem
loans. This helped to compensate for a 3 per cent fall in lending and lower
margins.
Problem loans totalled SKr7.6bn at the end of the quarter, down 2 per cent
from the year-end. The bank expects full-year profits to be higher than last
year's SKr2.7bn.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Delaney Group, the shopfitter and joiner which returned to profit in 1993,
yesterday saw its market capitalisation grow by 17.5 per cent as the share
price rose from 14 1/4 p to 16 3/4 p following an upbeat statement by Mr
Nathu Ram Puri, chairman, to the annual meeting.
He said that sales in the first quarter were up 20 per cent on the same
period last year with more than half the improvement coming from new
products. He expressed confidence of an improved outcome for 1994.
In the next six months the Christies offshoot was opening five showrooms and
with fitted bathroom sales still improving, additional bathroom displays are
being introduced into a further eight showrooms.

FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Heron interest deferral opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Holders of Heron Internat ional's senior bonds voted against the deferral of
interest due on March 31 to June 30 at a meeting yesterday morning.
Of the votes cast, amounting to Pounds 78m of the bonds, only 38 per cent
supported the deferral. A meeting of junior bondholders was then adjourned.
At a meeting of bondholders on March 31 there were insufficient votes to
form a quorum and since then the bonds have been technically in default.
However, Heron, the property and trading group, said yesterday that Law
Debenture, the trustee of the bonds, was not intending to take any steps to
declare them due and payable. The trustee could be asked to act if 25 per
cent of bondholders requested this.
Heron's directors have been advised that the group can continue trading
while there is a reasonable prospect of its debts being refinanced.
Heron said it was in talks with possible bidders for the group, and expected
to have proposals by June 30.

<TEXT>
In the nine months ending March 31, Flogas, the Irish supplier of liquefied
petroleum gas, reported increased pre-tax profits of IPounds 7.12m (Pounds
7m).
The company has changed its year end to bring it into line with DCC, its
majority shareholder. Consequently the previous 12 month period ran to June
30 1993, when pre-tax profits amounted to IPounds 6.52m.
Sales this time were IPounds 45.9m (IPounds 48.1m). Exceptional charges of
Pounds 320,000 represented costs incurred in advising shareholders when DCC
increased its stake to 60.3 per cent.
A final dividend of 5.5p makes a total of 8.74p (7.92p), payable from
earnings of 24.5p (23.31p).

Available revenue for the year dropped to Pounds 22,000 (Pounds 165,000). A

Following the rationalisation and cost cutting of 1992, Silvermines, the
electrical services and property group, returned to profits last year with
IPounds 1.57m (Pounds 1.54m) pre-tax, against restated losses of IPounds
9.71m.
The result was helped by an exceptional gain of IPounds 648,000 on the sale
of a subsidiary. There were exceptional costs last time of IPounds 6.48m.
The Dublin-based company is proposing a final dividend of 0.5p - an interim
of 1p was declared in 1992 - payable from earnings per share of 3.09p
(30.77p losses). Turnover was IPounds 27.2m, against IPounds 36.8m including
IPounds 5.01m from discontinued activities.
Since the year end the company has acquired Molynx, the closed circuit

FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Pleasing some of the people - The retail
recovery presents its own problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tills are ringing again for Britain's high street retailers. But the
welcome additions to the companies' coffers, which will this year wipe out
the debts of several of the leading groups, have also prompted a debate in
retailing circles over how the cash should be spent.
While the stores groups are eyeing fresh investment opportunities, a growing
band of industry analysts and institutional investors are pressing for more
funds to be returned to shareholders.
Behind the concerns lie the memories of the free-spending 1980s when the
retailers went on a buying spree, gearing up their balance sheets to pay for
big investment programmes, some dubious acquisitions and questionable
business strategies.
'The record of the stores sector last time around was not a good one, and
now they have the opportunity to get the balance - of improved investment
and increased dividends - right,' said Mr Charles Nichols, stores analyst at
BZW, the investment bank.
As the cash has begun to mount, talk of special dividend payments, dividend
rises and share buy-backs has begun to circulate in the London stock market;
so too has takeover gossip.
Great Universal Stores has borne the brunt of the market speculation, mainly
because of its Pounds 1.5bn cash pile which many observers believe could be
used to mount a share buy-back operation.
Some of the sector's other big names are poised to emulate GUS's cash
position. BZW predicts that at signalled levels of investment Marks and
Spencer's current Pounds 139.5m of debt will transform into Pounds 5.5m of
cash this year and balloon to Pounds 482m by 1996.
For Boots, BZW forecasts a cash surplus of Pounds 436m that year, compared
with present debts of Pounds 209.5m. Other companies which could be included
in the list are Sears, Kingfisher, Next and Argos.
The reasons for the dramatic increase are several-fold. Many of the
companies are in dominant positions in markets that are relatively mature.
This has the double benefit of generating cash without the need for large
capital investments.
They have also emerged from the recession with a clearer retailing focus
following the excesses of the 1980s, paring down costs, divesting non-core
businesses and improving margins.
Mr Nichols, who has recently published research on cash generation by GUS,
M&amp;S and Boots, believes that the case for rewarding shareholders is
irresistible. 'Given the maturity of the core businesses, the awful history
of retail acquisitions and the inappropriateness of adding to balance sheet
liquidity, these three businesses should now look to return more cash to
shareholders.'
Investors might feel they deserve increased income from the general
retailing sector. Its dividend yield is currently 30 per cent lower than the
yield on the FT-SE-A All-Share Index. This relative yield is near a
five-year low, having fallen steadily from a modest premium to the market in
1989.
In the meantime, some of the companies concerned are content to pursue their
current investment policies. Mr David Keens, finance director at Next, said:
'Of course we will listen to our investors' opinions - but at the moment we
see no need to change what has been a successful investment and dividend
policy.
'Remember we are in a cyclical business and people have short memories.
There will be good times and bad times - we should not worry too much on how
to spend our resources.'
At Sears, Mr David Defty, finance director, said the group would continue to
use its funds for investment - including the Pounds 300m earmarked for the
next three years.
'If a new opportunity to invest comes along we'll take it. We are determined
to spend to achieve differentiation for all our products so that we become
the first choice when the consumer goes shopping.' He added that the
company's shareholders would benefit from a progressive dividend policy as
profits increased.
Both directors raised fears that any company contemplating a share buy back
would be judged poorly by investors and competitors in the long run.
'Any thoughts of a special dividend payment or share buy back would be
indicative of a moribund management team with no ideas,' said Mr Defty.

FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Record acquisitions year leaves Danka 83%
ahead at Pounds 32m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Danka Business Systems, the US-based office equipment supplier quoted in the
UK, announced an 83 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 32m, against
Pounds 17.5m, following a record year for acquisitions.
The addition of 29 companies in the last 12 months contributed some Pounds
100m of the overall Pounds 161m increase in sales to Pounds 347.2m for the
year to March 31.
Danka spent Pounds 65m in cash and issued shares worth Pounds 12.5m to fund
the acquisitions. The group wrote off about Pounds 57m in goodwill.
Sales were also boosted by a 12 per cent improvement in the dollar/sterling
exchange rate, and a full year's contribution from company purchases in
1992-93.
In an attempt to give some indication of underlying trading, Danka said
turnover in companies owned for at least two years was about 14 per cent
ahead.
Overall, the group had enjoyed the benefits of a recovering economy in the
US, where machine sales were beginning to pick up. Mr Mark Vaughan-Lee,
chairman, said the UK business was beginning to see similar signs of
recovery. Margins had been largely maintained, he said.
The maintenance and supplies division suffered a 1.3 percentage point drop
in gross margins to 47.7 per cent due to the number of acquisitions.
The final dividend is maintained at 0.75p for a total 33 per cent higher at
1.5p. Earnings per share were 11 per cent higher at 11.8p (10.6p).
The company's shares, which have risen in the last year from 50p, closed
yesterday at 335p, up 5p.
Danka has spent the last few years pursuing acquisition opportunities mainly
in the US, where the office equipment market is estimated to be worth about
Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20.5bn) a year. Last year the group took its first step
into Europe with the purchase of Saint Group in the UK.
Mr Vaughan-Lee said Danka intended to continue expanding, with at least one
acquisition expected before the end of June.
It intends to fund the acquisitions with facilities negotiated last year.
The group strengthened its balance sheet with a Dollars 150m credit line in
the US and a Pounds 58m placing in the UK. Net debt at the year end was
Dollars 21m, against Dollars 30m a year earlier.
The acquisition programme has brought substantial benefits to Mr Dan Doyle,
the company's American chief executive, who sold his rights to a
performance-related bonus to Danka for Pounds 4m over three years.
He is believed to have earned a substantial bonus this year under a new
scheme related to earnings calculated under US accounting treatments, which
rose sharply this year. Under this he is entitled to up to 50 per cent of
his base salary. Last year he is estimated to have earned a salary of about
Pounds 480,000.

FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: James Beattie dips on interest setback
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
James Beattie, the Wolver-hampton-based department store group, yesterday
reported a 4 per cent decline in annual profits as falling interest rates
led to a sharp contraction in investment income.
Sales, excluding VAT, in the 12 months to January 31 improved 6.4 per cent
to Pounds 79.4m reflecting the opening of the Aylesbury store in September
and a full year contribution from the Worcester store.
Sales growth from comparable space was just 2 per cent.
Sir Eric Pountain, chairman, said the growth was achieved without
sacrificing gross margins. 'This should be judged against a background which
has seen a continuation of trading pressures . . . with little sign of
sustained economic recovery.'
The trading climate remained 'highly competitive' Sir Eric added, with
customer confidence remaining at a low level.
Despite capital expenditure during the year of Pounds 5.4m, the group's cash
pile increased to Pounds 25m. Investment income and interest, however, fell
some 35 per cent to Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 1.89m) and left pre-tax profits at
Pounds 6.56m (Pounds 6.83m).
Earnings per share emerged at 9.3p (9.8p). A recommended final dividend of
4.7p lifts the total for the year to 6.2p (6p).

FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Provisions may follow revamp plan at Bulmer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HP Bulmer, the Hereford-based cider maker, is considering reorganisation
plans which may lead to the announcement of financial provisions later this
month.
The plans, code-named Project Orchard, include the closure of the oldest of
the company's two factories at Hereford.
Mr John Rudgard, chief executive, said it was 'impossible to be precise or
to comment' on the plans. However, he said: 'As a general principle, we're
absolutely committed to having the lowest costs in the industry. Ten years
ago we had 2,200 employees and now we have 1,200. Whether we will find
ourselves making significant further reductions, I can't say.'
Bulmer had started a Pounds 28m programme to modernise its manufacturing
plant over the next three years. This involved closing the older of its two
sites by next May. 'If there are further areas where we can get our costs
down, we will do so,' Mr Rudgard said. 'But the decision on whether or not
to make provisions hasn't yet been made.'

FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Do It All chain could be halved - Decision
on future of lossmaking DIY stores expected next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WH Smith and Boots are expected to announce early next week that they plan
to sell or close up to half the stores in their lossmaking Do It All DIY
chain, with resulting provisions totalling more than Pounds 60m.
Analysts believe the joint venture partners are preparing to announce that
they have already agreed to dispose of slightly fewer than the 70 stores -
almost a third of the chain - which had been widely mooted. However, they
plan to sell more stores, taking the eventual total to about 100, or almost
half the chain.
Boots and WH Smith refused to comment on the speculation surrounding the
disposal package, but confirmed that a statement would be made soon. Boots
announces its full-year results next month.
The total provisions, divided equally between the two groups, are expected
to be more than the Pounds 55m to Pounds 60m previously forecast -
reflecting the increased number of stores to be sold - but less than the
Pounds 80m quoted in recent press reports. They include asset and stock
write-offs, redundancy costs, and a provision to cover the cost of
converting remaining stores to a new format, called the New Trading Concept.
The partners plan to spend about Pounds 10m this year converting a further
38 Do It Alls to the format, taking the total to 82. The new concept groups
products together according to different projects, with customer displays on
how to carry out these projects.
Analysts believe the main buyers of the Do It All stores are Asda, which
will convert them into Dales discount grocery stores; PC World, the computer
superstore chain owned by Dixons; and Staples, the office superstore joint
venture between the UK's Kingfisher and Staples of the US.
Among other buyers are thought to be Courts, the furniture retailer, Aldi
and Netto, the discount food retailers, and the Focus DIY group.
WH Smith said in January that its share of losses at Do It All, after
interest, for the six months to November 27 were Pounds 8.3m. The partners
believe that if they can dispose of underperforming stores, Do It All can
return to profit relatively quickly.
But analysts suggest returns would have to be increased substantially before
the group could be sold.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Merivale Moore has sold its remaining two office buildings at Vision Park,
Cambridge, to Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme for Pounds 5.55m.
At the same time Lloyds has completed its purchase of Acorn House, the
largest single building in the business park, for Pounds 5.3m.
The aggregate income from all three buildings is Pounds 357,000 rising to
Pounds 803,000 in June 1995 when Acorn Computer ends its rent-free period.
As a result of the disposals Merivale has substantially reduced its bank
debt and gearing. Earlier in the year the company disposed of several low or
non-income producing assets to concentrate on building investment income in
its more familiar market of higher yielding industrial and retail

FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Burns set to leave NFC in September
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NFC said that Mr Robbie Burns, managing director of its UK transport and
logistics business, will leave the company in September, at the end of the
group's financial year.
Mr Burns, 45, was the driving force behind NFC's successful Exel logistics
business and was the main internal candidate last year for the post of group
chief executive.
When Mr Peter Sherlock, a former director of Bass, was awarded the top job,
the board took the risk of losing Mr Burns, who is only three years younger
than Mr Sherlock.
Mr James Watson, NFC's chairman, said yesterday: 'I am sad to be losing such
a long-standing colleague, but I fully understand the appropriateness of the
timing at this stage in Robbie's career.'
Pending appointment of a successor, Mr Sherlock will assume responsibility
for the UK transport and logistics business.
NFC also announced the further expansion of its European logistics side
through two German deals, worth Pounds 10.2m.
The group said Exel Logistics Deutschland had entered into an agreement to
market jointly national logistics services in the German temperature
controlled sector with Frigoscandia, the world's leading cold storage chain
which is owned by Aga, the Swedish industrial gas group.
NFC has bought Rickhoff, a temperature controlled distribution operation
based in northern Germany, and Rima, its operating subsidiary based in
Magdeburg, eastern Germany, for a maximum Pounds 4.4m and Pounds 1.7m of
debt.
It has also acquired the distribution business of Frigoscandia B+G
Speditions and Frigoscandia Transport for a maximum of Pounds 1.4m and
assumed Pounds 2.7m of debt.
In the UK, Exel Logistics has won a contract to manage the supply chain of
Homepride Foods' range.

FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Healthcall unaffected by government moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Healthcall, the doctors' deputising service whose flotation price will be
announced today, said it would not be hit by government moves to reduce the
out-of-hours burden on family doctors.
Mr Maurice Henchey, chief executive, said the proposed changes would not
affect present customers or put off potential new ones.
His comments followed reports that the Department of Health and the British
Medical Association were close to agreeing changes which would reduce the
pressure on GPs to make out-of-hours calls which they considered
unnecessary.
GPs are not obliged to make calls requested by patients, but in practice
find it difficult to refuse. It is thought the changes will make it clear
that in certain circumstances the doctor can suggest the patient visits the
surgery when open or go to a round-the-clock medical centre.
But Mr Henchey said such changes would not reduce the attraction of
deputising services for GPs. 'It does nothing to remove the mental pressure
of being on call.'
Any move towards open-all-hours centres should benefit the company. 'We have
led the way, having operated five such centres on a pilot scheme basis for
18 months.'
There is no suggestion that the strict obligation on deputising services to
respond to house call requests would be relaxed.
Of the 20,000 GPs who practice in urban areas, more than 15,000 have consent
to use a duty doctor service. More than 8,300 subscribe to Healthcall.
The company is expected to be valued at about Pounds 70m.

FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Placing will value JBA at Pounds 60m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JBA International, a specialist in software for International Business
Machines' AS/400 mid-range computers, is coming to the market by way of a
placing which values the company at about Pounds 60m.
JBA was formed in 1981 by Mr Alan Vickery, currently chairman, and Mr Kevin
Jones, technical director. Both had worked previously for IBM where they
realised the potential for developing business software for the US computer
manufacturer's mid-range System/34 and System/38.
The System/38 was redeveloped as the AS/400, and this week IBM will announce
a new family of AS/400 systems, which should reassure those worried about
the US manufacturer's commitment to the AS/400 line.
In 1993, turnover at JBA rose by 33 per cent to Pounds 74.5m, of which the
US contributed Pounds 27m. Profits before tax rose 31 per cent to Pounds
4.6m.
The management owns 50 per cent of the shares, a range of institutions have
30 per cent and employees also have a stake. IBM holds 5.75 per cent.
The placing is expected to raise up to Pounds 10m net of expenses, which
will be used to fund international development. The group has subsidiaries
in 11 countries, including the UK, the US, Australia, South Africa and
Mexico.

FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: European Acquisition Capital in Pounds 33m
purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Acquisition Capital, a specialist corporate equity investor,
yesterday announced the purchase of Stalwart Assurance Group in a Pounds 33m
deal.
Stalwart is a small life insurance company which sells a specialist annuity
home income plan, under which elderly homeowners receive a monthly lifetime
income in exchange for the sale of a 'reversionary' interest in their
property. Policyholders continue to live in the property for life.
EAC will invest Pounds 12.8m, including acquisition and cancellation of
Pounds 7.9m of loan notes and a working capital injection of Pounds 2.4m.
Existing and new debt facilities total Pounds 20m. Stalwart's executive team
will retain their shareholdings.
Stalwart was previously owned by a consortium of venture capitalists. EAC
said yesterday that Stalwart's growth had become constrained because of a
shortage of funds from traditional sources, falling house prices and the
knock-on effect of an adverse reaction in the market to unsuitable home
income products.
EAC has been able to obtain substantial sources of reinsurance funding for
Stalwart, which has a portfolio worth about Pounds 69m, represented by some
1,100 properties.

FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Traditional society maintained up north -
The proposed merger between Northern Rock and North of England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a different world, the members of North of England Building Society's
board might have a case to answer under the 'best advice' provisions of the
Financial Services Act.
They are apparently advising the society's 230,000 members to abandon its
independence for less than a tenth of its value.
The expected offer of up to 1 per cent of retail balances, making perhaps an
average of Pounds 50 per member, does not seem a good deal compared with the
average Pounds 650 if the society was sold for Pounds 150m. This is the
estimate of North of England's value made by UBS, the securities house.
The fact that such calculations are now made is a measure of the disruption
caused to the process of society mergers by Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn bid
for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society.
Until the proposed merger of North of England with Northern Rock was
disclosed yesterday, many advisers said Lloyds' bid could put off such
moves. 'Anyone who reads a newspaper knows that there are now alternatives
to a merger bonus,' said Mr Rupert Robson, an assistant director of
Schroders.
According to a very crude calculation, based on Lloyds' paying up to 2.1
times the net assets of C&amp;G, the value of societies can now be determined by
doubling their general reserves. This method would, for example, value
Nationwide at about Pounds 3bn.
Yet it now seems that, providing North of England members accept the board's
advice, the likely pattern of restructuring in retail financial services
will have to be recalculated yet again. The development is likely to add
more uncertainty to what is becoming an extremely jittery market.
Mr John Wriglesworth, UBS societies analyst, argues that North of England
members are likely to accept the offer.
'The inertia, apathy, lack of awareness and even idiocy among ordinary
members means that when the first fuss dies down, they are going to vote for
this,' he said.
Indeed, Mr Wriglesworth believes they should do so. North of England members
will not give up membership rights in the transfer but will instead join the
merged society. They will thus retain the right to a possibly larger bonus
should the enlarged Northern Rock convert, or be acquired.
Mr Wriglesworth is among supporters of mutual ownership who believe that
societies have a useful role. Yet he accepts it is a growing struggle to
convince everyone of this.
'If you accept that members want money, and their boards should act
accordingly, all societies should sell up.'
Some merchant bankers who advise societies think the market dynamics have
been changed by the Lloyds bid. Since they are responsible to employees,
depositors and borrowers rather than just shareholders, boards have until
now felt happy to rebuff offers from banks and others without consulting
members.
Yet these boards may now feel more exposed to the risk of such outsiders
publicising the terms of such offers if they are rejected. 'I don't think we
will see hostile bids for societies, but a lot of pressure can be put on a
society's board without open hostility,' said one adviser.
This change of attitude, combined with the renewed interest among banks,
means that some boards may be tempted to change. 'Some may feel they will
get a better deal by choosing a partner now than by waiting to see what
happens,' said Mr Charles Irby, a director of Baring Brothers.
Ailing societies which would until now have been herded by the Building
Societies Commission towards being taken over by another society may now
find it harder. At least one small society which was about to merge is
thought to have shelved the plans because of nervousness about its members'
reaction.
Yet some advisers believe that mergers will continue even if there is a
hiatus. 'Boards may think long and hard now that appetites have been
whetted, but mergers are well-established and there is still a need for the
industry to consolidate,' said Mr Richard Davey, a director of NM
Rothschild.
Furthermore, some analysts say that there is a good case for societies to be
preserved on competitive grounds. Mr Davey argues that societies can offer
better savings and mortgage rates to members because they do not have to
bear the cost of servicing equity through dividends to shareholders.
Mr Wriglesworth says that the benefit of not having to pay dividends might
in the past have been absorbed by 'management slackness'. However, societies
now face pressures, such as analysis by ratings agencies, which ensure that
they operate efficiently enough to pass on such benefits in pricing.
Yet this argument for the existence of a building societies industry to
offer competition to banks may not persuade many members that they should
reject cash offers for their own.
The reaction of the North of England shareholders will provide an indication
of how far attitudes have changed.

FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Bellway rises 73% and sees further growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Bellway rose 11p to 249p yesterday after the housebuilding group
reported a 73 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.79m to
Pounds 10m in the six months to January 31.
Turnover rose 44 per cent, from Pounds 56.1m to Pounds 80.7m, and margins
increased from 8.9 per cent to 11.4 per cent. The number of homes sold was
45 per cent higher at 1,212 (833), while the average selling price increased
from Pounds 63,000 to Pounds 65,000.
Mr Kenneth Bell, chairman, said: 'With the evidence that the market place
has improved, we are optimistic that a similar rate of growth can be
attained this year.'
Mr Bell said there were a few signs of temporary overheating in land prices,
but the group was fortunate in having a land bank extensive enough to be
able to temper its level of land purchases for a period.
Bellway, which had a Pounds 33.6m rights issue in March last year, reduced
its cash from Pounds 44.3m last July to Pounds 6.5m by January. In addition,
borrowings increased from nil to Pounds 6.7m.
Mr Bell said this substantial cash outflow was caused primarily by an
increase in land and work in progress, required to fuel expansion plans.
'On January 31 1994, the group had some 10,500 plots of land with planning
permission. Our plans are to continue to increase our land holdings which
should enable us to meet our future targets.'
The group mainly attributed the improvement in margins to more reasonable
levels of profitability in its north London and north-east of England
subsidiaries.
Mr Bell was optimistic about prospects. 'The group is now starting to
benefit from the expansion of our established divisions during recent years
and, additionally, from geographical expansion into Wessex and Yorkshire.
This year, we have also started a further division in south Wales which
should contribute to the group's results next year.'
Earnings per share rose by 59 per cent to 5.9p (3.7p). The interim dividend
goes up 10 per cent to 2.2p (2p).
COMMENT
These results were well ahead of expectations, hence the share price rise in
a falling market. Bellway was one of the first housebuilders to tap the
market last year, enabling it to build up enough of a land bank to cover up
to four years' building. But although partly protected from the current
overheating in land prices, Bellway is not immune and, like any other
housebuilder, would suffer if interest rates were to rise. The shares have
had a good run, increasing 64 per cent since the beginning of last year. On
forecast full-year profits of Pounds 24.5m. they are on a prospective
multiple of about 17, which looks reasonable.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intermediate Capital Group yesterday issued a pathfinder prospectus for a
placing and intermediaries offer that will value the provider of mezzanine
capital to unquoted companies at more than Pounds 100m.
The flotation will raise about Pounds 30m, some Pounds 18m of which will
repay existing preference holders. The size of the intermediaries offer will
depend on the level of interest from retail investors.
The four founding shareholders will retain about 80 per cent of their stakes
and hold between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of the company after the float.
ICG said yesterday that Mr Eric Kinder, chairman of Smith &amp; Nephew, will
join the board as a non-executive director.

FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Nationwide names new chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nationwide, the UK's second largest building society, yesterday appointed Mr
Brian Davis, its operations director, to succeed Mr Tim Melville-Ross as
chief executive in July.
Mr Melville-Ross is to become director-general of the Institute of Directors
from the beginning of August, after 10 years as Nationwide chief executive.
Mr Davis said that his priorities would be to improve the range of services
offered to customers in as efficient a way as possible. He would be looking
to improve further the society's cost to income ratio - which in the year
ended April 1993 fell to 48 per cent (55 per cent). Pre-tax profits fell by
8.6 per cent to Pounds 184.6m, after a sharp increase in bad debt
provisions.
But the society, which then had assets of almost Pounds 35bn, now seems
better placed after a period of strengthening its balance sheet. It is
expected soon to announce plans to end its relationship with Guardian and
set up its own life assurance operation.
Mr Davis joined Nationwide in 1986, and directed the combining of the
Nationwide and Anglia computer systems following the merger between the two
societies in 1987, and directed also the introduction of FlexAccount, the
UK's first interest-bearing current account.
The handling of the merger attracted criticism within the sector, as the
society was seen as not becoming a single, efficient organisation quickly
enough.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Unilever focuses AGM on copycats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, used yesterday's AGM to
vent its irritation at the emergence of so-called copycat brands, which
closely imitate brand name packaging, but undercut on price.
Sir Michael Perry, chairman, said: 'I have no objection to sitting at the
same table as my competitors - but I do object to them eating off my plate.'
The issue is of concern to Unilever when it faces tighter competition in the
US, combined with recession in continental Europe, and its soap war with US
rival Procter &amp; Gamble.
Sir Michael spoke of the investment Unilever has put into the development of
brand name products, and the fact that their brand identity was legally
protected throughout Europe, with the exception of the UK.
Unilever, which has been joined by other industrial groups such as Coca Cola
and even Procter, is attempting to persuade the UK government to prohibit
what it considers to be unfair competition. So far, the government has opted
not to extend trademark legislation to prevent lookalikes.
Unilever has reflected the current operating environment by unveiling a
Pounds 490m restructuring which should achieve annual cost savings of Pounds
240m.
The US has been a main focus of cuts, as Unilever has been losing the
detergent battle with Procter, but Sir Michael was anxious to emphasise
detergents were 25 per cent of US sales, and only 4 per cent of group
profits.
However, this has spilled into Europe, with the row with Procter over
Unilever's new range of concentrated washing powders.
Sir Michael said this was 'already on sale in the Netherlands, and it is
going very very well'.
Some Pounds 26m will be spent on 'supporting' Persil Power - Unilever's new
super-concentrated washing powder - in the UK this year, and Pounds 100m has
been invested in production facilities. Unilever's legal action in the
Netherlands to gag the perceived Procter campaign against the product has
thus taken on critical importance.
Yesterday was the retirement day for Mr Floris Maljers, vice-chairman, who
has also been chairman of Unilever NV since 1984. He is being replaced in
both positions by Mr Morris Tabaksblat.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Northern building societies to merge: Merger makes Northern
Rock the 10th largest society with assets of Pounds 8.8bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Rock, the UK's 11th largest building society, is to merge with a
smaller, neighbouring society, North of England, to create a combined
organisation with assets of Pounds 8.8bn.
The move takes Northern Rock - as the new organisation will be called - to a
position as the 10th largest society, overtaking Bristol &amp; West.
Lloyds Bank offered Pounds 1.8bn for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building
society last month. Northern Rock has been at pains to emphasise its merger
would bring a dual benefit to North of England members. It said they would
receive a bonus as a result of the merger - though not on the scale of the
payments offered to C&amp;G members - while remaining in a position to reap
benefits.
North of England has less than one-quarter of Northern Rock's 1.3m members,
including both both savers and borrowers. Members of both societies will be
asked to agree the merger in August, and if they approve it will take effect
in October.
Mr Chris Sharp, Northern Rock managing director, conceded that some
investors in his society might be disgruntled they will get no bonus while
North of England investors will. This was because of the differing level of
reserves.
'This is a traditional building society merger about traditional building
society values, two strong north-east societies coming together because, I
have not the slightest doubt, their future will be longer and stronger than
if they stayed apart.'
The new society will have joint reserves of about Pounds 400m; two
headquarters buildings - at Newcastle upon Tyne and at Doxford in
Sunderland; and about 170 branches. Mr Sharp insisted there would be no
compulsory redundancies.
Mr Sharp will continue as managing director, while Mr Bob Linden, North of
England chief executive, will take early retirement, and Mr Ron Shiel will
stand down as North of England chairman.
IBCA, the European rating agency, affirmed its credit rating of Northern
Rock (long-term A, short-term A1).
Mr Robert Dickinson, Northern Rock chairman, said he had a dream of forming
'a Great North building society encompassing the whole region', and hoped
the agreement would act as a catalyst for further mergers in the north-east.
The north-east's third largest building society, in 25th place nationally
with assets of Pounds 1.2bn, is Newcastle building society. Mr Bill Midgley,
its chief executive, said yesterday he did not see the merger as a threat to
the Newcastle.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Wall Street securities housesprosper in tough times: Fees,
broking and investment banking help firms ride out turbulent markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After three years of favourable financial market conditions, you would think
that the higher interest rates, lower securities prices and volatile
currency markets of the past few months would have severely dented Wall
Street's profits in the first quarter. Think again.
While many US securities houses reported lower quarterly trading profits
because of the deterioration in market conditions, most were able to make up
for it with higher revenues from fee-based businesses, and solid earnings
from retail broking and investment banking.
Mr John Keefe, an independent securities industry analyst in New York,
estimates that securities houses together earned about Dollars 1.7bn pre-tax
in the three months ended March. That is below the Dollars 2.3bn of a year
ago, and the Dollars 2bn in the final quarter of 1993, 'but it's still a
pretty good number'.
Smith Barney Shearson, Lehman Brothers, Dean Witter, Charles Schwab, Merrill
Lynch and Bear Stearns all posted higher earnings. Merrill Lynch and Bear
Stearns even came out of the turbulent quarter showing a bigger profit on
their trading activities.
Only two big firms, Salomon Brothers and PaineWebber, disappointed
investors.
The resilient performance from most US securities houses contrasted with
lower trading revenues at several large commercial banks. At Citicorp, the
biggest US bank, trading income plummeted Dollars 400m to just Dollars 71m
as turbulent fixed-income and currency markets took their toll. Bankers
Trust saw trading revenues tumble from Dollars 449m to just Dollars 14m,
while trading income at JP Morgan fell Dollars 114m to Dollars 356m.
The main difference between the commercial banks and the Wall Street firms
was that the latter were not as deeply involved in currency markets and
emerging market bonds.
Also, banks do not have the sort of stable fee-based businesses which the
securities houses have lately developed.
In the latest quarter, these recurring revenues helped the securities
industry ride out volatile markets. Fees from managing clients' funds rose
sharply at firms with sizeable asset management operations, such as Merrill
Lynch (where fees rose 23 per cent to a record Dollars 444m) and Smith
Barney (from Dollars 22m to Dollars 182m).
Wall Street's earnings were also cushioned by healthy brokerage commissions.
Trading activity on behalf of investors was at record levels: volume on the
New York Stock Exchange averaged 312m shares a day during the quarter.
At Merrill Lynch, growth in mergers and acquisitions and other advisory
business offset the downturn in underwriting. Following Smith Barney's
recent aggressive hiring of executives from rival houses, its earnings from
investment banking jumped 62 per cent to Dollars 196m.
While the brokers, asset managers and investment bankers mostly enjoyed the
first quarter, Wall Street's traders had the toughest time with sharply
rising US interest rates rocking stock, bond and currency markets in
February and March.
Salomon sustained the most damage, posting a meagre profit of Dollars 66m in
the wake of a Dollars 173m loss on its market-making activities, and its
very short-term trading strategies. The firm, however, made a profit on its
longer term trading business.
There are signs that profits growth is likely to slow further in the coming
months. Merrill Lynch's revenues, for example, had begun to decline in the
latter half of the first quarter, while Bear Stearns recently warned that it
incurred trading losses earlier this month.
The underwriting market also seems to be cooling. Rising interest rates and
unsettled stock markets have begun to deter companies from issuing new debt
or equity. The calendar for company flotations, or initial public offerings,
is less crowded than for some time, spelling trouble for firms which earn
their most lucrative fees underwriting IPOs.
The revived mergers and acquisitions business, however, may partly
compensate for any underwriting slowdown. A number of large corporate deals
have been concluded in recent months, and the drop in stock prices could
make more companies potential takeover targets. However, few expect 1994 to
sustain the industry's streak of three consecutive years of record-breaking
earnings.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Cost cuts lift Philips 150% in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   EINDHOVEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philips, the Dutch electronics group, raised profits by more than 150 per
cent in the first quarter of 1994 in spite of the recession that continues
to plague its main European markets.
Net profit rose to Fl 260m (Pounds 93m) from Fl 103m a year earlier, thanks
mainly to cost-cutting and further declines in group financing expenses.
Turnover was virtually flat at Fl 13.7bn, with strong rises in Latin America
and Asia helping to compensate for a decline in sales in Europe, where
Philips generates slightly more than half of total sales.
'Business remains extremely difficult in Europe,' said Mr Dudley Eustace,
finance director.
The improvement in operating profit to Fl 695m from Fl 560m a year earlier
was due chiefly to cost-cutting. At the same time, a further reduction in
group debt enabled Philips to lower its financial expenses nearly 30 per
cent to Fl 254m.
Mr Eustace said the repairs made to Philips' balance sheet over the past
year meant that it did not need to issue shares, but a share issue might be
possible if Philips were presented with a substantial acquisition. The
company is keen to grow by acquisition in the media sector to complement its
position in consumer electronic 'hardware'.
Despite the first-quarter rise, Philips remained cautious about the extent
of improvement in net profit from normal business operations in 1994.
The company's best-performing sector in the quarter was components and
semi-conductors, where operating profit nearly doubled to Fl 372m.
Consumer electronics, the company's single-biggest business, swung into an
operating profit of Fl 42m from a loss of Fl 28m. Grundig, the German
consumer electronic manufacturer that is 32 per cent owned by Philips,
reduced losses slightly, but it continues to suffer from its narrow focus on
Germany, Spain and Italy.
Mr Eustace said Philips had started setting aside DM10m (Pounds 4m) per
quarter to pay for the planned DM400m acquisition of the remaining Grundig
shares in the year 2004, as agreed with the Grundig family in 1984.
Professional products as a whole posted a Fl 47m operating loss, against a
Fl 9m loss.

FT  05 MAY 94 / BAT beats expectations with 20% jump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries, the UK tobacco giant, produced much stronger first-quarter
figures than expected, with a 20 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds
424m. The star performer was US tobacco, where profits doubled. Last week
BAT announced its intention of buying American Tobacco for Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m).
BAT said the US recovery was mainly due to the end of trade loading, whereby
the trade was stuffed with stock in the fourth quarter ahead of January
price increases. Ending this had helped profits by Pounds 50m in the
quarter. Chief executive Mr Martin Broughton said US tobacco had had a good
start to the year, with no evidence of further price discounting.
The black spot in tobacco came in BAT's Brazilian Souza Cruz subsidiary,
where volume fell 17 per cent and BAT incurred a loss of Pounds 10m. Mr
Broughton said this was partly due to a massive influx of smuggled
cigarettes from Paraguay under the encouragement of the Paraguayan
government.
BAT was confident the US tobacco market would remain 'large and profitable
for a long time', despite government moves to curb smoking. Mr Broughton
expected the Federal Excise Tax of up to 75 cents a pack to be introduced
this year, leading to a sharp drop in consumption followed by a sharp
recovery.
Total tobacco trading profit rose 13 per cent to Pounds 268m on sales up 1
per cent at Pounds 3.04bn. Profits from financial services were up 16 per
cent to Pounds 220m, consisting of Pounds 127m (up from Pounds 95m) from
general insurance and Pounds 93m (against Pounds 94m) from the life and
investment business.
Worldwide general business premium income was slightly ahead at Pounds 743m,
while the underwriting loss fell from Pounds 58m to Pounds 13m. Eagle Star
and Allied Dunbar increased profits to Pounds 37m and Pounds 44m
respectively, while Farmers in the US produced flat profits of Pounds 126m.
On group turnover down 2 per cent at Pounds 5.84bn, trading profits from
continuing operations were 15 per cent ahead at Pounds 488m. After interest
charges of Pounds 51m (against Pounds 43m), pre-tax profits were Pounds 424m
against Pounds 354m. After tax of Pounds 154m (against Pounds 131m) and
minorities - reduced by the Souza Cruz loss - of Pounds 12m (Pounds 24m) net
profit was Pounds 258m (Pounds 199m), giving a 27 per cent rise in earnings
per share to 8.4p.
