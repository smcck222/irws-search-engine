FT  05 MAY 94 / MEPs unlock the gates to an enlarged Europe

The gates to the European Union swung open yesterday for Sweden, Austria,
Finland and Norway when the European parliament ratified their accession
treaties by resounding majorities.
Whether all four join the EU's existing 12 members in January now depends on
whether they can sell European integration to their voters in referendums,
starting with Austria next month.
Latest opinion polls show that only in Finland is there a clear majority in
favour of EU entry. But the size of yesterday's ratification was acclaimed
by Nordic diplomats as a boost to their membership chances.
In what European parliament president Mr Egon Klepsch described as 'a
decision of historic importance', MEPs confounded critics of their chronic
absenteeism with a near-record turnout of 468 of the 518 members.
Amid barracking, an attempt to get the vote postponed was defeated by 305 to
150 votes with 13 abstentions. A large bloc of Euro-MPs then switched to
demonstrate support for enlargement itself and all four countries were
endorsed by huge majorities.
Norway received 374 for, 24 against, and 58 abstentions; Austria 374 for, 24
against and 61 abstentions; Finland 377 for, 21 against, and 61 abstentions;
and Sweden 380 for, 21 against with 60 abstentions.
At the core of the No vote were neo-fascists complaining that the Maastricht
treaty meant death to independent nations, and Greens arguing that an
unreformed EU would destroy high environmental and social standards in the
applicant countries.
An exception was former French foreign minister and European commissioner Mr
Claude Cheysson, who in a speech histrionically titled J'accuse, attacked
'the gravediggers of Europe' responsible for March's compromise with Britain
in the row over EU voting rights.
But the debate had already turned towards European Commission president Mr
Jacques Delors' interpretation that parliament had won a victory in ensuring
Britain got only cosmetic concessions in the voting row.
Strasbourg had held enlargement hostage until Britain's partners faced down
the UK demand that a small minority of countries should be able to block
decisions in an expanded Union.
Mr Delors called for a new federalist drive in Europe, and an offensive
against Euro-sceptics he characterised as bigots.
'Let us go on the attack,' he urged MEPs, ahead of next month's
Euro-elections. 'Don't be defensive. Don't just answer the people who have a
different Europe to propose, because those are the anti-Europeans. Those are
the people who do not accept people with different political convictions,
different religions, or a different colour of skin.'

South Africa's main political parties were negotiating a share-out of
disputed votes yesterday from the country's first all-race elections, after
the Independent Electoral Commission in effect abandoned a conventional
tally for political expediency.
IEC officials said privately that a deal had been struck at regional level
between the African National Congress and the rival Inkatha Freedom party in
Natal, the most heavily disputed province, to ensure that Inkatha emerges as
the largest party there. But the leadership of the ANC, the second largest
party in Natal and overall winner of the general election, had yet to
endorse the agreement.
The moves came as electoral officials early today ended a temporary halt to
the release of results, announcing that the ANC had won 64.9 per cent of the
votes with 15m counted out of the total of 23m. This brought the party close
to the 66 per cent threshold which would allow it unilaterally to change the
constitution.
The IEC, charged under the law with conducting elections and pronouncing on
their integrity, made clear it would endorse any agreement reached among
political parties, irrespective of voting totals.
Mr Justice Johann Kriegler, the embattled IEC chairman, said the commission
'would certainly not stand in the way' of parties resolving disputes among
themselves.
Asked whether the IEC ought not to judge disputes independently in
determining whether to endorse the elections, Judge Kriegler replied: 'If
the objector and the objectee come to terms, that is universally accepted as
legitimate in the political game . . . Let's not get overly squeamish.'
Judge Kriegler said he believed the presidential inauguration could take
place on schedule next Tuesday.

FT  05 MAY 94 / EU judgment deals blow to hopes over women's pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Women in Britain hoping European Union law would help them secure a full
pension at 60 suffered a setback yesterday.
The advocate-general of the European Court of Justice said EU law did not
prevent an employer raising a woman's pension age to 65, the same as a man.
The court usually confirms the advocate-general's opinions.
The case being considered by the court involves 78 women who work for Avdel
Systems, a Bedford company. They had planned to retire at 60 on full pension
but were told by their employer in July 1991 that unless they continued to
work until they were 65 their total pension entitlement would be cut by 20
per cent.
'We are obviously disappointed for the women,' Ms Kamlesh Bahl, chairwoman
of the Equal Opportunities Commission, said. 'They have lost substantial
pension rights as a result of the change and feel it is wrong that in the
name of equality those rights have been taken away.'
Mr Alan Jenkinson, policy director at Sedgwick Nobles Lowndes, employee
benefits consultants, said: 'The opinion goes further than general practice
in this country, as few employers are equalising pension ages for service up
to May 1990.
'But it is unlikely employers will take full advantage of it. Not only will
it complicate the administration of their pension schemes, but the changes
it will bring would be harsh on their female employees.'
The European Court's Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange ruling in 1990 found
that pensions were part of pay, so men and women had to be treated equally.
Occupational pension schemes had to remove sex discrimination from their
rules - including the different ages at which pensions begin.
Yesterday's opinion, if confirmed, would mean employers could set the
retirement age and would not, under European law, have to preserve any
previous advantage held by women.
They would still have to ensure, however, full equality of pension
entitlement for service after May 17 1990, the date of the Barber ruling.
Under a European court ruling last October employers are not obliged to pay
equal pensions to men and women for service before May 1990.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Major acts to protect balance of European manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major has rejected calls from the right of the Tory party to recast
in distinctly Euro-sceptic terms the government's manifesto for the June 9
European elections.
Instead, the latest Downing Street version retains the careful compromises
set out in the original draft written by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary. It marks a significant setback for the party's anti-Europeans.
Last night Mr Hurd reinforced the message in a letter to party activists
pledging to mount a 'positive' campaign emphasising the need for European
economic growth and employment.
The latest manifesto draft, which will be subject to only minor changes
before its publication on May 18, has been shortened to give it a sharper
edge.
But the careful balance of the original - seen by Mr Hurd as essential to
preserve the peace between the pro- and anti-European factions in the Tory
party during the run-up to the elections - has not been upset.
It sticks firmly to a neutral line on participation in a single European
currency - the subject of the latest Tory infighting over Europe.
Earlier this week, Mr Major rebuked Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief
secretary, for voicing opposition to economic and monetary union. The
manifesto underlines the prime minister's insistence that parliament will
take the decision only if and when Britain's partners move to a single
currency.
It stresses that Britain will not return to the European exchange rate
mechanism in the foreseeable future but leaves open the possibility of
participation at some stage in a reformed ERM.
The central themes of the manifesto - the case for a decentralised,
deregulated, open and competitive European Union - are designed to draw
maximum support from the Tory backbenches.
It underlines also the commitment to maintain Britain's veto in EU
decision-making, to maintain Nato as a central pillar of European defence,
and to preserve the present intergovernmental basis for foreign policy
co-ordination.
Mr Major hopes the contrast between those pledges and the alleged commitment
to a European 'superstate' of Labour and the Liberal Democrats will suppress
the Tory party's internal divisions during the campaign.
But the manifesto flatly rejects the demand of hard-line sceptics that
Britain consider disengaging from the EU if its partners press for greater
integration at the intergovernmental conference due in 1996.

FT  05 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Tate &amp; Lyle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Poor old Tate &amp; Lyle cannot strike the right chord with the market. Ahead of
last year's finals it upset investors with a profits warning. Yesterday's 22
per cent increase in interim profits might have been compensation but it was
greeted with a 2 per cent fall in the shares. These were undoubtedly good
results, particularly on the cereal sweeteners and starches side where North
American margins jumped to 12.2 per cent from 10.1. The trouble is that this
kind of movement is a reminder that Tate is in a cyclical commodity
business. It may regard itself as a processor, but its profits are volatile,
which is why the market tends to focus on the dividend. The main
disappointment yesterday was that this grew by only 8 per cent, well below
the progression in earnings.
A degree of caution is understandable. Tate does not want a repeat of last
year's second half when expectations raced ahead of themselves. Some
catch-up may occur at the final stage but yesterday's dividend news could
signal that management itself regards the interim profit increase as
somewhat above trend. It also gives the lie to those who argue that the
company will use every opportunity to raise its dividend to hasten
conversion of its Pounds 188m preference issue. Even counting the issue as
equity, gearing is 84 per cent. Yet interest cover is over seven times and
the company is not short of cash for expansion as its Orsan monosodium
glutamate purchase shows. It need not hurry to force conversion when the
preference capital will subsequently become progressively more expensive to
service.

FT  05 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Lufthansa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lufthansa's deal with the German government over how future pension
liabilities are to be split has paved the way for a decisive break with its
public sector past. The airline's culture has changed over the past two
years as top management has realised that a low cost base is essential in an
increasingly competitive industry. But Lufthansa's profile in international
capital markets has inevitably been affected by the government's majority
stake - something which could not change so long as the pension issue was
unresolved.
Now, though, Bonn is free to sell its stake, while the airline can press
ahead with its own rights issue. This comes at a good time, as Lufthansa's
profit and loss account is being transformed by the twin effects of strong
recovery in demand and vigorous cost-cutting. The group is expected to move
marginally into profit in the current year and strongly thereafter.
Some of this story is already incorporated in the share price, which has
outperformed the DAX index by more than 50 per cent in the past year. But
there is room for more. Using the yardstick of market capitalisation to
turnover, Lufthansa does not look expensive. Its ratio of 35 per cent is
similar to KLM's but less than half that of British Airways. BA, of course,
deserves a higher rating because its structural changes are much further
advanced than those of its continental rivals. But the wide gap in the
ratings shows the possible upside in Lufthansa's share price if it can catch
up.

FT  05 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite slipping in response to yesterday's first-quarter figures, BAT
Industries' shares are comfortably higher than before it spent Dollars 1bn
on US cigarettes last week. The market's favourable reaction might incline
Mr Martin Broughton, BAT's chief executive, towards further action. The
group has made no secret of its ambition to expand in financial services.
But simply adding another jewel to the crown - by buying a continental
European insurer, for example - would lack the same commercial logic.
While an overseas insurer would spread BAT's risk away from the UK, there
would be little obvious synergy with Eagle Star. Mr Broughton would have to
convince the City that he had struck an exceptionally good deal. The
acquisition of American Tobacco was applauded precisely because it addressed
a strategic weakness. On that basis, securing additional distribution in UK
life assurance should take priority.
It is too early to say that the advent of commission disclosure will cause
the same upheaval in UK life assurance as Marlboro Friday caused in US
tobacco. But a shift in the balance of power towards bancassurance companies
seems likely and Allied Dunbar's dependence on a direct sales force could
leave it exposed. Acquiring a retail bank or building society would make
strategic sense. Yet pushing gearing well above 50 per cent - the current
year-end target - would be risky unless BAT can rely on US tobacco to
generate cash. That, above all else, may be the value of last week's deal.

FT  05 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Bucking the trend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Concerted intervention by central banks means industrial countries know they
have a problem with the dollar. It does not mean they know how to solve it.
Yesterday's effort pulled the dollar a little further back from the Y100
threshold, and was slightly more successful against the D-Mark. It is hard
to see how the effect can last, however, without some accompanying policy
measures. The combination of a current account surplus and capital inflow
into Japan and a current account deficit and capital outflow out of the US
is a formidable force driving the dollar down. Intervention on its own is
unlikely to work for long without at least some supporting movement on
interest rates.
Perhaps the Bundesbank will use the opportunity to accelerate German rate
cuts, though this looks less plausible as signs of economic recovery
proliferate. Japan could cut short term rates still further, though that
might simply encourage more foreign capital to flow into its equity market.
That leaves the US. There must be a strong chance that the Federal Reserve
will bring forward its next tightening and raise its discount rate.
In the short run, that would be awkward for the bond market, which is ironic
since worries about the diminishing attraction of Treasury bonds to
foreigners is one reason why the US is anxious to see the dollar stabilise.
The nagging worry is that this may only be possible at the price of interest
rates higher than the markets have yet factored in. The risk is that the US
recovery will be stifled while that in Europe is still barely off the
ground.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Nostalgia for communist comfort: Passionate divisions behind
Sunday's Hungarian election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON and EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the outside world, it is clear enough what Hungary's election is about.
It will either reverse or, more probably, confirm the pattern of former
communists returning to power through the ballot-box, which now affects
almost all of central and eastern Europe.
The reason for this swing of the pendulum is no secret. While the scope of
reforms varies, the collapse of the communist system has brought social and
economic dislocation, unemployment, widening income differentials and, at
least initially, steeply falling output. Even in a country like Poland,
where gross domestic product began to grow again last year, unemployment
continued to rise.
Everywhere (except Russia) the former communists have changed their name.
All claim to be converted to the virtues of the free market, with a large
private sector, as well as multi-party democracy. But everywhere they have
benefited from public disillusionment with the first fruits of capitalism,
and have encouraged people to think that, with them in charge, the
transition can be managed more gently, with better protection for those who
stand to lose.
Yet when it comes to specific policies, their room for manoeuvre is small.
In Poland the ex-communists, now in government, find themselves struggling
to hold down wages and contain public expenditure, against the populist
demands of the Solidarity trade union. And in Hungary, while their attacks
on the conservative government's economic record and their claims that the
country is on the verge of economic disintegration have contributed to their
commanding lead in opinion polls, the Socialists (formerly communists) do
not offer any sharp change of policy.
In fact, economic policy as such has been almost absent from the Hungarian
election campaign. Every party agrees that income tax rates need to be
brought down, but none has staked out a position as the party of tax cuts.
All the main parties proclaim their belief in privatisation, and in economic
integration with western Europe.
Even where there are differences, they tend to be within political blocs
rather than between them. The fiercest criticisms of the government's
privatisation policy have come from the right wing of the ruling party, the
Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), and from its Christian Democrat coalition
partners. And the government presents its economic achievements, such as
more than Dollars 7bn in foreign investment, as fruits of gradualism rather
than 'shock therapy'.
The opposition Free Democrats - generally seen as to the left of the MDF,
and now as potential coalition partners of the Socialists - are, in fact, to
the right on economic policy issues: 'revolutionaries posing as yuppies', in
the bon mot of one of their founders, they favour more economic freedom,
less state control or intervention. Their fellow-liberals in the Federation
of Young Democrats ('Fidesz') are regarded as further to the right -
'yuppies posing as revolutionaries'  - because they are more firmly hostile
to the Socialists. Yet one of the Fidesz leaders, Jozsef Szajer, told the FT
recently that 'free market rhetoric wouldn't work in Hungary: no one here
believes in a simple, idealistic structure of any kind'. He went on to argue
for a consensual economic policy based on agreement between government,
unions and employers.
The Socialist party itself has the high priest of fiscal restraint in the
shape of Laszlo Bekesi, a former and perhaps future finance minister,
alongside a trade union wing that promises higher social spending and
government action to save troubled industries. (The party leader, Gyula
Horn, has good reformist credentials as the foreign minister who tore down
the barbed wire between Hungary and Austria in 1989, but also a more dubious
past as a militiaman in the grim period after the 1956 revolution.)
In short, economic policy is not what divides the parties. Voters' feelings
about the economy may be the decisive factor in the election, but the
political class reserves its passion for 'the national question'.
This is, in essence, a question about what makes a Hungarian: ethnicity or
citizenship? The late Jozsef Antall, founder of the MDF and prime minister
until his death last December, once said he considered himself the prime
minister in spirit of 15m Hungarians. Hungary has only 10m inhabitants, but
Antall's concept of the nation included Hungarian-speakers in neighbouring
countries. Left-wingers, both liberal and socialist, regard such talk as
dangerous, potentially even for the Hungarian minorities themselves, since
it tends to increase suspicion of them among their fellow-citizens.
Intellectuals maintain that there is a deep and unbridgeable divide in
Hungarian society between liberals and conservatives. Socialists, even after
half a century of communist rule, are regarded as a sub-category within the
liberal camp.
Perhaps it is not surprising that this should be the view of a rightwing
intellectual like Istvan Csurka, the nationalist playwright who split from
the MDF two years ago to form his own splinter group, the Hungarian Truth
and Life Party. What is surprising is that many liberals see politics in
rather similar terms. This is particularly true of the Free Democrats,
despite their origins in the anti-communist opposition of the 1980s. Many of
their original leaders were the offspring of committed communists, and many
had begun their careers as Marxist dissidents before graduating to
liberalism. Many, including perhaps half the top leadership of the party,
are also Jewish.
The readiness of right-wing nationalist leaders like Csurka to resort to
anti-semitism is thus not entirely surprising; and the Free Democrats made a
sort of concession to it when they picked Gabor Kuncze, a previously little
known provincial politician, as their candidate for prime minister. Election
posters featuring their previous leader, Ivan Peto, who comes from a Jewish
and communist family, are frequently spray-painted with the star of David.
Kuncze is a Christian, whose mustachioed features give him an 'authentic
Hungarian' look (to borrow Csurka's terminology).
Csurka has happily been marginalised. But many liberals argue that the
mainstream MDF retains the instincts of a Catholic, authoritarian,
nationalist party. Even Gaspar Miklos Tamas, a Free Democrat MP who once
described himself as a 'central European Tory', now grudgingly admits that
he would regard a Socialist victory as a lesser evil than a continuation of
the present government. 'One may have doubts about the genuineness of the
Socialists' conversion to democracy,' he says, 'but these people (the MDF)
positively hate it.' As proof of this somewhat extreme proposition he cites
the sacking or forced retirement of 129 journalists from the state-owned
radio last February, which prompted large demonstrations both for and
against.
Feelings run equally high on the other side. An adviser to the present prime
minister, Peter Boross, accuses the Free Democrats of advising western
countries to withhold credits from the present government, and makes a
seemingly far-fetched link between such 'unpatriotic' behaviour and the
shortlived bolshevik dictatorship of Bela Kun, which followed Hungary's
defeat in the first world war.
Only the Young Democrats have tried to rise above this apparently
anachronistic kulturkampf, but it is far from clear they have succeeded. A
year ago they were riding high in opinion polls and tipped by some as
leaders of the next government. But their efforts to reassure provincial
conservative voters by calling themselves 'national liberals' - stressing
their concern for Hungarian minorities abroad, repudiating any anti-clerical
tendencies and hinting that they would prefer a coalition with the MDF to
one with the Socialists - provoked a split in the party and hostile press
comment.
Today, Fidesz leaders claim their first preference would still be a liberal
government, formed by themselves and the Free Democrats. But no one
seriously expects an election result that would make this possible.
Hungarians are being asked to choose between left and right, not in the
sense of socialism versus capitalism, but in the much older sense of
'cosmopolitan' free-thinkers versus Christian nationalists. In 1990 an
anti-communist backlash brought victory to the right. This time, nostalgia
for the relative comfort of 'goulash communism' seems likely to favour the
left.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Mr Clarke's manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenneth Clarke has proved a prudent chancellor of the exchequer. It says
much about the febrile state of the Tory party that his reward is to be
pushed well down the list of potential candidates for the leadership. This
is a pity, since the underlying philosophy he articulated in yesterday's
Mais lecture on 'the changing world of work in the 1990s' accords well with
what the country needs. But the lecture fails to provide adequate answers to
the questions it raises.
'I intend,' said Mr Clarke yesterday, 'to extol the virtues of both a
flexible labour market and a strong welfare state. I believe that both are
essential for the quality of life that we aspire to in Britain. I believe
that, properly directed, the two complement one another.' The essence of Mr
Clarke's philosophy then is the desire to combine the 'best aspects of
American enterprise and free market efficiency with the European commitment
to the welfare state'. Two questions arise: first, whether a flexible labour
market is as wonderful as Mr Clarke claims; and, second, whether the
flexibility he extols is consistent with the welfare state he defends.
Where Mr Clarke is right is in arguing that the high current level of
unemployment is not caused by changes in international competition. Nor is
it due to technological change, which seems to be no faster than in the
1960s. There have been inescapable structural changes, such as the decline
in the number of coal miners from 750,000 after the war to today's 15,000.
The economy's failure rests in the fact that it has not provided those who
have lost these sorts of jobs with adequate replacements.
Market forces
Deregulation does have important successes to its credit: strikes have
fallen to their lowest level for a century; pay is more responsive to market
forces; productivity has improved, above all in manufacturing; there has
also been substantial growth in self-employment, part-time employment and
female employment, with women making up 46 per cent of those in work; and
employment seems to be more responsive to changes in output than a decade
ago.
Yet all is far from rosy. The growth of part-time work is indeed desirable,
but the reduction in the number of full-time jobs is not. Equally, the
unemployment cost of lowering inflation remains very high, as is the level
of unemployment at which inflation stabilises. If deregulation had achieved
all Mr Clarke claims, wage inflation would still be falling and an expansion
of the economy at greater than its long-run trend rate of growth would be
greeted with equanimity. Nothing, in short, suggests that a return to what
was not so long ago thought of as full employment is likely. This may be
because a 'norm' for wage growth, an idea Mr Clarke condemns, is inescapable
in any fully integrated labour market. If wages in successful firms rise at
levels only they can afford, wage push will afflict the entire economy, with
dire results.
Welfare state
So far, then, it is only one-and-a-half cheers for deregulation. But what of
the compatibility of deregulation with the welfare state? Mr Clarke simply
asserts that the social security system should complement an efficient
labour market. So, of course, it should. The question is how.
Questions do not arise, in this regard, about the National Health Service or
state education. But they do about any form of assistance whose withdrawal
is liable to create a poverty trap. The issue is whether there can be a
flexible labour market, at least at the bottom of the earnings distribution,
if people can obtain almost as much as they would get from working by not
working, instead.
Mr Clarke's response is to state that the 'government is looking at the
means of ensuring that the welfare system encourages the low paid to find
employment'. This is a central issue because these are precisely the people
a welfare state is supposed to help. Mr Clarke fails to provide the answer,
which is why his assertion that 'harnessing market forces does not mean
abandoning social protection' is, for the moment, pretty empty. His job now
is to fill it.
The chancellor has addressed the right agenda. But he has some way to go if
he is to convince the public that he has the right answers too.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Personal View: An example for the rest of Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Lord CALLAGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's elections were a reminder to those with jaded political
palates how much the vote means when it has been denied for so long. Now
comes the hard part - the fulfilment of the masses' expectations that the
election of a government of their choice will in a very short time transform
into reality their demands for decent housing, better schooling and more
jobs. Not that their leaders were extravagant in their pre-election
promises, although enthusiastic local activists over-egged the pudding.
Among the national leaders, there is a sober appreciation of the tremendous
tasks that they will face.
I doubt whether this has gone home to the electors in the excitement of
living through a truly revolutionary era. In truth, although a beginning can
and must be made quickly, a levelling up process will take several years. As
many as one-quarter of black people are living in miserable lean-to huts and
shanty towns with flimsy housing materials, and with a lack of water, proper
sanitation and electricity.
The ANC believes that extra social expenditure can be financed by the faster
rate of economic growth that they expect now sanctions have been lifted -
and in fact the economy has already begun to expand. Another favourable
factor is that the country's small international debt should permit
additional borrowing, and it will have renewed access to IMF drawings and to
World Bank loans. There are signs that many of the 200 to 300 overseas
companies which ran down their operations as a result of sanctions are
considering returning.
The economy of South Africa is altogether larger and stronger than any of
its neighbours. It manufactures nearly as much as the whole of sub-Saharan
Africa put together and exports twice as much as all the rest. By comparison
with its neighbours, it is an industrial giant in every respect. But when
viewed against the industrialised west, its deficiencies are glaringly
apparent.
Sanctions had a bigger impact than was admitted. New investment declined
seriously during the 1980s and, if it is to increase to the level at which
it can sustain a fast rate of growth, the present low levels of domestic
savings need to improve and a favourable climate needs to be established to
encourage overseas capital to return.
Both big parties in the new government favour lower tariffs and less
protection with a reduction of subsidies to domestic industry. And both
recognise the need to recover South Africa's international position in price
and quality, despite the lack of skilled technical, managerial and
professional manpower.
But the incoming government must strive to formulate economic policies that
will give confidence both at home and overseas, while at the same time
transform the social landscape, finding work for the near 50 per cent
unemployed, and deliver those basic services which the African people
expect.
Without economic success, the social improvements will not bear fruit. But
without social reform, a democratic society would collapse, and the boldest
multi-racial venture ever undertaken in Africa could dissolve in disorder or
worse. It will be as difficult a task as any government has undertaken.
The world cannot turn its back on South Africa at this crucial moment.
Additional resources are needed to enable it to transform itself and to
assist its re-integration with the rest of the continent. Whilst it is
imperative that South Africa's revolution should succeed for the sake of its
own people, an additional bonus will be the enormous impact it would have on
sub-Saharan Africa as a whole.
It is already a magnet for Africans in other African countries. A few of its
continental neighbours have recently embarked on far-reaching reforms and
show signs of progress. But that is not the general picture. Some are in
turmoil: agriculture stagnates; many are unable to break free from the
burden of foreign debt; there is corruption and an absence of sound
government, indifferent and sometimes no education, grossly high military
expenditure, ethnic tension; and so on.
The example of a successful South Africa would galvanise other sub-Saharan
countries. What energies might be unlocked if South Africa could hold out a
vision of a future in which neighbours could integrate their resources and
skills as a means of realising the potential of Africa's rich diverse
resources and bringing hope to poverty-stricken millions?
What better international role for a newly democratic, multi-racial country
emerged from decades of isolation than to assist friends and neighbours
weaker than itself to rejoin the mainstream of the international community?
South Africa's revolution must not fail.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Leading Article: What Palestine needs now
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has taken eight months, since their historic handshake in Washnington
last September, for Mr Yitzhak Rabin and Mr Yassir Arafat to reach the point
where they could actually sign an agreement yesterday, giving limited
self-rule to the Palestinians in two small areas of Palestine. During those
months euphoria has dissipated.
Israelis are bitterly divided, between those who are eager to get rid of the
Gaza Strip and other densely populated Arab areas at almost any price, and
those who regard withdrawal from any part of the 'Land of Israel' as close
to sacrilege. Palestinians are even more bitterly divided, between those who
see the 'liberation' of even a small area as an essential first step towards
an independent state, and those who regard the agreement as installing Mr
Arafat in a quisling role, with the job of suppressing Palestinian
resistance and so indirectly protecting the Israeli settlements which remain
on Palestinian soil.
The delay has strengthened the opponents of compromise in both camps. The
massacre in Hebron last February revealed the extreme vulnerability of the
Palestinians. The fact that even after that Mr Rabin was unwilling or unable
to remove the handful of settlers based in the town centre of Hebron, let
alone any of the larger concentrations, hardly inspires confidence. The
momentum of events has been unfavourable. Those who have signed the
agreement, and those who support it on both sides, need to work very fast to
reverse that trend.
Tangible benefits
Israeli leaders have made it clear they regard the agreement as a test,
implying that further progress towards a final settlement depends on the
success of the new arrangement in enhancing rather than diminishing Israeli
security. But Mr Arafat's chances of keeping the peace will depend in large
part on his ability to demonstrate that the agreement is bringing real and
tangible benefits to Palestinians.
Those who live in Gaza and Jericho will not long be grateful for the removal
of Israeli soldiers if they find themselves harassed with an even more
brutal hand by the Palestinian police and Mr Arafat's 'Fatah hawks'. Mr
Arafat cannot afford to be indulgent towards those who seek to sabotage the
agreement by carrying on acts of violence against Israelis. But he should be
careful to avoid the appearance of confiding power only to his own
supporters.
His legitimacy as a historic resistance leader has virtually run its course.
To rule over Gaza and Jericho he needs democratic authority. Elections
should not be postponed longer than absolutely necessary. The risk that
Hamas, the Islamic resistance movement, will win many posts has to be
accepted.
Economic prospects
Equally important is the need to provide the population with some economic
prospects, especially in Gaza where annual per capita income is Dollars 850,
40-50 per cent of the workforce is unemployed, and the population is growing
at 4.6 per cent per year. The World Bank has just announced a Dollars 1.2bn
three-year emergency aid package - which at Dollars 200 per person per year
is certainly generous, but will not in itself create a viable economy.
Indeed, it could do more harm than good if much of it sticks to the fingers
of corrupt administrators, or if the PLO uses it mainly as a political tool
for rewarding supporters and entrenching its own power. That has tended to
be the pattern in the past.
What the Palestinian economy needs, like any other, is free trade and free
movement of labour, and large flows of inward investment. This is much more
likely to generate sustainable improvements in living standards than
dependence on mere handouts. The most important element in the agreement may
be the access to the Israeli market which it offers to Palestinian producers
 -something ironically denied them during 27 years of Israeli occupation. In
time, this should enable Palestinian industry and agriculture to absorb a
larger share of the work force.
But in the short term the best hope is for Israel to readmit Palestinian
migrant labour to its own economy. That does involve some security risks,
but the risk of continuing to bottle up the Palestinian work force inside
the territories is even greater.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest upheaval in the building society movement - the proposed merger
of the Northern Rock and the North of England, raises a question. Can there
be some curious connection between glossy new headquarters and society
mergers?
The North of England is soon to move from the centre of Sunderland to a new
HQ on the edge of Sunderland, at the Doxford business park. Similarly the
Universal, one of the smaller societies, in merger talks with the Tynemouth,
recently moved to smart new premises in central Newcastle. The Leeds, in
swank new premises, was in merger discussions, abandoned last autumn, with
the National &amp; Provincial, and the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, soon to be
digested by Lloyds Bank, hasn't long been in its glitzy premises on the
outskirts of Gloucester.
So where does this leave the Newcastle Building Society which is planning to
move into its imposing Pounds 10m HQ in the centre of Newcastle? A prime
target for the Northern Rock's expansion minded management team?
Not so, says Newcastle chief executive Bill Midgley, who likens the
phenomenon to football teams building new stands, only to be relegated the
following season. 'We have to concentrate our minds on making the profits to
pay for our new headquarters.'
Fighting talk, Bill.

What will Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, make of the
departure for New York of Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil?
Back in February when the Malaysians imposed a ban on giving government
contracts to British companies after the Sunday Times made certain
unflattering references, Neil was seen by the Malaysians as the principal
villain of the piece. The question now is whether Dr Mahathir feels that
with Neil's exit honour has been satisfied and normal business relations can
be restored.
While several British ministers have been on their diplomatic knees trying
to placate Dr Mahathir, John Major has stayed aloof from the whole affair.
It's no secret that the two PMs do not get along. The gossip in Kuala Lumpur
is that Dr Mahathir is waiting to see if there's a new man in Downing Street
before burying the hatchet.

A sign of the times. The Asian Development Bank, that portmanteau do-gooder
on behalf of developing Asian nations, has been staging its annual general
meeting in Nice. Rather more developed France used the occasion - naturally
 -to tout for inward investment and push its own products.
Prime minister Edouard Balladur fronted the sales effort, regaling the
assembled horde of Asian dignitaries - some rich, others decidedly poor -
with France's virtues of low inflation, stable currency, freedom of capital,
dynamic companies. Then Edmond Alphandery, economics minister, pointedly
reminded them how much aid France has, over time, pumped into Asia.
Pity Alphandery seemed rather less familiar with ADB's own workings -
displaying remarkable vagueness on the number of its members, for instance -
after all, he is its current chairman.

In Brazil, plagued by near hyperinflation and bad governments for more than
a decade, success stories like Ayrton Senna don't come round too often.
Hence the death of the Formula One racing driver almost brought Latin
America's biggest country to a halt yesterday, when his coffin was paraded
through the street of Sao Paulo, atop a fire engine.
President Itamar Franco had already declared three days of mourning and
delayed the announcement of a new currency until next week, while Rubens
Ricupero, Brazil's new finance minister, compares Senna's death to the loss
of the US space shuttle Challenger.
'For a country which has still not sent people into space, Senna was the
hero in the vanguard of technology and proof of our ability to win among the
most modern and new. Senna was our astronaut,' says Ricupero.

British-born chairman Deryck Maughan will now be paid according to how
Solly's return on equity compares with that of Merrill Lynch, Morgan

Last year Maughan raked in Dollars 7m in cash and stock benefits - a figure
loosely tied to performance. Now he will receive no bonus at all, and a
salary of just Dollars 1m, if the firm's ROE is as low as 5 per cent and
equals that of its five rivals.
But he would be looking at a maximum bonus of Dollars 25m, were ROE to top
30 per cent and exceed the average of the five rivals by 10 per cent.
Admittedly, it's a stiff task. Last year's return was 23 per cent, against

FT  05 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: A kindness not to be repeated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW BARNARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Anthony de Jasay's article, 'A vicious kind of social kindness'
(Personal View, April 29), asks whether democracies are 'condemned to
smother the young and the long-term unemployed with their caring kindness'.
The impression is that the author himself is in no doubt that this is the
case, but one wonders why. His analysis does not treat the young or the
long-term unemployed as special groups. This begs the question of why they
in particular should be disadvantaged, as they surely are.
Inadequate training, particularly of the young and the long-term unemployed,
does seem to provide a relatively good explanation for rising structural
unemployment. It may have been a problem 20 years ago, but this is not an
adequate reason for dismissing it as an 'old chestnut'. For that matter, de
Jasay's argument against social protection does not exactly break new
ground. The belief that cuts in social protection could stop the rise in
structural unemployment was an important part of early Thatcherism.
It is fairly clear now that cuts in both taxes and social protection during
the 1980s completely failed to halt the inexorable rise in the UK's
structural unemployment. Failure to realise this at the time - which led to
policy mistakes, and so to overheating and recession - may be regarded as
unfortunate. To continue to proclaim that social spending is the prime cause
(rather than a consequence) of unemployment, is less excusable. Such vicious
'kindness' should not be repeated.

THE BILLION DOLLAR MOLECULE: One Company's Quest for the Perfect Drug
By Barry Werth
Simon &amp; Schuster Dollars 25, 445 pages
Anyone who thinks scientists are quiet and dull should read this
fly-on-the-wall account of research in action at Vertex Pharmaceuticals, a
Massachusetts biotechnology company. The Billion Dollar Molecule is a story
of anger, arrogance and aggression, spiced with duplicity and deceit and
lubricated with hard drinking. One scientist smashes office furniture when
his experiments fail and there is even a half-hearted arson attempt in the
laboratory.
The hero of The Billion Dollar Molecule is the hyper-ambitious Joshua Boger,
a chemist who leaves a senior research job at Merck, the largest and most
respected US drugs company, in 1989 to set up Vertex. He has enough venture
capital funding to recruit a bright band of scientists. Most of them are
former Merck colleagues whom he lures away with stock options and a
scientific vision of computerised 'rational drug discovery' combining the
skills of chemists and biologists.
Boger emerges as a true leader. While all around him are acting
irrationally, he remains calmly decisive. After every disappointment he
manages to soothe his anguished staff and to reinspire them to new efforts.
However, on the basis of this book, Boger is open to criticism. One
strategic mistake was to put egotistical researchers into a flat management
structure as a 'social experiment', with the result that they waste time
fighting each other. It takes him three years to recruit a research
director, who proceeds to reorganise the scientists into a more conventional
and smoother-running hierarchy.
And, on a personal level, it is sad to read how Boger and his workaholic
colleagues deprive themselves of normal family life. Returning home for a
rare weekend between 'death march' business trips, Boger finds that his
youngest son first fails to recognise him and then says poignantly,
'bye-bye, daddy' whenever he leaves the room. Vertex may be a new company
but its mainly male staff works according to the old macho traditions.
Barry Werth, author of The Billion Dollar Molecule, follows consciously in
the tradition of Soul of a New Machine, the highly successful inside story
of a computer project written 13 years ago by Tracy Kidder. But Werth's book
is more wide-ranging than Kidder's, covering not only the science and
technology but also the financial story behind Vertex.
Indeed for many FT readers the most interesting aspect will be the way Boger
raises tens of millions of dollars to fund Vertex's research, both from
established drug companies for collaborative ventures and from Wall Street
investors. Kidder Peabody, the bank underwriting Vertex's initial public
offering, only just manages to get the issue away, at a price cut from the
original Dollars 13-Dollars 15 range to Dollars 9 per share, by calling in
every favour it is owed by the investment community - and allowing Boger and
Rich Aldrich, his business development director, to sell a fifth of the
offering to their own contacts.
How does Werth, a freelance science writer, know all this? At the back of
the book he says he had 'nearly complete freedom to come and go at Vertex
for almost four years'. In exchange he allowed the company to 'review my
manuscript for factual accuracy and proprietary disclosures'. Werth also
agreed that anyone quoted directly in connection with Vertex could review
the quotes 'to ensure accuracy and confidentiality on scientific matters'.
But he does not say how much he left out.
The book's theme is competition. The most immediate rivals of the Vertex
researchers are their own colleagues, fighting for laboratory resources and
professional recognition. The names that go on Vertex's scientific papers -
and in what order - are an explosive issue.
The most important external competitor is Merck. The scientists whose
careers started with the world's top drug company are desperate to show that
they can do better outside its bureaucracy. And Vertex is in a commercial
race with Merck in its first two research projects: to create better drugs
to suppress the immune system (to treat transplant patients) and to treat
Aids.
Less predictably, Vertex also develops an obsessive rivalry with Stuart
Schreiber, a brilliant young professor of organic chemistry at Harvard
University and the only character in the book to match Boger's supreme
self-assurance. Schreiber starts off as the star member of Vertex's
scientific advisory board. (Boger has deliberately set the company up in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, so as to be able to draw on Harvard's chemical
expertise.) But Boger soon suspects that Schreiber is passing on
confidential information to Vertex's competitors - and fires him.
The most surprising strand in the whole book is the race between Vertex and
Schreiber's academic team to discover the structure and function of
biological molecules associated with the immune system. Boger and Aldrich
are driven by an anti-Schreiber passion and 'gloat radiantly' when Vertex
manages to upstage him on a scientific publication. 'Imagine Stu-Bob (their
name for Schreiber) driving in his Porsche on his way to Harvard, hearing it
on National Public Radio,' Aldrich says. 'He'll wrap it around a tree.'
But there is also public relations value in a Nature paper for an obscure
biotech company trying to raise money. So Boger devotes a lot of energy in
twice convincing the venerable science journal to change its mind after
initially rejecting Vertex papers.
The Billion Dollar Molecule has several flaws. For example, the purple prose
is frequently tinted with cliches and the book lacks the illustrations that
would help non-scientists to follow the story. But, in all, it is the
liveliest and most revealing story written so far about the biotech
industry.

<TEXT>
Sir, Can anybody tell me what purpose is served by imposing a fine on a
mutual society such as Norwich Union? As I understand it, the Financial
Services Act was introduced to help protect the public from financial loss
through being sold inappropriate long-term financial products. Mutual
societies have no shareholders, so all their profits are distributed to
their with-profits policyholders. Therefore, those who suffer financial loss
from the imposition of a fine are the very people the legislation was
designed to protect.
Surely more thought could be given to the penalties imposed for
infringements of the regulators' rules? For instance, fines could be imposed
on directors and chief executives or regulators could be given the power to
remove the chief executive of a persistent offender.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Why Estonia central bank is exception
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor STEVE H HANKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Lloyd reports on the politicisation of central banking in the
republics of the former Soviet Union ('A cry for freedom', May 3). While Mr
Lloyd correctly concludes that Estonia and Latvia are success stories, he
omits fully to explain why they are exceptions to the rule. In June of 1992,
Estonia introduced a currency board-like system. Under that system, monetary
policy is solely rule driven and insulated from political meddling. Although
Latvia has a central bank that can engage indiscretionary monetary policy,
it has been operating as if it was a currency board. Moreover, the Latvian
central bankers have kept the politicians at bay by threatening to introduce
currency board legislation, if the politicians should meddle in monetary
affairs.
Mr Lloyd also commits an error of commission. He concludes that it is
probably too late for other republics to follow the lead of Estonia and
Latvia. That is not true. In Lithuania, Mr Aldolfas Slezevicius mounted a
successful campaign earlier this year to depoliticise monetary policy with
the introduction of a currency board-like system. Such a system was
installed on April 1. Now the litas must be fully backed by foreign reserve
currencies and gold and freely convertible at a fixed rate of 4 litai per US
dollar.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Energy efficiency targets not
ambitious enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr EOIN LEES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'All eyes on efficiency' (April 27) questioned whether the
regional electricity companies (RECs) can be serious about saving energy if
profits are tied to volume sales. The Energy Saving Trust, in its response
to the Offer consultation paper, Electricity distribution: price control,
reliability and customer service, believes the director-general should adopt
a more ambitious approach to promoting efficiency in the distribution
business than is the case under the current price control mechanism.
In recent years, inter-fuel competition has stimulated the electricity
industry to develop many energy-efficient solutions, reflecting the fact
that it is only through developing new efficient electro-technologies that
the electricity companies can compete with other fuels which are generally
cheaper. But, in practice, technological development has been mainly
directed at high demand users in the commercial and industrial sectors.
It is for these reasons that the Energy Saving Trust recommended to Offer
that it should treat low-demand customers (less than 100kW) differently from
those of high demand, by making a more significant reduction apply in the
volume sales component of the supply price control formula.
The trust proposes a three-factor price formula, based on the number of
customers, fixed costs and volume. A significant reduction in the existing
volume sales component, coupled with some degree of compensation to the RECs
for the energy savings attained, would increase the incentive to the RECs to
invest in demand-side management measures.
In order to achieve widespread benefits to the broadest range of customer
types, we believe the RECs should receive an allowance within the
distribution price control for investment in demand-side measures. This
amount (Pounds 40m in 1995-96, Pounds 90m in 1996-97, Pounds 125m in 1997-98
and beyond) would initially be raised from low-demand users of the
distribution system, who would of course also receive the benefits of the
subsequent investment.
On a practical level, the trust is already working with the RECs on a number
of energy efficiency schemes aimed at domestic consumers and small
businesses. All will provide considerable benefits to the customer and the
environment.

Sir, Your headline, 'MEPs fail in their attempt to block enlargement vote'
(May 3), is grossly misleading given that the overwhelming majority of MEPs
were attempting to do precisely the opposite.
In spite of some misgivings about the failure to adapt the institutional
framework of the European Union to cater for 16 member states, which will
result in some MEPs abstaining or voting against enlargement, it was already
clear on Monday that most MEPs support the accession of Norway, Austria,
Finland and Sweden.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Currencies all a bit groggy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The background to the surprise concerted intervention to support the dollar
is that all the world's currencies are looking a bit groggy. By what
measuring rod can such a statement be made? Not in terms of current
inflation, which is lower than for 30 years. The market which has expressed
most unease at the prospect for world money is, of course, that for bonds.
By the arithmetic of compound discounting, bonds are sensitive even to a
modest adverse shift in sentiment about inflation stretching some years
ahead. There could also be less well-articulated fears that budget deficits
and other calls on world savings may push up real interest rates as world
recovery gathers momentum.
It is, in any case, not a coincidence that the rebirth of concerted
intervention by the Group of Seven industrialised countries has coincided
with another upsurge of favourable indicators about the US economy. The US
Treasury and Fed obviously feared that the latest indicators would - by
refuelling inflation fears - turn what has really been by past standards a
minor dive of the dollar into something more like a rout. It may be a funny
old world where good news is treated by the financial markets as bad; but
reflections on this aspect will have to wait until a calmer moment.
One reason why monetary authorities are right to be sensitive to market
trends is that the industrial world is just emerging from a long growth
recession. (A growth recession is a rate of growth insufficient to prevent
capacity utilisation from falling and unemployment from rising - and seems,
in the G7 context, to occur when total output growth is less than 2 1/2 per
cent per year.) Some of the recession may have been inevitable if, as the
IMF suggests, the G7 began the 1990s with demand too high in relation to
capacity and with a related tendency for inflation to rise. But by 1993
there was a big 'output gap' - meaning downward pressure on inflation and
upward pressure on unemployment.
In the present cycle, output has never fallen absolutely in the G7 countries
as a unit, because the business cycle has - mercifully - not been
synchronised. The English-speaking countries were the first into recession
and also the first out of it. Japan and continental Europe were the last in.
The developing countries, which are growing on average by 5 1/2 to 6 per
cent per year, are now important enough to flourish on their own despite
stagnation in the older industrial world; but they are not yet large enough
to be a locomotive for the G7.
For the G7 as a whole, however, the IMF forecasts imply no shrinkage of the
output gap in 1994 and very little in 1995. Unemployment in the G7, which
has risen from 5.7 per cent in 1990 to an expected peak of 7.4 per cent this
year, is projected to drop only slightly to 7.2 per cent in 1995. Inflation
on the other hand has been moving sharply downwards on average, from a
temporary peak of 4.1 per cent in 1990 to an expected 2.2 per cent in 1994.
The implication of these trends is that nominal GDP is still growing by a
little less than the 5 per cent which would be a reasonable target
consistent with trend growth and minimal inflation.
The main exception to this below-par outlook is the US, where recovery is
vigorous enough and has been going on long enough for the gap to vanish in
the course of this year, and for the main dangers to tilt towards inflation.
The UK is in a different category. There is no chance of the UK output gap
vanishing. But it could shrink quickly enough to make the debate between the
chancellor and the Bank governor switch in the course of this year to
whether and when to raise base rates, rather than whether to cut them.
The very vigorous growth in notes and coins in circulation, apparent from
the British M0 statistics, would by itself be just a straw in the wind. But
it has to be read in conjunction with many other indicators - for instance
the UK Purchasing Managers' Index, which was established in June 1991, and
which rose in April by a record amount to reach a record height. Nor can one
overlook the CBI Databank showing manufacturing pay settlements - not just
overtime and bonuses - turning up in the first quarter of 1994.
The conclusion so far is that policies should still have a modest, if
diminishing, bias towards relaxation in the G7 countries as a whole, but no
longer in the English-speaking ones. Thus any tightening up in the US or
Britain should be more than offset by relaxation in the continental
countries and Japan. Relaxation in the former is still governed by the
glacial unfreezing of German monetary policy.
The more interesting case is Japan. Here the IMF expects the smallest
recovery of all G7 countries - output growth of only 0.7 per cent this year.
Even this is uncertain. Japanese inflation is still barely positive at just
above 1 per cent, when measured conventionally by consumer prices or the GDP
deflator. But producer prices, which are more exposed to international
competition, are down by 2.2 per cent over a year ago. Another measure,
known by the old fashioned name of 'wholesale prices' is down by 3.2 per
cent. The true trend of Japanese nominal GDP is surely stagnant or
downwards. The word 'deflation' is much over-used, but can in truth be
applied to recent Japanese experience.
Nor is it difficult to see where the weakness is coming from. In the
year-and-a-half since the autumn of 1992 the exchange rate index for the yen
has risen by 33 per cent. The chart makes clear that, apart from the last
couple of weeks, it is the yen that has been strong rather than the dollar
that has been weak.
Some commentators will be quick to attribute the high yen either to the
persistent, large Japanese current balance of payments surplus or to
prolonged recession. But this is not too convincing, as currencies have
sometimes been strong, even with current account deficits and rapid domestic
growth - for example the dollar in the mid-1980s. Nor is it easy to find a
monetary explanation. The narrow measures of the Japanese money supply,
while certainly not soaring, have risen faster than the Japanese national
income.
There is probably an element of safe haven about the strength of the yen.
Despite the dollar's recent weakness its underlying trend has been
remarkably stable for a good three years. The same applies to the D-Mark,
despite the upsurge of recent days. But the stability has been that of
mutual weakness. Confidence in the dollar is wobbly, mainly because of an
understandable market doubt about whether the Clinton administration will
back Fed efforts to prevent a re-acceleration of inflation, or whether it
even wants to preserve an anti-inflation Fed.
Most informative among exchange rates - if rarely cited - is the D-Mark
against the yen, which shows a strong downward trend, despite a modest
contrary movement since the middle of April. It is also notable that Japan
has suffered much less than other leading countries from the shakeout in
international bond prices.
It is some consolation that the US Treasury has called off its campaign for
a higher yen and has declared - to the surprise of some financial observers
 -that it does not want a lower dollar after all. Unfortunately the recent
intervention has been taken at too high a yen level.
Nevertheless it is now up to the Japanese to take further measures to expand
demand and curb the appreciation of their currency. There have already been
several stimulatory fiscal packages; and short-term interest rates are down
to 1 per cent. In the context of the present international action, it may be
worth trying unsterilised intervention to bring down the yen and
simultaneously boost the Japanese money supply. If such efforts were blessed
by a sufficiently convincing G7 consensus it is difficult to suppose that
they would utterly fail. But in the not so last resort it might still be
worth dropping yen notes from helicopters or burying them in the ground for
private enterprise to reclaim.

Politics is big on the airwaves tonight. The BBC has a comprehensive
coverage of today's UK local government elections at 11.30pm, and Channel 4
(9pm) looks at Russia's first free parliamentary election last year in
Moscow Central, part of the Bite the Ballot series.
Producer Clive Gordon won a 1993 BAFTA for his investigation of Bosnia, but
this time he goes for the bizarre. He focuses on three candidates competing
to represent Moscow: one has to prove his sanity to be declared a candidate;
another is reckoned to be a local mobster; and a third, an exiled
millionaire, can only return to Russia because he is standing for
parliament.
With crime such a hot issue, the vigilante is becoming a popular hero. In
Taking Liberties (BBC 2, 8pm), Polly Toynbee asks whether juries are too
lenient in cases in which citizens take matters into their own hands so
enthusiastically that innocent people die as a consequence.
At last, the cricket team in Outside Edge (ITV, 8.30pm) gets to play a
match. Richard Harris' play has been running out of steam of late but this
should be a happy climax.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Arts: Cosi in concert - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 82, Sir Georg Solti conducted Mozart's Cosi fan tutte with unabated verve
on Tuesday at the Royal Festival Hall. For this concert performance
(repeated tonight), the musical circumstances were particularly happy: an
international cast of youngish singers with rich experience in their roles,
and a small band who could make Mozart's orchestral inspirations tell
without covering the voices.
The result was pretty much pure delight. Solti set a cracking pace, and
after the Royal Opera's recent Figaro, it was bracing to hear Mozart's
recitatives rattling along as they should. A pair of Italians in the cast
was an enormous help, and in the roles where it matters most: chattery
Despina and the cynical philosopher Don Alfonso.
Nothing sounded forced or hard-driven, because Solti's Cosi is coherently
swift - everything in due proportion, judged by one of the most seasoned
pairs of ears in the business. In fact speed was essential, for we were
hearing an unusually full text, and even then Cosi ran on to 11.15 pm.
There were stronger grounds for complaint about the programme-book (Pounds
2) for this costly event (best seats Pounds 42). At a BBC Prom, the full
libretto would have been printed. Here, besides lists of performers, long,
gushing CVs for the singers and a few adverts, we got only a
number-by-number synopsis written for some 1989 performance in which
Ferrando apparently sang only one of his three arias. The book needed urgent
checking against Solti's menu: customers would have liked to know which bits
of Cosi were on offer and there was no excuse for this tacky non-effort. One
had less complaint about hearing only four of the six principals originally
advertised: that is par for the course, and anyhow both the substitutes were
outstanding.
If Frank Lopardo's Ferrando sounded darker and heavier than European ears
expect from a Mozart tenor, he was faultlessly intelligent and stylish. As
for his compatriot Renee Fleming, her Fiordiligi is by current standards
already world-class: sensitive, gorgeously varied in tone and attack, rising
to a noble 'Per pieta'. Anne Sophie von Otter sings a delectable, resinous
Dorabella, skittish and funny.
The real Italians are Michele Pertusi's cultivated, saturnine philosopher,
and Adelina Scarabelli's bright Despina - in a slatternly little black
number, peasant-style: Northern European sopranos never hit that earthy
vein. Olaf Baer's knowingly winsome Guglielmo veers between two stools; when
intimate and velvety he falls short of operatic scale, but in virile
frustration he sounds brittle and dry.
The Chamber Orchestra of Europe fulfilled every expectation. They fielded
period-trumpets, which scored unexpectedly sharp and rewarding points; their
horns looked fairly battered too, but modern or not they delivered their
fearsome 'Per pieta' obbligati with credit. This Solti/COE collaboration is
going to stay in the mind for a long time.

INNOCENT MOVES (PG) Steven Zaillian
THE PAPER (15) Ron Howard
WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE? (12) Lasse Hallstrom
MY FATHER THE HERO (PG) Steve Miner
We all know why we love Hollywood, when we do not bow to intellectual dogma
and say we hate it: because the place is determined to turn the mundane into
the magical. Look at Innocent Moves, a film about a father-child
relationship tested by the boy's rise as a chess prodigy. And even when the
transformation does not quite work - listen for the sound of creaking
corsetry and snapping stays as The Paper inflates the journalist's life into
a melodrama the size of Mr Blobby - we love Hollywood for its urge to risk
all in pursuit of the grand and passionate.
I have just come back from the place and can testify that nothing has
changed. Little can dent Tinseltowners' up-and-at-em nature: not
earthquakes, nor murders, nor smog, nor the worst post-Oscars famine of good
American movies I can remember. Topping the box office was - ultimate
humiliation for non-limeys - a British film: the romantic comedy Four
Weddings And A Funeral, opening here next week.
So what has happened to the men and women lost in self-congratulation only a
month ago, when Schindler's List swept a quality Oscars night? Looking for
fresh directions and fresh directors - while staying true to the myth-making
spirit. One Oscar winner, Schindler screenwriter Steven Zaillian, has got
behind a camera and made Innocent Moves: a film so good that it did only
medium business in the US under the over-enterprising name Searching For
Bobby Fischer. This title recklessly assumed familiarity with Fischer's name
in a country where many people have not heard of Arthur Miller, Einstein or
the Pope.
The plot is plain. Seven-year-old Josh, played by real-life chess prodigy
Max Pomeranc, rises from early promise outwitting chess hustlers in New
York's Washington Square to a will-he-won't-he finale in which he faces the
reigning champ. But the drama is less in the climax than in all that goes
before. Zaillian moves the characters themselves around like thinking chess
pieces. Joe Mantegna is kindly-bullying Dad, charging forward or sideways
like a chutzpah-fortified castle. Ben Kingsley is Josh's European teacher,
zigzagging in crafty knight moves. And imperious Robert Stephens, the
rival's mentor, drawls in bishop-like diagonals across every crowded room.
Some Copland-ish music by James Horner reminds us how close this film could
have been to pure American corn. But intelligence keeps outflanking mere
inspirationalism. Zaillian knows when to hasten his story with montage
sequences, pasting-and-scissoring whole weeks or months in speedy scrapbooks
of images. And he knows when to slow to one perfect, glowing image: like the
close-ups of Pomeranc (excellent), sitting luminous in thought over his
chequered battleground.
Newspaper buildings, as we all know who work in them, are orderly places
full of crisp business suits and calm, incisive decision-making. But what is
a newspaper office in a Hollywood movie? To judge by The Paper - idiotically
enjoyable even when idiotic - it is something between the bridge of the
Titanic and the last days of Pompeii.
Michael Keaton, city editor of the New York Sun, needs a crisis a day to
keep his adrenalin going. So writers David and Stephen Koepp and director
Ron Howard (Backdraft, Far And Away) decide to test him with an overdose.
What about three crises? In the morning and evening our baby-faced perpetuum
mobile must deal with a miscarried justice story about two young blacks
wrongly arrested for a shooting. In the afternoon he has a job interview at
the snooty New York Sentinel (read New York Times). And throughout the day
his wife Marisa Tomei is in the last stages of pregnancy.
This New York could exist only in Hollywood. But the advantage of
over-egging a pudding is that no one can complain about the quality of the
eggs. Dome-pated Robert Duvall sizzles away as Keaton's editor, whose own
panjandrum of crises includes an estranged daughter and a 'prostate the size
of a bagel.' There is Randy Quaid, hardboiled hack par excellence. And there
is the toughest egg of all, assistant editor Glenn Close. She insists on
'rolling the presses' - cue trembling floorboards and San Andreas sound
effects in the upstairs newsroom - before Keaton has made his final dash to
the cop shop for that clinching piece of police evidence for his 'They
didn't do it' story.
Add a fight and another shooting and by the last reel almost everyone is
being carried off in an ambulance. But in Hollywood this is what they think
of as real life. No day goes by there without the sweet music of
emergency-service sirens. The Paper has nothing to do with the New York
newspaper business, everything to do with the nerves of a city where a day
without make-or-break news is counted a day lost.
The whimsical, under-energised What's Eating Gilbert Grape? demonstrates
another truth about America's movie capital. Hollywoodites believe that once
you step outside Los Angeles time stands still. The entire country - this
film is set in Endora, Iowa - consists of hicks, hillbillies and the
handicapped, frozen in American Gothic postures. Strike that frown: clasp
that pitchfork: chew, if possible, that cornstalk.
Here is stalk-chewing Johnny Depp, who divides his days between tending his
oversize Momma - 'Did yer ever see a beached whale on television?' is how he
describes her to strangers - and saving his mentally retarded brother
Leonardo DiCaprio from suicidal escapades. DiCaprio keeps climbing the town
water tower, to the distress of Depp and the enthusiastic curiosity of
undertaker Crispin Glover. Then a girl floats into town. She is Juliette
Lewis, a trailer waif with a line in mystical repartee. Show her a sky and
she will quaver 'So-o limitless]' Which boy, if either, will she enchant or
ensnare? Screenwriter Peter Hedges, adapting his own novel, must have been
force-fed Carson McCullers as a child. Archness and bucolic surrealism
reign, though McCullers herself would have ensured there was some muscle
under the mimsy mythopoeia.
But better Gilbert Grape than My Father The Hero. This time Hollywood takes
an even larger step outside its own borders and an even smaller step
imaginatively. Remake a recent French movie. Hire the same star, Gerard
Depardieu, to play the jealous father holidaying with his nubile daughter on
a paradise isle. Have the daughter pretend that Dad is her ageing boyfriend.
And then sit back to watch the film nosedive at the box office. Deservedly
too. For the original film's slender wit and charm, read the Disney Studio
stomping across the sand in size-12 schmaltz-boots.
Hollywood could not, of course, get to the all-French-made Germinal, also
starring Depardieu. But unfortunately neither could I. I returned from
Lotusland on Sunday to find that the press show, like that for M. Butterfly,
had happened last week. Watch for both in next week's space.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Arts: A misguided 'Weekend' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of Michael Palin's first play, The Weekend, feels just like a TV
sitcom; and there's the rub. The TV sitcom gives us the same sit., milked
for the same kind of com., week in, week out. Audiences know the way they
will laugh, and love the way it caters to their expectations.
In particular, they know how they will laugh at One Foot in the Grave; and
The Weekend is principally a vehicle for that series's star, Richard Wilson,
giving him a not dissimilar role (Stephen) with not dissimilar humour. The
basic sit. here is one we have all watched umpteen times - the relatives
come for the weekend, the neighbours come for dinner, the family plays
Scrabble - and most of the jokes lie in the sarcasm and ill temper displayed
by Stephen, the reluctant host.
This is Comedy of Vituperation. (One scene begins with Stephen saying, about
the impending arrival of his own daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter,
'Maybe the A37 will have been mined by the Iraqis'.) Some touches are
uniquely Palin. I love Charlotte (Joanna Forest), the cleaning-lady who
prides herself on her left-wing credentials. Of her late mother she says
'She knew all the Fabians; she ironed for Rebecca West.' But Charlotte is
the only character with the comic bizarrerie we associate with Palin; and we
only see her once. Like so much else here, she is introduced for instant
comic effect, and then forgotten.
How disappointing to find the author of A Fish Called Wanda and A Private
Function writing so conventional a comedy; and so creakily constructed a
play. Act One has too many separate scenes, and some of them have no
dramatic substance - just jokes. Of course I laughed at some of the lines -
eg Stephen's Coward-like description of his wife's bitter lemon: 'Spinstery
little poison; it reeks of disapproval'  - but the comic rhythm built up by
a succession of one-liners is wearisome.
There is, mind you, a twist. After two hours of increasingly unpleasant
bile, Stephen lowers his defences to his wife, and reveals why he is so
nasty (Palin trying to dig deeper than sitcom.) But Stephen's justification
 -the classic self-loathing of the alcoholic - emerges with no great
struggle. In the play's final scene (the next morning) Stephen has already
begun to make the tea - ie to reform. How neat; how cosy.
There is, of course, real daring in the way Wilson never plays for
sweetness, making so much of his own venom. And he negotiates the switch
from aggression into confessional with exemplary tact. He is almost a comic
Jimmy Porter; or a cousin of Basil Fawlty. Yet he is less substantial a
character; too obviously johnny-one-note. Angela Thorne, as his
longsuffering classy wife Virginia, is pleasant without ever attempting
anything we have not seen her achieve before.
Marcia Warren does wonders with the neighbour Bridget. 'I love York,' she
says bravely over drinks , and adds a little forced smile. 'Terribly,
terribly . . . historical. Harrogate's very nice too.' Jonathan Coy handles
the embarrassment of the son-in-law Alan extremely well and Julie Peasgood
is gamely amiable as daughter Diana, the play's dullest role. Robin Lefevre,
directing, has achieved fine ensemble and pacing. The comedy moves jerkily
from joke to joke - and too smoothly past its confessional climax - but
that, alas, is its playwright's fault.
At the Strand Theatre, WC2

FT  05 MAY 94 / Arts: Burrows back in form - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For admirers of Jonathan Burrows the question has been what he would do
next. Of his talent there has never been doubt. From his apprentice
creations, then in pieces made for the Royal Ballet's touring company, then
in independent stagings, Burrows' choreographic style moved from
folk-influenced energy to something magnificently awkward, uncompromising.
His most assured works - Hymns, Stoics, rainy morning spoke of a creator
fascinated by mute suffering. The controlled ferocity of their language,
with harsh stampings and contortions of the body, was also compassionate.
Burrows saw lives that were a stifled cry of pain, and his movement, wild,
autistic, sometimes very funny, provided an exact parallel without
descending into mimicry.
His last piece, Very, made over a year ago, I found too cussed, too
uncommunicative. He had painted himself into a creative corner, and the
question about Our was whether he had escaped from these difficult confines.
I saw Our on Tuesday night at The Place, and record with pleasure that
Burrows has freed himself. Movement is fluid, structure more relaxed in
outline and broader in dynamic range.
The theme is Burrows' continuing fascination with the human condition. But
it would be as useful as trying to describe the actions of a crowd, as to
give coherent account of what I saw. Burrows quotes Baudelaire as an
epigraph: 'To express at once the attitude and the gesture of living beings,
whether solemn or grotesque, and their luminous explosion in space'.
This is what Burrows does after his own fashion: the anonymous arena of The
Place, grey with a white back-drop. Four women (Lynne Bristow and Deborah
Jones - Burrows' fine Royal Ballet colleagues; Susana Garcia, Fionuala
Power) and two men (Edwin Lung, Henry Montes). Ravishing clothes from Issey
Miyake (grey trousers, jackets, vests; exquisite cut; subtle pleating: new
dance has never been better dressed). Fine lighting from Tina McHugh. Faint,
evocative burblings and tickings as accompaniment from Matteo Fargion.
The dance curves and surges through the bodies, pivots at arm or shoulder,
drives onward in kicks, draws the cast together or separates them. We see
encounters that hint at loving, hating, battling, consoling. There are
mysterious journeys, recapitulations - people live trapped in emotional
tape-loops - and ventures into darkness, quests for light. Burrows' dance is
both camera and x-ray, recording and revealing: how couples love, how they
depend upon each other and battle with each other; what age can do to body
and to companionship. All this we can sense through the movement. Burrows'
dance is pure yet eloquent: there can be no greater accolade.
The piece lasts just under an hour (hence Our). It is admirably crafted,
tremendously danced. Lynne Bristow was notably fine as a classical dancer at
Covent Garden. She is shown here as a superlative exponent - none better -
of the new dance: speed, clarity, amazing rhythmic virtuosity, all are hers.
The other members of the cast are no less convincing, and fascinating as
personalities. How well we seem to know them as the piece ends.
The Place until May 7, then to the Roedean Theatre as part of the Brighton
Festival on May 14, 15.

</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A wide ranging boardroom reshuffle at ICI Australia
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
which is 63 per cent owned by ICI - has seen the replacement of Bruce
Vaughan, 66, as chairman by Colin Short, below, 59, ICI's finance director
until December 1993.
The move reflects ICI's desire to take much closer control over its
operations in the important high-growth Asia-Pacific region.
Moreover, it is an acknowledgement that there will be a change in the
strategy pursued by ICI Australia, which has not concentrated on its core
businesses to the extent that ICI overall has.
Vaughan, who has been chairman for the relatively short period of 13 months,
is a rounded businessman, only one of whose interests is ICI Australia, said
ICI.
'He has gone because ICI Australia is being aligned with ICI. Short's
appointment as chairman reflects the enhanced significance of ICI Australia
following the demerger of (drugs company) Zeneca in 1993,' added the company
yesterday.
Short, 60, joined ICI's board in 1990. He became deputy chairman of ICI
Australia in January this year. He is now to be replaced in that role by Ben
Lochtenberg, 63, an Australian who retired as chairman of ICI America last
summer.
At the same time, Chris Hampson, 62, has resigned as a director of ICI
Australia following his retirement as an executive director of ICI.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Technology: Science sans sanctions - Matthew Curtin
continues a series on collaborative research by looking at the effect of
political change in South Africa on a state-owned research body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the African National Congress's victory in last week's historic
election, South Africa's new government has plenty on its hands. Preserving
and redirecting science and technology resources may not be high on its
priority list just now, but in the longer term, this will be vital in
regenerating the economy and raising living standards for the black
population.
The task is huge because policy in this area - no other African country
south of the Sahara has such large science and technology resources - was
biased for so long in favour of a white minority government. This recruited
the private sector in its costly nuclear bomb-building programme and to
match Soviet military hardware for the wars in Angola and Mozambique. These
efforts, added to dubious research with a racial bias aimed at underpinning
segregationist policy and strategic projects such as the development of
synthetic fuel technology, had limited success.
As political change drew near, a forum of government, business, trade union
and community groups made progress in devising a new science and technology
initiative. A central role was played by the state-owned Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research.
The CSIR reorganised itself in a way that transformed its relationship with
business and government. A report by the Canada-based International
Development and Research Centre concluded that the CSIR 'has conducted what
has probably been the most thorough re-evaluation undertaken by any
governmentally-created research organisation in the country'.
The IDRC was commissioned by the ANC to investigate science and technology
policy. The report says the CSIR was restructured 'along up-to-date lines to
equip itself to play a leading role in the quest to make a post-sanctions
South Africa' internationally competitive in a number of fields.
Brian Clark, CSIR president, says the attitude in South Africa until the
late 1980s was that government was responsible for scientific research,
especially high-risk projects which should be fully funded from the public
purse. The approach of 'science for science's sake', with research and
development unfettered by industrial strategy, mirrored that of governments
in the US and UK.
The CSIR, however, could see how East Asian countries had moved swiftly to
the forefront of industrial activity - without a well-developed science base
 -through mastery of new technology. It therefore set out to learn the
'business' of R&amp;D. 'The measure of our success would be the ability to win
funding for our research and place products in the market, rather than the
amount of work our researchers published,' Clark says.
The CSIR earned 60 per cent of its R418m (Dollars 121m) turnover in 1993
from contract income compared with about 15 per cent in 1987. Since 1990,
the CSIR's re-organisation has been spurred by factors outside its control,
not least the steady reduction in defence spending, as South Africa's
military commitments declined after the withdrawal from Angola and the ANC's
unbanning.
The government has continued to invest in capacity building but the CSIR has
focused on providing a 'strict client contract service'. Half the contracts
derived from the private sector last year, with the rest spread equally
between defence and other government departments.
The relationship between the CSIR and AECI, the Anglo American-owned
chemicals supplier, demonstrates the old and new styles of the council's
relationship with industry. The CSIR is proud of the joint development with
AECI of a high-yield lysine, an amino acid and ingredient in animal feed,
which resulted in a new R300m plant.
However, AECI bought the bio-technology from the CSIR in 1989 after the
research group tried and failed to interest other parties in South Africa in
what was a research-driven exercise which had reached only an embryonic
stage. Frank Fisher, group research and development manager at AECI, says
the CSIR lysine required more work for it to be commercially viable but the
core research had been done.
Fisher says the relationship between the two groups is now less ad hoc. Four
projects are in development, based on proposals from the CSIR whose lack of
engineering and commercial expertise is offset by academic excellence. 'We
can't do all the work ourselves, so collaboration is vital at the stage
where projects are yet to reach the market.'
The CSIR's relationship with the mining industry has also changed with the
1993 merger of the Chamber of Mines Research Organisation, an
industry-funded research body, to form the group's new mining technology
division. Under pressure from falling commodity prices, the mining houses
decided it was more efficient to buy research for individual needs rather
than fund a co-operative effort. 'The CSIR maintains links with the Chamber
of Mines but there is no guarantee we will win industry contracts unless we
come up with ideas which complement the mines' own research efforts,' Clark
says.
The IDRC stresses that although the CSIR has done well in its collaboration
with industry, its efforts at providing technological support for small
business and community development lack momentum, a criticism the CSIR
admits is valid. Clark says the group will have to devote more of its
resources to these sectors, although its contracts with the emerging black
small-business sector account for nearly a fifth of sales and is the fastest
growing part of the CSIR's work.
The group must provide technology for the small-business sector to meet
community needs while retaining its main corporate role. 'The biggest
tension we face is grappling with the massive and legitimate demands on a
new government for the most basic services - housing, water, electricity -
but as the focus shifts from promise to delivery, we're confident anyone who
can help deliver will be co-opted, not neglected.'

FT  05 MAY 94 / People: Durham Business School gets Tony Cockerill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At last it has become clear why Tony Cockerill, the former deputy director
who has been in charge of Manchester Business School for the past two years,
did not want his contract renewed after July. He has other plans - including
going off to be director of Durham University Business School from October
this year.
The Manchester school was more than a little coy about Cockerill's future,
when it announced two weeks ago that it was looking urgently for a new head.
It then gave the clear impression that Cockerill might stay on in some
subordinate role. That possibility is now scotched, with the news he is in
fact defecting across the Pennines to a smaller and somewhat aggressive
rival.
Cockerill, 52, is an economist who has advised House of Commons select
committees on nationalised industries, trade and industry, and Scottish
affairs.
He stepped into the breach at Manchester after Tom Cannon and his board of
private sector advisers fell out with the university over autonomy and left
en masse.

FT  05 MAY 94 / People: Accountant takes over as UK's biggest publican at
Bass Taverns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bass, Britain's largest brewer, has decided to turn its Australian-born
finance director into Britain's biggest publican.
Philip Bowman, 41, is to take over as chairman of Bass Taverns which is
responsible for its 4,200 pubs and 120 Toby restaurants.
Bass is using the forthcoming retirement of Charles Darby, chairman of Bass
Taverns and Bass Leisure, and Jimmy Angles, chief executive of Bass Taverns,
to rejuvenate its increasingly elderly top management team.
Apart from Bowman, right, who will combine the job of chairman and chief
executive of Bass Taverns, Iain Napier, 45, is adding the job of chief
executive of Bass Leisure to his current role as Bass's head of personnel.
Napier will also join the Bass executive committee.
Bowman, who joined the group in 1985 as finance director of Bass Leisure,
takes charge of Bass's biggest profit centre at a critical time in the
group's fortunes.
Napier started his working life with publishers William Collins. Before
joining Bass in 1989 he had stints with Whitbread and Ford.
Whilst profits from brewing are expected to grow slowly over the next few
years, the growth potential from the pub retailing side is considerable if
the group can reposition itself.
City analysts speculate that if Bowman makes a success of his new job he
would be an obvious candidate to take over as chief executive if Ian
Prosser, 50, were to split the role of chairman and chief executive.
Bowman is far and away the youngest member of the board and his promotion
comes 18 months after the sudden departure of Peter Sherlock, one of the
rising stars on the Bass board. Sherlock, 48, is now chief executibe of NFC.
There was some surprise yesterday that Bass had announced Bowman's move
without naming his successor as finance director.
However, analysts noted that David Nash, Grand Metropolitan's finance
director, had also moved into an operational role before his replacement had
been found.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Technology: All fingers and thumbs - The search for a
machine that reads prints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A tussle is going on in the UK government over the politically sensitive
issue of whether to bring in identity cards to tackle social security fraud.
On one side is the Department of Social Security, which opposes such a move
for the millions of social security claimants. On the other is the
government's efficiency unit, which has just gained the support of the
Treasury for its view in favour of identity cards.
The Treasury's influence could be decisive in paving the way for the issue
of cards. But whoever wins the argument, the search will go on for a
foolproof biometric system of data access and cash and benefits
dispensation. This is a system where a single body measurement, say a
fingerprint, will suffice to identify a claimant and so authorise a payment.
Thorn Secure Systems, part of Thorn-EMI of the UK, and Electronic Data
Systems, the information technology subsidiary of General Motors of the US,
are thought to be the frontrunners for welfare identity cards in Britain.
They and others are believed to have offered various systems, including
watermarks, handscans and fingerprints. All, however, would be linked to
cards in some way - either swipe cards or smart cards.
The problems with fingerprints are threefold: no one applies the same
pressure twice; the angle of approach is always different; and scratches,
cuts and scar tissue contaminate the print.
This leads to an unacceptable level of false rejections and false
acceptances. False acceptances can mean fraud; while false rejections can
mean frustration - with a machine denying that you are who you say you are.
The only fingerprint recognition system in operation over the past year is
in Los Angeles County, for the welfare department's general relief scheme.
Recently, it was extended to cover aid to families with dependent children.
Well over 100,000 families are involved.
Lisa Nunnez, the welfare department's head of computer services, claims the
system, from software consultancy EDS, will save the county tens of millions
of dollars each year. But she agrees that it is only 95 per cent effective,
even though prints are taken from two fingers.
This level of failure is probably too high for the UK, where there is a
great aversion to identification cards of any kind. Cards linked to
fingerprinting are a particular anathema, conjuring up images of criminal
activity and a police state.
Now, however, Harry Takhar of Jasper Consulting in Bemidji, Minnesota has
made an extraordinary claim for a fingerprint biometric system, which may
have cut the mistakes to an acceptable level.
The problem is speed. To be useful in the real world, recognition must take
only fractions of a second. Human fingerprint experts are adept at matching
'cold' prints with samples held in a fingerprint library, but they take
minutes if not hours to complete a match. Computers are fast but cannot
approach human pattern-recognition abilities.
Takhar is enthusiastic about the way his system solves the problem. Prints
are scanned raster-fashion, the way a television picture is built up, and
the result processed to present a clean image. Elements of the print -
distance from the core to the periphery, the numbers of whorls and arches
and so on - are then calculated.
Takhar describes this in terms of a child's join-the-dots picture. The
fingerprint image represents the completed picture, the calculations place
the dots in the picture. It is then possible to calculate a unique number
from the position of the dots. Combined with other information - a social
security number, for example - a 64-element number can be constructed which
is unique to a particular fingerprint.
Comparison with a reference number for the individual takes only a fraction
of a second. Only the unique number is stored for each claimant; there is no
need to maintain politically sensitive files of fingerprints.
Takhar says his product cost Pounds 1m to develop. It combines the
techniques of 'neural networking' - high-speed computing similar to the way
some researchers believe the human brain operates - and 'fuzzy logic', which
allows answers between 'true' and 'false'.
These techniques are well understood. But eyebrows may be raised at Takhar's
claim that, in volume, he can sell a complete system, hardware and software,
for Dollars 300.
According to Brian Maitland Reynell, government services director of EDS:
'Takhar has contacted us. My technical people are very sceptical. Biometrics
is a very small world, and it seems highly unlikely that this man's system
would not have been heard of.
'They feel the mathematical probabilities are against him. However, we are
certainly prepared to take a look. We
would need to take the thing
apart and examine everything thoroughly.'
David Arnold, business development and marketing director at Thorn's
transaction (security card) division, says the same. 'Our technical people
have heard from him and have done a preliminary test, but they
would need to have a much closer look.'
Takhar shrugs off the derision. 'We expected disbelief. But we have got
international patents in place and now want to market our product.'
Asked why companies are not beating a path to his door, he replies: 'They
are. We only finalised the product last November and we wanted to make the
product known to the public before we approached the big companies.'
Takhar may be deluding himself, but as Reynell says: 'Stranger things have
happened. We are definitely interested in checking out the system.'

FT  05 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Card game with much
to play for - Banks may be victims of their own rules on issuing plastic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE WORTHINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the basis that there is no such thing as a free lunch, the credit card
car discounts offered by Ford and General Motors in the UK must seem to many
people too good to be true. But consumers who choose their credit card well
and use it wisely can come out ahead of the game because of the peculiar
features of the credit card market.
Even after playing one dealer off against another in negotiations, GM and
Ford card holders can get a further healthy discount on the purchase of a
new car. This win-win situation has arisen because of the way the banks have
structured the credit card industry and organised its economics, possibly to
their own eventual detriment.
The structure of the industry is built around the two leading worldwide
credit card associations, Visa and MasterCard. They are 'owned' by the banks
that helped to establish them or subsequently joined them when they realised
the potential profitability of the market.
Membership of the card associations was originally restricted to banks but
competitive pressures led MasterCard in particular to relax its membership
criteria. It is still the case that only banks can become full members.
The card associations determine the procedures by which credit card
transactions are reconciled between card issuers, facilitate the
transmission of transaction information and set the fallback position on
pricing arrangements between card issuers, in the event of them being unable
to reach bilateral agreements.
The crucial element in this calculation is the so-called issuer
reimbursement fee (or interchange). This is an ad valorem amount paid on
every transaction by the bank that acquires these from the merchant, to the
bank that issued the card. The interchange rate on credit card transactions
varies between 1 per cent and 1.3 per cent, so that for a purchase of Pounds
100, between Pounds 1 and Pounds 1.30 is paid by the merchant where the
transaction took place to the acquirer bank, to be then passed on to the
issuing bank - where this is a different institution.
The acquiring bank requires recompense for the activities it undertakes; the
total cost to the merchant of a credit card transaction (including the
interchange rate) is called the merchant service charge and this is now an
average of around 1.7 per cent of the value of the card transaction.
The card association rules currently decree that only association members -
for which read banks - can be card transaction acquirers. The rewards are
particularly juicy for the banks that are large issuers and acquirers for
they handle many 'on-us' payments, where the acquired transaction is on
their issued card: here the merchant service charge can be allocated between
the acquirer and issuer sides of the bank, according to internal policies.
The four main clearing banks are believed to have more than 80 per cent of
the total combined issuing and acquiring market.
It is, however, the high level of interchange that has attracted the new
non-bank entrants to the credit card market, while dissuading a prominent
merchant, Marks and Spencer, from accepting Visa or MasterCard transactions.
For new entrants such as GM and Ford who can persuade their credit
cardholders to maximise spending on their credit cards, as indeed they must
to build up their car purchase rebate value, then as card issuers but not
acquirers they stand to receive a substantial and ongoing income stream
through the interchange arrangement. The income stream is activated as soon
as their credit cards are used by holders, whereas the rebates they offer
may well be cashed in some years into the future.
Added to this will be income paid to them under their agreement with their
issuing banks, HFC and Barclays respectively, as a proportion of interest
paid on cardholders' outstanding debt and on other card-related
income-generating activities, such as cash advances, credit card loss
protection, payment protection, fees for late payment and so on.
While such income does not entirely cover the rebate value accumulated by
their credit cardholders, it goes some considerable way towards offsetting
it. Who knows just how many rebates may not be cashed.
No wonder then that non-banks have sought to enter the credit card market
and that they can afford to offer cards with low APRs, no annual fees and
added-value features.
No wonder also that Marks and Spencer will continue not to accept Visa or
MasterCard credit cards or Amex or Diners charge cards and that other big
multiple retailers are thought to have been reconsidering their options on
this matter.
In an era of shrinking retail margins, but increasing spending through
credit cards, the proportion of the 1 to 1.3 per cent interchange not taken
by the card issuer can look very attractive.
Why are the card associations so reluctant to allow non-banks to become
members and why has the interchange rate been increased in recent years? The
answers lie in the banks' dual desires to protect their equity in the card
associations, while simultaneously milking that investment for cash, through
the interchange system.
The equity value of the card associations is unknown, but potentially
enormous, given their dominance of card-based payment systems worldwide. The
admission of non-banks as members would both dilute that equity and throw
into doubt the sustainability of the interchange charge, certainly at its
present rate.
Unfortunately for the banks, the consequences of not allowing non-banks to
join the card associations are potentially even more dangerous.
The car manufacturers and retailers have learnt that having a credit card
relationship with a customer is a key to wider and deeper relationships,
perhaps even to provide other financial services.
The GM and Ford credit cards offer those car manufacturers a regular,
justifiable and personal way to communicate with their cardholders via the
monthly statement.
By also using information from the cardholders' application form and by
monitoring their spending patterns, a great deal can be learnt about those
customers and their product and service needs.
Marks and Spencer's own credit card base has been the starting point for its
other incursions into financial services, Peps, personal loans and now
insurance and pensions.
Because of their narrow view of the profitability of credit cards and
failure to see the potential for wider relationship building, the banks have
often left their credit cards as standalone operations.
By either encouraging or allowing the interchange rate to be increased
disproportionately to the total amount of the merchant service charge, the
banks have made the issue of credit cards so economically attractive that
non-banks have seen how they can make money on the operation of a credit
card and build a card base that can be cross-sold with other products and
services.
Truly the banks are in great danger of being hoist by their own petard.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): It's all in the name
 -Why Heinz and McVitie's are putting new emphasis on their brands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the coming weeks television viewers will see a subtle shift in the way a
number of leading consumer products are advertised in the UK. Instead of
emphasising the identities of the products themselves, manufacturers' own
names will be far more prominent than in recent years.
The move is part of the fightback by brand-owners against retailers'
own-label goods. It is also an attempt to consolidate expensive television
advertising behind just one message, rather than fragmenting it across the
promotion of numerous individual items.
Food companies Heinz and McVitie's are taking this route, while also
stepping up their direct marketing and promotion activities to reach
consumers with details of specific products.
Heinz, which currently spends an estimated Pounds 12m a year on television
advertising of individual products, including beans, soup and sauces, will
switch this money into supporting the main brand on television. The precise
nature of the commercials has still to be decided, but it is likely that
future campaigns will concentrate on what are seen to be fundamental Heinz
'values'.
The company has already used this approach with poster advertising, with an
umbrella campaign emphasising high nutritional content, lack of artificial
ingredients, and affordability.
With 300 products - around twice the number the company had a decade ago -
Heinz says it is increasingly difficult to promote individual lines through
mainstream advertising. Even tomato ketchup is no longer a straightforward
sell, as there are now half a dozen varieties.
This is where direct marketing can play its part, says Heinz, which is
planning a substantial investment in the direct targeting of particular
groups of consumers to promote individual products.
Lawrence Balfe, Heinz marketing director, says: 'While we remain totally
committed to advertising, with mainstream advertising expenditure staying at
current levels, we will be putting additional funds into our direct
communication activities. We see the direct link with our loyal consumers as
an essential means of developing our consumer franchise.'
The approach has already been successful over the last couple of years for
baby foods, the company claims, which represent a particularly tough
marketing challenge.
McVitie's direct contact with consumers will include a big free sample
drive, covering about 25 per cent of the UK population, and forms part of a
Pounds 20m push this year to strengthen the brand name.
For the first time in recent years McVitie's UK, the United Biscuits
subsidiary, is concentrating its advertising on the overall brand. An Pounds
8m TV campaign will cover four products: Digestive, Homewheat, Hob Nobs, and
Riva biscuits. Together they accounted for about Pounds 140m of McVitie's UK
turnover last year. The four brands will feature in the advertisements but
will not overshadow the McVitie's name.
A further Pounds 10m will be spent on in-store promotions and sampling,
while Pounds 1.5m will be spent on redesigning packaging to increase the
size of the McVitie's logo. The moves represent 'a fundamental change to the
McVitie's strategy,' says Andy Rush, marketing director. 'There is a clear
recognition in the business that our strongest asset is the McVitie's brand
and therefore all investment will be directed towards it in the future.'
United Biscuits, which has 44 per cent of the UK biscuit market, saw profits
on UK biscuits fall 10 per cent last year, before exceptionals, to Pounds
83.8m. This is partly attributable to a sharp increase in the cost of raw
materials, but the fact that McVitie's has had to trim margins is an
indication of the price pressure the company is under.
The pressure is coming from rival biscuit brands as well as retailers'
own-label products. Rush argues that smaller competitors' only strategic
option has been to compete on price. 'The key for us is not to follow them
down that route, but to maintain a quality stance in the marketplace,' he
says. Ensuring that advertising messages about the brand are not
inconsistent or dissipated among a whole range of products is central to
that strategy.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Accountancy Column: Industry's cost-cutting pains US firms -
KPMG's attempts to cope with the malaise which still exists in the sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If accounting firms in the developed world have had a tough time of it so
far in the 1990s, then those in the US have suffered more than most. And if
you were to pick a firm that exemplifies the pain of the past four years or
so, you could hardly do better than KPMG Peat Marwick.
In 1993, Peat reported revenues in the US of roughly Dollars 1.8bn, the same
as it has in each of the past four years (the firm's fiscal year runs to the
end of June.)
In real terms, income has been falling at a time when costs have been rising
steadily. To sustain partners' earnings, the firm has slashed partner
numbers during the period by around 20 per cent, to just under 1,500. (It
started culling partners soon after the 1987 merger between Peat Marwick and
Main Hurdman.)
Peat is not alone, of course. Of the US firms, only Arthur Andersen and, to
a lesser degree, Price Waterhouse, have managed to keep a degree of top-line
growth. The products of the late-1980s mega-mergers have suffered more than
most; Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte &amp; Touche have also been forced to cut back
partner numbers, though not to the same degree as Peat.
US accountants blamed the malaise for a long time on their country's early
1990s recession. Such claims have sounded increasingly hollow: the US
economy came out of recession more than two years ago, at first fitfully and
more recently with undeniable vigour. But the fortunes of the accounting
firms have not responded as fast. Their fees have become just one more of
the items that US industry, bent on squeezing out every unnecessary cost,
has put under the microscope.
The experience has been a sobering one. Accounting firms spent much of the
1980s talking about becoming more useful to their customers, and less
reliant on compliance products like doing audits and filling in tax returns.
They are still talking about it - but there is little indication that this
approach has reinjected any growth into the accounting business.
The man with the unenviable job of reinventing Peat in the US is Jon
Madonna. Elected chairman in 1990, he has already presided over a painful
downsizing. He could now be set to lead the firm into the next century. His
51st birthday is today, leaving him plenty of time to serve a second
six-year term as chairman (should he be re-elected) before reaching Peat's
retirement age of 60.
According to Madonna, the turning point has come: 'What we went through in
the last few years was a downsizing. Now, it's a growth strategy.'
If he is right - a big 'if' - the rest of the 1990s will be a more pleasant
time for the accounting firms than the first part of the decade.
The starting point is a difficult one. 'We've got productivity issues, we've
got growth issues, we've got profitability issues. We're no different from
any other industry here,' says Madonna.
The US firms are reeling from the effects of cost-cutting already
undertaken, and have yet to rebuild morale. The cost-cutting is unlikely to
be at an end, though.
Technology has revolutionised the way companies and the investment community
collect and analyse financial information. Accountants have long realised
this, and have struggled to reinvent their role as an intermediary in the
information chain: rather than collectors and collaters of financial
information, they have tried to become interpreters and strategisers.
Yet the cost structures of the big US firms suggest that they have not made
the sort of productivity gains that might be expected from this information
revolution.
Since the middle 1980s, the ratio of partners to professional staff - one of
the best indicators of productivity in any professional partnership - has
hardly budged at several of the biggest firms, at around eight professionals
to each partner. Nor has the ratio of non-professional (largely
administrative) staff fallen. Cutting people has at least lifted the average
revenues per partner, though.
'We're not as good as we should be (at measuring productivity),' admits
Madonna. Productivity may be one of the biggest issues facing the
profession, yet it continues to be overshadowed by an obsession with growth.
Reinvigorating the top line is the first objective of all firms.
Peat's response has been to take a strategy common among all accounting
firms in recent years one step further. 'Industry specialisation' has been
the mantra of the profession for at least a decade. Peat has now elevated it
to become a raison d'etre.
By last summer, the firm had, in the US, scrapped its traditional functional
groups - audit, tax, consulting, and so on - and reorganised itself along
industry lines.
Madonna says: 'We're measuring ourselves by market - we will be able to tell
you how much we generate in financial services, for instance.'
That approach enables the firm to reward its staff according to how well
their particular industry group does. Audit staff, the theory runs, will be
more inclined to think creatively about other services that could help a
customer if their own pay is more closely tied to the outcome.
Does fiddling with organisational structure in this way get to the root
problems of the accounting firms? It is hard to argue against the approach:
if the accounting firms find growth in the future, it must come from selling
new services to their customers. Organising around customers, rather than
around their own functional divisions, is a logical step.
Yet on its own, industry specialisation is not the answer. It did not
prevent the problems of the early 1990s, and is unlikely to be a panacea in
the future.
'On the face of it, it seems a good idea. But the world doesn't
compartmentalise that way, it's too dynamic,' says Bruce Marcus, a
consultant on marketing for professional firms. More seriously, he adds,
accounting firms have still not adapted to the competitive era ushered in as
long ago as 1977, when the ban on advert-ising in the US was first lifted.
There are other, more serious management problems that hang over the
accounting firms, notably the partnership structure itself. Having taken the
first steps in the early 1980s to setting up quasi-corporate governance
arrangements, accounting firms have failed to carry the process to its
logical conclusion.
Madonna makes the most of the partnership system, even going so far as to
suggest that the corporate world has moved closer to the partnership
structure, rather than the other way around.
'A lot of corporate America is trying to manage itself as a partnership,' he
says. He suggests it is 'very much in line with the stock option frenzy'
which has seen companies increasingly offering senior employees an equity
interest.
In reality, though, there is still a huge gulf between the consensual style
of a partnership and the standard corporate management structure. Tackling
this issue remains one of the basic challenges that accounting firms have
shied away from.
If there is a model for the accountants to follow, perhaps it is the US
investment banks. Small partnerships until the 1960s in most cases, they
managed the transition to big, public corporations with spectacular success.
The most profitable of them all, Goldman Sachs, remains a partnership. But
in its strong leadership and management structure, it has far more in common
with a public company than an accounting firm.

collectively lost Pounds 600m in the 1985 tin market collapse, is now being
forced to move home because business is booming.
After a sixfold increase in LME turnover in the past five years the
exchange's premises at Plantation House in the City are now too small. In
the autumn it will move to 56 Leadenhall Street, less than a mile away and
only the third premises the exchange has occupied in its 117-year history.
The Leadenhall Street building, built about 1922, is no more than a shell
and this will enable the LME to install a trading floor and support
facilities tailored to its needs.
The trading floor will be designed to allow for an increase in the number of
members participating in the traditional ring formation, backed by modern
communication booths. For the first time, ring-dealing members will have
private clerical offices behind their booths.
But Mr Raj Bagri, chairman of the LME, stressed yesterday that there would
be no change in the way the exchange operates. 'Our customers are
well-served by the way we trade today,' he said.
Mr David King, chief executive, said the LME had signed a 30-year lease with
five-year break clauses with the Prudential Assurance Company. The break
clauses would enable the LME more flexibility.
'We don't know what lies ahead when technology is changing so fast. But we
believe we will continue to trade the way we are trading today for at least
another 10 years.'
Mr Bagri said the exchange would bear the Pounds 3m to Pounds 3.5m cost of
the move without charging a special levy. He said the Pru had asked for
financial details to be kept secret but, compared with Plantation House, the
LME would be paying less than half the cost per square foot.
British Land, owner of Plantation House, had offered an attractive deal
including extra space. 'But that would have been a compromise,' Mr Bagri
said.
'We can now create everything we need from a shell. The exchange has been
growing fast and we have every confidence that our members can continue to
make it grow in the future.'
The LME is the world's leading futures market for trading in copper, lead,
zinc, primary aluminium, aluminium alloy, nickel and tin. Most world metal
industry supply contracts are based on its official prices.
Turnover is about Dollars 5bn a day, having increased last year turnover by
43 per cent to a record 830m tonnes of metal worth more than Dollars
1,000bn. About 95 per cent of this business comes from outside the UK and 85
per cent of LME members have non-UK parent companies.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Martin Stanbridge of the FT: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Stanbridge, a senior editor on the International Companies pages at
the Financial Times, has died at the age of 41 after a long battle against
cancer.
He was born in South Africa but moved to the UK as a small child with his
family. He obtained a BSc in geography at University College London, before
joining Price Waterhouse as a trainee accountant.
He decided accountancy was not for him and became a trainee journalist on a
London weekly paper, later moving to the now defunct Evening Post-Echo at
Hemel Hempstead, Herts, before joining the FT in 1981 as a UK Companies News
sub-editor. He joined our UK News sub-editing team in 1984 and the
International Companies section as night news editor in 1987, moving to take
responsibility for the section's overseas news page in 1990.
As a journalist, he was a true professional, working with quiet efficiency
to ensure everything he handled attained the highest quality and dealing
with writers, often in far flung corners of the globe, with an appropriate
mixture of tact and firmness.
As a colleague, he was unfailingly kind, courteous and helpful, inclined to
self-deprecation, and widely liked. Outside the office, he was an avid
reader, particularly in art, architecture and history.
He will be much missed.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Textiles aid sparks anger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Textile Confederation yesterday reacted angrily to the European
Commission's approval of Pounds 61m of state aid for a Northern Ireland
textiles plant, saying the industry was already suffering from overcapacity.
'There is just no market for the 30 to 40 per cent increase in British
capacity that the new factory would bring,' said BTC's director-general, Mr
John Wilson. Under-utilisation was running at about 20 per cent in the
European textile industry, he said.
The Pounds 157m Belfast factory for Hualon of Taiwan is the largest project
ever handled by Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board and would
employ 2,000 workers to produce about 23,000 tonnes, of polyester-cotton
fabric a year.
The IDB yesterday welcomed the commission's decision and said it was
optimistic that the project would proceed, although contracts had not yet
been signed.
Hualon is one of the Far East's leading textile manufacturers, with sales of
Pounds 500m in 1992.
Much of the output from the Belfast factory would be for downmarket
garments, about 40 per cent of which are currently imported into Europe. The
company argues that with many European producers having abandoned this
market to switch to higher-quality products, the new factory would be
substituting imports rather than displacing European producers.
However, the BTC says there is 'no proof whatsoever' that Hualon will limit
itself to low-cost products.
'The investment is vast and they are going to have to find a huge market for
such gigantic volumes,' said Mr Wilson. He also disputed the number of jobs
that will be created.
'Up to 2,000 jobs in an area of high unemployment is certainly a compelling
case,' he said. 'But there has been no explanation of where these jobs will
come from. We find Hualon's figures startling in that the factory will be
highly capital intensive.'

FT  05 MAY 94 / Oil and gas output continues to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK production of oil and natural gas continued to rise strongly in the first
quarter of the year, official statistics showed yesterday.
The Department of Trade and Industry reported that petroleum production
totalled 30.4m tonnes, a 30.8 per cent increase over the first quarter of
1993. Natural gas output rose by 16 per cent.
The increase in oil and gas production is a result of new fields coming on
stream and the output build-up from fields which are approaching full
production.
The statistics show that coal production continued to fall, with a 36.5 per
cent reduction recorded in the first quarter compared with the same period
last year. Total energy consumption for the quarter was up by 3.6 per cent.
The rise in oil and gas production, however, comes at a time of weak prices,
with producers reporting a continuing fall in revenues. Royal Bank of
Scotland, for example, recently estimated that UK oil and gas revenues fell
by 6 per cent in March.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Conundrum of Birmingham property market's revival: A city
with a glut of office space cannot meet potential tenants' needs because
they are seeking air-conditioned premises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The commercial property market is poised for recovery. Rents have mostly
stopped falling, tenants are beginning to seek new premises and developers
are dusting down plans for new projects.
No single city is representative of the market as a whole. But many of the
factors driving the nascent recovery are evident in Birmingham. It has a
large number of empty buildings. About 800,000 sq ft of space is vacant in
Birmingham's core out of a total of about 16m sq ft. This year the amount of
empty, central space will rise to more than 1m sq ft as a result of
companies moving.
Paradoxically, there is insufficient space of the right kind to meet
tenants' demands. 'There is a general shortage of good-quality accommodation
of any size,' says Mr Andrew Wilkes, head of facilities and property at
Mercury Communications, which is seeking new premises of 120,000 sq ft in
Birmingham.
Like most other large prospective tenants, Mercury is reluctant to consider
the older buildings without air-conditioning - which make up the bulk of
Birmingham's empty stock of offices.
Modern property is in short supply in Birmingham. Unlike London, it does not
have a glut of space left from developments of the late 1980s. 'Birmingham
did not really benefit from the boom; the rents went up but the buildings
didn't,' says Mr Jon Bellfield, a director of Richardson Barberry, one of
the most active developers in the city.
The difficulty in finding space in Birmingham arises more from a scarcity of
good supply than from a large demand from potential tenants. Demand from
tenants is running at low levels, both because business confidence is
subdued and because of the difficulties of disposing of former premises. But
agents believe that if more buildings were available, there would be more
tenants seeking to move into them.
Richard Ellis says there are half a dozen companies that need more than
100,000 sq ft, although they are not actively looking for buildings because
so little of the right quality is available. A number of bidders for the
National Lottery looked at Birmingham, but were unavailable to find anything
suitable buildings.
The belief that a lack of the right supply has dampened demand is stirring
developers into action. The first speculative scheme is due to start next
month.
This will be the first building of Brindley Place, a 1.1m sq ft scheme close
to the International Convention Centre in the west of the city, outside the
inner ring road. Argent, which has already sold the building to an
institution, has yet to find a tenant, although it has been shortlisted by
Mercury.
The Fountains scheme in central Birmingham has planning consent for 90,000
sq ft of space by Axa Equity &amp; Law, the insurer. Richardson Barberry plans
to start in September on a 58,000 sq ft speculative office scheme in Temple
Street.
Apart from Brindley Place, the largest potential project in central
Birmingham is adjacent to Snow Hill Station, where Speyhawk, a developer
which collapsed last year, had planned a 900,000 sq ft building. British
Rail Property Board and the city's Economic Development Department, the
site's owners, are seeking a new developer.
Problems experienced by property owners in letting obsolescent buildings
provides a powerful incentive for redevelopment. The enthusiasm with which
developers are pursuing their plans begs the question of whether Birmingham
 -which has 3m sq ft of valid planning permits - could end up with an
oversupply of new space that will depress rents.
Mr Andrew Causer, an analyst at brokers James Capel, believes not. He argues
that the development pipeline is not big enough to prevent rents from rising
from their current level of about Pounds 20 per sq ft towards Pounds 25 per
sq ft over the next three years.
Mr Bellfield agrees, pointing out that only cash-rich investors or
institutions are willing to build speculatively. Most developers are anxious
to secure a commitment from a potential tenant before beginning work.
'If everyone with a site started to build tomorrow, that might create an
oversupply, but that is unlikely to happen,' he says.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Ageism payout decision tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Birmingham industrial tribunal will tomorrow decide how much compensation
is due to three workers unfairly dismissed on grounds of age.
The tribunal has already decided that Mr Ray Walker, 62, Mr Larry Nolan, 61,
and Mr Peter Kiddy, 62, were unfairly dismissed by Carbodies, in Coventry,
maker of taxis, when it was decided that all workers over 60 would be made
redundant. This was one of the first industrial tribunal cases to accept age
discrimination as grounds for unfair dismissal, and tomorrow's decision will
be closely watched.
The three were dismissed in September 1992 and their unions are hoping for
compensation payments of up to Pounds 17,000 each.
Mr Mike Robinson, regional officer for the MSF technical union, said
yesterday: 'Carbodies selected these people for dismissal solely on the
criteria of what was their date of birth. No account was taken of their
service, skill or the fact that over 60's are just as capable as anyone
else.'
The government argues that specific legislation against ageism, as in the
US, would be counter-productive. But Miss Ann Widdecombe, a minister in the
Department of Employment, has been campaigning vigorously against ageism.
Miss Widdecombe recently launched a government booklet on how to stamp out
ageism at the workplace.
The booklet suggests five steps to avoid discrimination: dropping age bars,
selecting on ability, welcoming older applicants, offering flexible working
and investing in workers, regardless of age.
She said: 'Research confirms that older people offer employers skills,
reliability and experience. They are adaptable and as trainable as their
younger counterparts, and their commitment and loyalty is as great or
greater.'

FT  05 MAY 94 / Record profit at Post Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Post Office made a record operating profit last year, Mr Bill Cockburn,
chief executive, said yesterday.
Although the full results will not be announced until next month Mr Cockburn
said they were 'excellent' in a year that saw the largest volume of mail
distribution ever recorded.
He said that the corporation faced growing competition to its services
however and needed an urgent decision from the government over whether it
could enjoy commercial freedom and not be hemmed in by public-sector
financial requirements set by the Treasury.
The Post Office's hands were being tied by the government's delay on the
future of the organisation, he said. This was enabling the Dutch postal
service - to be privatised next month - and possibly the German one to
'plunder' the British market, he added.
'Unless we can respond on equal terms at Post Office counters, up to 20 per
cent of our business could be at risk over the next few years and with it
30,000 jobs and the closure of up to 5,000 Post Offices.'
Mr Cockburn also announced the results of a public opinion survey in which
76 per cent of the consumers questioned said they supported making the Post
Office free to enter new markets and offer new services to compete with
electronic communications.
Two-thirds of respondents supported the suggestion that the Post Office
should be able to compete with banks and building societies and 61 per cent
agreed it should be free to raise money to invest in its business.
However, the survey, carried out by Opinion Research and Communication,
found strong opposition to suggestions that the Post Office should be
privatised. While 49 per cent favoured allowing the organisation freedom to
enter and invest in new markets, they also thought the taxpayer should
remain as the sole shareholder.
From the sample of 1,068 adults aged 16 and over at a hundred sampling
points, 42 per cent disagreed that the service to the ordinary customer
would be good or better under a privatised postal service.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Nationwide chief to head IoD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, who was named yesterday as the next director-general
of the Institute of Directors, said he would 'push hard on the issue of
corporate governance'.
'The debate has tilted too far towards control and away from enterprise and
initiative,' he said. 'Directors need to be imaginative to be
wealth-creating.'
Mr Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide Building Society, is to
succeed Mr Peter Morgan at the IoD on August 1.
Mr Melville-Ross, 49, spent 10 years with British Petroleum before joining
Nationwide as secretary in 1974.
He has been Nationwide's chief executive for almost 10 years and was
chairman of the Council of Mortgage Lenders from 1992 to 1993.
'My first priority is quite clear, and that is to make sure that the
institute is doing everything that it should be for its 48,000 members,' he
said yesterday.
'I will also be pushing hard on the issue of corporate governance.'
On policy issues he emphasised that his agenda would be shaped by the needs
and desires of his members rather than any preconceptions that he might
hold. He was emphatic on the need to pursue the aim of de-regulation,
however.
'This is our aim in Europe,' he said. 'We are not little Englanders. We want
to be in Europe, but I have very grave concerns about the notion of a
federal Europe. The European Union is already overregulated, overcentralised
and very difficult to live with.
'Any suggestions that we should withdraw from Europe altogether - maybe
through some kind of loose free trade alliance - are going too far. We need
to be a part of Europe in order to convince governments and companies of the
need for free enterprise.'
Mr Melville-Ross points to the 1996 intergovernmental conference as a
possible focal point for the IoD's drive to reduce European regulation.
Closer to home, he is keen to see an easing of the regulation of financial
services. 'There is a danger of too much and inappropriate regulation
constraining the range of services and products and raising the costs of
those services that remain to a level that customers cannot afford.
'I appreciate that public confidence is at stake, but I am in favour of
self-regulation rather than statutory regulation.'
Mr Melville-Ross also disputes the notion that the IoD has become outdated.
'If by old-fashioned, our critics mean the institute's commitment to virtues
such as hard work, personal initiative and enterprise, then I make no
apologies for that. But if they mean that we are out of touch with modern
thinking, they are absolutely wrong.'
Mr Melville-Ross has been appointed on an initial three-year contract. His
salary of Pounds 180,000 represents an increase on Mr Morgan's Pounds
148,000.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A vote to censure the executive council of Usdaw, the shopworkers' union,
for reversing its opposition to Sunday trading has been narrowly defeated at
the union's annual conference in Blackpool.
The vote of 116,000 against the motion to 99,775 in favour showed the extent
of the division among the union's membership.
The executive relied heavily on the support of its large proportion of women
supermarket workers, many of whom are in favour of Sunday working.
Its earlier decision to reverse its policy against Sunday working had
however angered many of its members.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Treasury expects recovery to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury yesterday presented a favourable picture of UK economic
developments to coincide with the monthly monetary meeting between Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the
Bank of England.
In its latest monthly report, prepared for the meeting, the Treasury noted
that Britain's latest monthly economic indicators remained consistent with
continuing recovery, and retail sales 'remained on a strong upward trend'.
Although the report merely compiled recent economic data and gave no new
insights into the thinking of policymakers, it added to the impression that
yesterday's meeting was not the occasion for a decision to change monetary
policy.
Expectations of a cut in bank base rates from 5.25 per cent have been
receding for some time, with some commentators now suggesting that the next
move could be upwards.
Britain's gold and currency reserves rose an underlying Dollars 19m in April
according to Treasury figures released yesterday. The overall level of
official reserves rose by Dollars 531m to Dollars 43,446m at the end of
April from Dollars 42,915m at the end of March.

FT  05 MAY 94 / More holidays are taken overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More UK tourists are travelling overseas and their spending is increasing,
suggesting a recovery in confidence, Central Statistical Office figures
showed yesterday.
The number of UK residents travelling overseas in the three months to
February was 9.6m, an increase of 6 per cent over the previous three months.
Their spending rose 2 per cent to Pounds 3.28bn.
In the 12 months to February, trips abroad by UK residents rose 7 per cent,
and their spending rose 13 per cent.
Overseas visitors to the UK rose 5 per cent to 5m in the three months to
February compared with the previous three months - but their spending was
broadly unchanged at Pounds 2.32bn. That meant a deficit of Pounds 960m
compared with a deficit of Pounds 890m in the three months to November.
In the year to February, the number of overseas visitors increased 3 per
cent and their spending rose 14 per cent.
The most popular destinations for UK travellers were western Europe, where
the number of visits increased by 12 per cent. Visits to north America fell
7 per cent but trips to the rest of the world increased 7 per cent.
The number of visitors from north America to the UK also fell 1 per cent
while visitors from western Europe increased 4 per cent. There was a 3 per
cent rise in those from the rest of the world.
The Association of British Travel Agents said many UK residents sacrificed
winter holidays abroad in the recession in the early 1990s. It added: 'But
now they have taken one as they feel more confident the recession is over.
'Consumer confidence is increasing all the time and we estimate 14m Britons
will taken an overseas package this year and a further 10m will travel
abroad independently.'

FT  05 MAY 94 / Repossession orders fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Court orders for mortgage repossession have fallen to their lowest level
since 1989, confirming that the worst of the recession in the housing market
is over.
County courts in England and Wales made 17,522 orders for possession in the
first quarter of the year, the Lord Chancellor's Department said yesterday.
This compares with 23,646 in the last quarter of 1993 and 26,910 in the
first quarter of last year.
The number of actions commenced also fell sharply in the fourth quarter of
1993 and the first quarter of this year, when they totalled 21,968.
The sharp fall was caused partly by new rules requiring lenders to provide
more details before they can win a possession order, the department said. It
is thought that lawyers for mortgage lenders had taken time to adjust to the
new rules.
Even so, Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Council of Mortgage
Lenders, said the figures 'show the successful effect of lenders' policies
and confirm that the worst of the pain in the housing market is now over.
'As the housing market returns to normal it is important to remain mindful
of the lessons learnt the hard way during the recession.'
At the depths of the housing market recession in the third quarter of 1991,
the courts made 39,798 possession orders. The figures do not show how many
homes have been repossessed as not all orders result in the execution of
warrants of possession.

FT  05 MAY 94 / DoT launches crackdown on non-payment of road tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Department of Transport inspector questions a motorist as part of a
national campaign to crack down on non-payment of vehicle road tax. The
campaign, which started in London yesterday and will move to other large
cities, aims to cut the estimated Pounds 145m lost annually through tax
evasion. In the 12 months to March this year 455,000 evaders paid
out-of-court settlements or were successfully prosecuted. Private motorists
and motorcyclists without a tax disc face fines of up to Pounds 1,000.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Large National Insurance shortfalls found
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers appear to be underpaying National Insurance contributions due on
their employees' company cars to the tune of more than Pounds 240m a year,
the National Audit Office says in a report published today.
The public expenditure watchdog reports that fewer than half of 10,000
employers surveyed were paying the right amount. Underpayments averaged 36
per cent of the amount due.
The audit office has qualified the accounts of the National Insurance fund
because of uncertainties over the amounts of contributions underpaid.
However, the Contributions Agency, responsible for collecting National
Insurance, said last night that the underpayments were still being pursued.
Underpaid contributions can be pursued for up to six years after they are
due.
Employers are liable to pay Class 1A contributions on the cash equivalent
benefit of cars and car fuel provided to employees. About half the money is
paid direct to the Contributions Agency, the rest collected through PAYE by
the Inland Revenue.
The Revenue has been unable to modify its computer systems to separate Class
1A contributions from other National Insurance contributions. The National
Insurance accounts are therefore based on an estimate by the Government
Actuary of Pounds 429m for the amount collected in Class 1A contributions.
The Contributions Agency wants to use company car declarations provided to
the Inland Revenue by employers to check that the right amount of National
Insurance has been paid.
It is also compiling a register of employers to assist in checks. In
addition to monitoring Class 1A contributions, the register will be used to
ensure that employers deduct and pay the right amount of Class 1
contributions on employees' earnings.
The agency's inspectors discovered underpayments in Class 1 contributions of
some Pounds 89m on visits to 118,000 employers. Inland Revenue staff
checking PAYE records discovered Pounds 48m of underpayments on 46,000
inspection visits.
But since employers' visits are targeted on high-risk businesses, the agency
is unable to quantify the overall level of error in contribution receipts.
The accounts have also been qualified over uncertainties experienced in
previous years in the amounts employers are paying out in statutory sick pay
and statutory maternity pay. The agency plans a survey of employers to
determine whether correct amounts are paid out.
The level of errors in unemployment benefit payments were also censured by
the NAO.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Business looks again at social commitment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A study by Business in the Community of its priorities on extending
corporate community involvement will be examined by its board next month.
The study by management consultants McKinsey will be on the agenda for the
first board meeting chaired by Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of Grand
Metropolitan, who is about to become chairman of BITC.
Sir Allen said the study would stress the importance of focus in BITC's
activities and the need to ensure that good ideas were actually delivered.
This meant BITC had to involve other organisations to supplement its
resources.
BITC has promoted corporate community involvement since the early 1980s and,
in recent years, has been particularly anxious that companies should see it
in business rather than philanthropic terms. There was considerable growth
in community involvement during the 1980s, although primarily in large
companies.
BITC, said Sir Allen, must encourage other organisations to become more
active. 'Action must come from the community, and BITC's role is to find
ways of increasing the impetus for people to do it themselves.
'We need to find ways of encouraging Tecs, chambers of commerce and other
organisations to become more active in the community. This can be happen on
many different levels, from a dinner party of interested groups every three
months to something far more formal.'
Corporate community involvement, he said, needed to be regarded as a central
issue by all companies in the way corporate governance had become a central
issue.
Sir Allen's company is already particularly active in the community. Grand
Metropolitan's community and charitable activities worldwide consume an
annual Pounds 18m, or 2 per cent of profits. The company is conducting
research to see if a link can be traced between community involvement and
business efficiency.
'We have set up case studies to try to find out whether, if a group of
Burger King employees are motivated to become strongly involved in voluntary
work, they are good at running the business as well. First indications are
that there is some evidence that this is the case.'
Sir Allen stressed the need for companies to treat the management of
community involvement like any other business activity. 'In Grand
Metropolitan it has its own vision, strategies and annual and three-year
plans.'

FT  05 MAY 94 / GMTV's quotas are watered down: Minimum airtime for current
affairs is cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GMTV, the loss-making breakfast television station, has persuaded the
Independent Television Commission to lighten its licence obligations.
The commission has agreed to set aside detailed weekly quotas on everything
from news and current affairs to children's programmes.
Instead, the commission has set lower minimum timings for particular
programme categories. The new weekly minimum for current affairs will be 2
hours 30 minutes a week compared with 3 hours 47 minutes in the original
licence and the new minimum amount of sports coverage will be 40 minutes a
week instead of an hour.
In addition to increased flexibility, one and three quarter hours a week
will not be allocated to any category and can be assigned by GMTV, according
to editorial priorities.
Mr Christopher Stoddart, managing director of GMTV, said yesterday: 'It
takes us 10 per cent of the way towards our rivals who have no quotas at
all.'
The commission decision reflects the fact that GMTV operates a rolling news
service and has faced much more intense competition, particularly from
Channel 4's Big Breakfast, than expected when the company bid for its
licence.
GMTV, which is owned by Carlton Communications, Granada, The Guardian Media
Group, Scottish Television and Walt Disney, implemented the changes a month
ago in anticipation of the decision.
'We took a calculated risk. I think it is the logical way to make the
programme,' Mr Stoddart said.
GMTV faces considerable commission criticism over its first year on air
because it is clear that in order to survive the company deliberately
breached quotas in the first half of 1993.
'We didn't get it all right,' said Mr Stoddart yesterday. 'Maybe we veered
too much towards the Big Breakfast.'
According to the latest figures, GMTV reached a total of 11.2m viewers from
Monday to Friday compared with 8.6m for the Big Breakfast and 8.1m for the
BBC's Breakfast News.
The zany Channel 4 programme had the largest peak quarter hour audience at
1.9m - 300,000 ahead of GMTV.
'We have stopped counting quotas. We just pursue the stories now and it's
already increased confidence,' Mr Stoddart added. GMTV bid Pounds 34.61m a
year for its licence.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Customs official tells Scott of errors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The investigation which led to the unsuccessful trial of three directors of
Matrix Churchill, the Midlands machine tool manufacturers, should have been
carried out more thoroughly, a senior Customs and Excise official admitted
yesterday to the Scott inquiry.
Mr Douglas Tweddle, head of investigations at Customs, conceded that with
hindsight his staff should have inquired further into the roles played by
individual government departments involved in the affair.
Mr Tweddle is one of a small number of witnesses called to give evidence to
the inquiry after its official closure date last month.
Lord Justice Scott had asked him why Customs investigators only questioned
civil servants from the Department of Trade and Industry about the licence
applications for the export to Iraq of equipment capable of being used to
manufacture munitions.
Mr Tweddle said Customs had relied entirely on the DTI because, as the
licensing authority, it was thought it would reflect the views of other
departments involved such as the Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence.
However, after the judge pointed out that documents released during the
trial demonstrated the different views of the various ministries towards the
applications, Mr Tweddle agreed officials from these departments should also
have been questioned.
But he denied a suggestion by Lord Justice Scott that such questioning would
have demonstrated that the intelligence services knew for certain that the
equipment was destined for military use and was therefore against government
policy.
Such intelligence information could raise suspicions but not prove anything
with certainty, Mr Tweddle said.
He defended the decision to mount the prosecution, insisting that the case
turned on what the three Matrix Churchill directors had stated to the DTI
about the end use of the equipment they wanted to export.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Channel tunnel safety queried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed doubts about the safety of the Channel tunnel are raised in the
latest edition of the Consumers' Association magazine Which?, out today,
Charles Batchelor writes.
The study, published on the eve of the official opening of the Pounds 10bn
project, questions the failure to separate passengers from their vehicles on
the shuttle trains and the failure to use enclosed wagons to carry lorries.
It also points out that the increase in distance between cross-passages
linking train tunnels with the service tunnel would mean passengers would
have to walk further to safety - the original recommendation of 250m was
sub-sequently revised to 375m.
When the magazine went to press, Eurotunnel, which will run train services
through the tunnel, had not yet published details of its safety procedures.
On Tuesday Eurotunnel outlined the basis of its risk calculations and
measures it has adopted to reduce the dangers of fire, collision and
derailment. 'Until we are shown the evidence we cannot be certain that
safety is being put before commercial considerations,' the magazine says.
Eurotunnel said it had repeatedly given the association the opportunity to
inspect its safety procedures but its offer had not been taken up.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Lancer Boss decision due today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The administrative receivers for Lancer Boss are due to announce the buyer
of the Bedfordshire-based lift truck producer today amid signs that the
battle for control of the company has been won by Hamburg-based
Jungheinrich.
Jungheinrich and Clark Material Handling, which is part of Terex, the US
construction equipment group, are vying for control of the company. A third
bid has been made by a South African-based entrepreneur, Mr Roman
Simonovitch.
Jungheinrich earlier this month bought Steinbock Boss, Lancer's German
subsidiary, from the German lawyer handling its receivership, and has been
considered the most likely buyer for most of the rest of Lancer Boss.
Because of the trading links between Lancer Boss and Steinbock Boss,
managers and employees at Leighton Buzzard have been strongly in favour of a
takeover by the German company.
Jungheinrich said earlier this week that it was 'trailing' behind a bid from
Clark, which is said to have offered Pounds 15m for Lancer Boss. Mr Bob
Bischof, chairman of Jungheinrich (GB), also threatened to starve Lancer
Boss of vital supplies if its bid was not accepted.
Last night, though, there was growing confidence at Lancer Boss that
Jungheinrich had won the contest.

FT  05 MAY 94 / SIB chairman issues warning to companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The option of being regulated directly by the Securities and Investments
Board, the City's chief watchdog, should not be available indefinitely to
financial services companies, Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities
and Investments Board indicated to MPs yesterday.
He said the ability of a company to choose to be regulated by SIB should be
reviewed once the Personal Investment Authority, the new regulator to
protect the private investor, had been established.
Mr Large told the Commons Treasury committee that he wanted the PIA to
become operational as a regulator 'before and without' removing the choice
of regulator available under the financial services legislation, but that
once the new regulator had come into effect then that aspect of the 1986 act
should be looked at again.
His evidence to the committee's inquiry into financial regulation seemed to
be aimed directly at reassuring the MPs about the effectiveness of the PIA
after weeks in which they have heard several witnesses suggesting that the
proposals will not work. Meanwhile, the MPs themselves have sounded
sceptical about its prospects.
In particular, Mr Large was forced to defend Mr Joe Palmer whose appointment
as PIA chairman has caused some MPs to express concern. Mr Palmer was
formerly chief executive of Legal &amp; General, which recently attracted a then
record fine from Lautro, the existing regulator for the life insurance
industry, for systemic failures in its compliance arrangements.
Mr Large was pressed by Mr Brian Sedgemore, a Labour committee member, about
Mr Palmer's answers to the committee last week.
The day after giving evidence to the committee, Mr Palmer wrote apologising
for having inadvertently misled MPs by saying that he had not seen an
internal Legal &amp; General memorandum from 1990, which suggested there were
widespread breaches of the rules by sales consultants.
Mr Large also indicated the timetable for the regulatory switch to the PIA.
He said that SIB would decide next month whether finally and formally to
recognise PIA as a regulator.
The PIA is due to become operational in July.
At the same time, SIB would decide whether to withdraw recognition from
Lautro and from Fimbra, the existing regulator for independent financial
advisers.
A likely timescale would be for the watchdogs to stop accepting new
companies from the beginning of October, but to continue for about a year to
regulate existing companies which had not transferred to the PIA.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Audience deserted Accountancy TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accountancy Television, the training service for accountants, had only 200
subscribers to its programmes broadcast on the BBC Select Service when it
collapsed last month, it emerged yesterday.
There were just 867 names in total for the list of TV and video subscribers,
bought yesterday for Pounds 40,000 from the receivers by Television
Education Network (TEN), its leading competitor since launch two years ago.
The customer figures are much lower than earlier claims by Accountancy
Television that it had 1,200 subscribers, and indicate the extent of the
company's financial crisis.
Initial reports prepared by the receivers from accountants Buchler Phillips
suggest the service has lost more than Pounds 1.5m since it opened and owes
creditors more than Pounds 350,000.
The collapse has proved embarrassing to its backers BBC Select, BPP, the
financial training company, and five of the UK's six leading professional
accountancy bodies.
TEN yesterday said that it would send Accountancy Television customers its
own videos until their subscriptions expired.

FT  05 MAY 94 / MoD may buy more tanks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence is examining a tender submitted by Vickers for
supplying the army with more Challenger Two tanks to supplement the 127
already ordered, the Commons was told last night.
In a progress report on a comprehensive equipment programme for the army, Mr
Jonathan Aitken, minister for defence procurement, said a contract for
attack helicopters was expected to be placed in the middle of next year.
Mr Aitken confirmed that the outcome of the defence costs study 'Front Line
First' would probably be announced before the Commons adjourned for the
summer recess in July.
He agreed with Mr Tom King, the former defence secretary, that there was no
scope for further cuts in the strength of the army.
Mr Aitken said the army was now at its 'correct and right strength' and this
would remain the case even if it proved possible to withdraw troops from
Northern Ireland.
He denied that defence policy was being dictated by expenditure cuts imposed
by the Treasury.
The government was warned from both sides of the House that uncertainty
created by the latest review of defence costs was affecting army morale.
Mr King urged the government to announce the outcome of the current defence
costs study as quickly as possible.
He said the scaling down of commitments after withdrawal of forces from
Belize and the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty would not justify
any further reduction.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Political Notebook: Filling the European cracks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has only just started. Even before the votes have been cast in today's
local elections the cracks over Europe in the Conservative party have
re-opened. Mr Douglas Hurd's supply of high-class Polyfilla is running
dangerously low.
Mr John Major faces another five weeks of it. However badly (or, just in
case, however well) the Conservatives fare today, ministers are unanimous
that the results of the European parliament poll next month will be worse.
The difference between a bad and catastrophic outcome on June 9 is likely to
determine the prime minister's future. If the government holds on to more
than 15 or so of its 32 seats in Strasbourg Mr Major has a fighting chance.
If that number drops to 10 or below, the manner of Baroness Thatcher's
assassination four years ago will begin to look rather a civilised affair.
Even before the campaign is under way, Mr Major has been obliged to rebuke
Mr Michael Portillo for breaking cabinet ranks over the issue of a single
currency.
But Mr Portillo, a politician with a self-confidence which far outstrips his
junior cabinet post, cannot be sacked. In a few weeks the 40-year-old chief
secretary has emerged as the only candidate of the right in any leadership
contest.
The latest spat had the unreal quality which has become characteristic of
the current debate within the Tory party over Europe.
Mr Portillo made some unguarded remarks about the undesirability of a single
European currency. Nothing really surprising about that.
The sceptics have long seen economic and monetary union as the point at
which Britain will have no option but to draw a line in the sand. For them,
a single currency means political union, which in turn means the absorption
of the nation state into a European superstate.
It was in order to finesse that problem and to delay the inevitable breach
within his own party that Mr Major negotiated the British opt-out at
Maastricht.
Up until now the line that Britain will cross the single currency bridge
when it comes to it (ie after the next general election) by and large has
held. But these days the Tory party goes looking for things to fight about.
If there is no immediate casus belli then why not anticipate the battles
ahead and fight them now. The sceptical right, whose influence has risen as
Mr Major's leadership has weakened, is not about to cede its newly won
ground.
Against that background, the election manifesto produced by Mr Hurd is a
masterpiece of rationality. Against the hopes of the Europhobes Mr Major has
not torn up the original draft and replaced it with a chauvinist tirade
against all things European.
The document has been shortened. In typescript it is closer to 40 pages than
the former 60. Some of the attacks on the 'federalist' Labour and Liberal
Democrat parties have been couched in coarser terms than flow naturally from
the pen of the foreign secretary. But all the essential compromises of the
original have been maintained.
The emphasis, as expected, is on Britain's case for a decentralised,
competitive and open Europe. The nation state, it asserts with confidence,
is here to stay. So too is the British veto. It argues for minimum
interference from Brussels, for a renewed drive to deregulate, and for
intergovernmental co-operation rather than integration in areas like
defence, interior and immigration matters.
Labour, it asserts, would sign up for a single European currency tomorrow.
The Liberal Democrats would just backdate a wholesale transfer of
sovereignty to Mr Jacques Delors and his Brussels cronies.
Mr Hurd's hope is there is plenty of ammunition in all of that for the less
enthusiastic Europeans in the party to fire at the opposition.
But however naive may be its hope of persuading the rest of Europe to make
common cause with British pragmatism, the manifesto is not an anti-European
document.
In deference to the enthusiasts (there are still a few) and the realists in
the Tory party, it does not question Britain's place in Europe. It leaves
open the option of participation in a single currency and signposts the
route to a more coherent European defence identity.
In other words, it presents the issue not in terms of Europe right or wrong
but of Europe right or left.
Mr Major has signed up to the strategy. It fits his own instincts. It has as
good a chance as anything else of holding together his party during the next
few weeks.
The question, however, is whether the prime minister will stick to it. If
the opinion polls point to a landslide defeat, Mr Major may well be tempted
to abandon the pro-Europeans and appease the sceptics. That would provide
the trigger for civil war. The Conservatives, right and left, would look for
another leader.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government should crack down on car boot sales, the Consumers'
Association said yesterday.
A report in its Which? magazine said it should be illegal for a trader to
operate at non-commercial car boot sales. It said commercial events should
be classed as markets and organisers required to register them with a local
authority.
Which? said new rules were needed to ensure that consumers' rights could be
enforced when they bought shoddy goods.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Takeover of Swans backed by MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A takeover of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, by
French-owned Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie would create a world
force in the shipbuilding market, two Tyneside MPs said yesterday after
visiting CMN's Cherbourg yard, Chris Tighe writes.
Mr Steve Byers, Labour MP for Wallsend, and Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for
Newcastle East, said Swan Hunter and CMN had complementary skills and
facilities.
Senior management of Triacorp, CMN's parent company, believed the
acquisition of a British shipyard by CMN, creating an Anglo-French
consortium, would be advantageous, especially in securing work in the Middle
East.
But Mr Byers said CMN's expertise in the construction of composite hulls,
used in minehunters, could pose real competition for Southampton-based
Vosper Thornycroft if such a consortium were created.
Some MPs have questioned CMN's financial stability, but Mr Byers said
Triacorp directors had fully answered the questions raised. He said he had
been impressed at the way Triacorp had turned around CMN since acquiring it
in 1990. The yard, he said, was full to capacity.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Efficiency of Child Support Agency in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Child Support Agency may collect no more in maintenance payments from
absent parents in its first year than the Department of Social Security
collected last year.
The disclosure, which emerged this week in answer to MPs' questions, will be
politically damaging for the government since it suggests, by one yardstick,
that the controversial new regime is no more effective than the old.
It comes just two weeks after it was revealed that the agency is more than
Pounds 100m short of its overall target of making benefit savings of Pounds
530m for 1993-94.
With figures for one month of its financial year still to come, the benefit
savings secured by the agency have reached just Pounds 285m.
This compares with Pounds 313m in savings secured in 1992-93. The agency is
confident that it will beat this figure.
In a further disclosure, Ms Ros Hepplewhite, the agency's chief executive,
has told Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the Commons social security
committee, that the cost of setting up the agency was 'around Pounds 146m'
and that its running costs 'are estimated at Pounds 97.8m'.
The committee is to launch a review of the agency's workings when it
receives the body's annual report, expected in July. The committee expects
to publish its second report on the agency in the autumn.
According to figures released by Ms Hepplewhite, the agency collected a
total of Pounds 186m in maintenance payments in the 11 months to the end of
February. This compares with Pounds 220m in maintenance obtained by the DSS
in 1992-93 for income support claimants.
To match that performance this year the agency would need to have collected
Pounds 34m in March, the last month of its financial year, for which figures
are not yet available. This would be exactly double the Pounds 17m it
secured in February.
The agency said yesterday that the maintenance collection figures for
1992-93 and 1993-94 were not directly comparable, since it now deals with a
larger client group than the DSS had done.
The agency now handles family credit recipients and private clients in
addition to income support claimants.
Ministers put the agency's disappointing financial performance down to
changes forced by the social security committee and a refusal by some
fathers to pay maintenance.
In February, the DSS responded to Commons criticism of the agency by
amending the formula for absent parents' maintenance payments. The changes
also allowed fathers facing big bills to pay in stages over an 18-month
period.
Mr Field said recently that he felt the anger expressed by the public
necessitated a new inquiry to decide whether the formula that determined how
much parents should pay ought to be changed.
In a letter to Mr Field last month, Mr Peter Lilley, social security
secretary, said he was 'determined not to be rushed into further,
inappropriate changes simply because the policy is unpopular with some
sections of the community'.

FT  05 MAY 94 / London boroughs still on knife-edge: As the campaign closes,
several results are far too close to call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Breakthroughs by Labour and the Liberal Democrats in London seem a real
possibility in today's local government elections.
In several boroughs, opponents to the Conservatives have abandoned the usual
pre-election cageyness and predict victories.
London politics remain more dominated by local issues than virtually any
other area of the UK, and several boroughs will not follow the national
swing.
According to Mr Tony Travers, head of the Greater London group at the London
School of Economics, there will be a series of two-party battles, with the
impact of the Liberal Democrats, who seem certain to improve on their 15 per
cent share of the vote in the last elections four years ago, making a number
of elections hard to call.
Conservative boroughs will attract the most attention. Statistically the
most 'winnable' for Labour are Hillingdon - already won by Labour in a
by-election - Enfield, Brent and Ealing.
But the Conservatives in Ealing say that the former Labour council's 65 per
cent rate rise in 1986 is still frequently volunteered on the doorsteps.
They are confident they will keep control.
In Tory-controlled Brent the contest will also be very close. Conservative
Central Office has repeatedly depicted Tory Brent as a highly efficient
council with a low poll tax, in much the same way that Wandsworth and
Westminster were portrayed in the 1990 campaign. Mr Leslie Winters, one of
the Tory campaign organisers, predicted a 6-seat Conservative majority, up
from the current three.
But Mr Paul Daisley, Brent's Labour leader, said his party is well ahead in
the 5 or 6 marginal wards that they need to win control.
In marginal Kingston the Liberal Democrats are the greatest threat, and Mr
John Tilley, the Liberal Democrat leader on the council, predicts his party
will have an overall majority of at least 2 seats.
'The big surprise was that the Tory vote turned out to be non-existent,' he
said.
Another band of seats in outer London boroughs will require a greater swing.
In Croydon Labour has fought hard to engineer a Tory defeat. Croydon is the
biggest London borough by population, Labour needs a handful of votes in the
right wards to win control from the Conservatives for the first time.
Neither party was confident of victory yesterday.
Mr Jeff Dixon, Labour's energetic campaign director, said: 'I'm cautious.
It's not easy to believe that 120 years of Tory rule in Croydon could now
come to an end.'
Sir Peter Bowness, the Tory leader, said the Tory vote was holding in the
right wards, but believed that the turnout would be decisive. 'It's vital we
get our people out,' he said. 'People must remember it's about who controls
this borough.'
In Harrow, the Liberal Democrats are the opposition and hope to pull off an
extraordinary coup. The Tories have a 10-seat majority, but Mr Ralph
Bancroft, Liberal Democrat campaign manager, believes his party could get
outright control if it wins seats in 3 crucial Tory wards, where there a
large number of 'don't knows'.
Mr Donald Abbot, the Tory leader, admits that the Liberals have an 'outside
chance' of taking control, but still claims his party has won through. His
campaign has emphatically distanced itself from government policy.
In Bexley, Labour believes it has a chance of outright victory. Mr Leonard
Newton, the Conservative leader, admitted that it had been difficult to
persuade voters to consider local rather than national issues and said: 'I'm
fairly confident that if we don't keep control then we'll still be the
largest party.'
Elsewhere, Waltham Forest, Lambeth and Southwark feature strenuous Liberal
Democrat campaigns against allegedly 'loony left' Labour councils. Gains of
seats, but not of overall councils, seem likely.
Tower Hamlets sees another battle between Labour and the Liberal Democrats,
complicated by the presence of the far-right British National Party, which
won its first ever by-election success in September.
Canvassers for the main parties admit there is still substantial BNP support
on the Isle of Dogs, scene of the by-election victory.
According to Mr Travers, defeats in a further six boroughs would be
impossible for the Conservatives to explain away - Bromley, Barnet,
Redbridge, Wandsworth, Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea.
Labour are carefully circumspect about their chances in Wandsworth and
Westminster - the 'flagships' of four years ago when the poll tax dominated
other issues.
The two boroughs still have the lowest council tax figures in London and
Labour campaigners seem pessimistic that this financial obstacle can be
overcome.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Labour confident of true-blue Redbridge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three weeks ago Miss Liz Pearce, Labour leader on Redbridge council, was
quietly accepting that the Tories would retain control of the borough, which
they have run without break for 30 years.
But her opinion changed this week. 'I am confident that the Tories will lose
overall control here,' she says, running through a list of promising canvass
returns in the north-east London borough. 'I think we have a very good
chance of winning outright.'
Miss Pearce's prediction should cause deep anxiety among party workers at
Tory central office as they ponder how the elections in London will go
today.
Redbridge, where the Tory group has a majority of 23 seats, ought to be
impossible to lose. Psephologists claim it is 'on the cusp' between a bad
result for the Tories and a disastrous one.
If Redbridge goes, the Tories will only have the big strongholds of
Wandsworth, Westminster and Kensington left.
The borough of Redbridge, combining towns such as Ilford, Wanstead and
Woodford, is classic Thatcherite territory. It has many white, aspiring
middle-class voters, who have been the bedrock of conservatism in the last
20 years.
The council leadership has been composed of a closely-knit group of Tories
who were all elected to the council 20 years ago. Yet Labour seems to have
made huge inroads here in the last few days.
Miss Pearce claims that in some marginal wards Labour is getting the support
of between 50 and 60 per cent of those who say they will vote.
She claims that 90 per cent of first-time voters are opting for Labour.
Even in Wanstead and Woodford, Sir Winston Churchill's constituency for many
years, Labour candidates are supported by a remarkable 42 per cent of those
who say they will vote.
Tory campaigners are still confident that they will win. They privately
admit that the party will lose 9 seats on the council, but this will still
give them a majority of 5.
Mr Ronnie Barden, the Tory group leader, believes that the predictions of
Labour victory are no different from those that were made - in error - in
1990.
'People may say on the doorstep that they will vote Labour,' he says. 'But,
time and again, when they come to the ballot box they have second thoughts.'

FT  05 MAY 94 / Poisoning claims near settlement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 150 people who claim their health was affected in Britain's
biggest water poisoning incident are close to a cash settlement. Their
claims for damages stemming from the Camelford water affair were adjourned
at Truro Crown Court yesterday.
Mr John Hendy QC, representing 10 people chosen to make test claims against
South West Water Services, told Mr Justice Wright: 'The parties are speaking
to each other. Some progress has been made and it is likely more progress
will be made with an adjournment.'
The case was expected to last three weeks before moving to London but a cash
settlement is now likely to be offered to the 159 claimants.
The case comes six years after 20 tonnes of aluminium sulphate was poured
into the wrong tank at the Lowermoor treatment works near Camelford,
Cornwall.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Tories oppose more cuts in army
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tom King, Conservative MP for Bridgwater and a former defence secretary,
warned last night that there was no scope for further cuts in the size of
the army, Ivor Owen writes.
He told the Commons that cuts made when the Options for Change policy was
introduced in 1990 reduced the army to what should be regarded as its lowest
acceptable level.
Mr King, who joined other Tories in expressing anxiety about the 'stretch'
to which army personnel were being subjected, urged the government to
announce the outcome of the current defence costs study as quickly as
possible.
He said the scaling down of commitments resulting from the withdrawal of
forces from Belize and the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty would
not justify any further reduction.

FT  05 MAY 94 / 'It's going to depend on who gets their support out': FT
reporters declare any party could win what has been a rather subdued
campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, JAMES BUXTON, PAUL CHEESERIGHT and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lack of big prizes to be won outside London in today's local elections
has kept campaigning at a subdued level. As a referendum on the government's
performance, the regional poll is likely to be overshadowed by next month's
European elections.
Birmingham, the UK's largest metropolitan authority, is the biggest
potential prize for the Conservatives. Labour would lose control if its
opponents captured four seats. Workers from all parties agree the result
will be neck-and-neck, although Labour thinks it has done enough to stay in
power.
'It's going to depend now on the parties getting their support out,' said Mr
Bernard Zissman, the Conservative leader, who has been urging electors to
concentrate on local issues rather than the woes of the government. 'It's
not about trying to convert anybody to your point of view.'
But even in Birmingham, the campaign has been unexciting. 'The thing which
will decide the election is whether the Conservatives stay at home or
whether they vote for another party,' said Mr David Luscombe, leader of the
Liberal Democrats, who tomorrow could hold a pivotal position between the
two main parties.
In the south and south-west, the poll will show the extent to which the
Liberal Democrats have maintained their momentum and whether Labour can
build on the gains it made in 1990, when the Tories suffered badly from the
unpopularity of the poll tax. The Tories expect to win back some seats, but
their campaign has been largely one of damage limitation.
Tory officials accept that national issues, such as April's tax increases,
have predominated in voters' minds over local issues, such as the level of
council tax. Even where local issues are important - for example, the high
water charges in Devon and Cornwall - the Tories are on the defensive. 'The
feedback on the doorstep is one of antipathy to the government,' said Mr
David Fox, regional co-ordinator for the Liberal Democrats.
His party is hopeful of making the seven gains needed to win control of
Bath, where the Conservatives are the largest party. An easier target is the
'hung' Weymouth and Portland council in Dorset, where the Tories have only
been able to field candidates in five of the 12 contested seats, and
Colchester in Essex.
Mr Mike Jempson, for Labour's south-west region, said the party's canvass
returns 'are showing much better prospects than we expected. The Tory vote
has collapsed.' His party will be disappointed if it fails to win the two
seats needed to win overall control of Gloucester council, although its
opponents believe that is not a foregone conclusion. Labour is also the
largest party in Exeter and hopes to take outright control.
In Bristol, the controlling Labour group should be able to fend off a
challenge in 10 wards from the new Bristol Party, started by disgruntled
Bristol Rovers football supporters. But Labour's 12-seat majority could be
cut by the Liberal Democrats.
In the north, the Liberal Democrats are challenging in Liverpool, where the
controlling Labour group has to contend with a rival leftwing faction.
Labour also has difficulties in South Tyneside, where the Liberal Democrats
have pushed hard to reduce Labour's formidable majority of 55 of the 60
seats.
One northern council where control could change - from Conservative to
Labour - is Barrow-in-Furness. Even there campaigning has been muted.
There are two main questions in Scotland: whether the Scottish National
party gains the extra votes and seats it expects and whether the Tories fall
to fourth, rather than third, in voting share.
The elections for the nine regional councils of mainland Scotland and the
three island councils are unlikely to produce changes in more than one
regional council. Only in Grampian, and to a lesser extent Tayside, could
the SNP conceivably win full control.
The SNP has been boosted by a System Three opinion poll a week ago which put
its support on 27 per cent. While Labour was on 44 per cent, with the Tories
and the Liberal Democrats on 14 per cent each.
However, the Conservatives expect to do better than that, claiming support
for their local policies, which involve the abolition of the regions in 1996
and their replacement by a single-tier system. But they have had difficulty
convincing voters that their plans do not involve privatising water.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Fowler willing to take rap for losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, yesterday attempted to act as a
lightning conductor for Mr John Major, the prime minister, by taking
personal responsibility in advance of the Tories' expected poor performance
in today's local elections.
Sir Norman said: 'As party chairman, I take responsibility for the campaign;
the buck stops with me.'
In contrast to the Tories, who sought to focus the debate on local issues,
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, insisted that the public saw the elections as
a means of registering their anger at the 'incompetence of the government'.
Today's local elections involve 114 English non-metropolitan districts, 36
metropolitan districts, 32 London boroughs, nine Scottish regional councils,
three Scottish islands councils and four Welsh districts.
There is also the Rotherham parliamentary by-election caused by the death of
Mr Jimmy Boyce, which Labour is expected to hold easily.
A poor performance by the government in the local elections is likely to
lead to increased speculation about Mr Major's future.
Mr Smith demanded that the government call an election if Mr Major is forced
from office following further disappointing results in next month's European
elections.
While he predicted that Labour would be the clear winner from today's
elections, Mr Smith warned that in many areas it was almost impossible to
improve on his party's performance in the last local contests in 1990.
Sir Norman stuck to his earlier prediction that the party would take seats
from the opposition parties, but declined to say where.
The Liberal Democrats, who expect 'modest gains' from today's elections,
denied that the outcome of the poll could be seen as a referendum on the
government.
Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat president, said Tory infighting over a
single currency in Europe confirmed the impression of a government in 'some
disarray'.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, accused Labour of trying to divert
voters' attention from local issues because of the 'appalling record' of
Labour-run councils.
Labour denied the accusation as it published a document boasting of a record
of 'excellence' in local government.
But it omitted to mention Lambeth, where Labour has expelled several extreme
left councillors and the council has been accused of more than Pounds 20m of
unlawful expenditure by the district auditor. Mr Smith denied that he was
embarrassed by the council's record.
Earlier, Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary, declined to
apologise for breaking cabinet ranks over his opposition to a single
currency.
He also refused to accept advice from Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary,
that all contributions to debate should concentrate on supporting local
government candidates and not be distracted by other issues.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Pools group to launch lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Littlewoods, the football pools group which decided not to be involved in
bidding for the National Lottery, is setting up its own scratch-card lottery
to raise money for charity.
The UK's dominant football pools operator is working with four charities -
Age Concern, the NSPCC, the Roy Castle Cause for Hope Appeal and the
Spastics Society - to launch the lottery.
It will start in the north-west on June 20 with the aim of becoming
nationwide if successful.
The Pounds 1 lottery tickets will have a top prize of Pounds 25,000. By law
the Littlewoods lottery can only be a small affair. The maximum permitted
annual turnover for charitable lotteries was increased last year, but only
to Pounds 5m.
Many specialists believe that the National Lottery, which could begin before
the end of this year, may have revenues of around Pounds 4bn in a year or
two.
Under the rules, Littlewoods would be a promoter - such lotteries can only
be run by charities, local authorities or clubs.
Apart from the public relations benefit of raising money for charity,
Littlewoods may be trying to protect the income of their football pools
collectors who could be affected by a successful National Lottery.
Collectors would get a proportion of scratch-card money for selling the
cards.
The retailing and football pools group had pre-tax profits of Pounds 117.2m
last year. It decided not to be involved in bidding for the National Lottery
because it feared that, as the largest pools group, it would not have a
chance. However the Department of National Heritage made it clear to the
company that any application would be judged on its merits.
The successful bidder for the National Lottery licence is expected to be
announced before the end of this month.

FT  05 MAY 94 / World Trade News: US hits at barriers to film, TV exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The US audio-visual industry, the country's second largest exporter, claims
it is under siege around the world, fettered by quotas, discriminated
against by tax laws and a target for pirates who sell illegal duplicates of
films and television programmes.
This, at least, is the contention of the Motion Picture Export Association,
and its colourful chairman, Mr Jack Valenti, who in a new report cites what
he says is a 'catalogue of artificial barriers erected by governments on
every continent, whose aim is to shrink the reach of American visual
entertainment and to baffle the movement of our products in world market
places.'
According to MPEAA, China's piracy costs the US industry an estimated
Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.5m) in exports; it has also thrown up 'a vast array
of market restrictions' to legitimate US exports. Until recently there were
few pirate videos of US products in China, according to a US lawyer. But the
market has grown with rising purchases of VCRs. Political relaxation has
made enforcement a more important issue.
Europe remains the film industry's largest market, which is why 'cultural
protectionism' which limits US TV programming has become a live issue. Italy
and Turkey were singled out for 'continuous and unacceptably high levels of
piracy exacerbated by lack of legal protection and insufficient penalties
for enfringement.'
Piracy is also a problem in Poland and Hungary along with concerns on
currency convertibility, freedom to remit earnings and distribute filmed
entertainment with minimal government control.
In Latin America, there are worries about 'an emerging trend' toward use of
revenues from the sale of foreign films to support the national industry.
The Middle East has become 'a transshipment centre' for pirated products.
A long crusade on intellectual property rights has won the industry powerful
Washington friends in both Congress and the White House. Hollywood campaigns
for politicians and helps finance their campaign. Film directors, such as Mr
Steven Spielberg and Mr Martin Scorsese, issued statements equating artistic
freedom with open markets.
Even clout could not contend with the intricacies of US-China trade
relations. When the deadline came for Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, to release the Special 301 lists designating countries for
talks and potential sanctions for intellectual property rights violations,
naming of China as a 'priority foreign country' was delayed until June 30.
Mr Valenti expressed disappointment. 'It is an open and shut case,' he said.
'Piracy in China is visible and confirmable.'
Inclusion of intellectual property rights in the planned new World Trade
Organisation, if it is approved, will allow the US to take many of these
complaints to a multilateral forum. But, according to the US lawyer, the US
will still have to sometimes act unilaterally because 'even copyright laws
consistent with the WTO may not be adequate because of advances in
technology.'

FT  05 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Brussels acts on cement dumping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mounting Portland cement sales from Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic
to the European Union have led Brussels to open anti-dumping proceedings
against the three countries.
The move comes at the instigation of the German producers' association,
whose share of the German market fell to 80 per cent in 1992 from 86 per
cent in 1991. The association is charging that exports from Poland, for
example, are almost 40 per cent cheaper than locally-produced cement.
The complaint comes despite the strong German position in Poland's cement
industry. German cement companies have recently purchased many Polish
state-owned plants and last year accounted for almost 40 per cent of Polish
cement output.
The anti-dumping action comes in spite of Polish promises to maintain 'fair'
export prices. German producers and Poland's cement producers' association
have an agreement the Poles will price cement exports at German levels.
Polish producers have to obtain export licences from the country's foreign
trade ministry. If the exporter offers to sell cement abroad at prices lower
than those agreed with German producers the ministry may refuse to issue a
licence.
Last year Poland produced 12m tonnes of cement, of which 2.4m tonnes were
sold abroad, mostly to Germany. This contrasts with the 19m tonnes produced
by the industry at its peak in 1979 and 12m tonnes in 1992, when exports
amounted to 1.6m tonnes.

FT  05 MAY 94 / World Trade News: South Korea may get Rover engine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kia Motors of South Korea is at an advanced stage of negotiations with
Rover, the leading carmaker in the UK, for the production in Korea of
Rover's planned top-of-the-range V6 engine.
Mr Sun-Hong Kim, chairman of Kia Motors, visited Rover last week, and a
final agreeement is expected to be signed next month.
Kia is expected to produce the Rover engine under licence for use in a new
range of executive cars, it plans to launch in 1995/96.
The South Korean vehicle maker, in which Ford of the US owns a 10 per cent
stake and Mazda of Japan an 8 per cent stake, is developing growing ties
with the European motor industry.
It reached agreement last week with Karmann, the German automotive
engineering and production group, for the assembly in Germany of its
Sportage four wheel drive sports-utility vehicle. It will become the first
Korean vehicle maker with assembly in Europe with output planned to rise to
30,000 vehicles a year.
It is also discussing with Group Lotus, the UK sports carmaker and
automotive engineering consultancy, the possible transfer to Korea of
production of the Lotus Elan sports car.
Lotus was forced to stop production of the Elan in 1992 because of heavy
losses. Now owned by Bugatti International, Lotus has re-started production
of the Elan in a limited run of 800 units.
Elan output in the UK is due to stop next year, however, when Lotus exhausts
its present stock of engines, and it is negotiating the transfer of the
sports car project to Korea.
Kia's potential deal with Rover concerns the production in Korea of the UK
carmaker's new V6 engine range in 2.0 and 2.5 litre versions. The V6 is
being developed by Rover from its highly successful K-series engine range,
produced in 1.1 and 1.4 litre four-cylinder versions. Larger 1.6 and 1.8
litre K-series engines are also under development.

FT  05 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Rolls-Royce set to secure Saudia order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce could win a significant piece of the Dollars 6.2bn (Pounds
4.1bn) fleet renewal and expansion programme by Saudia, the Saudi Arabian
national carrier, by supplying it with engines for its US-built Boeing
widebody airliners.
If confirmed, the engine order would represent a consolation prize for
Europe, which in February was dealt a heavy blow by the Saudi government
when it opted for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft to modernise
Saudia's fleet.
The European Airbus consortium had hoped to win a large slice of the Saudia
order but in what was seen as a highly political decision after an
unprecedented degree of US government export promotion, the Saudi government
said it intended to buy only US-built airliners.
Saudia has been holding complex talks with the two US aircraft manufacturers
during the past six weeks to select the number and types of airliners for
its fleet modernisation programme.
The airline is now drawing up a report to be submitted to its government
recommending the purchase of a total of 61 airliners, including Boeing 737
twin engine narrowbody aircraft, Boeing 747 four engine and 777 twin engine
widebody airliners and McDonnell Douglas MD11 three engine widebody
aircraft, according to the Saudi al-Hayat newspaper.
The Saudi government is expected to take a final decision on the huge order
this summer. The US Export-Import Bank has already said it would guarantee
Dollars 6.2bn financing for the deal.
Quoting informed sources, the newspaper said Saudia had also recommended the
selection of engines to power its new aircraft.
It said General Electric of the US was expected to take 46 per cent of the
engine package, with Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US taking 26 per cent and
Rolls-Royce of the UK taking 28 per cent.
Since the UK group does not build engines for the Boeing 737 or the MD11,
its potential order would involve supplying powerplants for the Boeing 747
and 777 widebody airliners.
Rolls-Royce yesterday declined to comment on the newspaper report.
Although the deal would represent an important breakthrough for Rolls-Royce
and its new Trent 800 large engine designed for the new Boeing 777, it risks
sparking some resentment in European aerospace industry circles.
French aerospace officials have often criticised in private what they regard
is the UK government's ambivalent stance in promoting European commercial
aerospace exports. They suggest the UK has tended to favour Rolls-Royce,
whose engines at present equip more Boeing than Airbus aircraft, rather than
Airbus in which British Aerospace has a 20 per cent stake.
This reflects the relatively higher UK value of a Boeing aircraft equiped by
Rolls-Royce engines compared with an Airbus aircraft equipped with a US
power plant.
Engines account for about 20-25 per cent of the value of an airliner but
they also produce considerable additional long term revenues from sales of
spare parts, aerospace analysts note.
However, the UK value of an Airbus aircraft with Rolls-Royce engines such as
the A330, the new twin engine Airbus widebody offered but not selected by
Saudia, rises to around 50 per cent.

FT  05 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Polyester plant aid 'must be repaid'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday ordered that AlliedSignal Fibers the
advanced technology company, repay part of a French aid package donated
towards an industrial polyester fibre plant in eastern France.
It said that about FFr26.3m (Pounds 3.1m) of a total FFr200m aid package
awarded by the French government could not be paid because it broke the
European Union regulations on aid to the synthetic fibres industry.
The Commission, which has the authority to clear or block state aid within
the EU if it concludes that competition is harmed as a result, ordered that
part of the amount already paid should be returned with interest. This
figure amounts to roughly FFr621,000.
Allied Signal Fibers said it regretted the decision and would consider an
appeal.
'We believe we have taken all reasonable steps to verify that the subsidies
offered by the authorities were compatible with the commission rules,' said
a spokesman.
Allied Signal chose to locate its plant in the Pole Europeen de Developpment
 -an area straddling Belgium, France and Luxembourg which benefits from the
EU's regional fund.
The Commission also announced yesterday that it had started an inquiry into
an unspecified amount of aid that the Belgian government was planning to
give to another synthetic-fibre producer in Belgium, BVBA DS Profil of
Dendermonde.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Clinton explains what in the world he is doing: The
president's 'global press conference' designed to defend his foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Criticism of US foreign policy has come in waves since Bill Clinton became
president. This has partly reflected peaks in foreign horrors such as
Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti and now Rwanda, partly genuine debate over how best
to approach Russia, China and Japan and partly the swivelling spotlight of a
nation still more interested in its own affairs.
But the latest flood tide has taken on a decidedly personal turn. No longer
is it the much-maligned Clinton foreign policy team in the firing line, but
the president himself.
He stands accused of not being interested in foreign affairs, of providing
no strategic vision of leadership to guide the US and its friends and
enemies in the post-cold war world, of not knowing when to use, or threaten
to use, force, and of being driven by domestic public opinion and its
assorted pressure groups into changes of tack beyond number.
This week even the president's presumed deficiencies of character were
adduced into the foreign policy argument. Far from untypical was a Joe Klein
column in Newsweek which said: 'It may be that Clinton's alleged (and it
must be emphasised unproven) behaviour towards women is not irrelevant when
his behaviour towards Haitians, Bosnians - and Americans - is considered.'
Even E J Dionne, the not unsympathetic Washington Post commentator, had
advance doubts about the purpose of Tuesday night's 'global press
conference' on foreign policy. Recalling the gap between Mr Clinton's
campaign promises and his execution of a foreign policy only marginally more
active than that of President George Bush, he feared 'words again'.
'The test of how well he does will lie not in what he says, but in what he
disciplines himself not to promise.'
The White House is conscious that US criticism has many foreign echoes,
which is why Tuesday night's event, broadcast live around the world by CNN,
saw Mr Clinton take questions from reporters in Jerusalem, Johannesburg,
Sarajevo and Seoul.
Mr Clinton stated, yet again, that the US had 'a clear road map' and ticked
off the predictable list of its signposts and accomplishments, emphasising
trade and economics. But much of what he had to say was explanatory and
defensive.
He repeatedly stressed the limits on the use of unilateral US power. An
accommodation with Pyongyang was 'in the hands of the North Koreans'; Bosnia
could only be resolved by 'a negotiated settlement'; the latest US pressure
on the Port-au-Prince junta was 'to help Haiti grow again and crawl out of
the enormous hole its present rulers have put it in'.
This message - that reasonable people must learn to live and work together
of their own volition, but with a bit of help - is his frequent domestic
refrain. He saw it working in South Africa, the Middle East, in South
America and elsewhere, but its rational appeal to those mired in intractable
rivalries is less apparent.
Mr Clinton was willing to concede this, along with the difficulty of getting
US friends and allies to co-operate, as over Bosnia. At his most irritated
initially in answering an aggressive question from CNN's correspondent in
Sarajevo ('there have been no flip-flops, madam'), he went on to say he had
rejected 'bad advice' to steer clear of Bosnia altogether.
'The US sometimes has to try and make a difference where it cannot control
events but can influence them. That is the situation with Bosnia. We are not
in control. We have some influence. We're doing our best to exercise it and
I think we're better off.' Mr Clinton, in effect, thumped no tubs, as
several of his critics have demanded.
He also drew lessons from the US experience in Somalia, now applicable to
Rwanda. The most important was not to be 'naive' in assuming that
humanitarian disasters had only natural causes. 'What we read of the
conflict between the Hutus and the Tutsis is that there is a political and
military element to this', which meant that any attempt to resolve the
conflict had to address both elements.
Mr Clinton was at his most comfortable talking about the issues closest to
his rational heart, such as trade with Japan and relations with China. He
was conciliatory to Beijing, half suggesting a way out of the impasse over
human rights could be found in the month remaining. 'I do not seek, nor
would it be proper, for the US or any other nation to tell a great country
like China how to conduct all its internal affairs.'
By Mr Dionne's measurement the president probably succeeded in not making
promises he could not keep. But on the opinion pages of the New York Times
yesterday there was former British prime minister Lady Thatcher again
demanding air strikes against the Serbs and a lifting of the arms embargo.
Several newspapers ran moving accounts of Mr Randall Robinson, admitted to
hospital on the 23rd day of a hunger strike in Washington protesting over US
policy towards Haiti.
Mr Clinton's middle ground can seem pallid in comparison.

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican government is backing away from the contention that Mr Luis
Donaldo Colosio, the slain presidential candidate, was the victim of an
organised plot.
The special prosecutor has released a report by Spanish police which says
video evidence used to implicate six alleged accomplices of the confessed
assassin is 'inconclusive'.
The report by Spanish experts 'throws the investigation open and raises the
possibility there was no plot to kill Mr Colosio', an official says.
Conspiracy theories have been further fuelled by last week's murder of Mr
Federico Benitez, the police chief in the city of Tijuana, where Mr Colosio
was killed. Mr Benitez was reported to have had a number of secret files on
the Colosio murder stolen just before he was killed.
A government official said Mr Benitez had information about Mr Sergio Ortiz,
deputy attorney-general in Baja California, who was arrested on Tuesday on
charges of protecting a well known drug cartel.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Menem scraps pension plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's President Carlos Menem has scrapped a controversial provision
forcing the country's biggest bank, government-owned Banco de la Nacion
Argentina (BNA), to offer dollar-linked pension funds.
The government argued the change was needed to remove a big distortion from
its pension reforms, but it has led to protests that Mr Menem is ruling by
personal fiat. The provision was approved last year by Congress and the
president's right to issue decrees was originally intended for use in
emergencies only.
On Tuesday Mr Menem decreed BNA need not provide a minimum dollar-linked
return for retirement savings accounts it will administer on behalf of
private savers.
Argentina is just beginning to implement a private pension fund system to
complement the bankrupt state pay-as-you-go system. Savers must choose
between staying in the state system or picking companies to manage their
individual retirement accounts.
Mr Menem's Peronist government last year had to accept a Peronist demand
that BNA offer dollar-linked pension schemes as the party's price for
supporting pension reform. But rival pension managers complained this gave
BNA an unfair advantage.
However, Mr Jorge Matzkin, Peronist party leader in Congress, yesterday
warned the decree was 'not the most adequate way of eliminating the
guarantee. We will present a bill offering substitute guarantees better than
those removed.'
Pension reform will channel Dollars 200m a month into the capital markets
but it has been dogged by poor organisation.
The government only allowed fund managers to begin selling pension plans on
Monday. They have until the end of July to sign up the 5m workers eligible
for the system.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Venezuela dollar auctions: Move aims to stabilise foreign
exchange market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's central bank yesterday initiated an auction system under which
commercial banks and exchange houses can obtain dollars from the government
through a daily bidding process.
The system, aimed at stabilising the foreign exchange market, falls short of
direct controls on exchange transactions but nonetheless represents a
restriction on sales of dollars by the government.
It was implemented after several days of heavy dollar purchases and an 8.6
per cent fall in the Venezuelan bolivar between April 26 and May 3.
In the auction, the dollar was sold at 129.39 bolivars, implying a further
0.7 devaluation of the currency from Tuesday, the smallest daily decline in
the past week. No details about the amount sold were available, however.
Until April 26, when Mrs Ruth de Krivoy shocked investors by resigning as
president of Venezuela's central bank, the bank openly sold dollars under a
crawling peg system.
After Mr Antonio Casas was named to replace her, the bank began restricting
dollar sales, provoking a new wave of nervousness in the foreign exchange
market and renewing fears of exchange controls.
Some bankers fear that dollar sales over the last week may have reached
Dollars 600m or more, compared with total dollar sales of Dollars 327m in
March. The bank has not yet published figures on dollar sales and the
international reserve position for April. The bolivar's sharp devaluation
over the past week is already creating problems for the government of
President Rafael Caldera, which is trying to hold down price increases.
Businessmen say prices will rise for any products that have imported
components.

nomination in the race to succeed his father-in-law, Senator Howard
Metzenbaum, as senator for Ohio.
The wealthy Mr Hyatt won a closely contested primary on Tuesday by 46 per
cent to 44 against a strong challenge from Ms Mary Boyle, a county
commissioner, who argued in her campaign that the Senate needed more
mothers, not more millionaires nor more lawyers.
In the November general election Mr Hyatt will face Mr Michael DeWine,
Ohio's Republican lieutenant governor, who won his party's primary with 52
per cent of the votes, defeating Dr Bernardine Healy, former director of the
National Institutes of Health.
In the same round of voting in Ohio, Congressman David Mann beat off a
challenge from Mr William Bowen, a state senator, for the Democratic
nomination in his House of Representatives district.

Inflation in Brazil's new currency-in-waiting accelerated sharply in April
in a blow to government hopes of containing price rises.
Monthly inflation in the URV accounting unit increased nearly a percentage
point to 2.62 per cent in April from 1.77 per cent in March, according to
Fipe, one of the country's main research institutes.
The URV, or unit of real value, was introduced in March as the first step
towards the creation of a new currency, the real, which the government
expects to launch in July.
Government economists said prices remained volatile, and sharp swings are
expected until the new currency is fully in place. They claimed some prices
were falling in URV terms, but indicators had not yet registered it.
Inflation is continuing to soar in underlying cruzeiro prices. Fipe said
yesterday April cruzeiro inflation rose to 46.22 per cent from 41.94 per
cent in March. If this rate of increase continues, Brazil will soon pass
through the technical measure of hyperinflation, 50 per cent a month.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Gaza-Jericho Autonomy: Israel will spin out next stage of
peace process - The road ahead
</HEADLINE>

The Gaza-Jericho agreement could prove to be a small but important step on
the road towards Palestinian aspirations for an independent state. The next
phases of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process are, however, mired in
ambiguity and open to different interpretation by each side.
Essentially, yesterday's agreement gives the PLO a five-year interim period
of self-rule (more than autonomy but less than statehood) over the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank enclave of Jericho. The accord, covering a limited
slice of the Palestinian land occupied by Israel in the 1967 Six Day War, is
supposed to be a transitional agreement towards a permanent solution to the
Palestinian question in 1998.
The agreement rules out, for the moment, Palestinian statehood, the
definition of international borders, Palestinian control over the rest of
the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem, and the right of return of up to 4m
Palestinian refugees.
These issues are all left for staged negotiations until 1998, when a
permanent solution is intended, based on UN resolutions which realise 'the
legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and their just requirements'. As
such, the interim agreement is a gamble for the Palestinians, as it contains
no guarantees of further advances towards an independent Palestinian state
in all of the pre-1967 Arab land.
Gaza-Jericho is clearly designed by Israel as an experiment, the success of
which will determine the shape of a future Palestine. Many Palestinians fear
that 'Gaza-Jericho first' could end up being 'Gaza-Jericho only'. Under the
agreement, the PLO is supposed to take control over Gaza-Jericho
immediately. An advance contingent of 1,000 Palestinian police of a
9,000-strong force will cross into Gaza and Jericho today to pave the way
for a phased Israeli troop withdrawal within 21 days.
In the coming month, the PLO must take over executive power from the Israeli
military administration and build the institutional structures for
self-rule. The most important task is the appointment of a 'Palestinian
interim self-government authority', to be composed of 24 members or
'ministers' led by Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, which will govern
Gaza-Jericho until elections. Mr Arafat and his inner circle of senior PLO
officials are expected to return to Gaza-Jericho within six weeks.
The next steps of the peace process are much more complicated and ambiguous.
The Declaration of Principles signed last September says implementation of
the Gaza-Jericho accord is supposed immediately to be followed by
negotiations on the second phase of the interim period: the extension of
Palestinian self-government to the rest of the West Bank excluding Arab East
Jerusalem.
Under this phase, Israeli troops are supposed to move out of Palestinian
population centres and make way for Palestinian policemen. The declaration
says the second phase will be implemented after the PLO holds elections for
a National Council on July 13 and the Israeli redeployment must be completed
'not later than the eve of elections'.
On the inauguration of the Council, the civil administration will be
dissolved and the Israeli military government withdrawn. The elections have
to be held under a protocol to be negotiated by Israel and the PLO. However,
it is already clear the elections will be long delayed and might even be
indefinitely postponed. Furthermore, Israel has promised speedy talks on
early transfer of power to Palestinians in the rest of the West Bank ahead
of a formal agreement on extension of self-rule.
Israeli officials clearly intend to drag out negotiations on the second
phase of the agreement until they can assess how Gaza-Jericho has worked.
For Israel success essentially means security: whether the PLO can curb
attacks by Palestinian extremists on Israelis.
If security is not increased there will be tremendous domestic pressure in
Israel not to proceed. If Mr Arafat does not hold elections, Israel will be
able to hide behind that excuse for not honouring its obligations in the
declaration.
Mr Rafi Ganzor, Israeli foreign ministry spokesman, said an appointed
Palestinian Council and proof that Gaza-Jericho was working were conditions
for beginning talks on the rest of the West Bank.
Even if Gaza-Jericho goes well, complicated security negotiations for the
150 settlements and 120,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank could well mean
implementation of the second phase will be delayed well into next year.
The declaration also says negotiations on a permanent settlement to the
Palestinian question - essentially statehood or confederation with Jordan -
as well as the sensitive issue of Jewish settlements and the future of
Jerusalem, are to be discussed not later than the beginning of the third
year of Palestinian self-rule.
Under the timetable laid out in the declaration, this would mean
negotiations on permanent solutions would begin in December 1995 and would
be implemented by December 1998. It is unclear how the five-month delay in
implementing Gaza-Jericho and any future delays will affect the timetable.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Gaza-Jericho Autonomy: Biggest obstacle to peace process -
The settlers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Dotted throughout the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, home to more than
120,000 Israelis, the 140 Jewish settlements constitute arguably the largest
potential obstacle to a successful conclusion of the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process.
Yesterday's agreement on Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho will
theoretically have no impact on Gaza's 4,000 Jewish settlers or on the
half-dozen small settlements close to Jericho.
It was an Israeli precondition that no settlement be dismantled, not a
single Jewish settler forced to return to sovereign Israel, in the initial
stages of the autonomy process.
Only in more than two years from now, when Israeli and PLO negotiators begin
another round of intensive talks on a permanent solution in the occupied
territories, will the status of settlements be on the agenda.
As they pull out of Palestinian population centres in Gaza and Jericho over
the next few days, many Israeli troops will not be leaving the occupied
territories altogether.
They will be redeploying at new bases built alongside settlements,
patrolling newly-erected settlement perimeter fencing, ensuring the security
of Jews who were assured under previous Israeli governments, hardline and
moderate alike, that their presence in the heart of hostile Arab territory
fulfilled a vital Israeli security interest.
If anything, the army's newly-limited role in Gaza and Jericho - protecting
settlers rather than ruling Palestinians - should provide a greater sense of
security. But most settlers have read the writing on the wall.
If the autonomy process unfolds as planned, and the Labour party of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin remains in office, they are living on borrowed time,
with probably no more than five years before enforced evacuation.
While a substantial proportion of West Bank settlers moved there for a
better standard of living - house prices in Ma'aleh Adumim, for example, are
a fraction of those in Jerusalem, just 10 minutes away - Gaza's Jews are
highly ideologically motivated, digging roots in soil they regard as an
integral part of biblical Israel.
The few dozen Jews at the Gaza settlement of Dugit, who moved there to set
up a fishing community, are an exception; they are already clamouring for
financial compensation that would enable them to leave. Most of Gaza's
settlers, like their counterparts in Hebron, Kiryat Arba and other West Bank
ideological hot-houses, will do their utmost to resist evacuation. Some
extremists have threatened to use force against Israeli soldiers who may try
to drag them out.
For the time being, Mr Rabin is standing by his commitment to leave the
settlements be. Even after February's Hebron mosque massacre, when the
Hebron settlers themselves expected to be forced to leave, he did nothing.
His aides say privately that, long-term, Mr Rabin will negotiate hard to
maintain a strip of settlements along Israel's border with Jordan, a ring
around Jerusalem, and the areas of Arab East Jerusalem where Jewish
neighbourhoods have sprung up since 1967.
The aides believe Mr Rabin will give up the rest of the settlements, more
than 100 of them, offering their residents the choice between government
compensation or staying put under Palestinian rule.
Labour party members have opened a kind of disenchanted settlers register,
listing names of families who would leave if offered alternative
accommodation inside Israel proper. The Treasury is said to have drawn up a
working paper on settler compensation, with an overall price tag of Dollars
10bn (Pounds 6.6bn).
Mr Rabin has forbidden his ministers to discuss the compensation issue. But
several times he has spoken out against settlers, lambasting their frequent
demonstrations against the autonomy plan.
On Monday, he declared their role in protecting sovereign Israel was
'marginal', adding it made his blood boil to have to deploy elite paratroops
to protect Hebron's 400 Jews. Such language would suggest Mr Rabin is ready
to evacuate settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, in a final deal with the
Palestinians.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Gaza-Jericho Autonomy: Arafat opposed from two sides - Rival
factions unable to agree a common strategy / The Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When youths in the occupied Gaza Strip burnt Mr Yassir Arafat's effigy after
the Hebron mosque massacre in February it sent shock waves to the PLO
chairman's Tunis headquarters. The message from Gaza appeared to be that Mr
Arafat's personal popularity was disintegrating rapidly.
Palestinian opposition to the Gaza-Jericho self-rule accord has gathered
momentum during the months of negotiations with Israel. Mr Arafat will face
a formidable challenge in winning back discontented Palestinians and
creating a sustainable support base for the agreement. Much will depend on
how he manages the early days of the transition to self-rule and meets
Palestinian demands for democracy, economic improvement and transparency.
At every turn Mr Arafat will face opposition from people bent on undermining
the agreement, exploiting any mistake or proving that the PLO has failed to
achieve the fundamental aspirations of the Palestinian nation.
Two groups of opponents confront Mr Arafat in the territories:
First there is a broad opposition coalition between the two extremist
Islamic groups - the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement and the Islamic Jihad
combined with the left-wing groups inside the PLO - the Democratic Front for
the Liberation of Palestine and the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine. Six other minor Palestinian factions are in this coalition called
the Palestine Forces Alliance.
Second, and potentially much more dangerous for Mr Arafat, is the growing
opposition within Mr Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction both inside and
outside the occupied territories and from powerful independent politicians
such as Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi, the Gaza elder statesman and former chief PLO
negotiator.
Hamas is by far the most powerful faction in the Palestine Forces Alliance.
It is a highly organised, underground movement with a powerful ideological
Islamic appeal to frustrated youths. In the West Bank, Hamas has active
cells in Jenin, Nablus, Hebron and Ramallah and has a bedrock support base
of about a fifth of Gaza's 850,000 residents.
The PFLP is well represented among students and professional associations in
the West Bank and Gaza. Although the Red Eagles, its military wing, has been
relatively inactive recently it has considerable experience of armed
struggle against Israel.
Fortunately for Mr Arafat the Islamic groups and the secular PLO factions
have been unable so far to agree a common strategy to defeat the
Gaza-Jericho accord because of their incompatible ideologies. They have also
pledged not to engage in violent conflict with Mr Arafat's PLO camp. But
they are determined to continue the armed struggle against Israel. The
opposition believe that Mr Arafat will be unable to solve the huge problems
and that continued Israeli intervention and the presence of Jewish
settlements in self-rule areas will turn more and more people against Mr
Arafat.
The mainstream opposition to Mr Arafat will be more politically difficult,
particularly inside the Fatah faction and among those leaders inside the
occupied territories. Mr Hani al-Hassan and Mohammed Ghneim (Abu Maher),
Fatah co-founders, lead the opposition inside Mr Arafat's faction.
In the West Bank senior political figures in the West Bank such as Mr Faisal
Husseini, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi and Mr Saeb Erekat - the three key PLO
negotiators before the Gaza-Jericho agreement - have been warning Mr Arafat,
even up to the last minute, of the dangers of signing an agreement which
appears to fall so short of Palestinian demands.
In Gaza, Mr Abdel-Shafi, who until recently supported trying to make the
agreement work, last month circulated a petition signed by 22 other
Palestinian leaders which said an agreement which did not halt Jewish
settlement would lack all legitimacy 'and shall therefore not be binding on
the Palestinian people, its institutions, public figures and political
forces'.
Mr Arafat is counting that some opposition will fade when he makes his
historic return to Gaza-Jericho next month and begins to disburse some of
the Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 820m) of foreign aid pledged by international
donors for the next three years. He also believes the withdrawal of the
Israeli soldiers and their replacement with a Palestinian police force will
be popular.
Mr Soufian Abu Zayda, an Arafat loyalist and senior Fatah official in Gaza,
warned of the dangers Mr Arafat will face if he fails to meet Palestinian
expectations. 'There cannot be a dictatorship in Palestine.
'If Arafat does not bring democracy there will be a revolution not only
against the dictatorship but against the peace process.'

FT  05 MAY 94 / Gaza-Jericho Autonomy: Decades of neglect leave unemployment
as the norm - The economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Groups of young men sit outside their concrete breeze-block shacks in the
middle of the day in the sprawling rubbish streets of Jabalya refugee camp
in the occupied Gaza Strip. For many Palestinian youths, unemployment is the
expected norm.
Creating jobs for the 800,000 residents of the Strip, where 40-50 per cent
of the workforce is unemployed and the population is growing at 4.6 per cent
a year, will be the immediate challenge for the incoming Palestinian
authority.
The Palestinians will also need to reverse decades of Egyptian and Israeli
neglect which have left Gaza's sewerage, water, roads, power, communications
and housing in disrepair and chaos. The World Bank says the Israeli-run
civil administration of the occupied territories for 27 years had an
unusually low rate of investment, only 3 per cent of gross domestic product.
A recent International Labour Organisation report warned unemployment could
worsen unless the Palestinian administration puts in place an immediate
programme for up to 12,000 freed detainees, along with temporary public
works measures to employ a further 15,000 workers.
Many of Gaza's problems are repeated in Jericho and the West Bank. But Gaza,
which has an annual per capita income of Dollars 850 (Pounds 566), will be
the real test for the economic challenges of peace. Unless Gazans feels a
rapid change in living standards, the already fragile support for the peace
process may collapse. Unmet expectations may fuel Islamic and other groups
which reject peace with Israel.
'If the peace process is to have any hope of success, the Palestinians need
to see improvements in the living conditions quickly,' Mr Caio Koch-Weser,
World Bank vice president, said this week.
Total GDP for the West Bank and Gaza Strip is Dollars 3bn, less than 5 per
cent of the Israeli economy. Creating economic growth will not be easy.
First, the Palestinians must untangle a web of regulations over investment,
land and trade which scared away private-sector investment. The biggest
factory in the Gaza Strip is the Seven-Up bottling company, and industry's
share of GDP is less than 10 per cent. Second, the Palestinians must create
credible economic institutions free from the political interference of the
PLO.
The economic protocol with Israel will considerably aid the Palestinians in
giving them access to the huge market next door. Mr Samir Houleila, a
Palestinian economist, says the agreement will create an immediate lowering
in costs of production and living.
This is because Palestinians have won a lower rate of VAT and direct
taxation, lower customs duties on many imports mainly for construction, and
cheaper sources of oil which will let them price petroleum products freely -
except petrol which can be only 15 per cent lower than Israeli pump prices.
In agriculture, which accounts for at least a quarter of Palestinian GDP,
the economic accord grants Palestinians the right to export to Israel for
the first time since 1967. All farm products will be exported freely except
for five items subject to a sliding quota scale until 1999. Lower labour and
production costs should let Palestinians compete effectively with Israeli
farmers.
The Palestinians will also be much helped by a Dollars 1.2bn, three-year
emergency aid programme announced by the World Bank this week. About half
the package, which will inject Dollars 200 a year in aid per person, is
targeted on transport, water supply, housing and education.
International donors are increasingly concerned about the Palestinian
ability to absorb the aid, spend it on productive projects and create the
capacity to manage their own economy. The World Bank's report acknowledges
the risk that some aid could end up being used for 'political' construction
projects that are not needed and line the pockets of politically-connected
businessmen.
Institutions such as the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and
Reconstruction, which will co-ordinate aid with donors, will be play a vital
role. Senior Palestinian economists fear the PLO may not allow independent
and efficient institutions to emerge.
'The problem for the PLO is to realise that it is no longer in exile and
needs different capacity, different organisational structure based on
efficiency, professionalism and transparency,' said Mr Houleila.
Another problem is skills gaps in the occupied territories, especially in
economic and financial management. Mr Houleila said recent efforts to
recruit personnel from the Arab world have been a failure; he urged Arab
governments to give key workers a sabbatical to work in Gaza-Jericho for a
year. Foreign technical assistance and training programmes, such as Bank of
England assistance with the Palestinian Monetary Authority, will be
critical.
Raising their own revenue, building an independent sustainable base to
finance domestic activities and avoiding aid dependence will be a vital
challenge. Israel will help by transferring 75 per cent of income tax levied
on Palestinian migrant workers in Israel to the 'Palestinian treasury'. But
improving tax collection in Gaza-Jericho will not be easy.
Ultimately, much will depend on the Palestinians building a stable free
market environment to attract the billions of dollars held by the
Palestinian business diaspora.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Gaza-Jericho Autonomy: New realities outweighed crises on
road to accord - The overview
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The worst crises in the Middle East can also be the best harbingers of hope.
Just eight months after the end of the Gulf war, during which Palestinians
cheered Iraq's President Saddam Hussein and the Scud missiles he fired into
Israel, members of the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel sat down
together for the first time in Madrid. Little more than 11 weeks after an
Israeli extremist shot dead 29 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque, Israel and
the PLO have filled in some of the many gaps in the outline peace agreement
signed in Washington on September 13.
If there is a lesson to be learned, it must be that the fundamentals of
international politics are a much better guide to the future than short-term
manifestations of long-running conflicts.
Mr Saddam ignored the new world realities, and the Iraqi people are still
paying the price. Israel's Arab neighbours and the PLO have better
understood the consequences of the Soviet Union's demise, and appreciated
they had little choice but to press ahead with the course mapped out for
them at the Madrid peace conference in October 1991.
For the PLO, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, it has not been the peace process
they would have wished. Israel has not been required to fulfil UN Security
Council resolutions by withdrawing from all the land it has occupied since
1967.
Instead, Israel has shown it will bargain hard over every inch of territory,
and intends to keep a significant part of it, including east Jerusalem and
adjacent swathe of still-expanding Jewish settlements which cut deep into
the West Bank.
Under the Washington agreement, this issue, linked inextricably to the
Palestinian goal of an independent state, need not be addressed for another
two years. During that time, Palestinians and Israelis may learn better how
to live alongside each other. But it also a dangerously long time for
resentments to fester, extremists to provoke, leaders to change, and the
overall political climate of the region to deteriorate.
The peace process is also being led by men approaching the end of their
political careers. Democratic systems provide mechanisms for succession, but
in the cases of President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, King Hussein of Jordan
and Mr Yassir Arafat of the PLO, the departure of any one could inject a
dangerous uncertainty into the region.
Each has a political authority established over decades, and the confidence
to take hard decisions. In the months ahead, none will be more critically
challenged than Mr Arafat as he faces the domestic consequences of the deal
he has negotiated with Israel.
He must be able to demonstrate not only immediate economic benefits, but
also the skills of conciliation needed to heal the rifts with his numerous
critics in the West Bank and Gaza, while building a responsive bureaucracy.
All this, while Israel makes sure he adheres to every last detail of the
agreement.
Mr Assad, who shares with Mr Rabin a distaste for shaking the Palestinian
leader's hand, will meanwhile continue to exhibit his legendary patience.
The Syrian regime is well aware no Middle East peace deal can be complete or
durable without its participation, and will continue to hope its improved
relationship with the US is the key to securing a full Israeli withdrawal
from the Golan Heights.
Without such a commitment, Mr Assad knows a resolution of the conflict in
south Lebanon is not possible, and will seek to keep King Hussein wedded to
his pledge not to go the way of Mr Arafat and sign a separate deal with
Israel.
The Syrian leader is not alone in his scepticism about Israel's intentions.
A common theme running through the different strains of Islamic militancy in
the Middle East is a rejection of the peace process and hostility towards
the Jewish state.
Iran is the most obvious example, but this hostility also surfaces in
Algeria, Sudan, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and, of course, among the
Palestinian community. The best antidote to such militancy, born essentially
out of deprivation, has to be economic co-operation, development, and
budgets no longer dominated by military expenditure.
The swift injection of international aid into the Gaza Strip and West Bank
should provide early evidence of the extent to which economic improvement
can offset political militancy. But, ultimately, the momentum of the peace
process will be maintained, or lost, by the people of Israel.
Because Israel is so supreme in the region, militarily and politically
through the support of the US, it will have to decide whether it can give
enough, not to satisfy Arab leaders, but to offer the people they represent
real hope for the future.
The agreement signed in Cairo yesterday is just one modest step towards that
objective. Further progress will test the fragility of Israeli coalition
politics as never before.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Japanese atrocity 'a hoax' says minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's new justice minister, Mr Shigeto Nagano, yesterday confronted the
minority government with a potential crisis by claiming that an infamous
wartime atrocity never happened.
Mr Nagano said the 1937 Nanking massacre, in which the Japanese army killed
tens of thousands of Chinese civilians, was a 'fabrication'. His comments,
in an interview with the Mainichi newspaper, could provoke calls for his
resignation.
China last night expressed shock and indignation, suggesting that the
outburst could hamper Tokyo's efforts to improve relations with its
neighbours. A foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing, quoted by the official
Chinese news agency Xinhua, said Japanese military aggression had caused
great suffering for the Chinese and the Nanking massacre had been one of the
most serious episodes.
Mr Nagano, 71, a member of the occupying forces in China and a former army
chief of staff, said it was 'wrong to say the war was a war of aggression',
and that reports of the Nanking massacre and other Japanese atrocities were
'hoaxes'. According to the official account to the 1948 Tokyo war crimes
tribunal, 155,000 died in Nanking at the hands of invading Japanese forces.
The controversy Mr Nagano's claims will arouse will further weaken the
vulnerable government. Mr Nagano's outburst contradicts the line taken by Mr
Koji Kakizawa, foreign minister, that the new government shares the former
Hosokawa administration's apologetic stance on Japan's war record.
However, Mr Nagano does reflect a continuing mood of hawkish unrepentance
among a minority of Japanese politicians, such as Mr Shintaro Ishihara, a
member of the right wing of the opposition Liberal Democratic party and a
fierce critic of Mr Hosokawa's attempts to confront wartime guilt. Mr
Ishihara has claimed the Chinese account of Nanking was untrue.
The Social Democratic party, the second largest opposition party, will use
Mr Nagano's statement to demonstrate its contention that the five-party
coalition government is artificially dominated by the right wing. Mr Nagano,
a member of the LDP until last year, belongs to Mr Hata's Japan Renewal
party, which dominates coalition policy.
This will add extra weight to opposition fears that the Hata administration
wants to revise Japan's pacifist constitution to allow full military
contributions to UN peacekeeping operations. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the JRP's
deputy leader, is a keen advocate of this, on the grounds that Japan should
assume greater responsibility if it wants to earn the right to greater
international influence.
However, the Socialists and several other centre-left parties oppose
changing the constitution, for fear of rekindling nationalism.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Markets have gone too far, says Bentsen
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration has come a long way in its remarks on exchange
rates since taking office 15 months ago.
A year ago, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, prompted the dollar to
slide to Y118.20, at the time its lowest level in four decades, when he
observed in passing at the Washington National Press Club that he would like
to see a stronger yen.
A few weeks later, President Bill Clinton, asked how the US trade deficit
with Japan could be reduced, responded: 'Number one, the appreciation of the
Japanese yen.' The dollar duly dipped further.
The administration has since then become more wary of commenting on foreign
exchange issues. The Treasury is now in the habit of carefully drafting
short and precise statements, and senior officials decline pointedly to
elaborate.
Nothing has served to reverse the impression that the Clinton
administration, with its entire international economic policy built on a
promise to open up markets overseas, would still not be averse to a lower
dollar-yen rate in its search for ways of penetrating the Japanese market.
'It's got to the point now where the market interprets any comment from the
administration as tacit acceptance of the dollar moving further down,' says
Mr Ravi Bulchandani, an economist with Morgan Stanley, the New York
investment bank.
Mr Bentsen's statements have had to become more and more explicit in their
rejection of a further depreciation of the dollar. 'We're not going to try
to devalue ourselves into their markets. We are in no way managing the
dollar in that regard,' he said before meeting fellow finance ministers from
the Group of Seven leading industrial nations two weeks ago.
Yesterday, he had to move even further, insisting in a two-paragraph
statement accompanying concerted intervention by G7 central banks in support
of the dollar that the administration 'sees no advantage in an undervalued
currency'.
'These operations reflect our view that recent movements in exchange markets
have gone beyond what is justified by economic fundamentals,' Mr Bentsen
said.
Mr Bentsen's assessment, backed by the other G7 ministers, has the economic
numbers on its side. Judging by continuing strong data, the US recovery is
still far stronger than either Japan's or Germany's.
Yesterday's intervention may, in fact, have some enduring effect on the
dollar's value against the D-Mark and other European currencies, which has
slumped in the wake of its plunge against the yen.
'They have a fair chance of stabilising the dollar against the D-Mark. In
that instance, co-ordinated intervention is acting in the same direction as
prospective monetary policy changes,' says Mr Bulchandani, noting that while
the German Bundesbank is expected to keep lowering its interest rates, the
Federal Reserve is expected to keep raising its.
But traders still seem unpersuaded, while trade tension with Japan remains
unresolved, of the administration's commitment to a serious reversal in
dollar-yen trends.
The recent change in the Japanese government has done nothing to raise hopes
of an early settlement to the row.
Market analysts interpret the administration's decision to step into the
foreign exchange market in recent days as motivated more by concern over the
knock-on effects on the bond market than by disagreement with the exchange
rates.
The sliding dollar has added a risk premium for foreign institutions
considering investing in US bonds. That has, in turn, given an extra spin to
the wheel of rising long-term interest rates, which had already begun to
move quite fast enough for the administration's taste, in response to the
Fed's tightening of short-term interest rates and to ever-increasing
inflationary fears.
Against this background, the administration may have to brace itself for a
steeper rise in long-term interest rates before the dollar returns to
stability.

FT  05 MAY 94 / ADB loans policy angers Asians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   NICE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Asian developing countries yesterday made public their bitterness at the
linkage of a capital increase for the Asian Development Bank to new lending
policies.
A doubling of the bank's capital to Dollars 46bn (Pounds 30.6bn) is almost
certain to be formally approved by May 22 by countries holding at least 75
per cent of shares. But China has abstained from the vote and other
countries are approving it only, while recording their concern.
Industrialised countries, led by the US, have insisted that the capital
increase be linked to a switch in focus of ADB lending to issues such as
poverty and the environment. They have also linked lending to the concept of
'good governance', which, to developing countries, smacks of political
interference.
Mr Zhou Zhengqing, senior Chinese official attending the ADB's annual
meeting in Nice, said: 'China does not agree with the linkage between policy
and capital; they are totally different issues.' China viewed the change
with the 'greatest regret' and linking projects to the solution of social
problems was 'not helpful'.
China and other countries believe that ADB lending to infrastructural
projects fosters development and economic growth which, in turn, leads to
the solution of social problems.
Mr Roger Altman, deputy US Treasury Secretary, insisted the changes were in
line with those made at other multilateral development banks and reflected
the maturing of the region. 'Private capital flows have risen to the point
where financing of projects can now be absorbed by the private sector,' he
said in an interview.
'It is not as if social-sector lending doesn't have an economic pay-off,' he
added, arguing that lending to support education and health care had
longer-term economic benefits. The ADB should not, however, compete with
private-sector lending or substitute for it.
US officials said that they expected the guidelines to be applied 'flexibly
and pragmatically' and that the ADB would still have the scope to respond to
the disparate needs of borrowing members. Mr Altman declined to define 'good
governance', saying it was 'one of those things you know when you see.
There's no short answer to that question.'
Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, Indonesia's finance minister, said it was 'impractical
and unrealistic to try to devise an all-embracing set of policies for all
member countries.'
Thailand and India also expressed concern about the linkage of capital to
lending policy. Mr Mohammad Saifur Rahman, finance minister of Bangladesh,
said a majority of the ADB's developing members had been against it. 'We
wish the exercise could have been conducted in a more subtle manner,
avoiding this division,' he added.
Mr Ian de Jong, representing the Netherlands, defended the change as common
practice in international financial institutions.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Strengthening D-Mark rattles the Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'Too strong an appreciation of the D-Mark, against the dollar, for example,
is not in the interests of our economy.'
This one sentence from a speech due to be delivered at lunchtime by Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, released early yesterday, provided the
first hint of the concerted international intervention in support of the US
currency which was to follow.
It was not until late afternoon that the usually taciturn German central
bank confirmed widespread rumours that it had been in the market.
The full speech failed to enlarge significantly on the key sentence, but in
a characteristically roundabout way, it left no doubt that Mr Tietmeyer was
unsettled by recent developments.
The D-Mark was rated 'stronger rather than weaker,' Mr Tietmeyer said. Faith
in its stability remained intact, as recent volatilities connected with the
reversal of US interest rate trends had shown. But as he tried to say in his
keynote sentence, the German economic recovery - dependent on improving
exports - could be endangered if revaluation cost the domestic industry
competitiveness in terms of price.
The quotation had an immediate beneficial impact on the dollar, which was
later enhanced by an intervention from Mr Hans-Jurgen Koebnik, a more junior
member of the Bundesbank's decision-making council.
Mr Koebnik markedly reinforced expectations of further cuts in the
Bundesbank's 5 per cent discount lending rate, in an apparent attempt to
lessen the downward pressure on the dollar. All economic indicators, with
the exception of the eccentric M3 measure of money supply growth, spoke in
favour of a clear reduction 'before too long,' he said.
By 'clear,' he clarified later, he meant at least half a percentage point.
As to timing, he suggested before the end of June.
Although he stressed that this was his personal view, he said he wished that
the last discount cut - a quarter-point on April 15 - had been bigger.
Mr Tietmeyer was, as usual, no more than vaguely encouraging. He was still
worried about the extraordinary growth in M3, which is ballooning at around
2.5 times the bank's targeted annual expansion rate. Because M3 growth is
regarded as an early warning system for potential inflation, the bank had to
tread warily.
Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist and a member of its
permanent directorate, was in little doubt where most of the blame lay. In a
speech last night in Frankfurt, he blamed free-spending federal and local
governments and national institutions.
Their aggregate borrowings last year almost doubled to DM130bn, he noted.
M3's recent behaviour 'can be traced to reasons which have little or nothing
to do with monetary policy,' he said.
He echoed another passage from Mr Tietmeyer's speech in which the government
was told that spending cuts, now being introduced, had to be continued for
several years.
The implication was that it was Bonn rather than the Bundesbank which was to
blame for the slowness of interest rate cuts.

Rocket, artillery and tank battles raged in several areas of Yemen early
today and a spokesman from the North said loyal troops were under siege in
Aden, capital of the former Marxist South Yemen, Reuter reports from Sanaa.
Political sources in Sanaa, the capital, said the country's three-party
coalition government was meeting last night to consider offering its
resignation to pave the way for a new administration in the face of the
deepening crisis.
Fighting flared first yesterday in the northern town of Dhamar, 100km south
of Sanaa.
Unconfirmed reports said fighting had also spread to the northern
oil-producing region of Marib and Yarim.
South and North Yemen merged in 1990 in a 50-50 power-sharing accord between
Aden's YSP and Sanaa's General Peoples Congress but the two sides had failed
to merge their armies.

<TEXT>
Iran, its currency sliding on the open market, yesterday in effect devalued
the rial and reintroduced a multi-tier exchange rate system, Reuter reports
from Tehran.
The central bank governor, Mr Mohammad Hossein Adeli, said state banks would
offer dollars at 50 rials below the open market rate for certain imports.
This would mean banks selling dollars at about 2,700 rials, compared with
the official selling rate of 1,750.
The decision officially puts an end to a single-rate exchange system
introduced in March last year as a main element of the government's economic
liberalisation.
Money dealers said the announcement did not significantly affect open market
rates. Iranian money dealers in London quoted the dollar at 2,880 rials, 50
higher than Tuesday, the D-Mark at 1,750 rials and the pound at 4,350 rials
 -all record highs.

FT  05 MAY 94 / ANC farm policy stresses market pricing strategies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The African National Congress yesterday launched an agricultural policy
paper combining market-driven pricing strategies, a competitive exchange
rate to encourage exports, and a big increase in support for small farmers.
'We firmly believe market principles should determine prices,' Mr Derek
Hanekom, ANC agriculture spokesman, said, explaining the farming ideas the
ANC expects will form the basis of future government policy. But the paper
maintains a cautious approach to the sensitive issue of land redistribution.
The 60-page document says these and other policies 'will be implemented in
the context of a programme of land reform and rural development designed to
redistribute land to alleviate landlessness, land hunger and apartheid
dispossession'.
The land reform programme will involve both the 'restitution of land to the
victims of forced removals since 1913 through a Land Claims Court, and a
process of land redistribution to assist those with limited means denied
access to land under apartheid laws.'
But the paper does not depart from the principles set out in the ANC's main
economic policy document, The Reconstruction and Development Programme. This
calls on the government to provide 'substantial funds' for land
redistribution, but within the framework of the new constitution which
allows for expropriation but stipulates there shall be fair compensation.
South Africa's 50,000 commercial farmers, almost all white, are the main
users of the country's agricultural support services, the paper notes. About
30 per cent of them are responsible for 80 per cent of the country's farm
output.
Small-scale farming has been neglected or undermined, and one of the key
elements of ANC agricultural policy is the creation of a more diversified
farming community by supporting this sector, in part by 'modifying'
agricultural credit policies and reviewing the role of the Land Bank.
'Credit subsidies and bail-out to help commercial farmers must stop,' the
paper warns. 'Public-finance institutions should rapidly begin to redirect
grants and lending to poor farmers in consultation with local communities.'
High price incentives, input subsidies and protective import barriers cost
the consumer and taxpayer about Rand 2bn (Pounds 377m) a year, the paper
calculates. While world food prices remain depressed, the case for reducing
levels of protection as part of a broad food policy remains strong, it adds.
But the report also says 'additional food subsidies should be considered',
singling out maize and bread as the most important foodstuffs. The ANC
intends to 'remove most of the remaining statutory powers of agricultural
control boards', it goes on.
Uniform national pricing will disappear, while 'a greater emphasis will be
placed on market forces, bringing domestic producer prices more in line with
international markets'.
For the 'more strategic commodities such as maize', a state-supported
marketing agency will be required to serve the buyer of last resort through
operation of a floor price system. The floor price would be pitched at a low
level, only slightly above export parity.
Agricultural exports incentives, 'limited to a specific time period and
related to performance', will be used to increase export earnings.
'Macro-economic policy will also be important to avoid sustained currency
over-valuation and promote the competitiveness of South African
agriculture.'

FT  05 MAY 94 / UK offers Pounds 100m aid package to S Africa

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is to provide a Pounds 100m aid package to assist the new government
of South Africa over the next three years, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, announced yesterday.
He told the House of Commons that Pounds 60m would be in the form of
bilateral aid and the remainder through programmes arranged by the
Commonwealth Development Corporation and the European Union.
Mr Hurd was joined by Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's shadow foreign secretary,
and MPs of other parties in congratulating the people of South Africa on the
conduct of the election.
The foreign secretary said he would be discussing how the aid could be best
used when attending the inauguration of Mr Nelson Mandela as president on
May 10.
The Pounds 100m will be made available by the Overseas Development
Administration from its existing budget. Mr Hurd envisaged that priority
would be given to helping with policy formulation and projects in education
and health. Other aims should include enhancing productive capacity and
employment.
Mr Hurd urged British businesses with interests in South Africa to study the
opportunities and prospects opening up.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Zimbabwe cancels controversial land leases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   HARARE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Zimbabwe government has cancelled 72 farm leases under which ministers
and senior officials had occupied state land forcibly acquired from white
farmers for the resettlement of landless peasants. The move is being seen as
an exercise in damage limitation at home and abroad.
Announcing the cancellation in parliament late on Tuesday night, agriculture
minister Mr Kumbirai Kangai published the names of prominent black
Zimbabweans who had been provided with farms. The list includes the head of
the air force, the minister of education (and former agriculture minister
who piloted the controversial land legislation through parliament), the
governor of Matabeleland North, the deputy minister of industry and commerce
and several members of parliament.
Political sources insist that President Robert Mugabe was not party to the
scheme and was upset by the elitist image created by the allocation of farms
to people in well-paid positions.
Last month Mr Mugabe, who said he had not been aware that land acquired by
the state for resettlement purposes was being leased to tenant farmers as
part of the government's 'economic indigenisation' programme, promised to
cancel all leases.
The announcement has been welcomed by businessmen concerned that the
Zimbabwe investment promotion conference in London on May 19 would have been
undermined by the controversy.
While there is general acceptance of the need for the provision of more and
better land for the country's black majority, land policy has been a
persistent headache for Mr Mugabe's government.
It has run into criticism from white farmers fearing that their land will be
subject to compulsory acquisition by the state; by donors critical of the
slow pace and poor results of past resettlement programmes; and by black
Zimbabweans angry at the delays in making land available.
In 1982 the government promised to resettle 162,500 families on vacant or
under-utilised land by 1985. The programme fell well behind schedule and
latest figures put the number of families resettled at less than 65,000.
Government spokesmen blamed inadequate funding and a shortage of land and
new legislation to enable ministers to 'designate' privately owned
agricultural land was introduced.
The designation and compulsory acquisition process replaced the previous
'willing seller, willing buyer' programme applied during the 1980s.
Controversy over designation has died down in the past year as relations
improved between white commercial farmers - the main targets of designation
 -and the government. Early this year, however, independent newspapers began
reporting that state land was being leased to prominent black ministers and
officials. rather than being used for peasant resettlement.
The lease programme was stoutly defended by the government-controlled media
and by Mr Kangai despite mounting criticism from opposition politicians, the
independent media and even the ruling Zanu-PF party newspaper.
The controversy came as industrial relations problems have mounted. Junior
doctors in the government service are on strike demanding a 40 per cent pay
award, the Zimbabwe Confederation of Trade Unions and postal workers have
demanded pay awards of at least 25 per cent and school teachers are
threatening action unless they receive a 40 per cent pay increase.
Official figures show that non-farm real wages reached a 20-year low last
year. Prices have more than doubled since the launch of the country's
Economic Structural Adjustment Programme in 1991 and virtually all wage and
salary-earners have experienced a decline in real take-home pay. Real income
per head has fallen more than 10 per cent since 1991 and is currently at its
lowest level in more than a decade.
Yesterday, the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industry published a gloomy
business opinion report, suggesting that industrial production, down more
than 20 per cent in the last two years will take at least another two years
to regain its 1991 output levels.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Abattoir row fans flames of faith: Delhi butchers are up in
arms over court case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India's Supreme Court is due to decide today on a case of immense interest
to Delhi's butchers, their customers, vegetarian critics and the city's many
vultures.
The learned judges will consider whether to re-open the city's only
abattoir, shut for more than a month. The closure, stemming from the order
of a lower court, was ostensibly on health grounds.
But the case touches on issues of faith and diet central to the beliefs of
many Indians: while many Hindus are vegetarian, Moslems tend to be hearty
meat-eaters.
Already, the case has attracted wild accusations from both sides, some
Hindus claiming the abattoir was partly used for the illegal slaughter of
sacred cows, and some Moslems condemning the affair as an anti-Moslem
conspiracy.
Meanwhile, meat prices have doubled; luxury hotels have started shipping
meat from as far away as Jaipur, some 250 miles distant, and cheaper
establishments have been forced to take kebabs off the menu.
The argument was started by Mrs Maneka Gandhi, a former minister and widow
of Mr Sanjay Gandhi, Mrs Indira Gandhi's playboy son. Mrs Maneka Gandhi is
India's best-known vegetarian, who bans even her dogs from eating meat. They
have to chew on grain and pulses.
An anti-slaughter movement launched by Mrs Gandhi filed a court action
earlier this year demanding that the 90-year-old abbatoir be closed on
health grounds.
The Delhi High Court accepted the evidence of bad conditions, poor hygiene
and the dumping of untreated waste. On March 18 it ordered the abattoir to
close, pending immediate renovation.
The judges also ruled that when it re-opened, the butchers could slaughter
only 2,500 animals a day, enough for Delhi's consumption, but not for
exports to other parts of India and abroad. Before the row, some
13,000-14,000 buffaloes, sheep and goats were slaughtered daily.
The 25,000 butchers, porters, drivers and other workers, mostly Moslems,
went on strike. Some have joined a black market trade, illegally bringing
into the city animals slaughtered elsewhere.
A killing ground has developed on the edges of the national and
international airports, attracting vultures away from their normal haunts,
and into the flight paths of aircraft. After two bird-strikes, extra
sharp-shooters have been posted around the runways.
Mrs Gandhi argues her movement is not about imposing vegetarianism but
promoting the humane slaughter of meat. The butchers, particularly Moslems,
claim they are being treated unfairly.
'They are calling us criminals. Our community is upset,' says Mr Mohammed
Haneef Qureshi, a Moslem butcher and president of the Delhi Meat
Association.
He claims sick people are suffering for lack of meat. Moslem celebrations
are not what they were. 'Normally we eat mutton. Now we must make do with
chicken and vegetables.'

of parliament has been involved in drug trafficking to the US, it said
yesterday. The disclosure is the latest in a series of embarrassing drug
scandals involving Thai politicians.
Mr Den Tohmeena, deputy interior minister, said he would visit the US this
week to seek details of the accusations against Mr Thanong Siripreechapong,
an MP for the Chart Thai party, in talks with the US Drug Enforcement
Administration.
A US court last year ordered the seizure of Mr Thanong's Los Angeles home
and a Mercedes Benz car on the grounds they had been bought with profits
from narcotics smuggling. According to a US prosecutor, Mr Thanong earned
more than Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) by arranging marijuana shipments to the
US. Efforts to contact Mr Thanong yesterday were unsuccessful.
Thai drug enforcement officials said yesterday that the US had asked the
Thais to freeze the MP's assets in Thailand as well, but the US embassy in
Bangkok could not confirm this. Western diplomats said the Thai authorities
could seize assets under Thai law, but the US had simply asked the
government to notify Mr Thanong of the seizure of his US assets.
The timing of the accusations surfacing in the Thai press this week against
Mr Thanong is convenient for the coalition government (its efforts to reform
the constitution are being blocked by the opposition parties), but Mr
Thanong is not the first Thai politician against whom such allegations have
been made.
Two years ago, Mr Narong Wongwan, a powerful businessman refused entry to
the US because of his alleged links to heroin trafficking, was nominated by
a group of pro-military parties as prime minister. But the accusations
stopped him gaining the job.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Australia plans ADollars 6.5bn jobs package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The Australian government yesterday proposed spending ADollars 6.5bn over
the next four years in an effort to address the nation's chronic
unemployment problem and reach an unemployment rate of about 5 per cent by
the end of the decade.
Among the extensive measures, set out in a White Paper on Employment and
Growth and presented to parliament by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister,
is a ADollars 4.6bn 'job compact' for the long-term unemployed. This will
offer either subsidised employment, primarily in the private sector, or work
experience and training to all long-term unemployed people of 18-plus.
However, if they do not participate, they will risk losing unemployment
benefit.
Under the scheme, employers will be offered subsidies, ranging from ADollars
100 to ADollars 230 a week, for periods of 13 to 26 weeks, to encourage them
to take on unemployed people. There will be a bonus of ADollars 500 for
employers who continue to employ the person for 12 months - that is, after
the subsidies have stopped.
In addition, as part of the 'job compact', ADollars 1.46bn will be spent on
creating 'new work opportunities', primarily in remote areas.
The white paper also envisages a 'youth training initiative', giving 15-17
year-olds work experience or training while paying them a youth training
allowance; a restructuring of the much-criticised Commonwealth Employment
Service, opening case management of the unemployed to competition from the
private sector; and some significant reforms of the social security system
to encourage unemployed people to take part-time work.
At present, many people - especially women - complain that there is a
disincentive to do this, because they lose more in benefits than they gain
in income.
Unemployment has become a serious bugbear for Mr Keating's Labor government.
While the economy has been performing very well in recent months - with last
year's growth rate reaching 4 per cent - unemployment remains stuck at more
than 10 per cent. Some 350,000 people are reckoned to be 'long-term'
unemployed - that is, without a job for more than a year.
Several studies have suggested that even if growth rates remain at about 3.5
per cent for the rest of the decade unemployment would only fall to about 7
per cent by 2000, with around 200,000 long-term unemployed. For a government
which is closely tied to the union movement, yet bent on encouraging the
industrial sector to become internationally competitive and more efficient,
these stubborn numbers have become a serious embarrassment.
Mr Keating said yesterday the white paper represented a 'statement about the
two imperatives of a decent society - compassion and strength'.
The possibility that high levels of unemployment could persist despite
strong growth if the government did not intervene was, he said, 'not only
profoundly unfair, it is profoundly inefficient'.
The package brought mixed reactions. The coalition opposition attacked it as
a 'Labor spending spree', that would add pressure to interest rates. 'It is
clear that the burden of taxation is going to rise,' commented Mr Alexander
Downer, the shadow treasurer.
The stockmarket also weakened, with dealers saying that budget worries were
beginning to loom. The government's finance package for 1994/5 is due next
week, and there is now considerable interest in how the government will
finance the jobs measures - somewhat costlier than expected - and still meet
its deficit reduction targets.

FT  05 MAY 94 / China seeks meeting soon on finance for HK airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
China yesterday requested a meeting in the next week or so of a high-level
group charged with deciding how to finance Hong Kong's new airport and its
connecting railway.
British and Hong Kong government officials had expected a formal meeting of
the airport committee, an adjunct of the Joint Liaison Group (JLG) which
oversees the colony's transfer to Chinese sovereignty, but not so soon. Such
a meeting would raise hopes of an early resolution to the financing of the
airport.
The Chinese request is linked to the presence in the colony of Mr Lu Ping,
Beijing's top official on Hong Kong affairs. He is making his first visit
since January 1992. On Tuesday evening, he said he thought an agreement on
the financing of the airport acceptable to both sides could be reached soon.
Mr Lu has attracted much criticism in the Hong Kong colony for his refusal
to meet Governor Chris Patten, or be questioned by the colony's media. The
surprise Chinese overture on the airport may be his attempt to salvage what
has begun to look like a public relations failure for Mr Lu.
But it is also in step with the noticeable thaw in Beijing's hard line on
dealing with the British on Hong Kong matters. China is studying the fourth
financial plan for the airport and its railway.
This provides for an increase in the government's equity contribution to
airport and railway to HKDollars 60bn (Pounds 5.4bn), from HKDollars 45bn,
and a cut in the amount of debt needed to finance the project to HKDollars
23bn from HKDollars 38bn.
Behind-the-scenes discussions about the airport have been going on for the
past few months. Recently, a senior member of the Chinese JLG paid a visit
to the airport site to assess work in progress.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Berlusconi to inherit economy on the mend: The incoming
government has room for manoeuvre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The incoming Italian government will inherit an economy showing timid signs
of recovery after two years of recession.
Coupled with the innate optimism of the Italian business community, Mr
Silvio Berlusconi's government will have a positive atmosphere in which to
frame economic policy.
Though the senior ranks of Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation,
have been careful to retain their distance from Mr Berlusconi in the media
magnate's new role as a politician, the rank-and-file membership openly
endorses him as able to head Italy's first genuinely 'pro-business'
government. They also consider it propitious, despite Mr Berlusconi's lack
of political experience, that he should be taking office at the moment of
recovery.
'I can see signs of the recovery written on the faces of our members,' says
Mr Stefano Micosi, Confindustria's head of research. However, he warns: 'The
recovery is still export-led; domestic demand remains weak and the
industrial recovery is patchy.'
Exports grew an average 18 per cent, with more than double that level to
newly industrialised countries, and the trend is continuing. Industries in
Lombardy and the Po Valley have begun to rebuild stocks and recommission
spare capacity. The south, meanwhile, is still gripped by recession, and
unemployment there is almost three times the national average of 10.7 per
cent.
Istat, the national statistics institute, pointing to a revised index of
industrial production, said output was still declining even in the first
three months of this year; the old index began to climb in the last quarter
of 1993.
The old index tends to square with the 0.3 per cent year-on-year fourth
quarter increase in GDP, which also finds confirmation in the official
monthly surveys of business and consumer confidence which bottomed out last
November. The key indices of business opinion for machine tools showed
domestic orders up 44 per cent in the first quarter compared with 1993.
In this uncertain climate of tentative recovery, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi,
the outgoing prime minister, has been cautious. But last week at the annual
Turin motor show he declared: 'The recession is behind us.'
As a former governor of the Bank of Italy and having made economic
management a central pillar of his year-long premiership, Mr Ciampi has
every interest in demonstrating the worst is over without encouraging
overdue optimism.
But Mr Ciampi's audience in Turin, which had seen demand for cars drop 20
per cent in 1993, scented a change. The Fiat-dominated automotive industry
expects car production to increase 12 per cent this year.
Already Fiat shares on the Milan stock exchange have risen on hopes of the
automotive industry being the engine for recovery.
The stock market has witnessed an unprecedented boom since Mr Berlusconi's
right-wing Freedom Alliance won the general election at the end of March.
The lira has also recovered from nearly L1,000 against the D-Mark to L950.
This reflects confidence that the new government will favour business
against a background of continued low inflation (running at an annualised 4
per cent) and improvements in the balance of payments.
However, the Ciampi government's projections for 1.6 per cent growth this
year, drawn up last autumn for the 1994 budget, still seem optimistic. The
International Monetary Fund recently produced its own forecast of 1.1 per
cent against the 0.7 per cent negative growth of 1993.
The IMF, like the Bank of Italy, prefers to focus attention on unresolved
business: the inter-connected problems of the continuing large budget
deficit and the huge stock of state debt. The latest figures suggest a
combination of lower Treasury receipts in 1993, the slower than expected
growth in 1994 and heavy social security spending have undermined the hope
of reducing the budget deficit to 8.7 per cent of GDP, as planned.
The deficit looks set to remain around 10 per cent without remedial measures
and the primary surplus (the budgetary balance excluding interest payments
on debt) will be cut by two-thirds. Meanwhile the debt stock continues to
increase and is now close to 120 per cent of GDP.
As a condition of obtaining an Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.3bn) loan last year from the
EU, Italy undertook to reduce the budget deficit and conform to the
Maastricht treaty convergence criteria. This, coupled with the 1994 budget
already having been approved by parliament, places constraints on the extent
of initiatives by the incoming government.
Thus it would be surprising, and would be judged negatively by the markets,
if corrective measures were not introduced before the summer to hold the
budget deficit down to its planned levels of around L144,000bn (Pounds
60bn). Economists differ on the extent of the money needing to be found
either through spending cuts or new fiscal measures, or a combination of the
two. The amount varies between L5,000bn to L10,000bn.
However, Mr Berlusconi has to balance short-term remedial measures with a
more general consideration. Instinctively, he would like to give the economy
some stimulus to encourage the recovery, having promised to cut taxes and
provide 1m jobs. To achieve this, he will have to reach a clear
understanding with the unions, a good deal of luck.
Those close to the next government argue that the extra budget revenue now
needed can be raised by 'swinging the axe' at the enormous amount of fat
still contained in Italy's inefficient public sector. This is easier said
than done, given the inertia of Italy's bureaucracy. But whatever happens
the incoming government will seek to give itself space by blaming the
inheritance it has received.

Turkey's annual inflation rate rose to 107 per cent last month, in the wake
of the recent wave of price rises in state-controlled commodities. According
to figures from the state statistics institute, monthly consumer prices rose
24.7 per cent in April. The wholesale index rose 32.8 per cent, giving an
annual wholesale index of 125.5 per cent, while monthly prices of
state-controlled products went up a hefty 55 per cent. The price rises form
part of the austerity programme unveiled last month by Mrs Tansu Ciller,
prime minister, in an effort to reduce the budget deficit and restore
confidence. A mission from the International Monetary Fund is in Ankara to
discuss the programme with a view to agreeing a letter of intent and a
stand-by facility which would pave the way for Turkey to return to
international debt markets. The government is projecting zero growth for
1994. The programme envisages a 50 per cent cut in the central government
deficit to TL90,000bn for 1994.
A further improvement in Spain's trade figures in March reduced the
first-quarter deficit to Pta389bn (Pounds 1.9bn), 23 per cent less than in
the same period last year. The Economy Ministry saw the figures as
confirmation of a recovery, with exports 44 per cent up at Pta2,359bn and
imports up 28 per cent to Pta2,748bn. The March deficit was 17 per cent
lower than a year ago at Pta164bn.
The Belgian National Bank yesterday cut its key central rate for money
market lending by 10 points to 5.50 per cent.
Russia's April inflation was 9.7 per cent a month, up from 8.7 per cent in
March but below a monthly average of 20 per cent last year and 22 per cent
in January.

Mr Yannos Papantoniou, 45, a British-trained economist, yesterday took over
as Greece's economy minister, following the death of Mr Giorgos Gennimatas.
His appointment signalled that there will be no tightening of economic
policy, despite European Commission calls for immediate spending cuts to
reduce the public sector deficit. This year's government borrowing
requirement is projected at more than 17 per cent of gross domestic product,
against a budget target of 12.8 per cent. A technocrat with few close
friends in the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement, Mr Papantoniou
lacks the authority to impose overdue but unpopular measures, such as
freezing recruitment in the public sector. He could also face problems
launching the flotation of OTE, the state telecoms company.

West German industrial orders rose for the third month in a row in March,
showing an increase of almost 3 per cent over the previous month, and
reinforcing expectations of economic recovery. Export orders rose by 5.8 per
cent and domestic industrial orders by 1.2 per cent, but domestic consumer
demand continues to flag, with consumer goods orders declining by 3.7 per
cent in the same period. The best performing sector was capital goods, with
orders up 5 per cent, according to economics ministry figures. Orders for
raw materials and intermediate goods were up 3 per cent. Industrial
production figures for March are expected to show an increase of 1.5-2 per
cent, after a rise of 1.3 per cent in February, the first rises in nearly
two years.

The future of eastern Germany's largest steel mill was yesterday thrown into
jeopardy after Riva, the Italian privately-owned steel company, said it
could not acquire the plant under the current arrangements. Officials from
the Treuhand privatisation agency said yesterday, however, that a new round
of talks would take place next week. Earlier in the day, Ms Birgit Breuel,
Treuhand president, and Mr Emilio Riva had met in Berlin in an attempt to
unlock the dispute between Riva and IG Metall, Germany's large engineering
union. At issue in the dispute between both sides is the way in which Riva
will reduce the workforce this year, what it will do with Ekostahl's
subsidiary companies, and the composition of the supervisory board.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister and reluctant co-parent of the
Eurofighter 2000, was conspicuous by his absence at yesterday's official
unveiling at Warton, in northern England. He apparently had an important
meeting with South Korea's defence minister in Germany, which stopped him
attending the christening of the Pounds 30bn project.
His absence fuelled suspicion that his well-known scepticism about the
Eurofighter remains undiminished. Certainly, his deputy, Mr Jorg Schoenbohm,
waxed long about the responsibility of manufacturers to keep down the cost
of the ambitious project, which aims to meet Europe's air defence needs for
the next 20 years.
Mr Schoenbohm was extremely cautious about committing Germany to the
production phase of the aircraft. It was, he said, 'a decision which
requires very broad consensus and no decisions can be taken until after the
(federal) elections' later this year. He added: 'Eurofighter is not a
monopoly supplier. Germany has other options.'
The Spanish minister, Mr Julian Garca Vargas, also tempered his enthusiasm
with warnings that 'we must think very carefully before we spend every
peseta'.
Perhaps Mr Ruhe simply stayed away to avoid the embarrassment of a grounded
aircraft. It was a typically robust Lancashire spring day at British
Aerospace's Warton airfield and officials grumbled all morning that wind
might keep Europe's most expensive baby on the ground.
But there was no need to worry. The aircraft took off on time and, after a
number of passes over the field, came together with Tornado, Jaguar, Harrier
and Hawk fighters in an impressive 'diamond nine' close formation.
All the tools of the marketing trade were there to help the Eurofighter on
its way. In scenes which would have amazed the Spitfire's designers, straw
boaters and smoke, lasers and light shows filled the hangar. Some of the
proud parents were unstinting in their praise. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK
defence secretary, said that as well as developing technology and protecting
jobs, Eurofighter would give pilots the confidence to tackle 'any tasks we
may ask them to undertake'.
The aircraft is intended to beat any fighter currently under design, apart
from the US F-22, which is much more expensive. At present, Europe has
nothing decisively superior to the Russian Mig-20.
The Italian minister, Mr Fabio Fabbri, was similarly enthusiastic, though
all ministers shied away from revealing how many they would buy.
Although political uncertainty continues, at least the technical capacity of
the Eurofighter is becoming clear. The test pilots say it is a great
success. While they continue with development work, they will have to hope
that the politicians continue to agree.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Corruption crisis grows for Gonzalez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, yesterday came under further
pressure to regain the political initiative as newspapers published more
allegations about corruption cases which yesterday claimed a second
ministerial victim in five days.
The agriculture minister, Mr Vicente Albero, resigned over his failure to
meet his tax obligations. This followed the departure from the government
last weekend of the interior minister, Mr Antoni Asuncion, over the case of
former Civil Guard chief, Mr Lus Roldan, who is accused of embezzling public
funds and is now on the run from police.
Mr Gonzalez, who has formally accepted the resignations of both ministers,
is expected to disclose the names of replacements today when he holds a news
conference.
The case of Mr Roldan, combined with allegations of tax fraud against former
Bank of Spain governor, Mr Mariano Rubio, has presented the government with
one of its worst political crises in almost 12 years in power. Opposition
parties have repeatedly called for Mr Gonzalez himself to resign or call new
general elections. The Catalan nationalists, on whom Mr Gonzalez depends for
support to keep his minority government afloat, have called for concrete
steps against corruption if they are to continue backing him.
The daily newspaper El Pas yesterday published what it said were secret
documents showing that the Civil Guard, under Mr Roldan's direction, held
negotiations in 1991 with a French criminal organisation to obtain
information on the Basque terrorist group Eta. In return, the French group
was to be given assistance in purchasing government-owned property in Madrid
at below-market prices. But it later pulled out of the deal.
Meanwhile, Mr Rubio, former central bank governor and the other main figure
at the centre of the recent controversies, was arrested, along with an
investment broker, Mr Manuel de la Concha. The state news agency Efe
reported they were being charged with falsifying documents and tax fraud. Mr
Rubio, governor from 1986 to 1992, has formally resigned as an adviser to
the bank.
Mr Rubio is accused of avoiding tax by keeping stock investment gains in a
secret account at Ibercorp, a private investment bank run by Mr de la
Concha, who is also a former head of the Madrid stock exchange. Mr de la
Concha was censured in 1992 by both the National Securities Market
Commission and the Bank of Spain for irregular dealings.
In his resignation statement, Mr Albero, the agriculture minister, said he
was stepping down because of his failure to account for investment earnings
on tax declarations. He said Mr de la Concha had handled some of his
investments and he wanted to avoid embarassing the government.
As the wave of scandals spread, Mr Rubio's successor as Bank of Spain
governor, Mr Lus Angel Rojo, yesterday defended himself against allegations
of links to the Rubio affair following a report showing that he invested
funds through the same agent.
Mr Rojo, who was deputy governor under Mr Rubio, said he had opened a stock
account with Mr De la Concha in 1987 but had no say in how it was managed.
The investment, he said, involved 'a modest sum of money' from an economics
prize he had received.
He said he gave instructions a year later to cease operating the account,
after he found there were 'too many transactions'. There were, however, two
transactions in 1989, 'perhaps by error', resulting in a small loss. He
closed the account in 1990. Mr Rojo added that he declared all the
transactions in his tax returns.
Mr Pedro Solbes, economy minister, yesterday vouched for Mr Rojo's 'total
honesty'.
Political jitters over the corruption crisis hit stock prices in Madrid
yesterday, with the general index losing 5.78 points, falling to 311.57.
Mr Jordi Pujol, leader of the Catalan nationalist party (CU), which holds
the balance of power in the parliament, warned that it was the Socialist
party's responsibility to prevent a snap election over the scandals. Mr
Pujol's party, itself a coalition with varying degrees of enthusiasm for
remaining in alliance with the Socialists, has promised conditional support
for Mr Gonzalez. Its 17 deputies are crucial to the Socialists who, although
the largest party, have a minority of 159 seats in the 350-member
parliament. While this support remains, Mr Gonzalez is safe from a censure
motion which would automatically remove his government.
However, the Catalan nationalists have forced Mr Gonzalez to appear in
parliament next Wednesday to explain the corruption cases. They are likely
to demand a high political price for continued parliamentary backing, in
terms of budget concessions and greater home rule powers.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Lufthansa privatisation clears last hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

<TEXT>
The last important obstacle to the privatisation of Lufthansa, Germany's
state-controlled airline, was lifted yesterday as the airline and the German
government reached agreement on the issue of pension rights for the
airline's employees.
Lufthansa and the government will be contributing about DM4bn (Pounds 1.6bn)
in cash payments, provisions and guarantees to ensure that employees'
pension entitlements are maintained when the airline moves to the private
sector. The pensions issue had threatened to scupper the airline's
long-planned privatisation and delay rationalisation measures.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, said in Bonn yesterday that the
agreement opened the way for the government to reduce its 51.42 per cent
stake in Lufthansa. He said the privatisation would take place in stages,
starting in the second half of this year, when the state will not take up
its rights to new shares under a rights issue. The airline gave few details
yesterday but supervisory board chairman Mr Wolfgang Roller said that the
airline needed about DM1bn in fresh equity capital. The state's
non-participation in the issue will take its holding down to between 40 and
45 per cent.
Thereafter the government is likely to sell off some or all of its remaining
holding - valued at DM3.1bn at current market prices. Mr Waigel hinted that
the first direct sale of shares could take place this year. Mr Jurgen Weber,
Lufthansa's chief executive, said the solution to the pensions problem would
allow the airline to proceed with a further round of restructuring. The plan
is to concentrate on the airline's core business and it is likely that
marginal activities will be spun off or contracted out to third-party
suppliers in an attempt to improve efficiency.
The airline has already implemented big reductions in its workforce: a total
of 4,000 jobs were cut last year, reducing costs by DM300m. Partly as a
result of this, pre-tax losses at the parent company dropped to DM50m in
1993 from DM297m in the previous year. Mr Weber said the group was on track
to break even at the operating level this year after losses of about DM500m
last year.
The pensions issue has dogged the airline's sell-off plans. Pensions are now
financed by the VBL, the federal and state pension fund, but the government
has no legal obligation to finance pensions once its stake falls below 50
per cent. Under yesterday's compromise, the airline will take over financing
the pensions of its 45,000-48,000 active employees.
Excluding privatisations in eastern Germany, the government has raised
DM11.6bn from privatisations since 1982. It has reduced its industrial
holdings from 858 to under 400. The next big privatisation will be that of
Deutsche Telekom, scheduled to take place by 1996.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Lopez to pay DM75,000 to end perjury case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the beleaguered production director of
Volkswagen, will pay an agreed sum of DM75,000 (Pounds 29,850) instead of
facing perjury charges in court, it emerged yesterday.
Mr Lopez still maintained his innocence and had wanted a full hearing on the
issue, his lawyers said. However, he gave up this right and agreed to the
closure of the case 'to avoid further stress from these proceedings and in
the interests of the company'.
The deal ended speculation that Mr Lopez, subject of continuing
investigations for suspected industrial espionage, might shortly face his
first public questioning under oath in the long-running battle between VW
and General Motors of the US, Mr Lopez's former employer.
Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, welcomed yesterday's decision, even
though Mr Lopez had been neither tried nor judged.
Mr Lopez remains under investigation in Germany and the US for suspected
crimes against GM and alleged breaches of federal mail and
telecommunications law.
A muted statement from the VW supervisory board said it was pleased the case
had been closed 'and that Lopez had subjugated his personal interest in a
continuation of the proceedings - and an acquittal - in the interests of his
board responsibilities'.
The case concerned suspected false affidavits presented in a Hamburg court
last year about press articles over suspected industrial espionage by Mr
Lopez and three associates. One sworn statement to the effect that he had
never asked for nor received photographs of a projected new car to be made
by Opel, GM's German subsidiary, was directly contradicted in a later
affidavit from Mr Lopez.
Another sworn denial that he was the author of a controversial speech was
strongly countered by verbal and material evidence in open court from a
former GM associate.
The Hamburg prosecuting authorities said yesterday that these two points
gave grounds for sufficient suspicions that Mr Lopez had made 'negligent,
false or incomplete statements'.
Although it appeared 'negligence' had played a significant role, the
prosecutors were not able to close the case on the grounds that all
suspicions had been cleared. Yesterday's decision prejudiced neither the
'special characteristics of the subject matter of the investigation nor the
associated considerable public interest', they said.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Dutch leaders in search for three-party coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dutch politicians yesterday began the search for a viable government
coalition after an inconclusive general election split the vote among the
country's four main parties.
The election robbed the ruling Christian Democrats (CDA) and Labour party of
their majority in parliament, making a three-party coalition inevitable and
breaking a 13-year tradition of two-party rule.
The ruling coalition captured just 71 seats, short of the 76 needed for a
governing majority in the 150-seat lower house of parliament. In the 1989
election, the two parties won a combined 103 seats. Despite a sharp decline
in support, Labour emerged as the largest single party, with 37 seats, three
seats ahead of the CDA, which has traditionally dominated Dutch politics.
Two smaller parties, the right-wing Liberals and D66, a left-of-centre
party, posted sharp gains, to 31 and 24 seats respectively.
The four parties are most divided on social security. Labour, which will try
to secure the prime minister's job for its leader, Mr Wim Kok, the finance
minister, is against any far-reaching reform of the welfare system. At the
other end of the spectrum, the Liberals want to cut unemployment and other
benefits to 60 per cent of the minimum wage.
The challenge now facing the four parties is to form a three-party
coalition. In the meantime, the government of prime minister Ruud Lubbers
will remain in office in a caretaker's role.
Although the Netherlands has always been ruled by coalitions in recent
times, a prolonged period of uncertainty could affect financial markets,
though initial reactions yesterday were muted.
Queen Beatrix will hold meetings with senior politicians tomorrow. She will
then ask one of the party leaders to try to form a coalition. If the parties
are too far apart, she can also take the interim step of naming an elder
statesman from one of the parties to act as a go-between in party
negotiations.

FT  05 MAY 94 / PLO and Israel sign deal after last-minute row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine
Liberation Organisation chairman, yesterday signed into existence the first
form of Palestinian self-rule since Israel's creation in 1948 - in an accord
rescued by one of the most public haggles in Middle East history.
The 450-page agreement signed, and partly negotiated, on stage at the Cairo
Convention Centre put into immediate effect the withdrawal of Israeli troops
from Gaza and Jericho and began the handover of police and limited political
and economic powers to a new Palestinian authority.
It was hailed by Mr Arafat as 'the true beginning, the start of the end of
Israeli occupation' and by Mr Rabin as 'an historic opportunity to build
different lives'.
But the precariousness of the deal was underlined in the occupied
territories, where it was greeted by strikes across the West Bank and
clashes between troops and settlers in Jericho. Syria signalled its
rejection of the accord, while Jordan announced that it would not be pressed
into accelerating its negotiations with Israel as a result of it.
While yesterday's agreement was the culmination of more than seven months of
arduous negotiating since Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat last shook hands on the
White House lawn in September, the statesmanlike dignity of the Washington
proceedings was absent.
Instead, the PLO and Israeli leaders, Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, Mr
Amr Moussa, his foreign minister, and Mr Warren Christopher and Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, Mr Moussa's US and Russian counterparts, were forced into unseemly
huddle-and-whisper diplomacy after Mr Arafat refused to sign part of the
deal.
Mr Rabin thumped the table and summoned Mr Shimon Peres, his foreign
minister, on discovering that Mr Arafat's signature was missing from
documents containing maps of Gaza and Jericho. He returned to the main group
to begin agitated consultations which eclipsed the two following speeches.
Mr Moussa and Mr Mubarak sought to calm both sides. Advisers were summoned
on stage and documents were passed to and fro.
Several minutes later the principals left for the wings, returned, and Mr
Rabin and Mr Arafat completed the signing, to the relief of all on stage and
2,500 dignitaries assembled for the pageant.
Although a broad agreement on the delineation of Jericho to come under
Palestinian authority had apparently been reached in talks before the
signing, Mr Arafat was 'surprised', according to aides, to see definitive
maps of Jericho for his signature and refused to sign them. He was
eventually persuaded to do so only when he could add the caveat that these
were not final documents.
Mr Peres restored some dignity with a speech in which he elegantly praised
Mr Mubarak and heralded an optimistic future of Israeli-Palestinian
co-existence.
He said: 'We assure you that we shall not stop here, and we shall reach
peace with Syria, Jordan and Lebanon.'
Mr Rabin underscored his doubts about the Palestinians' readiness to assume
the administrative powers which the deal grants them. He told reporters that
Israel 'would like to get out as quickly as possible', but that Mr Arafat
had asked for a delay of up to four 'or even more' weeks to complete the
transfer of powers.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Clarke marks centre ground by backing welfare state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, last night threw his weight behind a
strong welfare state, arguing that it could complement more flexible labour
markets in the effort to reduce unemployment.
Delivering the Mais Lecture at the City University Business School, Mr
Clarke set out a UK approach towards pursuing full employment that would
combine 'the best aspects' of American enterprise and free market efficiency
and the European commitment to the welfare state.
Unemployment, Mr Clarke said, 'must be the main preoccupation of economic
policy makers in the 1990s'.
Politicians across Europe had been slow to face rigidities in the labour
market, which were 'the fundamental cause of structural unemployment'. A
strong welfare state was needed to 'complement, not hinder, more flexible
labour markets by reducing fear of change and opposition to it'.
Mr Clarke's speech was seen at Westminster as a clear attempt to stake out
the Conservative centre ground on the future of the welfare state after a
long period when the right of the party has held the initiative.
His insistence that the social provision by the state was an essential
buttress to efficient markets was in sharp contrast to the rhetoric of Mr
Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, and Mr Peter Lilley, the
social services secretary.
It marked the chancellor's return to the political limelight as a potential
Tory leadership contender if Mr John Major were to be overturned. Mr Michael
Heseltine and Mr Portillo have dominated speculation about the succession in
recent weeks.
Mr Clarke said the labour market should be left to work as freely as
possible. However, government policies should help not only those who cannot
work but also ease social problems for the working population. He showed
that he was sensitive to people's fears in an age of rapid technological
change.
'Families need a sense of security in their personal finances,' he argued.
'No individual will see any advantage in a flexible labour market unless he
or she sees how career prospects and life cycle finances can be enhanced by
it.'
The role of the state should not be confined to welfare provision, he added.
'A whole range of other social policies should alleviate such fears and
offer a sense of security in a world where retraining and changes of job are
becoming necessary events in most people's working lives.'
Arguing that Britain had a 'huge advantage' in its free national health
service and free education system, Mr Clarke said he 'would never support
any attempt to dismantle them'.
However, the chancellor also insisted that market mechanisms were the key to
economic success. Wages should be based on the economic performance of the
enterprise providing employment and ideas such as a 'going rate' for wage
increases and the annual pay round should become things of the past.

FT  05 MAY 94 / Central banks step in to defend Dollars: Fed move follows
failure of last week's intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM, PATRICK HARVERSON and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Federal Reserve yesterday led a concerted effort by central banks to
stem the dollar's steep decline against the yen and chief European
currencies, stepping into the foreign exchange market repeatedly to buy the
US currency.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, said the intervention reflected the
Clinton administration's view 'that recent movements in exchange markets
have gone beyond what is justified by economic fundamentals. This
administration sees no advantage in an undervalued currency'.
The Fed had intervened last week to support the dollar, but yesterday's
operations were supported by as many as 17 central banks, including the
Bundesbank, the Bank of Japan, Bank of England, Bank of Canada and most
European central banks. Several billion dollars of intervention was seen,
central bank sources suggested.
The central banks initially struggled to arrest the dollar's slide. During
the morning in New York, the Fed and other central banks bought dollars
around DM1.6570 and Y101.20.
After the intervention, the currency rebounded more than 3 pfennigs from its
overnight close to DM1.6643, and more than Y1 to Y102.43, but later slid
back to near its morning lows.
A second round of intervention helped to stabilise the currency. By late
afternoon in New York, the dollar stood at DM1.6542 and Y101.90, a gain on
the day of only 1 1/2 pfennigs and less than Y1, respectively.
US officials are anxious at the prospect that the slide in the dollar's
value, by making foreign investors less willing to put their money into US
bonds, could accelerate the rise in long-term US interest rates, damping
future economic activity as a result. However, the move had little direct
impact on the US stock and Treasury markets, although shares and bond prices
were unsettled by speculation that the Fed might have to lift the discount
rate - the rate at which it lends money to banks - to support the dollar.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 16.66 at 3,697.75. The benchmark
30-year government bond, which fell half a point during the morning, revived
later in the day following weaker-than-expected April car sales data. By
late afternoon it stood unchanged, yielding 7.346 per cent.
Although finance ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations
agreed two weeks ago to continue to co-operate closely in foreign exchange
markets, yesterday's concerted intervention was more a response to the
failure of last Friday's more limited intervention than an implementation of
a detailed G-7 plan.
Earlier, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, signalled German
unhappiness with the dollar's weakness. 'Too strong an appreciation of the
D-Mark against the dollar is not in the interests of our economy,' he said.
This had an immediate beneficial impact on the dollar.
Since President Bill Clinton took office, sharply on expanding US exports to
Japan and other markets, the dollar has dropped in value against the yen by
almost 18 per cent.
A senior US Treasury official said central banks had intervened 'to
counteract a negative psychology that had developed on the basis of false
perceptions that the US was trying to drive the dollar down . . . or was
somehow indifferent to where market forces took its currency'.

<TEXT>
Mr John Major has rejected calls from the Tory right wing to recast in
Euro-sceptic terms the government's manifesto for the June 9 European
elections.
The near-final version of the document sticks with the careful compromises
set out in the original draft written by foreign secretary Douglas Hurd. The
draft marks a significant setback for the party's anti-Europeans.
The document has been shortened to give it a sharper edge and sections
attacking Labour and the Liberal Democrats have also been toughened up.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kuhne &amp; Nagel, the international freight forwarding group, is going public
with a placing this week of 181,000 bearer shares - 18 per cent of the
enlarged capital - in Zurich and Frankfurt at SFr775 a share.
The group, in which Mr Klaus-Michael Kuhne will retain a majority stake,
also posted a 15.5 per cent rise in consolidated net income last year to
SFr44.6m (Dollars 30.9m) on sales up 1.1 per cent to SFr4.9bn.
Mr Bruno Salzmann, finance director, forecast that net income would rise a
further 12 per cent this year, suggesting the placing price was 15.5 times
expected 1994 earnings.
Mr Kuhne, 57, decided on the placing as part of the arrangements to ensure
an orderly succession. He has no heirs.
Viag Bayernwerk Beheer of Holland acquired 33 per cent of the capital in
1992 when Lonrho of the UK, which had held a 50 per cent stake since 1981,
withdrew.
Viag has first refusal on Mr Kuhne's shares, and its policy is for the
public to hold large minority stakes in its subsidiaries. The placing
consists of 91,000 existing bearer shares, being sold by Deutsche
Handelsbank, and 90,000 new shares.
Following the placing, Mr Kuhne will hold 51.6 per cent of the capital and
56.7 per cent of the votes. Viag will have 30.3 per cent of the capital and
33.4 per cent of the votes.
Mr Salzmann said the group's medium-term targets were for annual cash flow
of SFr90m to SFr95m and a 10 per cent annual rise in net income. It planned
a 40 per cent to 50 per cent distribution of profit in dividends.

FT  04 MAY 94 / IBM to set up data network across China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines has been chosen by China's ministry of
electronics industry to lead a vast project to link about 500 cities to a
national 'information highway' data network.
Under the terms of a memorandum of understanding signed by Mr Lou Gerstner,
IBM chairman and chief executive, and Mr Zou Jiahua, a Chinese vice-premier,
IBM will head the 'Golden Bridge' project, one of three initiatives designed
to modernise China's data communications and computing infrastructure.
The project will involve designing and building regional networks in cities
across China, along with a 'backbone' network linking the regional systems.
The effort will be led by a joint venture, based in Beijing, between IBM
China and Ji Tong Communications, a company affiliated to the Chinese
ministry of electronics industry.
'This is China's version of the information highway,' said Mr Ned
Lautenbach, head of IBM's international operations. 'The Chinese government
has set very ambitious goals and we are thrilled to have been selected to
work with them.'
IBM has also been chosen as the primary consultant on two other 'golden
projects': Golden Card will establish facilities for the credit and debit
cards throughout China, and Golden Customs will create computerised
record-keeping and tracking systems for China's exports and imports.
'IBM is a famous computer company and has a long history of working with
us,' said Mr Zou. 'Its technology and experience have contributed greatly to
the development of the information technology industry in China.'
As part of its expansion in China, IBM plans to establish a software
development centre in Shanghai to develop programs for use in China and for
export. Three networking technology centres will be opened in Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou providing consulting services to Chinese customers,
linking computers to networks.
IBM's presence in China dates back to 1935. The company left China when the
communist regime took over and came back in 1982 as an offshore business. In
September 1992 IBM China became a wholly owned foreign enterprise,
authorised to trade in local currency and to hire Chinese employees.
'In the last 18 months or so we have been aggressively growing our
resources, our commitment and our business in China,' said Mr Lautenbach.
These moves reflect the Clinton administration's liberalisation of export
controls on high-technology goods sold to China.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Britain will help create monetary authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England will help Palestinians create a Palestinian Monetary
Authority which will have all the functions of a central bank except the
ability to issue a currency, a senior Palestinian economic negotiator said
yesterday, Julian Ozanne writes.
Mr Samir Houleila said in an interview that the greatest challenge facing
the Palestinians in implementing the economic protocol signed with Israel
last week was the creation of credible, transparent and efficient financial
and economic institutions which would have authority outside the political
and bureaucratic structures of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
The Palestinians will ask for considerable technical assistance from the UK
and Switzerland. Implementing the agreement would be hard because it only
applied to the Gaza-Jericho part of the occupied territories, Mr Houleila
said. He urged Israel to endorse policy decisions taken by the Palestinian
authority and apply them to the rest of the West Bank.
He defended the protocol, saying Palestinians would gain an immediate
reduction in the cost of living from lower oil prices, VAT, customs duties
and direct taxation, which would fuel exports and investment.
The economic protocol met Palestinian aspirations much better than the
political and security agreement negotiated in Cairo. 'Actually we have paid
a high price in the political and security realm, but we get the benefits in
the economic sphere.'
The agreement terminates the Israeli-Jordanian agreement on banking in the
occupied territories and allows Palestinians to make the US dollar legal
tender, he said.
A negative point for Palestinians was Israel's refusal to state specifically
the number of Palestinians who would be able to work in Israel, Mr Houleila
added.
He and Mr Avraham Shochat, Israeli finance minister, agreed Israel was going
to pay a short-term financial price for peace with the Palestinians, but
would gain from long-term normalisation of relations with Arab and Islamic
states.
Mr Shochat said Israel would lose several million shekels' revenue from
customs duties and income tax on Palestinian migrant labourers (75 per cent
of which will be transferred to the Palestinians) but would reap the rewards
of peace. 'For us the most important thing is not the existing situation but
the opening of the door to the east and to Arab markets.'
Mr Houleila warned the PLO would not call for an end to the Arab economic
boycott of Israel before further talks on Jewish settlements, international
borders and refugees.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US told Japan's new government yesterday that the two countries must
make progress on trade before the July meeting of the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries in Naples, and Japan promised to seek a solution,
Reuter reports from Cairo.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, delivered the message during a
meeting in Cairo with Mr Koji Kakizawa, Japan's foreign minister.
It was the first high-level contact between the two allies since a new
government was installed in Tokyo. The two were in Cairo for today's
scheduled signing of the Israel-PLO agreement on Palestinian self-rule.
Mr Christopher said the US was prepared to be understanding during this
transition phase as the new government established itself and developed its
policies.
But at a news conference with Mr Kakizawa, he said: 'It's quite important
that we make as much progress as possible before the G7 meeting in Naples so
we have a good report to give to the other leaders of the world at that
time.'
Mr Kakizawa said: 'We agreed that the two countries have to make further
efforts' following talks between then-foreign minister Mr Tsutomu Hata, now
Japan's new prime minister, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative,
in Marrakesh at a recent meeting to conclude the Gatt Uruguay Round.
Mr Christopher noted that Mr Kantor raised with Japan in Marrakesh three
questions on the framework agreement that the two sides are negotiating to
provide greater access to Japan's markets for American businessmen.
He said Mr Kakizawa told him the answers would be forthcoming.
Japan has a trade surplus of more than Dollars 50bn with the US, which has
been trying to force Tokyo to open up its markets.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Bosnian Serbs test patience of Milosevic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Calls for peace and accusations of corruption against Bosnian Serb leaders
in the Serbian media are fuelling speculation that President Slobodan
Milosevic could turn against nationalists insisting on a Greater Serbia at
any price.
Mr Milosevic's opposition to the politics of the Bosnian Serb leadership has
been signalled by his wife, Mrs Mirjana Markovic, whose remarks have tended
to foreshadow the next move by the Serbian president.
'The representatives of those Serbs who are mostly outside of Serbia and
think war is their only option. . . . have no right to foist that option on
all Serbs,' she wrote last week in the popular magazine Duga.
'I am afraid that the Serbian people. . . . are at the point when they must
become pacifists, if they want to survive,' she added, making the point that
Serbs from Serbia should define national politics.
Television, tightly controlled by Mr Milosevic, last week repeatedly warned
Bosnian Serb leaders that war should not be their only option.
Implicit criticisms of their belligerent stance were accompanied by stinging
accusations that Bosnian Serb leaders and their influential Belgrade mentors
were involved in the huge financial scandal surrounding Dafiment bank, once
vaunted at the biggest private bank in the Balkans. Mrs Dafina Milanovic,
owner of the bankrupt institution, has made an 'impromptu' revelation that
even Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb chief, himself carried sacks of cash
out of the bank, which owes Serbia's citizens hundreds of millions of
dollars.
Such indictments of Mr Karadzic and the Bosnian Serb nationalists are being
interpreted as feelers for the famously close Mr Milosevic to change
allegiances.
But Mr Milosevic who rode to power on the mighty waves of Serbian
nationalism may find it dangerous to separate his future from theirs.
In spite of three years of war in neighbouring Bosnia and Croatia, economic
deprivation and political isolation, recent opinion polls reflect that most
of Belgrade still supports the Bosnian Serb leadership. More than 51 per
cent believe Serbs should keep the 70 per cent of Bosnia they currently
control, according to one poll.
An overwhelming majority back the unification of Belgrade with Serb-held
lands in Bosnia and Croatia. However, the pragmatic Mr Milosevic may now be
calling for something else.
His foreign minister, Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, in a weekend interview, sent a
message to the US that the 'only realistic solution for Bosnia-Hercegovina
is the creation of a wider state which would include Serbs and Croats'.
This proposal to create a 'new Yugoslavia' will set Mr Milosevic on a
collision course with Serb nationalists who insist on ethnic partition and
the creation of Greater Serbia.

The confirmation of Mr Lubbers' bid for the post was made minutes after

Mr Lubbers said five years ago that he planned to leave national government

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (19): Long
way from Santa Clara - Investment case study, SMI Microelectronics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You only have to stand in the small 'clean' room at SMI to grasp what is
taking place in this US-backed microelectronics enterprise at Markendorf,
near Frankfurt an der Oder on the Polish border.
Through the windows on one side of the room one sees the remnants of eastern
Germany's old microelectronics industry. It is a big workshop, decked with
large computers, some covered with plastic sheets.
On the other side of this insulated room is a small, modern testing station
installed last year and poised to supply its products to the European
market.
The east German engineers, dressed like surgeons, quietly pass from one old
world of increasingly out-dated technology to the new laboratory. They are
symbols of transition taking place in the east German economy.
But it has been a hard slog for Mr George Brown, the director of System
Microelectronic Innovation, or SMI, and a far cry from Synergy Semiconductor
Corporation, his parent company in Santa Clara, California.
'It has been slower than we expected, but we are getting there,' said Mr
Brown, whose offices overlook what was once eastern Germany's main
microelectronic enterprise.
In a search for more capacity, the US company bought a 49 per cent stake in
the old VEB Halbleitwerk from the Treuhand privatisation agency in March
1993. The Kombinate, or enterprise, used to employ 8,000 people and was one
of the main enterprises supplying the circuits for the east German consumer
market - mostly for television sets.
But following German unification, the collapse of the east European and
Russian markets, and the exposure of the Kombinate to competition, the
Treuhand pared down the work force to 1,200 and set about preparing it for
privatisation.
Mr Brown, whose US company was also seeking a foothold in Europe, eventually
acquired the stake and a reduced workforce of little more than 600. Boosted
by investment grants from the eastern state of Brandenburg and from the
federal government, and a commitment by the Treuhand to pick up losses and
redundancy payments, he agreed to initially invest DM45m for new equipment
to produce ECL logic devices and ECL RAMS, used mostly in radio equipment.
Initially it had been hoped that SMI could continue to hold on to some of
its east European, Russian and east German customers, which before
unification accounted for almost 100 per cent of the company's turnover. But
the shortage of hard currency and the need to find a niche in the European
market meant that Mr Brown had to reverse the company's strategy towards the
west.
The first year was spent on completely modernising the plant, and
introducing new product lines. This meant training the engineers, either in
Santa Clara, or bringing over US engineers to SMI.
During this time, the company's turnover to the eastern European and local
east German market virtually collapsed, falling from DM70m in 1991/92 to nil
by the end of last year.
'We now have only one option. We must continue to invest, and heavily. What
we are bringing here is technology, knowhow and a new product idea. But it
will take time to turn the company around,' said Mr Brown.
Like the 'clean room', the company finds itself in a finely balanced period
of transition. As testing takes time, and money - it has already received
quality certification for one of its locally produced integrated circuit
lines - it must utilise its capacity to gain turnover before new lines are
ready for full production. Currently, the plant is operating at 20 per cent
capacity.
But increasingly, as investments lead to production, SMI is subcontracting
as an interim measure - 'we have five foundry customers, some for Europe,
others for the US,' said Mr Brown, adding that SMI is trying to attract
companies which have neither enough or no capacity for production. Already
SMI is supplying Grundig, Blaupunkt and automobile manufacturers with its
products. Sub-contracting now accounts for nearly two-thirds, or DM18m, of
SMI's turnover and capacity is expected to reach 50 per cent by the end of
this year. Turnover for this year could reach DM46m.
But neither Mr Brown nor Mr Max-Eberhard Losel, the manager of the
enterprise, wants SMI to evolve into a business anchored on subcontracting.
The raison d'etre of the enterprise is to develop and market its own
products, particularly analog designs - circuits for radio-controlled
clocks, power switches and high frequency integrated circuits for
telecommunications.
'Foundry business is very competitive. But it is a fairly low margin
business,' said Mr Losel. 'You can't build a business on it alone. We need
high value-added products and innovative products which can ultimately
create high technology jobs.'
Through their investment programme, Mr Brown and Mr Losel want to enter the
high end of the market. In short, they want to adopt the 'leap-frog'
approach, whereby they can skip the intermediate technology by introducing
the highest levels of innovation.
But the sprawling 1 sq km large site which they have inherited does not lend
itself easily to the leap-frog theory largely because SMI, unlike some other
west German electronic companies, was not in a position to acquire a
greenfield site and build a completely new company. This means that the
first two years will be spent modernising, updating and equipping SMI with
new technology.
'What we want to do here requires a different know-how. We need to work much
more efficiently to cover costs. We are even occupying more space than we
need,' said Mr Brown. That was why SMI's management was interested in
acquiring partners.
It has been a slow process, but Mr Brown and his colleagues reckon that by
the end of 1994, its own new products will be on line. 'It has taken time.
Maybe we didn't expect the complete collapse of the east European and
Russian markets. Maybe we did not anticipate the recession in Germany,' said
Mr Brown. 'But we have extra capacity here and we have Europe as our market
and that's where we are heading.'

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (18): A
different life without Big Brother - Frederick Studemann on how capitalist
realism came to the theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FREDERICK STUDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Before the collapse of East Germany, actors at the Deutsches Theater in
Berlin led a life which their colleagues in the west could only dream about.
Every night the auditorium of the impressive neo-classical building near the
Friedrichstrasse station was packed.
Even better than the thrill of performing to a full house was the fact that
the audiences took a keen interest in every word and movement in a studied
search for any deeper meaning. Celebrated on stage, the actors and their
directors also enjoyed a life outside the theatre as bohemian types who were
not expected to conform to the rigours of state socialism.
Today, like every other sector of east German society, the members of the
Deutsches Theater are having to adapt to the rigours of capitalism. Lively
artistic types they may still be, but their theatre is often just over half
full. The days when drama was everything, and finance just a series of
figures are over - 'the main thing that everyone talks and thinks about now
is money,' says Maik Hamburger, the theatre's literary adviser.
Money is something everyone involved with culture in eastern Germany has had
to seriously think about in the last four years.
During that time the relatively generous hand of an omnipotent central
government has been swapped for that of the cash-strapped local authorities.
In line with the country's federal system, cultural funding in Germany is
today carried at the regional, or state level.
In the case of the Deutsches Theater, it is the city of Berlin that provides
the lion's share of the theatre's budget. Subsidies to the theatre this year
are DM32.67m. Last year, they were DM29.76m. But box office receipts in 1993
only amounted to DM2.4m and this year they expect DM3.1m, with an audience
capacity of 72 per cent.
Although the city of Berlin has earmarked the Deutsches, as it is known, as
its show-case for classical drama, and therefore deserving of substantial
funding, it is still on a much shorter leash than in the past. Then no one
really bothered with costs as it was always assumed that the state would
provide extra funds if necessary.
Now, for the first time, the Deutsches has taken the step of taking a
production off for financial reasons. Ironically, the play in question,
Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh, was reasonably successful. It was taken
out of the theatre's repertoire programme because there was no money to pay
for the storage of sets between performances.
Mr Hamburger now worries that financial pressures will cut the quality of
the theatre's work, and lead to a situation where once again artistic policy
is curtailed by outside considerations. The danger is, Mr Hamburger
believes, that the overt political censorship of the communists is being
replaced by the dictates of the box office. 'There have been internal
conflicts over whether we should make more artistic concessions or not. The
management wants plays with a large popular appeal, but the artistic side is
keen to do more exciting stuff,' he explains.
This internal tussle is of course about more than just the filling of seats.
To many of the members of the 170-strong staff of the Deutsches' company, it
is also about the perceived threat of westernisation of the theatre in the
east.
As far as the audience is concerned this change has already taken place.
Since the Berlin wall fell, the audiences at the Deutsches have been
increasingly made up of people from west Berlin, attracted by the theatre's
reputation and its grand appearance. On an average night the audience
make-up mirrors that of Berlin as a whole - two-thirds western, one third
eastern.
What they get to see is a culture in transition. Under the communists,
theatre performed a unique role as an unofficial form of the media. Plays
which were seemingly devoid of all political or social content would be
reworked to give them a topical edge.
Audiences were trained to see an elaborate critique of totalitarianism in a
few lines of Goethe, to see Hamlet turned into a symbol of the painful
indecision and self-obsession of the opposition dissidents groups.
Now such tactics are redundant - 'the actors say that today the audiences
are reacting on a more direct level to the texts and not looking for hidden
meaning,' says Mr Hamburger. This means that the Deutsches is now looking
for new forms of subtlety. This is a process that can be quite exciting to
watch. Recently, for instance, the Deutsches put on a play by Botho Strauss,
a western playwright noted for his mastery of subtlety. Getting to grips
with this very western work was tough. 'We found it quite hard because we do
not have this taste for deep inward searching and most of us do not find it
important,' says Mr Hamburger.
Other attempts to combine east and west have produced surprisingly topical
results as shown by the production of Tankred Dorst's play Herr Paul which
is currently in the repertoire programme. Dorst, a west German, originally
began working on the play in the 1960s.
Set in 1950s west Germany the play is the story of an old man who lives in a
soap factory who is faced with eviction by the building's youthful owner who
is keen to redevelop the site.
When Dorst began writing the play it was intended to show the fundamental
changes taking place in post-war west German society, the conflict between
the old and the new.
Now on stage at the Deutsches it has acquired a totally different quality as
anyone who has followed the complicated issue of property rights in eastern
Germany can testify.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (17): The
barbed wire remains - Judy Dempsey tours Gorlitz, a divided city on the
Polish frontier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rusty barbed wire separating Poland from Germany had not yet been taken
down. The road and border crossing signs needed a coat of paint. But the
Polish border guards were no longer surly.
They casually inspected my passport. Perhaps they were more interested in
the traders close to the bridge which connects the German and Polish sectors
of Gorlitz (the Polish part is called Zgorzelec). Energetic young Polish men
were trying to sell cartons of cigarettes to visitors.
As the thick cold fog gave way to heavy rain, I crossed the bridge over the
river Neisse from Poland to the German side of Gorlitz, an old merchant city
once granted trading privileges from the King of Bohemia.
Located in the south-eastern corner of eastern Germany, the city had been
divided after the second world war, when the and Neisse (which flows through
Gorlitz) became part of Poland's new western border. With the collapse of
the Iron Curtain, the German half of the city is trying to find its place in
the new united Germany. At the same time, the gap between Gorlitz and
Zgorzlec is widening, particularly in infrastructure, thanks to assistance
from Bonn and the state of Saxony.
'We want to put Gorlitz on the map and attract investors here,' said Mr
Jorg-Peter Thoms, an official responsible for construction and economic
issues at the city's local council.
Before German unification many of Gorlitz's 69,000 people were dependent on
Deutsche Waggonbau, the large rail carriage manufacturer which employed
3,800 but today has fewer than 1,650 on its books, the textile industry, and
the electricity complex at Hagenwerder, which will be closed down by 1997.
'There are investment opportunities and the state of Saxony offers financial
incentives for anyone setting up business here,' said Mr Thoms. The city had
DM14m-15m in grants for the centre itself, but investment had been sluggish.
'We have to improve the routes into Gorlitz,' he explained, adding that once
the A4 motorway was complete, and the train services improved, this
extraordinarily beautiful city, one of the few in eastern Germany whose
centre has not been spoiled by crass communist pre-fabricated architecture,
would prosper. He is also waiting for an end to the recession in western
Germany.
Recession apart, investment in Gorlitz is also linked to resolving the
outstanding property questions. Although investors have priority over
restitution, compensation claims by former owners continue to act as a brake
on investment.
Ms Annette Kreisch, 25, is the acting head of the Property Rights office in
Gorlitz. The office has had no department head since last October, when the
last one, a west German lawyer, left, the third to do so since late 1990.
Since that time, the inadequate staff of 22 people - all east Germans - and
all confronted with complex legislation on property rights - have had to
deal with more than 6,400 claims. By early 1994, the office had resolved
2,300 of them. It is estimated that the remaining 4,100 cases will require
at least another four years.
'We are faster than some other offices in eastern Germany,' said Ms Kreisch.
But some claimants, including Mr Frederick Kaufmann, who had to leave
Gorlitz in 1938, have been trying nearly four years to get their property
back.
The local Chamber of Commerce, or IHK, says the property rights issue is not
holding up investment. 'Investment, in the form of services, and even
manufacturing - Siemens, for instance, has bought the Turbinenwerk here -
will pick up once the infrastructure improves and the recession ends,' said
Mr Bernd Flamminger. The IHK'S members have invested DM153m since 1992.
'You see, we want investors to use Gorlitz as a stepping off point for
Poland, as well as to countries in the former Soviet Union. It makes sense.
By using our city as a base, companies can do business with eastern Europe.'
Officials at the IHK are all too aware that Gorlitz has to compete with
Leipzig, one of the fastest growing cities in eastern Germany, and Dresden,
the state capital of Saxony.
'Look, it's the unemployment that gets people down,' said Mr Klaus Ulrich
Eisenhammer. Mr Eisenhammer works at the local employment office, a modern
bright building which was home to the Pentacon camera factory. But it was
forced into liquidation and closed after unification with the loss of 1,500
jobs.
'I don't want to sound pessimistic, but there's not much left of the old
Gorlitz in terms of local industry. The textile enterprises, which once
employed 2,000 have closed. Women have borne the brunt. Two out of every
three people unemployed are women,' he said.
The employment office, which also serves nearby Bautzen, last year spent
more than DM3bn supporting the unemployed and those on government-supported
job creation and retraining schemes and those who had taken early
retirement. 'There were 6,196 unemployed. If we add the other class of
unemployed, those on the government schemes and short-time work, we have an
additional 7,000 people. That's a lot of people,' said Mr Eisenhammer, who
admitted that the really secure jobs were at the employment office.
He was hopeful about one thing - 'we have to rely on the small craftsmen and
traders to soak up some of the unemployed. That's a real plus, especially as
more and more people, and former owners renovate their houses and investors
modernise offices. But you know because of border zone regulations,
contractors here can legally hire Polish workers from just across the border
and pay them far less.'
Across town, Mr Roman Muller, managing director of Deutsche Wagonbau, or
DWA, knows how much the people of Gorlitz depends on the 145-year-old
railway carriage manufacturer. Unlike other Treuhand enterprises, DWA makes
money. Consolidated profits for the group weres DM23.3m in 1992 on a
turnover of DM3.6bn, with the Gorlitz branch accounting for DM16m. Despite
selling only to the east German and Russian market before unification, DWA
Gorlitz has managed to earn half its last year's turnover of DM420m from the
German market. Retaining the current levels of employment, just under 1,700,
will depend on how the Treuhand privatises DWA - as a whole or in parts  -
as well as orders from Russia. The shortage of hard currency in Russia has
meant that the management in Gorlitz has placed more than 400 of its
employees on short-time work.
Gorlitz needs someone like Mr Matthias Lechner, its energetic mayor, to
instil hope and a sense of perspective. But the 42-year-old aspiring
politician, is no idealist. Before unification he belonged to no party and
now belongs to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats. He
has few illusions about the time it will take to restructure industry, as
well as build a new political infrastructure.
Since May 1990, he had spent at least 12 hours a day trying to rebuild
confidence among a community suffering from 35 per cent unemployment, if one
takes into account all the people on retraining and job-creation schemes.
What surprises him was 'how quickly people forget the past. It's only four
years since unification, yet people sometimes think the old days were
better. It's a strange phenomenon.'
One of the greatest difficulties facing Mr Lechner is persuading people to
become politically engaged - 'you need a lot of time for politics now. I
don't think people want to spend that much time, particularly since politics
means accountability. When the council, for example, wants to raise the
price on the public transport in order to pay for infrastructure costs, we
were faced with a lot of complaints and naturally we have to explain all our
decisions. Money is precious. We have to be careful how we spend it.'
According to Mr Lechner, the debts of Gorlitz amount to DM1,240 per capita
of the local population, a level typical of other eastern German towns and
cities. 'We have a credit line of DM100m from the banks and a separate
budget of DM250m. But our tax revenue income is only about DM30m. Reaping
results from local government politics is a slow process.
'You have to remember that people were so politicised in the old sense, that
after unification they simply withdrew and tried to cope with unification
and the traumas thrown up by it.'
Mr Lechner, who is standing again as mayor in next June's local government
elections, believes he can muster enough support to win, although he - and
his deputy, Ms Renate Schwarze who represents the opposition Social
Democratic Party - have few party activists upon whom to rely. The CDU in
Gorlitz has 250 paid up members; the SPD, 80.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (14): The
left's confidence is growing - Political puzzle, despite recent polls, many
east Germans admit that they will cast their votes differently in the ten
local government and state elections, culminating in the federal elections
in October
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The east German economy is only 9 per cent of Germany's total Gross Domestic
Product, but its population represents a fifth of the country. The question
in the federal elections to be held next October is whether east Germany
will hold the national balance of power.
The most recent poll by Ipos, the Mannheim-based Institute for Social
Research, suggests that the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) coalition will
not win if it fails to improve its standing in eastern Germany. However it
is slowly clawing back some of its lost support.
An Ipos poll last December showed the CDU with 32 per cent of the vote in
the west and 22 per cent in the east; the SPD with 45 per cent and 38
respectively; and the FDP, 5 per cent and 6 per cent.
But by April 22, the CDU's standing improved both in western and eastern
Germany. In the west it increased to 39 per cent, in the east, to 24 per
cent; the SPD lost ground, falling to 41 per cent in the west but increasing
in the east to 40 per cent. The FDP, the junior coalition, had fallen to 4
per cent in the west and 3 per cent the east.
The PDS, the reformed successor party of the former ruling east German
Socialist Unity or communist party, which is based in the east, continues to
make ground, rising by 2 percentage points between December and April to 16
per cent; the Bundnis 90/Greens have 11 per cent in the west and 9 per cent
in the east.
'The CDU will have to make a big push and really improve in the east if it
wants to be returned to office,' said Mr Matthias Jung, head of Ipos.
Clearly, the economy, particularly unemployment, will be the main issue upon
which the election will be fought. In the east unemployment accounts for
16.8 per cent, or 1.2m of the labour force. But if, as economists forecast,
west Germany is emerging from the recession, it could have a positive
spin-off for investments in eastern Germany, besides improving the general
level of confidence, and boosting Chancellor Kohl's chances.
On a different level, other polls indicate that east Germans seem less angry
and disappointed than they were a year ago with the consequences of
unification. But would this benefit the present coalition?
Officials from the five eastern states believe that the easterners will
register an anti-Kohl vote, but perhaps not on the federal level - 'I may be
wrong,' said one senior official from the state of Saxony, which is CDU,
'but I think that the incumbents will suffer on the state level in order to
register an anti-Kohl vote. After all, four of the five states have CDU
prime ministers.'
However, he and other officials said that on the federal level, the CDU
might scrape in because 'although the easterners may not like Kohl, they
know him and they link him with achieving unification. Rudolf Scharping (the
head of the SPD) is still an unknown quantity.'
Many east Germans admit that they will cast their votes differently in the
nine local government and state elections, culminating in the federal
elections in October.
They say the local government elections will be based on local issues;
personalities will play an important part on the state level; and how they
vote on the federal election will depend on how urgently they want a change
of government in Bonn.
They also make two other points. First, they increasingly realise that there
are now no quick answers to unemployment or restructuring. And since the
massive transfers from the west cushion the unemployed and subsidise
consumer spending, they are slowly coming to accept the extraordinary depth
of social, political and economic changes.
Second, they are still unsure about what the SPD stands for, unlike the CDU,
or for that matter the PDS, which according to opinion polls could win at
least 16 per cent and even pass the 5 per cent threshold needed to enter the
Bundestag or parliament through getting three candidates directly elected.
Yet none of the established parties, with the exception of the PDS, can rely
on membership in the east to help in the campaign. By the end of last year,
the CDU had a total of 83,794 members in eastern Germany, 10,000 fewer than
the previous year; the SPD's 25,000 members rose by 200; the FDP is hovering
at around 35,000, after falling from 100,000 in 1990; the PDS has 131,000
members, a drop of 16,000 over the same period.
'The low party membership is worrying,' said the Saxon official. 'But what
concerns us most is that the east could matter, if, in the west, both
political parties are neck and neck at the opinion polls by next October but
the CDU has not moved from its current 24 per cent level in the east.
'Everyone will then start counting the numbers in the east. They would be
very unwise to neglect the region until then.'

gets in their eyes - Fuel and power are a marketing nightmare

<TEXT>
The restructuring and privatisation of eastern Germany's electricity and
brown coal sector was arguably one of the greatest challenges facing the
Treuhand and the federal government.
Brown coal, or lignite, exists in large quantities in Germany and is
reclaimed by open cast mining mainly for use in power stations.
Faced with the agonising choice of opening the sector to the market or
protecting jobs, the compromise agreed in August 1990, between the former
east German government, the Treuhand privatisation agency, and west
Germany's utility companies ensured that eastern Germany's energy sector
would not be exposed to the full rigours of real competition.
The Treuhand had inherited two huge and notoriously inefficient fields -
Laubag in the states of Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt, and Mibrag, in
Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony.
Employing more than 110,000 people before unification, productivity at the
two fields was at least 50 per cent below west German levels, even though
east Germany's per capita energy consumption was among the highest in the
world, exceeding west Germany's by more than 25 per cent. The potential for
waste was enormous.
Furthermore, the former east German communists had made brown coal mining a
top priority, but failed to allow for the effects on the environment by
working out a coherent strip mining plan. By 1989, brown coal accounted for
70 per cent of the region's primary energy consumption. A third of east
German railway capacity was engaged in serving this single industry.
The Treuhand also inherited the chain of filthy, polluting power stations
which ran on brown coal. The plants, run by Veag, east Germany's main
electricity company, is due to be privatised later this year.
The Treuhand's scope for privatising the electricity sector was restricted
from the beginning by the Stromvertrag, or Electricity Contract between the
former west and east German governments. Signed in August 1990, it
authorised west German utilities to own 51 per cent of east Germany's 15
utilities groups (all under Veag), with the remaining 49 per cent held by
east Germany's municipalities. In return, the west German utilities, which
include RWE, PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk, would undertake a large
investment programme for Veag.
To underwrite investments of about DM46bn in east Germany's electricity
network, the Stromvertrag stipulated that east Germany's regional utilities
must, over the next 20 years, buy 70 per cent of their energy from Veag.
Meanwhile, Rheinbraun, RWE's brown coal subsidiary, began assembling a west
German consortium to buy east Germany's Laubag brown coal fields as the fuel
source for Veag. Laubag will fuel Veag. As for the Mibrag fields, it had
been sold last December to an Anglo-American consortium comprising Britain's
PowerGen, NRG of Minneapolis, and Morrison-Knudsen of Idaho.
Dozens of east Germany's local councils had challenged the Stromvertrag at
Germany's Constitutional Court on the grounds that they had the right to 100
per cent of the assets, and not just the 49 per cent stake bequeathed to
them in the Stromvertrag. They were overruled. Veag's ownership structure
remains intact.
In the restructuring of the electricity and brown coal sector, the Treuhand
had to establish one criterion: that the value of Laubag and Veag - both
interdependent in the sense that Veag relies on Laubag's coal, and both have
the same buyers - could not be played off against each other. Since
electricity prices in Germany are among the highest in the European Union,
there were fears that the bidders for Laubag would beat down the Treuhand
with the aim of concentrating on extracting large profits from Veag's
electricity sales once the privatisation deal had been closed.
After endless negotiations, the settlement for the sale of Laubag and Veag
is nearly complete. Last February, RWE, and the other utilities agreed in
principle to buy Veag for DM8bn, while Rheinbraun will make a down payment
of DM2.1bn for Laubag, with a commitment of a further investment of DM6bn
over the next 20 years.
In all, Laubag's current work force, down from more than 60,000 to just
under 12,000, will be further reduced to 7,000 by the year 2000. Veag, which
before unification had a work force of around 29,000, now employs 14,500,
and the numbers will continue to fall.
Treuhand officials argue that, given the constraints of the Stromvertrag,
they attained their twin goal of securing jobs and privatising the industry.
Nevertheless, once Veag and Laubag is finally privatised, it will give west
Germany's utilities a virtual monopoly over the generation and distribution
of electricity throughout east Germany.
Mr Jurgen Stotz, a member of Veag's board, staunchly defends the
Stromvertrag and says that even if he could start again to restructure
Laubag and Veag, he would not radically change what had already been done.
'We were faced with a political and social problem,' he explains. 'We had to
find a way of securing a future for brown coal, a DM40bn investment
programme to upgrade, or build a total of 12,300 megawatt capacity (most of
it reliant on brown coal) and at the same time have a programme to introduce
a massive recultivation policy.'
Mr Stotz added that when the restructuring is complete, the east's energy
sector, including the brown coal fields, will not be subsidised, unlike west
Germany's hard coal, each tonne of which is subsidised by about DM180 to
keep coal imports down - 'what we have done in eastern Germany will have
been worth it,' he said.
Nevertheless, some energy experts still ask whether it would have been
possible for Bonn to revise the Stromvertrag in a way which would open Veag
and Laubag to international competition, thus giving the east German
consumer cheaper electricity as well as making eastern Germany the catalyst
for opening up the country's energy sector to competition.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (16): High
pressure policies - Gas privatisation benefits are disputed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treuhand privatisation agency and the government in Bonn have succeeded
in modernising east Germany's gas network. But if they also aimed at a truly
competitive industry they have some way to go.
In the opinion of the London-based Royal Institute for International
Affairs, 'domination by west German companies (in eastern Germany) meant a
missed opportunity to strongly boost competition. As yet, no clear benefits
for small consumers have emerged.'*
This missed opportunity occurred in the summer of 1990 when Verbundneztgas,
or VNG, east Germany's gas transmission company, was placed under the
Treuhand. The agency allocated 35 per cent of the shares to Ruhrgas,
Germany's largest gas company, and 10 per cent to Brigitta Erdgas-und Erdol
(BEB) in Hanover. (Ruhrgas also has a share in the latter.)
Under pressure to open up the remaining shares to non-German gas producers
and transmission companies, the Treuhand finally distributed its own 55 per
cent share to Elf Acquitaine, Statoil, Gazprom, Gommern and British Gas,
each with 5 per cent stakes. The rest were distributed to eastern
municipalities which obtained 15 per cent plus one share, and to
Wintershall, the gas arm of BASF, Germany's largest chemicals group, which
also received 15 per cent plus one share.
However, given Ruhrgas's close connections with the municipalities, VNG is
effectively dominated by the Essen-based company - 'Ruhrgas controls 60 per
cent of VNG. You could have had competition had Wintershall received equal
shares to Ruhrgas,' says Mr Herbert Detharding, chairman of Wintershall.
After bitter wranglings with the Federal Cartel Office, at which Wintershall
in particular tried to increase its stake as a means of breaking down the
monopoly structure, and endless disputes over the price to be paid for
Russian gas sales to VNG, the ownership structure for VNG remains unchanged
and stable and guaranteed gas supplies are now finally in place for eastern
Germany.
Eastern Germany's gas sector has enormous potential, largely because growth
is coming from a very low base. This is because the former east German
communist regime relied heavily on brown coal, or lignite, to fuel the
manufacturing sector and industrial sector. Until unification, lignite
accounted for over 70 per cent of the primary energy market, and natural gas
a mere 10 per cent; for domestic consumers the ratio was about the same.
Several studies, including reports drawn up by the Ifo economics institute
in Munich, Prognos in Basle and Esso in Hamburg, reckon that gas consumption
in eastern Germany is set to increase from 56bn kilowatt-hours, to between
200bn and 225bn kwh by 2010.
To meet this extraordinary growth potential, VNG has embarked on an
ambitious modernisation programme. It entails converting town gas production
plants - currently fed from a low quality gas  - to natural gas; the
construction or conversion of long-distance gas pipelines and regional and
local pipeline systems; the conversion of underground town gas storages; and
the conversion of gas heaters, cookers, and other gas-fired installations.
Mr Wolfgang Eschment, a member of VNG's board, says 820,000 households, the
equivalent of a third of east Germany's 2.8m users of town gas, had already
been converted to natural gas by 1992 and a further 1.2m by the end of 1993
 -'by 1995, I reckon we will have converted about 80 per cent of all these
customers.'
VNG, backed by Ruhrgas, did not waste time in finding new customers. The
fact that VNG had close links with the municipalities - who are represented
on VNG's board - meant that they could win contracts without undue
competition in the towns and cities. In addition, to ensure almost blanket
control over the gas sector in many municipalities, VNG has obtained
sizeable stakes in energy companies, particularly in Leipzig, one of the
fastest growing economies in eastern Germany. It has also secured contracts
allowing it to supply 100 per cent of natural gas needs, apart from Leipizg,
to other cities, including Halle and Freiberg.
Since 1991, the integrated gas pipeline system operated by VNG, and
Erdgasversorgungsgesellschaft, or EVG, the Leipzig-based gas transmission
company in the states of Thuringia, Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt in which VNG
has a 50 per cent stake, exceeded 4,495km. The two companies operate an
integrated gas pipeline network of more than 8,800 km. A report by VNG
estimates that with these pipelines in place, by 2000 its new customers will
include a third of all dwellings in eastern Germany.
VNG's two underground facilities of Ketzin and Kirchheilingen have also been
converted and others have been expanded providing total storage capacity for
VNG of about 1.82bn cubic metres by 1992, while the first pipeline
connection with Poland was constructed in late 1992.
Despite the conversion programme, sales of gas have yet to stabilise. VNG's
total sales in 1992 amounted to 85.8bn kwh, some 8 per cent less than in the
previous year. Of this amount, sales of town gas fell by 31 per cent to
13.4bn kwh, as households started to switch to natural gas.
VNG admits that neither new nor existing customers can help compensate for
the sharp fall in sales of industry, caused largely by the collapse of
eastern Germany's manufacturing base. 'But there is no doubt about the
growth potential of the region's gas industry,' says Mr Eschment. 'Our
customers know we give them an excellent back-up service and a good price.'
But are the consumers being given choice?
Despite limited entry into the tightly-controlled market by British Gas and
Wintershall, VNG, and its patron, Ruhrgas, do not face any serious
competition. Moreover, the way in which gas is distributed in eastern
Germany means that the consumer pays a heavy price for gas.
As in western Germany, Ruhrgas sells its gas to distributors, which, as is
the case in the east. The distributors in turn sell the gas to the
municipalities, which are responsible for distributing and selling gas and
electricity to the consumers, and where the eventual price of gas is set.
Essentially, the consumer ends up paying for two sets of middlemen.
What Wintershall wanted was to sell gas directly to the eastern consumer,
thus making it cheaper. But given VNG's close relations with the
municipalites, and since the cities themselves have the concessions rights
enabling them to issue permits for anyone entering the transmission grids,
the chance for the east German consumer to exercise choice in price and
supplier has been severely limited.
For his part, VNG's Mr Eschment argues that since the restructuring of the
gas sector eastern Germans have gained an efficient and modern network
backed by investments totalling DM346m in 1992. This includes DM160m
targeted on the construction or extension of natural gas pipelines, and
DM56m on engineering and telecoms equipment.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (11): The
stamp of unity - Unification of post codes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was July 1, 1993. The postman arrived at the usual time.
'I thought you might be a bit late because of the new post codes.'
'Oh no - the system is working fine. The Germans have had enough time to
tell their friends and contacts about the changes,' said the postman.
Not even the post code could escape the affects of German unification.
'After all, we could not have Bonn and Weimar sharing the same post code of
5300. Could we?' said Mr Norbert Schafer, of the federal post office.
The west German postal code system was introduced in 1961, the year the
Berlin Wall divided this great city. The east German system, considered more
rational because it had more post codes covering much smaller areas, was
introduced in 1965. But with unification came the re-writing of the post
code.
The new post code, inspired by the French and Swedish models after two years
of research and trials, involved scrapping the existing 5,400 codes and
replacing them by 26,400 new ones.
Gone is the old 'W', (for West Germany) followed by a number, the city, then
another number.
Gone too is the 'O' for east Germany. Instead, the post code has been
simplified with just a set of numbers preceding the city, town or village.
The first two numbers denote the region, the last three the local post
office.
The German post office spent DM400m on introducing the new system, which
included DM200m on its development, such as installing new computers, DM80m
on advertising, and DM120m for distributing to the country's 34m households
the hefty 1.3 kg new postcode book - which even merited a book review in the
conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on April 30, 1993.
Everything was ready by July 1, 1993, when the two separate postcodes of
eastern and western Germany were unified.
And the success rate? After a few initial complaints from the large retail
and mail-ordering services, the post office authorities feel they can take a
bow.
'The acceptance rate has been very fast and high,' said Ms Franzi Koski, an
official at the post office.
'Several weeks after introducing it, we had a 90 per cent acceptance. Now,
we have about 96 per cent rate. We expect 99 per cent soon.'
And the postman will continue to turn up at the usual time.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (13): A
plastic body has its uses - Judy Dempsey goes on the trail of the
disappearing 'Trabi'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Mattauch reckons his small business which he set up last year has a
good chance of surviving.
Faram, employing 30 people, specialises in breaking up and recycling cars.
Not only western models, but the famous Trabant - affectionately known as
'the Trabi.' The bodywork, with its spluttering two-stroke engine, is made
of plastic rather than steel. It was one of the symbols of the former German
Democratic Republic. But like so many other products, it was in permanent
short supply. People had to wait nearly a decade for one. By the time the
Berlin Wall fell in November 1989, there more 1.9m Trabi drivers on the
roads.
As soon as unification came, many east Germans swapped their Trabi for a
western car. But not everyone did. Today, more than 920,000 Trabies still
chug along the roads of east Germany - 'it's surprising how many of these
cars still exist,' says Mr Mattauch, whose company is based in Rohr in the
eastern state of Thuringia. 'I suppose it's because the old Trabi is still
cheap.'
But there's another reason: the Trabi has become a bit of a cult symbol in
eastern Germany, and not least, part of the nostalgia for things east
German. Mr Mattauch is already breaking up 3,000 cars a year, including
1,000 Trabies. He is delighted that the east Germans have not yet deposited
their Trabies at waste recycling centres - 'I'll be in business for a long
time - I hope.'
But don't for a moment think that there is no life after death for a Trabi.
Because it is not steel, it can be shredded, melted down, and then made into
a form of plaster for the building industry - which shows it has qualities
hitherto unknown to its critics.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (12): Music
of the cash tills - Supermarkets spring up on virgin territory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone driving through eastern Germany for the first time cannot fail to
notice the number of vast shopping centres which have been built outside the
region's main towns and cities.
These centres, built on greenfield sites since unification, undoubtedly
fulfil a demand. Before 1989, eastern Germany's retailing sector, such as it
was, was monopolised by the Konsumgenossenschaft co-operatives, consisting
of department stores, supermarkets and small outlets; and the
Handelsorganisation, the state-run retail sector. Compared with western
German levels, which has 1-1.2 sq metres per capita of retail outlets, there
were 0.3 sq m per capita in eastern Germany before 1990.
Following unification, the large retailers from western Germany rushed in,
encouraged by a consumer spending spree by east Germans. In most cases, the
big chains decided immediately to acquire property outside the city centre.
They bought cheap land from the local councils, often for only DM3 a square
metre. More importantly, they could acquire the land easily because, unlike
the centre of the cities, there were few property rights claims. In
addition, they could take advantage of investment grants allocated by the
states of eastern Germany.
But there was another reason why the west German retailing sector decided to
locate outside the cities. Not only was the land relatively cheap, but
retailers could obtain planning permission quickly, unlike western Germany
where planning permission is strict, and because the local eastern councils
realised they could reap some of the benefits by claiming turnover tax from
the retailers.
Above all, west German retailers arrived in eastern Germany at a time when
the city authorities themselves had not yet decided what kind of long-term
planning they wanted for the inner cities. In short, no lobbies had yet
emerged in the city councils to protect the small shop-keepers and retail
sector in the inner cities from the competition emerging outside the city
perimeters.
Eastern Germany's city authorities are now questioning the benefits of these
shopping centres.
Mr Ralph Kausch, a retailing expert at Leipzig's Chamber of Commerce, says
the cities are the main losers. 'A struggle is taking place between the city
government and local councils. That struggle is about how to win back
consumers to the inner cities. The shopping centres are chiselling away at
the small retailers in the city and taking away employment in the inner
cities.'
By 1993, only 20 per cent of retail outlets, including department stores, in
eastern Germany had been based in the cities compared with about 80 per cent
in western German cities. The absence of the large retailers also means that
the cities, already strapped for revenue, are deprived of the turnover tax
from the retail sector.
Mr Krausch believes that Leipzig is losing taxes on an annual DM900m
turnover in the retail sector. In contrast, the small local council of
Gunthersdorf, west of Leipzig, which has a population of 650, can expect to
thrive from the giant 100,000 sq m Saale Park shopping complex which is
expected to reach a turnover of DM850m by 1995.
The cities in eastern Germany are now on the offensive, tightening up
planning permission with the aim of curbing the continuing expansion of the
shopping centres.
Ms Irene Krause, an official at Leipzig's planning office, said the city had
already granted planning permission to develop 455,000 square metres of
retailing outside the city but in future the city authorities intended to
impose limits.
It may be too late. Mr Berndt Ruckert, president of the Association of
German retailers, said recently that the cities provided few incentives for
retailers after German unification. 'Property in the inner cities was too
expensive and property rights were unclear,' he said. In Berlin's Mitte, the
heart of east Berlin, retailers would have had to pay between DM20,000 and
DM30,000 a sq m in the boom of 1992.
Yet there is a positive side to the retailing developments of the past three
years. If the infrastructure outside the cities continues to improve, it is
likely the consumers and retailers will both win: consumers will be given
more choice at more competitive prices, and retailers, boosted by the
availability of more capacity, unthinkable in western Germany, can now
rethink their long-term strategy for retailing throughout Germany.
Mr Cy Schluter, a Frankfurt-based retailing expert, said that retailers will
be able to build large warehouses, which will cut costs, shorten delivery
times, and pass on some of the benefits to the consumer. 'If you have a
large warehousing network, the transport and delivery costs can be kept
down, and ultimately prices can be kept down as well,' he said. Mr Schluter
added that as the road network improved, retailers would increasingly use
eastern Germany as a base for moving goods across Germany.
But it remains to be seen if the economy of eastern Germany can support
these large retailing outlets as the fear of unemployment forces people to
spend less.
There are few worries on the home-improvement front, as east Germans
continue to renovate their homes. Hornbach, the large home improvement
department stores, expects its four outlets in eastern Germany to account
for a quarter of its total turnover, which last year exceeded DM750m.
But Mr Schluter believes the food sector could come under pressure. 'The
outlets are not near the centre. People tend to buy food every day. I am not
so sure they are prepared to drive some distance for the most basic food
items.'

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (10): Forward
from the 1920s - Quentin Peel describes the replacement of an archaic phone
system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They used to say in the old communist East Germany that it was not the
Americans who were the real enemy: it was the rain.
'Every time it rained, the wet would get into the telephone cables, and
knock out half the system,' says Mr Wolf Reiner Menzel, sitting in the
massive old Post Ministry headquarters in Berlin's Leipziger Strasse.
'The concrete channels were so rotten, you couldn't keep it out. We tried to
dry them out with compressed air, but it only worked up to 100 metres on
either side of the telephone exchanges. So the rain simply cut off our
conversations.'
Not that the phone system was that efficient when the sun shone. Only one
person in 10 had a telephone, and some of the switchgear dated back to the
1920s. Of the 1.8m telephone connections, around two-thirds were in private
homes, and of those, 90 per cent used shared party-lines. You couldn't use
the phone if your neighbour was talking.
The other idiosyncracy of the system was that each of the main arms of the
totalitarian state had its own separate phone network: the army, the state
security service, and the communist party, for a start. Any senior
functionary had to have a battery of telephones on his desk to be linked up
with all the separate services. No one trusted anyone else.
That was the extraordinary system which greeted Deutsche Telekom, the west
German state monopoly, when it took on the task of modernising the east
German network at unification.
The result was the biggest single investment programme undertaken by any one
enterprise in east Germany, scheduled to cost DM60bn by 1997. In that time,
some 7.2m new telephone connections will be installed, as well as 360,000
fax connections, 50,000 packet-switched data links, 5m TV cable connections,
a complete digitalised switching system, optical fibre networks for both
long-distance and local calls, and a whole series of mobile communications
networks covering the entire territory.
'We will simply leapfrog several generations of telecommunications
technology,' says Mr Menzel, who is today responsible for customer services
and public relations. From having had one of the most antiquated phone
systems in Europe, the east Germans will have one of the most modern.
The telephone exchange in Halle, capital of east Germany's once-thriving
chemical industry, provides a graphic illustration. The old exchange was
built in 1922. Standing surrounded by 10-foot-high banks of
electro-mechanical switches is a bit like being in the middle of a weird
mechanical jungle, full of the manic clicks and rattles of thousands of
crazy crickets. At the end of every row is a red light, which switches on if
there is a fault. At least 25 per cent are blinking.
Next door, still surrounded by bundles of new cable, stand the slim new
digital switches which will replace them: a few rows of neat grey cupboards,
totally silent, and intended to be virtually maintenance-free. Human beings
are noticeable only by their absence.
In the Halle suburb of Silberhohe, on the top of a grim 19-storey block of
workers' apartments, past graffiti denouncing racist skinheads and
celebrating tekkno-music, a forest of aerials has sprung up to cope with the
explosion of mobile telephone calls expected from the revival of the east
German economy. There are 10,000 users already in the Halle region, and the
newly-installed capacity is 80 per cent exhausted at peak times.
In spite of the frantic pace of investment, Deutsche Telekom is only just
keeping pace with the growth in demand.
In 1993, 1.02m new connections were installed, and another 249,000 old lines
transferred, which reduced the waiting list by just 90,000 - because there
were 1.18m applications for new lines.
Mr Wilhelm Pallman, Telekom director responsible for the Aufbau Ost
investment programme, says: 'Telephones are still selling like hot cakes
 .Beside a television set, refrigerator and car, the citizens of the new
federal states clearly regard the telephone as one of the basic necessities
of life.'
He admits that one of the biggest problems at the moment is the number of
cables being cut in the course of all the construction activity under way
across the territory. 'Many cables have fallen victim to this positive
activity,' he says. 'Of course it only causes quite short-term
interruptions, but it also causes natural irritation. It proves that
telephoning has become a perfectly normal activity.'
The investment programme has concentrated on supplying the business sector
first, and the turnover per telephone - at DM1,200  - reflects that. It is
around 10 per cent higher than the similar figure in the west.
From a density of one telephone to 10 people at unification, the level has
risen to 24.2 per 100 inhabitants to date, compared with 49.9 in west
Germany. By 1997, the target is to reach 46.8 per 100 inhabitants in the
east, compared with 52.7 in the west.
The cost has undoubtedly been astronomical, with DM28bn spent so far. It is
one key factor driving Deutsche Telekom towards privatisation, which will
provide the option of financing its capital spending through the stock
market.
The federal court of auditors has expressed the fear that the programme has
been conducted regardless of expense, and many outsiders believe it might
have been cheaper to allow the major international telecoms giants to
compete in the market.
Deutsche Telekom retorts that it is only thanks to its monopoly that it was
able to mobilise such vast resources so quickly.
'Perhaps we have sometimes paid twice for the same line. And we threw cables
over autobahns, and hung them from the trees, knowing they would only be
used for six months. We used every possible contingency. But the need was
urgent. The politicians demanded it,' says Mr Menzel.
'The lack of telecommunications was the biggest single disadvantage cited by
potential investors. Today it isn't seen as a serious disadvantage any
more.'

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of Greater Philadelphia (11): Best hope for replacing
lost jobs - Tourism is the centre-piece of a programme to stimulate the
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For many tourists, Philadelphia is just a sign on the motorway, a place to
drive by on their way to New York, Washington or Baltimore.
Even though more than 10m people from outside the area visited the city last
year, spending nearly Dollars 500m, local officials have recognised that
Philadelphia is falling well short of its potential as a holiday and
business destination.
The issue is not just a matter of civic pride. Mayor Edward Rendell wants to
bring in more visitors, because the travel and leisure industry represents
Philadelphia's best hope of replacing some of an estimated 11,000 jobs lost
every year as companies restructure or move elsewhere. Since 1970, the
city's employment base has contracted by 240,000.
To stem the tide, Mr Rendell has made tourism the centre-piece of an
ambitious economic stimulus programme unveiled earlier this year. In his
1994 budget proposal, he earmarked some Dollars 420m for projects to lure
more visitors to the city. He says he is committed to helping Philadelphia
take 'its place as one of America's premiere destination cities'.
'By necessity, tourism has to be one of the pillars of the city's economy,'
says Thomas Muldoon, head of the Philadelphia Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau.
'We have to figure out how to make people stay longer and spend more.'
There is nothing wrong with the basic product. Unlike Cleveland or
Pittsburgh, it is not perceived as a grimy industrial town on the wane.
Indeed, its downtown streets are lined with graceful 18th century townhouses
and arresting post-modern office towers, forming a sprawling showcase of
American architecture.
Unlike Detroit or Miami, the city of brotherly love does not suffer from a
image as a crime capital. Rather, it is perceived as a place of civility and
charm, a modern urban centre still tightly bound to its Quaker traditions.
Yet its sports fans are notorious for their irascibility. Whenever its four
professional sports teams fail to measure up, the home crowd is sure to boo
mercilessly. In baseball, the Phillies exemplified the city's scrappy
sporting tradition, going from worst to first in their league last season.
As a centre of history, the city has always stood top of the table. It is
bursting at the seams with landmarks. The Liberty Bell, the symbol of
America's fledgling democracy, and Independence Hall, where the Declaration
of Independence was adopted and the US constitution written, form the core
of 'America's most historic square mile'.
Philadelphia is also home of the country's third largest art museum, the
world's leading symphony orchestra in terms of record sales, and seven out
of 50 of the best restaurants in the US, according to a recent survey of
Conde Naste Traveler's readers.
In short, Philadelphia is one of the most interesting places on the east
coast. So where has it gone wrong? 'Philadelphia's basic problem is that it
suffers from a lack of image,' says Mr RC Staab, a senior tourism official.
'People don't necessarily know why they should come here.'
Mr Rendell intends to get the word out. The 'capstone' of his strategy is
already in place, with the opening last summer of the Dollars 500m
Philadelphia Convention Center, build with public and private funding. The
second phase of the complex, the restored Reading Terminal Train Shed, was
completed this spring. The huge, hangar-like structure, which stands
alongside the main convention hall, houses a grand ballroom and a bustling
farmers' market.
The centre itself, the second largest convention hall on the east coast, is
designed to serve two functions.
First, the city is confident it will become a magnet for conventioneers,
eventually attracting some 500,000 visitors a year. The economic impact of
this 'critical mass' of visitors will spill over into the entire leisure
industry, says Mr Staab. 'Historically, an increase in meetings and
conventions in a city leads to an increase in tourism.'
Bookings are already running well ahead of projections. Mr Muldoon says the
centre's early success in part reflects in its prime location two blocks
from the elaborate Victorian city hall, the geographic and commercial centre
of Philadelphia.
Therein lies the complex's second function. 'What this convention center
becomes is a focal point for the city,' Mr Muldoon says. 'The key was to put
it in the middle of the city,' in contrast to New York's Jacob Javits
Center, which is situated at the western fringe of Manhattan.
Blending warmly with the weathered brick and granite facades of central
Philadelphia, the complex stands at the crossroads linking all the city's
leading tourist sites, a 'loop' of attractions which the mayor hopes to bind
together in a package.
To the east, lies the downtown historical district. A few blocks west is a
parade of museums along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.
A short walk to the south is the 'Avenue of the Arts', where the city has
embarked on a Dollars 300m programme to create a performing-arts complex
along a mile-long stretch of South Broad street. The idea is to build on an
existing base of cultural institutions along the corridor, including the
celebrated Philadelphia orchestra and the Pennsylvania ballet.
The scheme, to be financed by public and private money, involves the
construction of new concert halls and theatres, and the renovation of
others. Mr Rendell estimates the avenue, when completed, will double the
number of visitors along Broad street to 1.6n a year and create 1,600 jobs.
But the plan has raised some controversy. Two of the city's leading
philanthropists are opposing Mr Rendell's proposal to move the orchestra
into a new Dollars 140m concert hall. Its current home, the 137-year-old
Academy of Music, is to be used for opera and ballet performances after it
is restored.
Other aspects of the mayor's master plan have ruffled feathers as well,
especially his method of financing the construction of at least 800 new
hotel rooms. They are considered essential for the long-term success of the
convention center, and ultimately the future of the city's tourism industry.
Mr Rendell has pledged Dollars 90m in public funds for new hotels over the
next five years, with the aim of attracting another Dollars 100m in private
financing. The extra space would complement the 1,200-room Philadelphia
Marriott, the third phase of the convention complex, due to open next year.
The problem is that the mayor intends to pay for the hotels in part with
money generated by riverboat gambling, which the state legislature is
expected to approve this year.
Critics say the floating casinos would lead to more crime along the
waterfront and, more important, besmirch the city's image as 'the cradle of
democracy'.
But city officials are steadfast in their defence of the proposal. With
gaming restricted to riverboats, they argue, the social problems associated
with Las Vegas-style casinos would not develop. With a motorway separating
the waterfront from the historic old city, the presence of floating casinos
would not overwhelm the neighbouring districts.
'We don't think it will detract from the character of the area,' says
Stephen Mullin, Philadelphia's director of commerce. 'As a matter of fact,
we think it will add a new dimension, bringing another exciting activity to
the city.'

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (9):
Agriculture sector still a collective mess - Many land disputes have yet to
be resolved, but private farming is slowly being reborn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Monika Singer knows all about agriculture in the eastern state of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
Before she became mayor of the small village of Gross-Wustenfelde in 1990,
she had worked for eight years on the nearby State Collective farm, or LPG.
Now, she spends hours in her small office dealing with queries and farmers'
complaints, leaving her with little time for her five children.
'Its tough. The enormous pace at which agriculture has been restructured has
left people disorientated largely because so many have lost their jobs,' she
said.
'Maybe it has been too fast, because at the same time we also had to
integrate our agricultural sector not only into the west German system but
into the European Union as well.'
There is hardly a village in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern which has not been
affected by these changes. United Germany inherited a complex farm sector in
eastern Germany.
After the second world war, the large estates of the former German
aristocratic families had been expropriated by the Soviet authorities which
administered eastern Germany between 1945 and 1949. These estates were
broken up and distributed among ethnic Germans forced out of eastern Europe.
Many received plots of land of about six hectares.
Not long after, the east German communist regime placed about 75 per cent of
the private farms under co-operatives, normally about 4,500 hectares in
size.
The remainder of east Germany's 6.2m hectares were turned into giant LPG
state farms. Coping with that legacy has proved one of the other difficult
aspects of restructuring the east German economy.
After unification, the federal government embarked on a two-pronged
strategy: the right to restitution and compensation was granted to former
owners of land under 100 hectares.
This right did not extend to those owners of the large estates which had
been expropriated by the Soviet authorities between 1945 and 1949; and the
Treuhand privatisation agency set about privatising or leasing 1.3m hectares
of land, a third of the total arable land in eastern Germany.
By the middle of this year, the Treuhand will have leased out 700,000
hectares, many on 12-year contracts.
Mr Otto Bammell, a senior official at the federal ministry of agriculture,
admits the re-privatisation of land has thrown up many unforeseen problems.
'Many people now have their land back. But in the process, they soon
discovered they had a giant silo stuck in the middle of their property, or
found huge barns which once belonged to the collective farm.
There are now disputes about who owns these buildings and who should remove
them. It's a mess,' he said. Then there was the unresolved question about
how much former small landowners would receive in compensation instead of
restitution.
Apart from property disputes, the government is also faced with very high
levels of unemployment in states such as Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and
Brandenburg where entire communities depended for their livelihood on the
state, or collective farms.
'Under the old system, there were 850,000 people working on the land, or
about 14 people per 100 hectares. That's at least three times the number
compared with western Germany,' said Mr Bammell. Since 1990 this figure had
fallen to about 200,000 people as a result of restructuring, he said.
'The reforms have been successful to the extent that farming is now more
efficient. But in some villages, about 60 per cent of the population have no
work. There is no industry in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern into which people can
move. Politically, and socially, it is extremely dangerous,' he added.
Restructuring also co-incided with integrating east German agriculture into
the European Union system.
'When we started the reform of agriculture we also had to reconcile levels
of production with EU regulations, which entailed putting aside 15 per cent
of arable land,' explained Mr Bammell.
'This meant limiting crop production here in eastern Germany to 3.6m
hectares. This is the base area which would make us eligible for EC price
support,' he added.
In the process, German officials had discovered that the state of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern had planted 17 per cent above permitted levels, and
the states of Saxony and Thuringia had overshot by 10 per cent. In total,
eastern Germany has exceeded the base area by 350,000 hectares.
As a result, farmers in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern may be asked to set aside a
total of one third of its land, without compensation, in order to pay the
penalty for over-production. Agricultural officials say it will be some time
before east German agriculture stabilises.
'The people have had to cope with so much change on the land. A complete
breakdown of the former system took place after unification. We now have to
restructure the entire sector stage-by-stage both socially and
economically,' said Mr Bammell.
For Ms Singer, the completion of that process cannot come soon enough.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (8): Search
for stolen rights - Property owners struggle with the legacies of Hitler and
Stalin. Disputes will take a long time to resolve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A US developer who is investing more than DM800m in eastern Germany recently
paid out more than DM1m as compensation to a former owner of a property who
had tried to repossess it. Had he not paid out, his ambitious redevelopment
of the property would have been delayed, and another costly design might
have been required.
An Anglo-American consortium, which had invested heavily in the states of
Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, is still trying to resolve a property rights
dispute after signing the contract with the Treuhand privatisation agency.
A Jewish family, forced to leave Nazi Germany in 1938, is still trying to
reclaim its property after four years of lengthy and bureaucratic
negotiations with the regional office for property questions.
The cases are typical of the claims being made by former owners (or their
heirs) for property in eastern Germany confiscated either during the Nazi
Third Reich or under the post war communist regime. Their claims often
collide with the efforts of commercial developers to take advantage of
eastern Germany's integration into the capitalist west.
In spite of such cases, German bankers, the Treuhand privatisation agency
and the teams of consultants and advisers insist that investment in the five
eastern Lander is not being held up by any outstanding property disputes.
Under the unification treaty, all owners who had their property confiscated
between 1933 and 1945 are entitled to restitution of their rights or to
compensation.
All owners whose property was confiscated between 1949 and 1990 are entitled
to similar rights. But those who had property expropriated between 1945 and
1949, when east Germany was under Soviet administration, are not entitled to
restitution, and only recently, won the right to a more limited form of
compensation.
The deadline for registering claims was December 31, 1992. A year later, the
Federal office for the Regulation of Property Questions still faced 1.08m
outstanding claims on 2.6m titles. By that time, Berlin had resolved 16.3
per cent of claims, Saxony, 51.95. All told, 30 per cent have been resolved.
According to officials at the Property Questions Office, it will take
another decade to close the books.
The federal government chose restitution of property rather than
compensation partly for financial reasons. Bonn simply did not have the
funds to allow only compensation. Yet no sooner had these rights been
granted than the Treuhand and bankers realised that investment in eastern
Germany would be held back unless new investors had precedence over
claimants for restitution. Following some amendments, it is possible to buy
commercial property in eastern Germany if one undertakes to invest (and
create jobs). In these cases, former owners of the property generally have
to settle for compensation at market value.
There are still outstanding questions over the level of compensation to to
individuals who cannot reclaim their property, either because it had been
legally bought by east Germans after 1949, or because municipal buildings,
such as a hospital, has been built on the original site.
The federal finance ministry has drafted several bills, suggesting that
compensation be valued on the 1935 value of land, but multiplied by several
factors depending on the nature of the property; that a ceiling be imposed
on compensation payouts; and payments be gradually paid out through some
bond system.
How do these delays in compensation legislation affect investment decisions?
Mr Hansjurgen Schafer, head of the Berlin-based federal office for Property
Questions, says that with about 70 per cent of the real estate titles 'there
are no problems'. But the other 30 per cent were 'really critical'.
One problem is deciding the actual purchase price as a basis for paying
compensation. From the legal point of view it was also sometimes difficult
to establish whether property was acquired legally after 1949. For instance,
Mr Wolfgang Berghofer, the former mayor of Dresden, gave apartments and
houses to his communist party friends and other political cronies.
'How do we assess the status of that property? Did these people receive the
property legally or not? Was it legal under the former German Democratic
Republic or not?' asked one official from the Property Questions Office.
Then there are cases frequently experienced by members of the Jewish
community. When they fled from Hitler, the Nazis, or those who had taken
over their property, went to the Land Registry. There, they either tore out
the pages containing the Jewish title to that property, wrote in their own,
or simply crossed out the original owners' names with black ink and wrote
their own names below.
The central land registry at Barby, near Magdeburg in Saxony-Anhalt, has
many such examples. These cases became even more complicated when the new
'owners' destroyed these documents or were stripped of the property by the
east German communist authorities.
In an bizarre twist of history, former Nazis have taken advantage of
unification to claim back these former Jewish properties, while their
original Jewish owners frantically search for their title deeds, or, with
the help of infra-red equipment at the Property Questions office in Barby,
try to read their names through the black ink.
There is one other problem. It is quite easy to buy agricultural land in
eastern Germany. But former owners of land expropriated between 1945 and
1949 are still insisting on equality of property rights before the law.
Since they will not have the right to restitution, they are seeking fair
compensation.
Mr Hans Marcus, a London-based lawyer at Pannone &amp; Partners, says the
situation in eastern Germany is 'a mess - no matter what the establishment
says, there are big problems with property rights. These disputes have
hindered investment decisions . . . such problems will take a long time to
resolve.'

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring Eastern Germany (7): Surge in
construction continues unabated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German and foreign construction companies have moved quickly into a region
starved of capital investment in housing, real estate and renovation in a
bid to make up for lost time over the past 45 years.
These companies are also playing a crucial role in providing jobs. More than
383,000 people are now employed in construction.
The building boom, which shows no sign of slowing, is a welcome development
for west German and foreign companies. They have offset poor returns at home
because of the recession by capitalising on the expanding construction
market in eastern Germany.
In west Germany, total investment in the building industry last year
totalled DM347.8bn, a sharp decline on the previous year.
In eastern Germany, in contrast, total investment amounted to DM87.5bn,
accounting for 7.1 per cent of GDP in real terms.
'Immediately after unification, there was a massive surge in public
investment, but from very low levels of (previous) investment as well as a
low GDP base,' said Mr Heiko Stiepelmann, a spokesman for Germany's
association for the building industry.
'We can now see a pattern emerging in east Germany,' he continued. 'At
first, there was a rapid and large public investment programme.' This was
mainly in the non-residential state sector, including roads, bridges, public
buildings, hospitals and schools. 'Then the private sector began building or
modernising enterprises and offices and now, over the next few years, we
will see activity on the housing front - not only renovating old stock, but
particularly building new homes as well,' he added.
In 1993 alone, the federal government invested more than DM18.3bn in
upgrading the infrastructure, a rise of 15 per cent on the previous year. It
was followed by private companies which invested DM35.3bn in non-residential
property, an increase of 22 per cent on 1992, and private housing, where
over DM33.9bn was invested, a rise of 42.2 per cent (all based on 1993 price
levels).
Mr Frank Soffner, a housing expert at the Munich-based Ifo institute,
believes that investment throughout the construction industry in eastern
Germany will continue to rise by 16 per cent each year.
On 1991 prices, it could reach DM2,400bn by the year 2005. However, he says
this level of investment would need to be maintained, if not increased, if
the German east was to reach the west's standards by that time.
So far, there are few indications to suggest that investment in the
construction industry will slow. The governments of the five eastern states
continue to offer generous financial incentives and tax holidays for
investors, and as more outstanding property claims are resolved, more
residential housing will require renovation. The federal government is also
planning to privatise 15 per cent of eastern German housing stock over the
next 10 years.
In reports issued by Ifo, the Basle-based Prognos, the number of dwellings
will increase even as the birth rate declines. In eastern Germany today, an
average 2.4 persons live in one home. This number will fall to 2.2 by 2000
and 2.1 by 2010, creating the need for more dwellings.
In addition, experts reckon that of the 6.9m dwellings registered in eastern
Germany, about 500,000 are no longer suitable for occupancy.
By 2000, they believe that between 7m and 7.3m dwellings will be required.
In short, one-family and two-family homes will account for a very large
share of construction activity for the rest of the 1990s, rising from 34 per
cent in 1989 to more than 38 per cent in 2000. As a result, east German
housing will soon match the occupancy - and quality levels - of its west
German counterparts.
Yet, the boom in the east German construction industry has had some negative
side-effects for west German companies. Wages in eastern Germany's
construction industry are approaching 90 per cent of west German levels,
although, according to Mr Stiepelmann, productivity levels are between 70
per cent and 80 per cent of west German levels.
At the same time, as more and more non-German companies enter the east
German building industry, often bringing their own crews, and in some cases
hiring workers from the neighbouring countries of eastern Europe, west
German companies are faced with competition - 'some local authorities are
contracting out to foreign companies because they can do things more
cheaply,' said Mr Stiepelmann.
'The German industry's high wage levels and competition mean that west
German companies have not reaped all the benefits of the construction boom
in eastern Germany' - but it may bring savings for city authorities.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (6): The high
price of national unity - A steep fall in employment levels / 37 per cent of
the eastern labour force is now idle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rarely, if ever, has a labour force experienced such a radical and swift
transformation as that which swept eastern Germany.
When the Berlin Wall was breached in November 1989, the 9.3m workers of
eastern Germany were heavily concentrated in manufacturing and agriculture.
More than 920,000 people worked on the land. That number has since dropped
to 210,000, a 70 per cent reduction.
More significantly, the 3.17m employed in manufacturing are now down by 60
per cent to 1.29m. In mining and energy, production decreased by 39 per cent
between 1989 and 1992.
Overall, the number of available jobs fell by at least 34 per cent from 9.3m
in 1989 to 6.2m in 1993. Since that time, the total labour force has
decreased to 8.2m, largely as a result of migration.
Several factors explain the steep fall in employment.
Most of the products from east German manufacturing were aimed at markets in
eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
The competition caused by the merging of the GDR's Ost-Mark with the western
D-Mark.
The collapse of the Comecon socialist trading organisation, and the
inability of the eastern European countries and the former USSR to pay for
east German goods. The policies of the Treuhand privatisation agency, which
sought to reduce overmanning, close or break up and restructure the large
Kombinate, or state-owned enterprises, to prepare them for privatisation.
The breakup of the LPGs, or collective farms.
The wage levels, which imposed another brake on the demand side of the
labour market. Since wages are set to equal west German levels by 1996,
despite productivity often 60 per cent below west German levels, unit labour
costs are around 170 per cent of west German levels.
'In reality, we would require a reduction by a further third of the work
force if we were to match productivity levels of western Germany,' commented
one economist.
By March of this year, 16.8 per cent of the labour force, or 1.26m, were
unemployed. That did not include those on short-time work (135,000), job
re-training and job creation schemes (249,000, and 238,000 respectively) and
those who had taken early retirement (205,000). All told, 37 per cent of the
total eastern labour force is idle. Last year, the federal labour office
paid out DM54.7bn in unemployment benefit.
The question is whether these very high unemployment levels have become
permanent features of eastern Germany, and whether the federal government
can continue to allocate nearly DM55bn each year as the price for
maintaining social stability and for subsidising consumer spending in the
east.
A recent report by the Berlin-based DIW Institute for Economic Research
concluded that if the labour market in Germany did not radically change,
there would be around 5m people without regular employment in the unified
Germany by the end of the decade. It added that the economy would be
burdened by higher taxes which would reduce enterprises' profits and could
dampen the willingness to invest.
Against this background, few economists believe that - with the exclusion of
women - the size of the labour market in eastern Germany will ever
correspond to west German or western European levels.
Mr Wolfgang Scheremet, a labour expert at the DIW Institute, said that even
when the recession ended in Germany, 'there will simply be not enough new
jobs in eastern Germany to absorb the high levels of unemployment.'
The manufacturing base, overmanned before unification, and now in a state of
collapse, could no longer be considered as a viable instrument for
rebuilding mass employment.
Instead, Mr Scheremet believes that some positive and negative trends within
the labour force are likely to emerge in the following sectors:
Construction. This sector will continue to play an important role as the
housing stock is modernised, the infrastructure is upgraded, and hotels and
offices are erected. Mr Scheremet reckons that the construction industry
already accounts for about 12 per cent of the labour market.
Innovative technology. A lot of money is being spent on introducing
innovative and high levels of technology which will quickly become
competitive and find a niche in international market. For instance, Siemens
is investing DM2.4bn in a new microchip plant in Dresden which will create
more than 1,200 jobs. The success of such enterprises are underpinned by
investment grants.
Services and the Handwerk, (the small trades and craftsmen sector). These
sectors are already capitalising on the construction boom. The DIW and other
economic institutes see the Handwerk, embracing 700,000 people, as one of
the engines of economic revival. 'The number of people in the Handwerk are
increasing as the manufacturing continues to decrease,' says Mr Schemeret.
But these trends alone are not enough to absorb the high levels of
unemployed. By 1993, western Germany was still supplying 90 per cent of the
goods and services bought in eastern Germany.
Meanwhile, the cheap labour in neighbouring eastern Europe could help to
keep high unemployment figures in eastern Germany.
The German economic institutes argue that if any small increase in the
demand for labour emerges, especially for intensive labour, western German
enterprises are more likely to shift production to the neighbouring
countries of eastern Europe. The DIW study argues, that in the short term,
this will deter investment both in west and east Germany.
In the medium and long term, it would benefit Germany as a whole because it
would create a hinterland with very favourable cost conditions for
suppliers. However, it concludes: 'The positive effects of this will,
however, not be felt until the beginning of the next decade at the
earliest.'
Women are the only sector of the labour market that appears to be matching
western German levels. Eastern Germany's 8.1m women represent half the
population. Before unification, more than 90 per cent of women, or 49 per
cent of the total labour force in eastern Germany, were employed.
In contrast, of the 33.4m women in western Germany, more than 20m are
classified as housewives while 13m are registered on the labour market.
Yet since unification, women, who are now more than two-thirds of eastern
Germany's total unemployed, are being economically and socially forced back
to the home as the labour market shrinks and radically different patterns of
work take hold.
By late 1992, more than 4.2m east German women were registered as
housewives, and 3.9m were registered on the labour market.
Yet even on the labour market, more than 905,000 are unemployed - not
including those women on short-time work, job creation and job retraining
schemes and early retirement. In western Germany, the number of unemployed
women is 858,000.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of Greater Philadelphia (8): US Healthcare cuts
costs, retains quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A pleasant but innocuous office complex, 20 miles north-west of
Philadelphia, has become a focal point in the great debate over the future
of the American healthcare system.
The headquarters of US Healthcare, located in the leafy suburb of Blue Bell,
has been the incubator for many of the ideas which are likely to form the
basis for healthcare reform, the hottest issue on the national political
agenda.
As one of the country's first health maintenance organisations, set up in
the late 1970s with a small government grant, the company has developed many
of the practices which have come to be known as 'managed care'.
Building on early success, the company has become the one of Philadelphia
area's biggest businesses, with annual revenues of Dollars 2.65bn. It
operates in eight states in the north-east, but Pennsylvania remains its
largest market by far.
What is managed care? Under its system, explains Mr Costas Nicolaides, chief
financial officer, 'the financing and delivery of care is integrated'; as
opposed to the traditional indemnity systems, in which the insurer 'simply
pays bills'.
A plethora of proposals to reform the inefficient US healthcare system is
now under consideration by Congress. President Clinton, in presenting his
benchmark plan, made reform his administration's top priority.
The final form of the legislative package is far from certain. But it is
becoming apparent in Washington that many aspects of the model championed by
US Healthcare will feature prominently in the bill that finally emerges this
autumn.
'Most federal healthcare reform proposals emphasise going more toward
managed care, in order to build savings into the system more
constitutionally than at present,' says Mr David Simon, senior
vice-president.
As the largest and most innovative company in its field, US Healthcare has
convinced many sceptics that soaring US medical costs can be effectively
contained without undermining the quality and availability of services.
In fact, it has shown that low costs and high-quality care are
mutually-supporting goals when the traditional hands-off relationship
between insurers and medical providers is abandoned. 'Quality care in the
end costs less for us and the customer,' says Mr Simon.
Prevention, it appears, is worth much more than an ounce of cure. By placing
emphasis on primary and pre-emptive care, US Healthcare has found ways of
cutting hospital stays and expensive medical procedures. It has pioneered
programmes aimed at promoting 'wellness' - how to help people stay healthy -
as well as schemes for the early detection of illness.
Its high-risk maternity programme is a good example. By offering pregnant
women in certain categories early access to specialists, US Healthcare
achieved a 50 per cent reduction in the use of neo-natal intensive-care
services.
By contrast, most traditional health plans neither pay for preventive care,
even in high-risk cases, nor control access to specialists. Patients are
left to their own devices. The result is often unnecessary visits, which
drive up premiums, or more expensive treatment after serious symptoms
develop. That's bad medicine as well as bad business.
By making preventive and medical-management programmes its hallmark, US
Healthcare held growth in its costs per member to 4 per cent last year, a
full point lower than the rate at which the medical consumer price index
increased.
The company's operating economies are reflected in its price tag. A recent
independent analysis showed that the company's coverage costs a family about
half the amount charged by typical indemnity plans, when differences in
benefits and total out-of-pocket expenditures are taken into account. Even
when such factors are not considered, US Healthcare says its premiums are 20
to 30 per cent less.
As with most HMOs, a fixed monthly payment entitles subscribers to unlimited
treatment by a network of providers, with only nominal charges for each
office visit. General practitioners are the gate-keepers to a team of
specialists, all of whom work under contract with the company.
By contrast, most traditional indemnity plans require customers to pay
'deductibles', or excess payments. Premiums are assessed on the basis of the
individual's risk of falling ill, and sometimes coverage is denied. This
practice is known as 'experience rating'.
Instead, HMOs use 'community' rating, which combines the risk of all
subscribers and divides it equally among them. 'It's a much more egalitarian
system. But most importantly it prevents situations in which people who are
sicker, or who get sick, have to pay more,' Mr Simon says.
But low premiums are only part of the equation. The company's medical costs
as a percentage of income dropped to 68 per cent last year, from 75.1 per
cent in 1992. Membership, meanwhile, jumped nearly 12 per cent to 1.67m,
continuing a long string of double-digit increases from internal growth,
rather than acquisitions. Total premium revenue was up 21 per cent.
Not surprisingly, higher gross income and lower cost added up to a 50 per
cent surge in 1993 net earnings to Dollars 300m last year. 'One of the
reasons US Healthcare has been so profitable is they have such good control
over the product and pricing,' says Mr David Lothson, an analyst at Paine
Webber in New York.
Senior US Healthcare executives are clearly feeling a quiet satisfaction
over the growing appeal of their approach.
Since the national debate over healthcare started in earnest last year,
'there has been a greater awareness of the kind of things that count:
quality, cost-containment and accountability. These are things that US
Healthcare began to recognise long ago,' says Mr Nicolaides.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of Greater Philadelphia (7): Bell Atlantic eyes
multimedia - The region is home to some of the most famous corporate names
in American business. FT writers discuss the progress of four of them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 53-storey, four-year-old Bell Atlantic Tower is a dominant feature of
the Philadelphia skyline and a permanent reminder of the importance to the
city of this innovative local telephone giant.
Bell Atlantic is one of the seven 'Baby Bells' - the regional phone
companies spun off from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph in 1984 under an
anti-trust court settlement.
It is the dominant telephone company in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia and Washington DC. Not only is its
headquarters, the Bell Atlantic Tower, in Philadelphia, but so too is the
headquarters of its local telecommunications operating company for the
state, called Bell Atlantic, Pennsylvania.
The company has gained a reputation under Raymond Smith, its chief executive
since 1989, of being the most entrepreneurial of the Baby Bells.
But radical change is sweeping through the US telecommunications industry as
the boundaries which divide it from the cable television and computer
industries blur. This is eroding the local monopolies as new rivals, such as
cable companies, start providing telephone services.
The change is also opening up huge new opportunities for the Baby Bells,
which can play a leading role in the provision of inter-active multimedia -
combining traditional telecommunications and television-based services - to
the home and office. In addition, they should eventually be allowed to enter
the long-distance telecommunications market, an area from which they are
barred under the AT&amp;T break-up agreement.
Bell Atlantic is at the forefront of this revolution - though it suffered an
embarrassing setback this year when it had to call off a merger with
Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable service provider in the US.
The deal collapsed in February, ostensibly because the Federal
Communications Commission ordered the cable industry to make big cuts in the
basic rates it charges consumers, which in turn upset the terms on which
merger had been agreed.
However, other factors may have been involved, including a clash of culture
between the racy, entrepreneurial TCI and Bell Atlantic, which, for all Mr
Smith's changes, retains a somewhat conservative culture deep down.
The chief executive is a native of western Pennsylvania who joined the local
AT&amp;T operating company, then called Bell of Pennsylvania, in 1961. He became
president of the company in 1983. When he became chief executive of Bell
Atlantic six years later he moved quickly to cut costs, and the group is now
the slimmest of the Baby Bells, ranked by number of employees relative to
phone lines.
Despite the collapse of the TCI deal, Bell Atlantic will still be a major
force in multimedia; but, as Mr Smith said recently, it will now pursue a
more flexible strategy on a 'market by market, partner by partner basis'.
This suggests that it will take the company substantially longer to build up
a significant presence outside its own operating area.
Within its operating area, it is pressing ahead with several important
inter-active initiatives. In August it won a landmark court victory which
has freed it to provide its own inter-active video service down its phone
lines, an area from which it was barred under 1984 cable television
legislation.
It has been testing such a service in Northern Virginia, and in July will
open a new digital production centre in Reston, Virginia, where its
interactive services will be created and packaged for delivery to consumers.
Its other initiatives in this area include: joining with a small New Jersey
company to blanket the New York area with an inter-active wireless
television service to compete with cable TV; and teaming up with companies
in two areas of New Jersey to deliver cable television programmes over
modernised phone lines.
Although the company has no large-scale multimedia experiments under way in
Pennsylvania, the state expects to get its fair share in future. Bell
Atlantic expects to will spend Dollars 80m on new plant in the region around
Philadelphia this year, and intends to make ISDN - an intermediate
technology which increases the capacity of an ordinary phone line -
available throughout the area this year.
As for community activism, Tony diGioia, executive director for external
affairs, Bell Atlantic, Pennsylvania, says the company's main thrust is in
the areas of economic development and education.
Some Dollars 3.5m of the subsidiary's Dollars 5.7m state-wide contributions
budget is committed to the Philadelphia area, with about Dollars 1.5m of the
total going on educational projects. The company's activities include a
programme to help reduce the school drop-out rate, by sending employees into
schools to talk about career choices; and mentoring, under which staff
members adopt a school child and give him or her guidance. Bell Atlantic has
also adopted two schools in the troubled inner-city area, and tries to give
them extra help.
As for economic development, it is a partner in a scheme which helps small
businesses across Pennsylvania identify problems and expand, and it has also
been involved in the creation of a computer model which will identify what
businesses can best be recruited for particular areas of the state.
Within Philadelphia itself, the company is one of 21 organisations involved
in Strategy 21, a partnership working to improve the industrial
competitiveness of the city in the 21st century.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of Greater Philadelphia (10): Sun emerges from the
clouds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Philadelphia loves a comeback story. It is a spirit epitomised in the movies
by Rocky Balboa, the washed-up palooka who made the most of his last big
shot to be somebody.
In real life, there is no finer example than the impressive turnround by Sun
Company, one of the stalwarts of Philadelphia's old industrial base.
In 1991, the 108-year-old energy group - the fourth biggest company in the
region - was a flabby under-achiever weighed down by a bloated portfolio of
peripheral businesses. Overall, its operations were producing a meagre 2 per
cent return on equity.
Just two years later, the company is showing a return on equity of 10 per
cent, having transformed itself into a lean contender with good prospects of
sustained growth.
'They have identified where they have the best chance to be profitable,'
says Mr George Baker, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. 'In doing so,
they have gone a long way towards making the company a more focused
enterprise.'
Sun has gone a long way in setting itself apart from its rivals, too. More
than any other big energy group, it has emphasised a commitment to safe and
sustainable environmental practices. It was the first Fortune 500 company to
endorse the principles of the Coalition of Environmentally Responsible
Economies, a non-profit organisation set up after the Exxon Valdez oil-spill
to promote green business policies.
On a smaller scale, Sun has put a human face on its corporate image with
several innovative programmes, including an offer to buy and junk worn-out
cars which are heavy polluters.
In a small step which may symbolise the fresh approach, its headquarters was
brought back to downtown Market Street after 23 years' exile in the suburb
of Radnor. Nostalgia, however, had less to do with the relocation than did a
desire to cut costs.
The move was part of a comprehensive streamlining implemented soon after Mr
Robert Campbell took over as chairman and chief executive in 1992. Under the
new regime, the company has shifted its focus back to its traditional
strengths - refining and marketing in the north-east.
In its core operating region, Sun commands 14 per cent of the retail petrol
trade, the second largest share behind Mobil. Branded petrol accounts for 37
per cent of total sales, by far the company's most important revenue
generator. Sun hopes to build on these strengths.
Concurrently, the group has withdrawn from the areas where it was taking a
beating. It finally threw in the towel on most of its international
exploration operations, after spinning off its US exploration and production
in 1988.
'In drilling for oil and gas, we had a horrible record,' admits Mr Robert
Aiken, chief financial officer. The company is still involved in
international crude production, which remains profitable. Coal mining and
real estate were deemed losing propositions, too.
In Sun's continuing operations, expenses were slashed and the workforce
reduced by 20 per cent to 14,000.
So far, the results have exceeded Mr Campbell's goals. Sun posted operating
profit of Dollars 193m last year, against Dollars 30m ayear earlier. The
figure is well ahead of his target of achieving a Dollars 150m improvement.
The company was again able to tap operating income in paying its dividend,
another of the chairman's ambitions.
Analysts are divided about some of the company's specific moves, and point
out that its recovery is part of cyclical upturn by the industry as a whole.
But most agree that the overall strategy is sound.
Sun wins plaudits for securing long-term leases to operate filling stations
along the Pennsylvania turnpike. The company also gained exclusive rights to
sell petrol along the New Jersey turnpike, perhaps the most travelled
highway in America. The high visibility of operating along such motorways
carries benefits that exceed the revenues they directly generate, analysts
say.
Meanwhile, filling stations in the mid-west have been sold; underperforming
outlets in the north-east have been pared from its 3,000-strong network. A
move to integrate its branded petrol offerings under a single banner -
Sunoco  - is also expected to pay off in higher margins, a critical factor
in petrol retailing, where demand at best grows a scant 1 per cent a year.
The group also put a feather in its cap by agreeing to buy a Chevron
refining plant located on property adjacent to its main Philadelphia
facility. The bargain-basement price of Dollars 170m made the deal an easy
sell, even though the potential environmental remediation costs which Sun
may face have yet to be quantified, says Mr John Hilton, an analyst at Argus
Research in New York.
'Such investments are usually just shots in the dark,' says Mr James
Murchie, who follows the industry for Sanford C Berstein in New York. He
argues that future demand and margins on refined products are nearly
impossible to gauge. Refining, a costly necessity for a marketer of
petroleum products, continues to be a drag on Sun's bottom line, accounting
for Dollars 80m in operating losses last year.
Still, the Chevron acquisition was a safe bet, says Mr Murchie. Indeed, if
the deal had been completed before this winter's deep freeze, which brought
a sharp increase in demand for heating oil, the investment would have
already paid for itself.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of Greater Philadelphia (9): How Unisys recovered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They are smiling again at the Jolly Road, Blue Bell, headquarters of Unisys,
the largest high-technology company in the Philadelphia region. After years
of heavy losses that brought the computer manufacturer to the brink of
disaster, the company is making a strong comeback.
Unisys was created in 1986 when Michael Blumenthal, then chairman of
Burroughs, masterminded an audacious plan to form a giant computer company
by acquiring rival Sperry for Dollars 4.8bn, combining two of the oldest
companies in the computer industry under a new name.
At the time, Mr Blumenthal boasted that within a few years Unisys would
achieve annual revenues of Dollars 20bn and challenge International Business
Machines' dominant role in the computer industry.
Instead, Unisys became the first of the large US computer companies to
suffer the effects of a market shift away from proprietary mainframe
computers to networks of standard desktop machines.
Burdened with heavy debts from the Sperry acquisition and the high costs of
maintaining two incompatible product lines, Unisys plunged into heavy losses
in 1989. To make matters worse, the company's defence business became
embroiled in a Pentagon bribery scandal.
Over the three years 1989-1991, the company recorded total losses of almost
Dollars 2.5bn as it drastically restructured its operations, taking charges
totaling Dollars 1.6bn to cut its workforce and consolidate operations.
Analysts were predicting the company's demise.
Defying the prophets of doom, however, Unisys, under the leadership of James
Unruh, appointed to replace Mr Blumenthal as chairman and chief executive in
1990, has staged a recovery all the more remarkable because it comes as two
of the company's largest competitors, IBM and Digital Equipment, are
struggling to adjust to adverse market trends.
The turnround began at the end of 1991, when Unisys recorded a modest
fourth-quarter profit. The company has not looked back since. Over two
years, its profits doubled to Dollars 565.4m in 1993. Net debts had been
reduced from a peak of almost Dollars 4bn to Dollars 1.1bn at the end of
1993.
The return to profitability has not come without human costs. The workforce,
which numbered about 120,000 at the time of the merger, has been reduced to
49,000. Retirement benefits have been slashed and the company has closed
several plants. Unisys now appears, however, to be ahead of competitors in
streamlining its cost structure and rationalising capacity, say analysts.
'The turnaround is real. . . No management in the computer business has
executed better over the past two years,' said Curt Rohrman, of First
Boston, in a recent report on the company.
Revenues, however, are still declining. For 1993, the company reported sales
of Dollars 7.7bn, down 23 per cent from a 1990 peak of Dollars 10.1bn. Only
about 10 to 15 per cent of Unisys' sales are to new customers.
To offset declining sales, Unisys is focusing increasingly upon the services
side of the computer business, providing systems integration and consulting
services to its customers. Analysts expect the company's service and
consulting revenues to grow by 20 to 25 per cent over the next few years
from Dollars 1.6bn in 1993.
'We are not going to become a computerless computer company,' Mr Unruh says,
'but we are in the information management business, rather than the computer
business. Our services and systems integration revenues grew by 19 per cent
world wide last year.'
The company has targeted the airline, health care, insurance, banking and
phone companies as areas where it can offer specialised software and
services.
It plans to offer similar software to banks, car rental agencies, hotels and
insurance companies, enabling them to provide better service and to research
their customers' buying habits. The new software could generate sales for
Unisys of as much as Dollars 1bn over five years, industry analysts predict.
In a bid to boost flagging sales of mainframe computers, Unisys has moved
ahead of competitors in a transition to more cost-efficient semi-conductor
chips built using the same chip technology widely used in desktop computers.
Ironically, these chips will be manufactured, to Unisys' specifications, by
its long-time rival IBM.
Unlike traditional mainframes, Unisys new computer systems will not require
elaborate water cooling systems. This will make them better suited to
today's networked computer systems, in which computers are typically spread
throughout the offices of a company or organisation.
As confidence in Unisys' future rises, the company has won several prominent
orders. These include a Dollars 1bn contract for an Amazon-region
environmental surveillance system; a Dollars 127m contract to computerise
the largest savings bank in Russia; and other banking-automation contracts
in eastern Europe totaling Dollars 400m.
'We see 1994 as a year of visible progress in differentiating Unisys in the
market-place,' says Mr Unruh.
In Philadelphia, this raises the hope of new jobs. Unisys is one of the
largest employers in the region, despite the cutbacks of the past few years.
The company currently employs about 4,300 in and around the city, down from
5,600 at the end of 1990.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (4): Sale of
the century ends - Quentin Peel on the successes and failures of mass
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Karl-Heinz Rusberg looks like a cross between a frantic factory manager and
a slightly dotty professor, with a rumpled suit, laughing eyes, a shock of
white hair, and the passion of a true believer.
He is probably the most successful single salesman in East Germany's 'sale
of the century', the wholesale disposal of the entire assets of the former
communist state by the Treuhand privatisation agency.
It is a process which has aroused furious passions both in favour and
against it, and a truly extraordinary exercise which will leave the
achievements of the Treuhand the subject of agonised debate for years to
come.
On the one hand, the agency has presided over the restructuring of a
hopelessly uncompetitive communist economy, involving the break-up and
reorganisation of vast industrial empires and agricultural estates.
It has sold almost 13,500 separate companies in rather less than four years,
for net proceeds of around DM30bn. By the end of 1994, when it is formally
wound up, all but 100 will be in private hands. It will have successfully
raised some DM230bn in loans on the national and international capital
markets to finance the process, with another DM45bn needed to pay for its
remaining obligations.
On the other, the Treuhand has seen the numbers employed by its enterprises
slashed by hundreds of thousands, and the industrial structure of east
Germany transformed from the showpiece of the communist world to a rump of
struggling enterprises, whose future in the cold capitalist market is still
not assured.
Instead of realising a positive balance for the German exchequer from the
sale - once casually estimated by Mr Detlef Karsten Rohwedder, the first
Treuhand president, at 'around DM600bn' - it will leave a debt burden to the
federal government of at least DM275bn.
Mr Rusberg remains convinced that the exercise has been overwhelmingly
positive and successful, in spite of inevitable mistakes. He is a believer.
'You cannot succeed in this job unless you work as a man possessed,' he
says, as he rakes through his files for the prospectuses of the last few
companies still on his books. 'Perhaps there is a certain nostalgia now, as
our job is coming to an end. But we can be happy to have been involved in
this unique work.'
Then he reels off statistics of his successes and failures, of the
remarkable products which east German companies are still capable of
producing, the quality of the workforce, and some of the mistakes which have
been made along the way of seeking to transform a totalitarian socialist
economy into a capitalist one.
Mr Rusberg is regional manager for the Treuhand in Halle, an historic but
grimy centre of east Germany's chemical industry, and he is not there by
chance. It is the last regional office still in operation, and Mr Rusberg
has been sent to clean up a disastrous, incompetent and corrupt
privatisation process in the area.
Two of the main purchasers of Treuhand enterprises - one who bought 29
businesses. and the other who took over 10 - are sitting in jail awaiting
trial on various charges of falsification and fraud. The former
privatisation director has just been arrested in Texas (for speeding in a
Rolls Royce), and is now the subject of extradition proceedings.
As for the 800-odd enterprises and properties sold off in the area, the
entire lot has had to be reconsidered, and contracts renegotiated, to make
sure the investors are sound and the legal details correct.
It is a nightmare for all concerned - not least the workers in the
privatised companies, whose jobs are once more in doubt - but it was
probably an inevitable consequence of the sheer scale and speed of the
privatisation process.
'With the best will in the world, mistakes can be made,' says Mr Rusberg,
who came to the agency as an entrepreneur who had run a joint venture in
Romania for MAN-GHH.
'The performance of the Treuhand in such a short time was fantastic. I
simply would not have believed in 1990 that so much could be done in such a
short time.'
The detractors of the Treuhand charge that the agency has presided over the
de-industrialisation of east Germany, leaving the region condemned to remain
a backwater of the west. They say that far more should have been done to
restructure the enterprises before they were sold, rather than rush into
privatisation at all costs.
Mrs Birgit Breuel, the no-nonsense former Christian Democrat economics
minister from the state of Lower Saxony who has been president of the
Treuhand since the 1991 assassination of Mr Rohwedder, quietly but firmly
rejects such charges.
'It has not been de-industrialisation,' she says. 'It has been a return to
small (industrial) cores. I am convinced that is positive.
'Every part we have sold will be fully modernised (by the year 2000). They
will be lean - and striving for cost advantages. Then I believe we will have
extremely attractive investment locations here.
'Of course, if everything was in a green field, we might have done things
differently. But we were not beginning in a green field. We were dealing
with hundreds of thousands of people.'
To the charge that the Treuhand put jobs second in the rush for
privatisation, she says:
'We always say we are not just selling firms, we are also buying something
for them. We are buying management, we are buying technology, we are buying
capital, and probably most important, we are buying a market share.
'We had to take the legal framework, and try to give the enterprises a real
chance within it. We had to slim them down so they had a chance to be
competitive. Of course that was gruelling work, and it meant a loss of jobs.
But it was unavoidable.'
There was no structural concept when the Treuhand began work, not least
because there was no time to develop one.
'We were overwhelmed by the need to take decisions, immediately,' she said.
'With economic and monetary union (on July 1, 1990), most of the companies
were in desperate straits. We had no structure, and only 150 workers at the
start.
'When I arrived in September, I had no office, no assistant, and no concept:
just sacks full of letters.'
But nor did the Treuhand's leadership believe there should be a 'structural
concept', says Mr Wolf Schode, the agency spokesman.
'Our philosophy was to give every individual enterprise an individual chance
to survive and develop itself,' he said.
'It was a bottom-up strategy. Others wanted us to design a sectoral plan,
industry by industry. But if we had done that, we would have been no better
than a successor to the old east German planning commission.
'We are the last centralised institution of the old centralised DDR, and we
are deliberately destroying ourselves - because in the pluralist, federal
system of the new Germany, you don't need such a centralised structure.'

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (5): Small
engine for growth - Industrial workshop profile, JenLaser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JenLaser is one of those tiny Handwerk businesses, or industrial workshops,
which economists believe will slowly help to drive the the east German
economy towards recovery.
Already, more than 1m people are employed in eastern Germany's Handwerk
sector. It consists of 138,500 businesses which vary in size from four (the
number who work at JenLaser) to 200. Total turnover for this sector in the
eastern states increased last year by 15 per cent to DM72.4bn last year
compared with the previous year. The Central Association for Germany's
Crafts and Trades reckons it already accounts for 10 per cent of gross
domestic product.
JenLaser's small workshop is in the small village of Schloben situated in
the forests of Thuringia. It was the brainchild of Mr Dieter Schumann and
two former colleagues from the Carl Zeiss optics enterprise in Jena.
Mr Schumann, 42, had worked there as a physicist until 1991. But instead of
waiting with thousands of others for the inevitable redundancy pay-off, he
left willingly, because, he said, 'the longer I stayed, the more
opportunities I would miss'.
He and his colleagues, Mr Stephan Zenkar and Mr Volker Kurze, raised
DM50,000, the minimum required to set up a limited company. Mr Schumann,
unlike many other east Germans, had decided not to spend his savings on a
new car. His loyal old Wartburg station wagon is an integral part of the
business. 'It's our delivery car,' said Mr Schumann.
The three then approached the banks with their plan - 'we wanted to set up a
laser cutting business which would provide high quality cut steel to
enterprises,' explained Mr Schumann. 'We needed a loan of DM500,000 to buy
new equipment,' he said, taking out a photo of his large house which he had
offered as security.
His subsequent dealings with the banks were his foretaste of western
capitalism. An official at the local Dresdner bank in Jena told the trio
that the project was a waste of time. An official at the Bayerische
Vereinbank said they should invest in second hand machinery but that a loan
would take a few months. Finally, the Commerzbank offered the loan in 14
days. 'We were on our way,' said Mr Schumann.
They rented a couple of farm sheds from a west German who had bought part of
a former LPG, or state farm, and then set to work - 'we were working 12-14
hours a day throughout 1992 and paying ourselves about DM1,500 per month. It
was tough going. We had to find a niche.'
At first they considered tapping into the machine building industry in
Stuttgart - 'but we soon realised that after 40 years, these managers had
built up very close contacts with suppliers and their customers.'
Instead, they used old contacts built up with Carl Zeiss, combed the eastern
states of Thuringia and Saxony, and secured nearly 100 customers.
Then came the need for more capital and a fourth employee.
'We needed another credit line of about DM750,00. This time, the local
Sparkasse helped and, with cheaper interest rates backed by the European
Union's Regional Development Fund, they bought new laser cutting equipment
from a Japanese company. By the end of last year, JenLaser had a turnover of
DM1m, and had paid off nearly 75 per cent of the first loan.
This year, Mr Schumann reckons turnover will be between DM1.2m and DM1.4m.
'We are making a profit,' he said (without saying how much) adding that
JenLaser's two-pronged strategy of reasonably close markets and competitive
costs was paying off.
'Our markets are within 200 km radius - and all in eastern Germany. Our
advantage is that we have a fast turnaround - a matter of two days. We
deliver the products ourselves.' They had also managed to keep costs and
overheads down. 'Our prices are between 60 per cent and 80 per cent of west
German prices,' said Mr Schumann.
Now that the capital investments have been made, the company of four people
believes it has secured a niche in providing high quality laser cut steel
products. 'We are operating at nearly 100 per cent capacity,' said Mr
Schumann. 'The biggest challenge facing us is finding ways to keep costs
down.'

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of Greater Philadelphia (6): Low costs, ready
resources - Frank McGurty explains why the region is a magnet for
biotechnology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greater Philadelphia is to biotechnology what the San Francisco Bay area is
to computer science. With its rich stock of trained scientists, plentiful
sources of venture capital and a deep base of medical schools and research
laboratories, the area is a hothouse for budding life science companies.
Over the past decade, more than 100 start-up biotech companies have sprouted
and flourished in the region.
Cephalon, located in suburban West Chester, is typical. Set up in 1987 by a
research team from DuPont, the company is engaged in developing new drugs to
treat neuro-degenerative disorders. Initial capital came from local funds
set up to help young biotech businesses get on their feet.
'We really are in the centre of a diverse biotechnical community here,' says
Jason Rubin, vice-president of corporate communications.
Dozens of established enterprises - big and small, foreign and domestic -
have been lured to the region by the concentration of resources, the low
cost of doing business and the attractive lifestyle it offers.
Last year, Camus-Landanger, a tiny French medical devices supplier, set up
shop in Newtown Square, about five miles south-east of Philadelphia. It was
no coincidence that Boiron-Borneman, a leading French supplier of
homeopathic medicines, had decided to expand across town.
'The managerial pool is available. Taken together with the science, and the
venture capital, we have all the ingredients for entrepreneurship,' says
Peter Sears, head of SR One, an investment arm of SmithKline Beecham. His
company is the fifth largest venture capital fund serving Philadelphia. All
told, there is nearly Dollars 2bn available for financing local biotech
projects.
The enterprising heart of the industry lies just west of the city limits on
US Route 202, where some 30 small research companies have clustered along
'Medical Mile'. Dozens more are scattered around the area.
But a stalwart base of multinational pharmaceutical companies has powered
the industry's growth engine as well. Merck, DuPont, Wyeth Labs, McNeil,
SmithKline Beecham and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer all have strong presences in the
area.
With so much activity, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals are the fastest
growing sector of the regional economy. Their strength has helped offset a
painful contraction in a manufacturing base which has lost 66,000 jobs since
1988.
The story is not entirely positive. The wave of restructuring sweeping US
businesses has not spared the drug sector, which is bracing itself for lean
times after national healthcare reform is enacted later this year. In
Philadelphia, however, the two-tier structure of the industry has softened
the blow.
'In the pharmaceutical business, there has been a lot of down-sizing, and
some of these people are very good managers and researchers. Many of them
have been snapped up by the small companies,' says Mr Sears.
Indeed, the two sides enjoy a symbiotic relationship. The big companies
offer a rich pool of talent from which startups can draw. The small
biotechs, meanwhile, represent promising sources of new products for drug
giants willing to enter into joint ventures and marketing deals.
The area's five medical schools and a clutch of research institutes, such as
the Fox Chase Cancer Center, provide biotech companies with ready access to
clinical testing facilities.
Despite its wealth of resources, Philadelphia would be less fertile ground
for biotechs without some careful nurturing by groups such as The Ben
Franklin Partnership, a private, non-profit organisation funded by the state
and federal governments. 'The mission of our organisation is to build
economic competitiveness through technology and innovations,' says Philip
Singermann, head of the Ben Franklin Technology Center, which administers
the programme in the area.
One of the ways it does this is by helping fledgling companies stay on aloft
while they are in the early stages of developing viable commercial products.
Often the lead time is lengthy. Symphony Pharmaceuticals, located in
Malvern, Pennsylvania, needed five years to develop an innovative drug to
protect the brain after injuries. The partnership has provided Dollars
85,000 over two years to help the company over the hump.
The centre is also involved in assisting scientists to bring their research
from the laboratory to the marketplace. Together with British Technology
Group USA, a leading technology transfer organisation, it sponsors a
consortium of universities, research institutions and venture capital firms
known as the Start Technology Partnership.
Start's mission begins further upstream, by identifying a promising
technology before the university which invented it signs up with a corporate
sponsor. The idea is to add value to the innovation beforehand, through
further refinements or by seeking wider applications. That allows the
institution to realise a better return on its work.
'We try to push as much back to the technology source as possible, and build
off the resources of the member organisation,' says Andrew Neighbor, the
director. 'We are very much the hub of a big wheel.'

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of Greater Philadelphia (5): No anxiety over
competition from Paris - The city's stock exchange is the largest currency
options market in the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may be the oldest equities trading forum in the US, dating all the way
back to 1790, but the Philadelphia Stock Exchange today is better known for
its thriving currency options business than it is for the trading of stocks,
a business now thoroughly dominated in the US by the New York Stock Exchange
and the Nasdaq screen-based market.
That is not to say that the PHLX has abandoned equities trading. It
currently lists 2,200 stocks, and volume last year totalled 1.3bn shares,
averaging about 5m shares a day.
These totals, however, are dwarfed by the big exchanges. The NYSE traded
66.9bn shares last year, at an average of 264m a day. The PHLX's share of
all equities trading in the US hovers around 3 per cent, behind not just the
NYSE and the Nasdaq, but also the Pacific Stock Exchange in San Francisco
and the Midwest Stock Exchange in Chicago.
Philadelphia does have a bigger share of the equities options market, where
it comes in behind the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the American Stock
Exchange in New York. The PHLX is noted for its index options. Its next
product will be an option on a Big Cap index, a basket of 50
large-capitalisation US stocks, nicknamed the 'nifty fifty', which the PHLX
hopes will grab the attention of investors.
Yet, if you mention the exchange's name to anyone in the financial markets
in the US and overseas, they will almost always think first of currency
options. Having pioneered the product in the early 1980s, the PHLX is now
the largest exchange-traded currency options market in the world.
Last year, a record 13.1m currency option contracts were traded on the
exchange, keeping it well ahead of its main rival, the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. In 1992, the PHLX handled the world's largest single currency
options trade, which consisted of 180,800 French franc options with an
underlying value of Dollars 8.1bn.
The PHLX opened its currency options business in 1982 with a sterling option
contract. Since then, it has added options on the Deutsche Mark, the yen,
the French and Swiss francs, the Canadian and Australian dollars, and
European currency units (Ecus). It also trades options on three cross-rates:
D-Mark/yen, sterling/D-Mark, and sterling/yen.
The PHLX has become popular because it's products appear to fit the needs of
corporate risk managers who wish to hedge their foreign exchange risks,
because its market is liquid, and because the floor is open for most of the
day. In fact, the PHLX trades currency options for all but three and a half
hours of each working day.
Currency options contracts are most useful during periods of volatility on
the foreign exchange markets, and so the turmoil among European currencies
since 1992 has been a godsend for the PHLX. Companies and financial
institutions, seeking to hedge their currency risk in the increasingly
unpredictable forex markets, especially those facing exposure to the French
franc, have been using the PHLX's currency options contracts. Its business
from European customers has grown so much that last year the exchange moved
its annual September symposium from Philadelphia to Paris.
It is from Paris, however, that the PHLX faces a potential threat to its
dominance of the currency options market. Later this month, the Paris
futures market (Matif), will launch two dollar options contracts on the
French franc and the D-Mark. The Matif hopes the contracts will win
European, and particularly French, business back from Philadelphia. If the
first two contracts are popular, the Paris exchange will consider launching
20 others.
The PHLX, however, is untroubled by the prospect of another exchange trying
to break into one of its biggest markets. Nicholas Giordano, PHLX chairman,
says: 'No, we're not worried. We have been able to maintain a leadership
position because we understand this market very well. We refine our products
as they need refining. We respond to our customers. We provide liquidity,
and we continue to educate. And the customers appreciate that, so I see no
reason why anything will change.'
But surely when the Matif's currency options start trading, European
institutions will choose to use the exchange on their doorstep, rather than
one in the US? 'First of all, I'm not sure what it is that is going to be on
their doorstep,' replies Mr Giordano. 'There needs to be liquidity, there
needs to be service, and an understanding by the people providing the
service. Customers know they can get it here.'
He is not even worried that the time difference between Paris and
Philadelphia will give the Matif a big natural advantage. 'We're open in
their time zone, at 1.30am. And it gets very active here at 3.30am, which is
9.30am Paris time. We've done that to facilitate our customers in Europe,
and I think they appreciate that. I see no reason at all why (the business)
should shift. I don't know what added value is being brought to the table. I
haven't seen it.'
Industry experts agree that it will difficult for Paris to wrest business
away from Philadelphia, because the PHLX has such a head start over the
Matif in the currency options business.
Hal Hansen, president of Cargill Investor Services in Chicago, says: 'The
Philadelphia Stock Exchange has for years developed and created a viable
product and a very popular contract. I can understand why the Matif is
aiming to compete for that business, but experience shows that it's very
difficult to unseat an exchange, and take a product away, when it's been
very well established over time. There are loyalties, and confidence in
market mechanisms, and established levels of liquidity, that customers are
comfortable with, and have come to depend on. That is not to say that the
Matif can't develop the same product, but it won't be an easy task, and at
the very least it will take lot of time. Ultimately, of course, the customer
will decide, based on where they're getting the best pricing and the best
quality of liquidity.'
The Matif is not the only cloud in the PHLX's sky. As a small, successful,
exchange, the PHLX is regularly discussed as a candidate for a merger with
any one of its many rivals. This is based on the assumption that there are
too many options exchanges in the US, and that consolidation is required if
the industry is to prosper into the 20th century.
Since the late 1980s, the PHLX has received several merger offers, and
rejected them all, most recently in December when it turned down a proposed
Dollars 68m merger with the Chicago Board Options Exchange.
Mr Giordano believes the PHLX is better off independent, and many of the
exchange's members - who know that a merger would leave a large number of
them out of a job - agree. The PHLX chairman says: 'It has proven to be very
difficult to merge two exchanges. If you look around, you'll be hard-pressed
to find that two viable exchanges have ever merged.'
The latest offer from the CBOE was declined, says Mr Giordano, 'because the
membership wanted to stay independent, and they felt that price offered was
nowhere near value of the exchange. But I'm not sure there is a right
price.'
Ultimately, he believes that it is in the best interests of the industry's
customers that the US exchanges remain independent, because competition
between them has led to a better quality product and better service.

The transition from command economy to market economy in the east of Germany
has been especially pronounced in the banking sector. Before unification
there was no private sector banking industry at all - now the sector employs
tens of thousands of people and provides a level of service to the customer
which is more advanced than in the west.
'Before the wall came down customers came into their bank and got shouted at
by the employees,' recalls Mr Peter Krakow, chairman of the Leipzig
Sparkasse, the biggest savings bank in the new federal states.
'There was no discretion whatsoever - and everybody else in the queue could
listen in. People were profoundly suspicious of their banks, seeing them
quite rightly as agents of the state. All this has changed.'
As the bustling banking hall of the Leipzig Sparkasse shows, well turned-out
employees now speak in respectful tones rather than barking out orders to
terrified customers as if they were underlings. Those who do not want to
stand in the queue can make use of an array of self-service machines in a
separate room. Here, as elsewhere in the new federal states, the level of
technology on offer is more sophisticated than at bank branches in the
banking metropolis of Frankfurt.
According to the Bonn-based Federation of German Banks, there are now just
under 100 private sector banks in the eastern states, with nearly 1,300
branches as at the end of last year employing 21,000 people. On top of that
there are around 160 Sparkassen which employ 42,000 - twice as many people
as before the wall came down. Then there are the Landesbanken - public
sector commercial banks  - which serve the new states in a series of
complicated cross-shareholding and cooperation agreements with their western
counterparts.
This is a dramatic change from communist days when the banking sector was
divided between the Staatsbank - the state-owned bank which was part of the
machinery of the command economy - and the Sparkassen. While Deutsche Bank
and Dresdner Bank, the two biggest banks in the west, bought the old
Staatsbank network, all other credit institutes have had to build up their
branch networks from scratch.
By the end of 1993, private sector banks had invested DM4.5bn in buildings
and fixed assets alone, excluding further hundreds of millions spent on
intangibles such as training. The Federation of German Banks says that banks
plan to spend a further DM1.5-2bn expanding their branch networks over the
course of this year and next.
The commitment of the private sector banks to the east has not been without
problems. Unpopular in the west of Germany at the best of times, banks are
especially unpopular in the east where economic recovery is taking far
longer than politicians promised at the time of reunification. The
resentment is that much greater as a result of the banking sector's record
profitability last year and, more recently, the failure of big banks to
foresee the collapse of the Jurgen Schneider property empire which has put
several thousand jobs in Leipzig at risk.
Mr Eberhard Martini, chief executive of the Bavaria-based Hypo-Bank and
outgoing chairman of the Federation of German Banks, complained in March
that banks were portrayed as 'crisis-profiteers'. He denied that the banks
charged excessive fees in the east and, in an outspoken speech, he
criticised Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Mrs Birgit Breuel - chairman of the
Treuhand privatisation agency - as well as the press for the banks' poor
image in the east.
His outburst follows the long-running dispute over the scale and the form of
banks' commitment to the so-called Solidarity Pact. While banks have agreed
to commit hundreds of milliona to east German industry by means of direct
participation in German industry, Chancellor Kohl has complained that the
'bank billions' have not yet been forthcoming. As Martini said, the banks
will only invest on normal commercial criteria and in the east these
criteria are difficult to fulfil.
Therein lies the nub of banks' problems in the east: they are expected to
fulfil a social role in the rebuilding of the new federal states while being
obliged to shareholders to undertake only profitable business. Conditions in
both commercial and retail banking are difficult. As Mr Martin Kohlhaussen,
chief executive of Commerzbank, explained recently, 'the risk for commercial
customers is higher in the east . . . we simply don't have the credit
information and the company history which normally form the basis of a
lending decision.'
Not surprisingly, corporate customers complain about their treatment at the
hands of the arrogant 'wessis' or western Germans who still dominate the top
management positions in the east-based banks. A poll conducted recently by
the BDI Federal German industry association of 1,000 east German businesses
yielded a multitude of complaints about the banks, who were accused of being
too conservative.
On the retail side, banks complain that they must pay higher deposit rates
than in the west and invest more time and effort in providing advice to
customers. Part of this is due to the Sparkassen, which have adapted rapidly
and vigorously to capitalism with the help of partnership agreements with
institutions in the west, with the result that they have managed to keep a
market share of retail business higher than in the old federal states.
'The big western banks thought that they'd have it easy when they came
here,' chuckles Krakow at the Leipzig Sparkasse. 'Of course we have lost
customers and market share - but not on the scale that other banks were
expecting.'
The net result is that for many big commercial banks, the investment in the
east has been substantial but as yet unprofitable.
Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of the Deutsche Bank, said as the bank
announced record 1993 profits, the bank has invested DM4bn to date in the
east and has yet to make a pfennig of profit. Mindful of the long-term
opportunities, Mr Kopper said he was not complaining about this.
Difficulties aside, institutions are using the east as a testing ground for
new products and services.
The best example of this is the Hypo Service-Bank, a subsidiary of the
Hypo-Bank which offers just nine basic retail banking products compared with
the 60 products on offer at a normal bank branch.
As yet, this highly automised concept - designed to cut down on the costs of
basic banking services at the same time as increasing the speed and
efficiency of customer service - is only on offer in the east. It may be
that this model will be copied throughout the western federal states.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restucturing of Eastern Germany (2): A slow
climb from the abyss - The economy will need another five years of massive
investment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
In two crucial ways, 1993 was a turning point for the east German economy.
For the first time since German unification in October, 1990, and indeed
since economic and monetary union on July 1 that year, production rose
faster than overall demand in the former Communist territory. Up till then,
stagnating output was steadily outstripped by a growth in demand fuelled by
transfers from west Germany.
Secondly, and possibly more significant still, investment per capita in the
east for the first time exceeded the level in the west.
Both indicators suggest that at last, after a period of free fall, followed
by prolonged stagnation, the east German economy is just beginning the
process of catching up on the wealthy west.
The question is, can the process be sustained? And if it can, how long will
it take?
On the negative side, it is clear that east Germany is still far from
generating the profits it needs to finance its own indigenous investment
process: the so-called wage quota - the amount of national income devoted to
wages and salaries - is more than 100 per cent. That means no profits are
being generated, and all investment is in effect financed by transfers from
the west.
Those transfers held up remarkably well in 1993, but given the depth of the
western recession, investment plans for 1994/95 are in some doubt. And just
as east German industry is beginning to pick up, the recession is also
squeezing consumer spending in its most important market.
The divergence of the two German economies, east and west, was and is
enormous. The collapse of the east German economy happened within weeks of
monetary union. West German industry moved in rapidly to fill the vacuum.
And the fear is that the former Communist state's entire industrial base has
been wiped out in the process, leaving the so-called new federal states in
danger of becoming an industrial and economic backwater, an eastern
Mezzogiorno on the fringes of western Europe.
The recovery of the eastern economy is still in the balance, but for the
first time, positive signs of recovery are starting to multiply.
Mr Udo Ludwig, chief economist at the economic research institute in Halle -
the first eastern institute to be set up since unification  - sees the glass
as half full. 'We are in the middle of a recovery process borne by private
and public investment,' he says.
'They are installing modern productive capacity. It will amount to a real
recovery when for the first time eastern products can supply most of eastern
needs. And profits have to be big enough to provide for refinancing. The
process will take a generation.'
Mr Heiner Flassbeck, the chief economist at Berlin's economic research
institute (DIW), tends to see the glass as half empty. 'The catching up
process has started in 1993, but it will be very difficult for east Germany
to have a higher growth rate than west Germany over a prolonged period,' he
says. 'At the best, they can expect to grow at the same rate, which means
the chance of catching up is called into question.
'It is much easier to make profits in the west than in the east.'
The hard-headed managers at Deutsche Bank have a rule of thumb for the
survival prospects of new businesses: they call it the seven year rule.
'Our investigations show that only after seven years can one say an
enterprise is really established,' says Mr Udo Vorstius, a former manager in
the western industrial heartland of the Ruhr, now transferred to run
Deutsche Bank's operations in Halle, the east German equivalent.
'We are nowhere near that point here, especially as far as small businesses
are concerned. It is clear that overall something is moving, but the nervous
phase is far from over.'
The evidence of catching up comes in the latest report by three independent
economic research institutes* for the Economics Ministry, on the overall
process of adjustment in eastern Germany.
The index of manufacturing production slumped from a level of 100 in the
second half of 1990 (already well below the level in the first half) to a
low point of 61.8 by the second quarter of 1992. From the first quarter of
1991 to the same quarter of 1993, it stayed around the same level.
Since then it has steadily recovered: to 67.7 in the second quarter of 1993,
72.7 by the third quarter, and 77.8 by the end of the year.
In the same period, industrial orders have also picked up appreciably: by
the last quarter of 1993 to 91.8 per cent of the level in the second half of
1990. The orders are coming overwhelmingly from the domestic economy, with
much less buoyancy in export orders, where eastern enterprises were
overwhelmingly dependent on the east European and former Soviet markets.
On the downside, industrial production is still less than 40 per cent of its
former level before unification, so the recovery is coming from a very low
base. Unemployment stands officially at 1.26m, or 16.8 per cent of an
already much reduced workforce, without taking into account several hundred
thousand more on short-time working, job creation schemes and retraining.
The overall number of economically active people has dropped over the period
from nearly 10m to under 6m. The rest, many of them women, have simply left
the labour market in despair.
The process of German unification has virtually turned the east German
economy on its head. Not only has traditional industrial production
collapsed, but the structure of east German industry and employment has been
transformed as well. The process was one which many now believe was
inevitable, yet which still took most observers in government and industry,
as well as the professional economists, by surprise when it happened.
The initial collapse came immediately in the wake of monetary union: the
exchange rate of one Ostmark for one D-Mark on July 1 meant an effective
revaluation of more than 300 per cent for the currency relevant for the
economic area of the GDR. At the same time, the open border with west
Germany meant that eastern producers were faced with free competition from
cheaper, higher quality western products. And eastern consumers showed an
instant, and well-nigh blind preference for western products.
At the same time, there was an end to measures supporting trade with the
eastern bloc, in effect, a second revaluation shock. The net production
index dropped by 40 per cent before November, and a further 30 per cent up
to March, 1991: from then until 1993, it stagnated at about one third of its
pre-monetary union level.
The effect was compounded by a wage explosion. In 1989, the average monthly
salary of an employee in east Germany was just under DM1,200, or roughly one
third of western salaries. Already, in the first half of 1990, unions and
enterprises agreed on wage increases of around 17 per cent.
The first round of collective wage negotiations in 1991 saw increases in
negotiated wage contracts of around 60 per cent. The result was a dramatic
deterioration in east German unit wage costs in relation to the west: around
20 per cent higher than those in west Germany immediately after currency
union, they rose in 1991 to about 170 per cent of the western level, because
of the combined effects of the drop in production and the high wage
increases.
If the west German government and its eastern agent, the Treuhand
privatisation agency, had hoped to preserve and privatise much of the
supposedly efficient east German economy, the uncompetitiveness caused by
those soaring unit wage costs put paid to it.
A more total collapse was only prevented by truly massive transfers of cash
from the west, in the form of straight subsidies, instant infrastructure
spending programmes, and huge transfers of unemployment and social security
benefits. Total financial transfers rose from DM132.1bn in 1991 to around
DM170bn last year.
The upheaval in east Germany has caused startling changes in its industrial
structure in a very short time. The capital goods manufacturing sector has
shrunk from about half overall industrial production to no more than
two-fifths of the much lower output levels.
Mechanical engineering, which in 1990 provided 23.6 per cent of
manufacturing output, was down to barely 11 per cent by the end of 1992.
Electrical engineering was down from 15.7 to 12.1 per cent, and other
technologically leading sectors - such as precision and optical instruments,
and data processing equipment - all saw their importance reduced sharply.
In contrast, the growth sectors have been food and drinks (up from 12.6 to
18.1 per cent), anything to do with the construction industry, and services.
Printing was the one industrial sector which was not affected by the initial
collapse: the demand for information remained constant.
'The competitive structure of east German industry has still not
crystallised,' says Mr Ludwig. 'It used to be dominated by capital goods.
Now it is a manufacturing sector dominated by the food industry. That is not
the structure of a developed country. But nor is it the final point. There
is a lot of investment in vehicle manufacturing and electrical engineering.
There are small signs that our export industry will recover.'
There have also been huge changes in the structure of enterprise size: today
the dominant size of enterprise is between 100 and 500 employees, in stark
contrast to the huge kombinats which dominated communist industry.
The greatest area of largely unknown and unmeasured activity is among the
smallest enterprises, the indigenous small businesses with fewer than 20
employees. 'My guess is that they are already producing 15 to 20 per cent of
what is produced in the measured sectors of industry,' says Mr Ludwig.
Neither Mr Ludwig nor Mr Flassbeck believes that the future for east Germany
is as a service industry economy. 'There are no special services east
Germany can offer,' Mr Flassbeck says. 'Take banking, insurance and other
financial services: they all depend on someone earning money from industry.
'We don't have the tourist attractions of a Switzerland. Our future depends
on having a highly qualified labour force, and an outstanding
infrastructure.
'Recovery depends on how long we will continue to be able to afford to pump
in subsidies at the present rate. I think we need to keep up this high
investment activity for another five or six years, at least. But that means
a huge amount of money, which many in the west do not think they can
afford.'

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of Greater Philadelphia (2): Municipal superman
rescues budget - Patrick Harverson traces the impact of a mayor who is
admired throughout the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
He is riding high in the opinion polls, and is the subject of almost
universally positive coverage in the media. Everywhere he goes there are
warm greetings and words of encouragement. He is now so well-known
nationwide that he has been dubbed 'America's Mayor'.
Barring disaster, he will win re-election by a landslide next year. He has
even appeared in a Hollywood movie starring Oscar-winner Tom Hanks.
Meet Mr Edward Rendell, mayor of Philadelphia, probably the most popular
politician in the US today.
In his 27 months in office, Mr Rendell has earned a reputation as one of the
the most effective mayors in the US. During his term, Philadelphia's
finances, so desperate in 1992, have been restored to good health. The city
is now poised to announce its second consecutive budget surplus, and the
pace of local economic growth is finally beginning to pick up.
The flight of jobs from the city and region has not been stopped, but it is
slowing. Philadelphia's relations with the Pennsylvania state capital of
Harrisburg, and with its neighbours across the Delaware River in New Jersey
have improved greatly. And with the help of its pro-business mayor, the city
has won the support of a once-hostile local business community and the
respect of Wall Street, where Philadelphia's bonds may soon lose their
'junk' rating.
Perhaps as important as anything else, Mayor Rendell has restored
Philadelphians' faith in their local government. Mr Peter Hearn, partner at
the law firm of Pepper, Hamilton and Scheetz, and Mr Rendell's principal
opponent in the race for the Democratic nomination prior to the 1991 mayoral
election, says that the mayor is extremely popular because he has proved
that local government can work. 'This has been a wonderful demonstration of
good government being good politics.'
Admirers also claim that Mr Rendell's growing national stature - he enjoys a
close personal relationship with President Clinton - is helping the city. Mr
Bob Hall, publisher of the Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily
News, says: 'His popularity outside the region, and the demand for him as a
speaker to mayors' groups, or other political groups, or urban developers,
is such a plus for the city. I don't recall another mayor of Philadelphia
ever enjoying that national recognition.'
So who is this municipal superman?
A native New Yorker, the 48-year old Mr Rendell is a lawyer who has spent
all of his political life in Philadelphia. First elected to public office as
the city's district attorney in 1977, he ran for governor of Pennsylvania in
1986 and mayor of Philadelphia in 1987. Although he lost both campaigns, he
came back strongly to win the November 1991 mayoral election by a landslide
on a campaign of fiscal reform.
Although a registered Democrat, his appeal crossed traditional party lines.
Like many other so-called 'new Democrats', he is a conservative on fiscal
policy but a liberal on social policy. He believes that many city services
can be improved through privatisation, and that government has to be
pro-business if it is to attract and keep jobs in the cities.
Nationally, Mr Rendell may be lauded for engineering the city's financial
recovery, yet he is quick to praise his partners in government. In
particular, he relies heavily on his main political ally, Mr John Street,
the president of the city council. 'I do not deserve, by any means, the
lion's share of the credit,' says Mr Rendell. 'We've received wonderful
support from the city council, and from it's president John Street.'
The mayor's championing of Mr Street is not just political rhetoric. In
Philadelphia, the offices of mayor and city council president have
traditionally been occupied by politicians pursuing separate agendas and
serving different constituencies. For most of the time, it was a recipe for
political gridlock.
When Mr Rendell arrived in office, however, he found in Mr Street someone
equally determined to end decades of political and financial
irresponsibility. Some say that Mr Street has proved the more fiscally
conservative of the two. Since the first day of Mr Rendell's term, they have
worked in harmony to rebuild the city's finances, constructing a five-year
fiscal plan that has been greeted with universal praise.
Mr Fred Voigt, executive director of the Committee of 70, a local
non-partisan political watchdog, says the importance of the alliance between
the mayor and council president cannot be understated. 'Together,
recognising the fiscal plight, they took steps that were absolutely
necessary. They had to balance the budget, which meant hurting people,
saying no to people. Yet, that (first) budget was passed 17 to zero. This
last budget had only one vote negative. That's extraordinary.'
A welcome by-product of the close working relationship between Mr Rendell,
who is white, and Mr Street, who is black, is that it has helped the city
avoid much of the racially-inspired political acrimony that has dogged so
many US cities.
If all this sounds too good to be true, Mr Rendell does have his critics.
The cuts in municipal expenditure that have helped him balance the budget
since 1992 have come at a cost to some local services. Rubbish collection is
now said to be less reliable, aid to museums and libraries has been cut, and
the wait for non-emergency treatment in the public healthcare system has
lengthened.
He is also criticised for focusing too much on Philadelphia's finances and
not enough on its social problems, particularly in the deprived
neighbourhoods just outside the city centre where living conditions are as
bad as anywhere in urban America.
Mr Rendell counters that the longer-term problems could not have been
addressed until the immediate fiscal crisis was first resolved. He knows
that, having tackled Philadelphia's financial woes, he now needs to turn his
attention to the more serious issues facing the city - too few jobs, too
many poorly runs schools, and too much poverty, homelessness, and crime.
Yet, typical among the new breed of big-city mayor, Mr Rendell does not
believe urban blight can be addressed by throwing more federal, state or
city money at the problem. He sees economic growth and job creation,
nurtured by government incentives aimed at attracting the private sector
into the cities, as the long-term answer to urban social ills. He says: 'If
I could create 100,000 jobs paying the inflation-adjusted equivalent of
Dollars 22,000 a year, I could do more to reduce drug use and crime in the
city of Philadelphia than if I had a thousand new policeman.'

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of Greater Philadelphia (3): New authority spans the
river - Old rivalries will be buried when two ports merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By  FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Delaware River is the axis which defines the Philadelphia region. The
city and its neighbouring communities grew up around the wharves and
warehouses that have thrived along its banks since the days of William Penn.
At the same time, the Delaware is a natural barrier, splitting the region in
two. The states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey have traditionally viewed the
river as the demarcation line in a struggle over the spoils of the maritime
trade.
It is an age-old rivalry which is finally coming to an end. After decades of
political wrangling, a preliminary agreement to form a bi-state port
authority was reached last December. The agency, which will co-ordinate the
activities of publicly owned marine facilities on both sides of the river,
is expected to hold its first board meeting in May. It is the first step in
an merger process which will take two years to complete.
Proponents of unification believe the move will hone the region's
competitive edge as a shipping centre. 'The ports will put less effort into
competing with one another and more into competing with other North Atlantic
ports,' says Joseph Menta, a spokesman for the Philadelphia Regional Port
Authority (PRPA), which owns piers and freight terminals on the Pennsylvania
side.
'The entire port community supports the move,' says Mr Tom Kelly, head of
the powerful Philadelphia Marine Trade Association, which represents about
40 private steamship and stevedore companies along the river. 'It is
something that had to happen if we were to remain competitive.'
The ports of the Delaware Valley already rank among the busiest along the
eastern seaboard. Taken together, their facilities handle some 70m metric
tons of international cargo a year, more than any other port on the east
coast, including New York, Baltimore and Norfolk.
More winter fruit passes through Philadelphia and Camden than any other port
in the US, and they lead the eastern seaboard in imports of meat, paper
products and steel. Last year, when ports around the country were
experiencing a slowdown, Philadelphia and Camden managed to increase
tonnage.
Still, the two sides have expended too much effort in fighting over the same
cargo, port officials say. By underbidding one another, the rivalry
effectively forced the states to take up more of the tab, in the form of
higher port operating subsidies.
Under a plan approved in December, the PRPA will combine its resources with
those of its counterparts across the river, the South Jersey Port
Corporation. The merged entity, known as the Ports of Philadelphia and
Camden, will become a subisidiary of yet another agency, the Delaware River
Port Authority (DRPA), which operates a regional mass-transit system and
four suspension bridges over the river.
The DRPA is already involved in promoting the regional ports through a
network of international offices organised under its world trade division.
But its role as trade ambassador created some confusion among overseas
shippers. At some point in negotiating a contract, the agency had to defer
to the relevant state authority, which would complete the deal.
The fresh approach is intended to bring more coherence to the task, says the
Rev Nicholas Rashford, president of St Joseph's University in Philadelphia
and chairman of the DRPA. 'What is going to change is that the people on the
operating level will be doing the marketing,' he says, 'I think that will
make us much more effective.'
Even critics of the merger agree that the ports, with the DRPA's assistance,
have done a good job of selling themselves, but some question whether the
unified agency will do any better.
Leo Donovan, a consultant with Booz, Allen and Hamilton, recommended against
the merger after conducting an early study on unification. 'Both ports are
thriving by competing in their own markets,' he argues.
Philadelphia moves large volumes of Chilean fruit, Australian meat, Finnish
paper and steel through its terminals. Camden, which lacks facilities to
handle containerised cargoes, is strong in lumber, scrap metal and other
bulk industrial commodities.
The merger, Mr Donovan says, would not necessarily make the ports more
competitive against other regions and would not create the economies of
scale necessary to make their operations more efficient.
'The danger is that it would lead to a monopoly which would encourage
'feather-bedding' and patronage' in the staffing of the bi-state agency,
says Mr Donovan. Competition between the two had kept workforce levels and
labour costs in check, he says.
Mr Rashford says Mr Donovan's criticisms do not take into account the
principal benefit of unification - enabling the ports to consolidate their
capital investment programmes.
Paul Drayton, executive director of DRPA, said the agency would make
available Dollars 300m over the next three to five years for port investment
and other economic development projects. The money will come from the huge
cash surplus which the DRPA generates by collecting bridge tolls.
The agency has already made a big port-related investment with the
construction of Amerport, an 'intermodal' rail transfer facility opened on
the Philadelphia waterfront two years ago.
Amerport gives shippers of intermodal containers - suitable for transport by
rail, truck or ship - immediate access to three full-service railways
linking the port with most of the US and Canada. The only terminal on the
east coast offering such extensive rail connections, it has proved so
successful that an expansion is already being considered.
'The idea is to have one agency looking at the big picture, not two looking
after their own narrow interests,' says Mr Drayton. Instead of duplicating
projects, the unified port authority would have the power to develop the two
sides in a complementary fashion, he says.
But the DRPA has already raised controversy in its development efforts. Some
Dollars 50m in financing was approved in the waning days of last year, with
most of the money earmarked for projects unrelated to the port, such as a
Philadelphia skating rink and improvements to an aquarium in Camden.
Mr Drayton declines to comment on last year's spending decisions, which were
made before his appointment. But he says the DRPA would make funds available
for both types of development, although it was not holding out 'an open
checkbook'.
'Infrastructural investment has to made in the port,' he says, but these are
not the kind of investments in which you are going to see a direct return.'
Where the private investors were unwilling to step in, the DRPA would
consider the broad economic impact of its spending decisions, he says.
But one of the tasks facing the new authority, in its role as regional
development co-ordinator, is determining which of its activities, if any,
should be turned over to the private sector.
'For the region to prosper, it isn't important which operator gets the
cargo, as long as someone in the area gets the cargo,' says Joesph Diemer, a
spokesman for the DRPA.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring of Eastern Germany (1): Positive
signs - but still a long way to go / There are indications that eastern
Germany is slowly emerging from an economic trough, but for the 16m people
of the region the initial euphoria of unification has given way to
disorientation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
As German unification approaches its fourth anniversary, the scope of the
changes undergone by the people of the former German Democratic Republic is
becoming increasingly apparent.
There are the changes apparent to west Germans and to visitors as well as
less noticeable but more deep-seated social effects. The infrastructure is
improving before one's eyes, and western-style retailing and services -
department stores, pharmacies, petrol stations and bakeries - have spread
across the land.
No less dramatic but less obvious is the social impact on the 16m people,
former citizens of the German Democratic Republic, who now find themselves
attached to the most prosperous democracy in Europe. Because of the
swiftness of the changes - ranging from the switch to the Deutsche Mark and
privatisation to the arrival of large scale unemployment - east Germans have
had little time to adjust and few opportunities to influence the changes.
The initial euphoria of unification has given way to disorientation.
The independent citizens' committees, which grew up in East Germany during
and in the wake of the peaceful revolution of autumn 1989, had hoped for
greater consultation, particularly over the constitutional way in which the
unification would take place.
There were two options. There was Article 146 of the west German Basic Law
which provided that, in the case of unification, a new constitution would be
framed and submitted to a popular vote. There was also Article 23, under
which the former German Democratic Republic would simply be slotted into the
existing constitution of the west German Federal Republic.
The federal government chose to implement Article 23 rather than the more
cumbersome Article 146. That meant imposing on eastern Germany the west
German status quo, and the entire complex of Bonn's laws and regulations,
institutions and procedures.
In taking this path, opportunities were missed by both sections of Germany.
In western Germany, a debate, begun in the mid-1980s, on the need for more
de-regulation and liberalisation of the economy, was interrupted. East
Germans, already familiar with an all-present bureaucracy, had a feeling of
being 'colonised' by the westerners. This perpetuated their sense of
exclusion from political decision-making and delayed the establishment of a
civil society.
This sense of exclusion, coupled with the start of one of the most radical
privatisation programmes undertaken anywhere, traumatised east German
society in two dramatic ways: the birth rate nose-dived and people turned in
on themselves.
According to Nicholas Eberstadt, a US demographer, 'eastern Germany's adults
have come as close to a temporary suspension of child-bearing as any large
population in the human experience.' In 1992, for example, the birth rate
had fallen by 55 per cent compared with 1989 when the Berlin Wall was
breached. Over the same period, the marriage rate had fallen by 62 per cent.
And compared with west Germany, the likelihood of an east German man aged
between 30 and 44 of dying from injuries or suicide is 150 per cent higher
than his western German counterpart.
These trends can be explained by the sudden prospect of women having no
status in a country where 90 per cent of them had a job before unification;
and equally the prospect of a man having no perspective for the future. East
Germany's unemployed, including people on government job creation,
retraining and early retirement schemes, represent 37 per cent of the
working population.
These trends in turn have delayed the emergence of local political and
social elites. Professor Jurgen Kocka, who teaches modern history at
Berlin's Free University, says church membership is falling and east
Germans, unlike westerners, are not joining associations or political
parties. 'They have completely withdrawn into themselves. Even the
intellectual elite is not as active as it should be. There is a vacuum. I do
not know how it is going to be filled.'
Western Germany shares some responsibility for this vacuum. Energetic
officials, whose promotion prospects had slowed down or had been blocked in
the west, seized the opportunity of moving eastwards to help transfer new
political structures to the region. At the same time, thousands of east
German academics and teachers, managers and scientists, had been sacked
because of their alleged links with the Stasi, or former east German secret
police, or because jobs no longer existed. This created an immediate vacuum
on the local level. The younger generation has not yet filled that vacuum,
partly because the Stasi files remain open, making many people feel suspect;
and partly because adapting to the economic upheaval is time consuming.
In spite of these traumatic effects of unification, the government has been
able to maintain stability in eastern Germany largely through the massive
transfers, which last year totalled DM170bn. Over a third is spent on
subsidising consumption in eastern Germany, whose collapsed economy last
year contributed no more than 9 per cent of the combined country's total
Gross Domestic Product.
Yet there are signs that east Germans are slowly reconciling themselves to
the new system. The initial spending spree of 1990 and 1991 has given way to
habits reminiscent of west German society of the 1960s and the early 1970s.
In 1990, after monetary union, the level of east German households'
financial assets was DM20,000 per household. After the consumer spending
spree, private disposable per capita income in eastern Germany rose by 55.5
per cent between the second half of 1990 and the first half of 1993. In real
terms, this represented an increase of 17 per cent. Boosted by west German
transfers, the average income over the same period has reached 55 per cent
of west German levels.
At the same time, the propensity for east German households to save is
similar to that of west Germans. According to the Bundesbank, savings last
year took 13 per cent of their disposable income, compared with 14 per cent
in western Germany, and the financial assets in eastern Germany totalled
DM190bn, or DM30,000 per household. This represents the average amount
reached by west German households in the first half of ther 1970s.
These developments suggest that east Germans, particularly those in work,
are protecting themselves against future unemployment; adapting to the
market, and west German habits; and are comparatively well off, taking into
account the transfers which underpin these assets, and the conditions of
former communist countries. These factors reinforce stability.
But the real test facing the east Germans is at what point their economy
will start producing goods which can be competitive on the west German and
international market.
Much will depend on the level of west German and foreign investment. For the
first time since unification, investment per capita in the east exceeded the
level in the west. Economists argue that these investment levels will have
to be maintained for at least another five years to modernise the
infrastructure and create a highly qualified labour force. They add that the
more investments are targeted on the highest levels of technology, the
greater the chance of higher output and productivity.
The other positive trend is that production has finally risen faster than
overall demand after stagnating output had been steadily outstripped by a
growth in demand fuelled by transfers from the west since 1990. Industrial
orders also show signs of picking up. But industrial production is still
less than 40 per cent of its former level before unification. Recovery is
coming from a very low base.
Any sustained recovery, and a growth in competitiveness, will also depend on
much higher levels of productivity. Productivity levels are on average
between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of western levels, while wages are about
80 per cent of those in western Germany, and are set to match western German
levels by 1996. This means that labour unit costs in the east are 70 per
cent higher than in western Germany.
To reach west German productivity levels, the government might have to
tolerate even higher unemployment levels, (or even indirectly subsidise the
newly privatised sector through more tax breaks) while continuing to
maintain the current levels of transfers to support consumption and the
unemployed.
Over time, some of the unemployed might be absorbed by the Handwerk, or
small crafts sector, the one area where east Germans are becoming
economically engaged. Last year, more than 1m people were employed in
138,500 of these businesses, 20 per cent more than the previous year.
But none of these trends indicate that eastern Germany is moving anywhere
close to becoming a self-sustaining economy. What they do suggest is that
the region is slowly coming out of the trough of the last three years; and
that the small emerging entrepreneurial class may in time help foster a new
political class in eastern Germany. Then, east Germans might be in a
position to contribute to the long overdue political and economic debate in
their country. But they will not be in a position to live without transfers
for many years to come.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of Greater Philadelphia (1): Rescued from the brink
of disaster - The municipal budget has been restored to health, writes
Patrick Harverson. Now the city hopes that the continuing loss of jobs can
be halted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'Philadelphia', a Hollywood movie about a lawyer with Aids who sues his firm
for unfair dismissal, was released last year to rave reviews. Tom Hanks won
the best-actor Oscar for his performance as the lawyer.
The film was made almost entirely on location in Philadelphia, and the city
has a story to tell of its own. Philadelphia's story has earned rave
reviews, too, and its leading man, Mayor Edward Rendell, would win an Oscar
for best mayor if awards were given for municipal governance.
The Philadelphia story is about a city that comes back from the brink of
disaster to emerge as a bright spot on the sometimes bleak landscape of
urban America. Three years ago, the city faced financial ruin. Today, it has
recovered to a point where the city will soon report a budget surplus for
the second consecutive year. Jobs growth in the metropolitan region is
picking up after a prolonged slump, and a huge new convention centre is
attracting thousands of visitors to the downtown area. Philadelphians,
notoriously difficult to please, are now proud of their city.
The contrast between the current bright outlook, and the dark days of the
early 1990s, could not be greater. At the start of the decade, years of
falling local payrolls, a shrinking tax base, declining federal assistance,
local political gridlock, an ever more costly city bureaucracy, and swelling
social problems had reduced Philadelphia's finances, and its self-esteem, to
tatters.
By early 1992, the situation had deteriorated so far that the city faced a
deficit of Dollars 230m, out of a budget of Dollars 2.4bn. Philadelphia
could not meet its bills, and the rating on its bonds had been reduced to
the level of junk by Wall Street.
In January 1992, Mr Rendell, Philadelphia's newly elected democratic mayor,
understood that the situation was desperate. 'In USA Today (a national
newspaper) on the day I was inaugurated, there was a little blurb on the
front page that said I would inherit the worst municipal financial horror
story in America. When I read that, I almost told the fellow who was driving
me to the inauguration to take me down to Atlantic City so I could blow off
the day and play the blackjack tables.'
Mr Rendell resisted the temptation, not least because he had campaign
pledges to keep. He won the mayoral election after promising to do what
previous administrations had never done: cut spending to balance the budget,
reform municipal government, and do everything possible to promote economic
development in the region.
At the heart of the city's immediate problems in 1992 was the escalating
cost of local government. With the crucial support of John Street, the
powerful president of the city council, and after facing down a brief
municipal workers strike, the new mayor eventually won a series of
money-saving concessions from city unions. They included a two-year pay
freeze; a reduction in paid public holidays; big changes in work rules and
practices; agreement on the privatisation of some city services; and cuts in
union health plans.
The concessions cut almost Dollars 100m from the city's annual budget. Along
with Dollars 84m in savings achieved from management streamlining, Mr
Rendell was on his way to balancing the budget. As he now proudly recalls:
'By June 30, 1993, 18 months after we started, we had a Dollars 3m surplus.
And we did it without raising one nickel of taxes.'
Solving the budget crisis was important not just in purely financial terms.
After years of mismanagement, the image of a competent municipal government
at City Hall helped repair Philadelphia's tarnished image, in the eyes of
locals and those from outside.
After balancing the budget, the Rendell administration wasted little time in
building on its success. The savings from the union concessions were part of
a five-year fiscal plan intended to ensure the city's finances were
stabilised over the long term. The plan was praised on Wall Street, which
has since raised the city's bond ratings to just below the level of junk,
and won the approval of the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Co-operation
Authority, the state agency which - in return for budgetary oversight - has
helped raise funds for the city during its crisis.
That the five-year plan is still on course has a lot to do with the revival
in the fortunes of the local economy. After lagging slightly behind the rest
of the nation, employment in the metropolitan region is now rising for the
first time in three years.
Local economists hope that jobs growth will prove sustainable. The greatest
strength of the Philadelphia region's economy is its diversity. Once
dominated by heavy manufacturing, the metropolitan area is now home to a
broad spectrum of businesses, including a particularly heavy concentration
of healthcare, pharmaceutical and bio-technology companies. Industries also
represented in the region include oil and chemicals (Sun Corporation, Rohm &amp;
Haas), telecommunications (Bell Atlantic), computer technology (Unisys),
food manufacturing (Campbell Soup, in nearby Camden, New Jersey) and finance
(Cigna, CoreStates).
While many of these are located outside the city centre, downtown
Philadelphia is enjoying its own renaissance. The new Dollars 523m
convention centre is providing a boost to local businesses. Tourism is on
the rise, and Dollars 280m will soon be spent on developing an 'Avenue of
the Arts' in the heart of the city. Also, there are hopes that by late 1995,
riverboat gambling will arrive on the Delaware River.
Yet the Philadelphia story has its dark side. The city has its fair share of
urban ills - high rates of poverty, unemployment, crime, homelessness and
drug abuse, and poor quality public education. The scars of neglect in many
of its neighbourhoods are as bad as any in urban America.
Mayor Rendell, often criticised for paying too little attention to the
problems of deprived areas, knows the hardest task is ahead. In the past, he
has likened the problem to a man suffering from cancer and a gunshot wound.
As Stephen Mullin, the city's director of commerce, explains: 'The first
thing you have to do is deal with the gunshot wound. And we've done that.
We've basically righted ourselves. We're not Beverly Hills, or some fat-cat
city, but we have gained significant control over our costs. Now, the
question is: what's the story with the economic base of the city?'
The story with the economic base of the city - as opposed to the suburbs,
where business generally flourishes - is that jobs are still being lost at
too rapid a rate. Philadelphia's employment base has suffered the loss of
263,000 jobs since 1970, 110,000 in the last seven years alone. That is too
many jobs gone in a city with a total population of only 1.6m (out of 5.7m
who live in the entire metropolitan region).
Next year, Philadelphia will lose about 7,000 more jobs when the Pentagon
closes the naval yard. As Mr Rendell says: 'We need to generate the type of
economic development that will employ local people. If we don't do that,
with all the successes that we have achieved in Philadelphia, we're not
going to make it.'
Today, Mr Rendell hopes that a combination of local and national efforts
will break the 25-year trend of declining employment. On the local level,
the administration has launched an economic stimulus programme which will
spend Dollars 1.5bn over the next three years to generate economic
development. At some stage, that programme must include lowering the city's
wage tax, which is so unpopular with local businesses. On a national level,
Mayor Rendell hopes that the federal government will adopt a new urban
agenda that provides not financial aid, but a range of incentives to lure
private sector businesses back into the cities.
For all of its triumphs so far, building a lasting revival in the city's
economy is the Rendell administration's toughest challenge yet. As Mr Peter
Hearn, a former political opponent of the mayor and a leading Philadelphia
lawyer, puts it: 'The mayor has hit a grand-slam home run in each of his
first two years. But to really have an impact on Philadelphia in the
long-term, he has to do that every year.'

FT  04 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: SmithKline deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRIS PRICE, and PETER JOHN.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group SmithKline Beecham jumped 6.5 per cent in a falling
market as early US support was fuelled by news that the company was making a
Dollars 2.3m (Pounds 1.57m) acquisition in the US. The shares were easily
the best performers in the FT-SE 100 and led the pharmaceutical sector
higher. The 'A's gained 25 1/2 to 415p on turnover of 7m and the Units,
which tend to reflect US interest, leapt 28 to 384p with 10m traded.
The purchase of Diversified Pharmaceutical Services (DPS) is expected to
enable the company to compete more effectively with Merck of the US, which
has recently bought MedCo.
SmithKline said the acquisition would result in earnings dilution of around
3 per cent this year and be earnings enhancing after that. It is funding the
purchase by the issue of commercial paper and existing cash reserves and
analysts were enthusiastic. Mr Paul Krikler of Goldman Sachs, the US house
which is advising DPS's former owner said it represented 'nothing less than
a breathtaking example of a bold and creative management' and Mr Paul
Woodhouse at Smith New Court 'It is a good move. DPS is the pick of the
bunch.'
The move enlivened a sector desperately in need of some focus after months
of depressing news. And it followed a slight shift of focus on Friday and a
Dollars 5.3bn agreed bid on Monday. The bid by Roche of Switzerland for
Syntex of the US was considered expensive but whetted the market's appetite
for further moves. Perennial speculative targets Fisons and London
International group rose a penny to 155p and 8 to 112p respectively. Heavily
sold Wellcome bounced 23 to 547p and hard hit Glaxo recovered 11 1/2 to
588p.
The oil majors were hit by a flurry of US selling as many transatlantic
investors locked in profits ahead of first quarter results from both BP and
Shell.
Shell, now the UK's biggest company measured by market capitalisation, slid
10 to 713p after turnover of 4.7m shares. BP, scheduled to announce results
tomorrow, and whose shares hit an all-time closing high of 399p last week,
fell 4 to 382p on turnover of 7.4m.
The Lasmo takeover saga rumbled on with oil sector specialists noting the
market's continuing dissatisfaction with Enterprise's all-paper bid and with
Enterprise's strategy. 'Although it's early days in the bid timetable, there
is definitely a feeling that Enterprise may already have blown its chances,'
said one analyst. A counter offer is still expected by many oil sector
observers. Lasmo slipped 1 1/2 to 148p on turnover of 7.2m shares and the
nil-paids  1/2 to 44p on 4.6m traded. Enterprise fell 6 to 410p.
Credit Lyonnais Laing was said to have been the driving force behind the
weakness in Abbey National, which fell 9 to 427p.
Hong Kong-sensitive banks received a rough ride following a steep overnight
fall in Hong Kong stocks. HSBC plunged 27 to 679p. Standard Chartered
settled 36 off at 959p.
Water and electricity sectors came under renewed fire as dealers took fright
at the latest big slide in gilts and on the prospects of a local election
hammering for the Tories in tomorrow's elections.
A series of presentations in the City were said to have lifted Upton and
Southern, the ambitious regional retailer, 2 to 32p.
Stores analysts were speculating over the scale of write-offs set to be
announced by WH Smith and Boots for their Do It All home improvement
subsidiary, expected shortly. The interest was sparked by weekend press
comment, but reports in some newspapers of an Pounds 80m provision found
little support. The consensus is that the two groups will make provisions of
nearer Pounds 55m and announce the closure of around 50 of the 220 Do It All
sites.
Around half those earmarked for closure are thought to have been sold to
other retail groups, including Asda, Dixons for its PC World stores, and
furniture and bedding company Staples. Boots shares advanced on the back of
the day's pharmaceutical activity, the shares closing 5 1/2 forward at 553p.
Smith slipped 2 to 496p.
Dixons slid 7 to 200p following the company's decision to treat its interest
in Fretter of the US as a fixed asset investment. There were also said to be
negative comments from Hoare Govett and Morgan Stanley. Asda shares were
down  1/4 at 55 1/4 p.

<TEXT>
News and financial information group Reuters Holdings was the most
significant casualty in the basket of leading UK stocks as a large trade
added to pressure on the shares following weekend press comment.
Dealers said the shares were restrained in early dealing in reaction to
negative comment in the Sunday press. Then, in mid morning, securities house
James Capel found a buyer and a seller for 2.3m shares and crossed the block
at 513p. Also, the SEAQ trading screen showed a block of 4m shares traded at
515p on the official close.
News that Liffe and the DTB, the UK and German futures exchanges were in
final negotiations over Globex, Reuters derivatives product, came too late
to prevent the shares falling 24 1/2 to 507p on exceptionally heavy turnover
of 13m.

FT  04 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Gas falls on broker meetings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRIS PRICE, and PETER JOHN.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A series of broker-hosted meetings between Ms Clare Spottiswood,
director-general of Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, and many of the
Scottish institutions saw British Gas shares the most heavily traded of the
FT-SE 100 constituents.
Gas shares, one of the FT-SE 100's worst performers last week after the
group issued a profits warning at its annual meeting, fell 4 1/2 , or 1.5
per cent, to 281 1/2 p yesterday compared with a 0.8 per cent decline in the
Footsie. Turnover in Gas reached 13m shares.
Dealers said the stock had attracted hefty selling by US institutions late
last week but that much of that had been countered by keen support from
UK-based income funds.
There was also increasing nervousness among dealers ahead of the politically
sensitive joint Department of Industry/Ofgas report on the structure of Gas,
expected next Monday. A second report, prepared by Ofgas, dealing
specifically with stock market sensitive areas such as rate of return and
pricing formulae, is expected at the end of this month.

FT  04 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bonds weakness drives Footsie down to
3,100 - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weakness in sterling and in UK government bonds left the FT-SE 100 Index
down 25 points yesterday, and struggling to hold on to the 3,100 support
level. Trading volume was not heavy but the announcement that Britain's MO
money supply jumped by an annualised 6.2 per cent in April emphasised the
market's growing fear that the next move in domestic interest rates could be
up, rather than down. Losses in long-dated gilts were extended to nearly two
points in late trading, and the investment mood turned significantly
bearish.
The bears justified yesterday's downturn by pointing to the UK local
elections to be held tomorrow, at which Mr John Major's government is widely
expected to suffer a setback. As always, political nervousness was more
marked in the foreign exchange markets than in domestic equities.
These factors combined to set an unhappy background to this morning's
routine meeting between the chancellor of the exchequer and the Governor of
the Bank of England. The surge in money supply is likely to increase the
Bank's caution towards any suggestion of cutting UK interest rates at
present.
Early deals brought a rash of gains in share prices as London hoped that the
closure of Japanese markets for the Golden Week might lift the pressure from
the US dollar. But initial firmness in stock index futures quickly
disappeared when the money supply figures were announced, and from then on,
the equity market unravelled steadily, with the stock index futures at a
discount for much of the session.
London tried to rally when Wall Street opened but, with the Dow Industrial
Average uncertain and down 2.37 in UK hours, there was little to help the
Footsie resist renewed losses in gilts.
The FT-SE Index was 25.3 down at 3,100 exactly, having rallied from 3,095.8
at the day's low. The Footsie has been jousting with the 3,100 support level
since the middle of March and traders sounded unconvinced last night that
this important benchmark level would be held if bond markets continued to
slip.
The wider market, less closely linked to the futures contract, performed
somewhat better than the blue chip sectors and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell
only 5.8 to 3,775.3.
The market setback was all the greater in that the pharmaceutical shares,
which are heavily weighted in index terms, were in good form following news
of nearly Dollars 8bn in acquisition deals in the US by multinational
companies. SmithKline Beecham jumped sharply after paying Dollars 2.3bn for
Diversified Pharmaceutical Services of the US, hard on the heels of the
Pounds 5.3bn purchase of Syntex by Roche.
The renewed focus on company takeovers kept the spotlight on Lasmo, although
the shares continued to weaken behind its predator, Enterprise Oil, which is
bidding in paper;there was little immediate reaction to a formal offer
document from Enterprise.
Trading volume increased as share prices gave ground, but the final total of
559.4m shares traded through the Seaq network was still below Friday's
figure. Several trading programmes were identified.
Traders drew little comfort from the moderate turnover, however, and the
market closed on a distinctly unhappy note, with the domestic scene clouded
over by prospects for sterling and the international scene by those for the
US dollar/yen rate.

FT  04 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weakness in sterling and gilts, higher than anticipated money supply figures
together with political uncertainty in the UK combined to cast a shadow over
the derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, traders initially attributed the poor opening in the June
contract on the FT-SE at 3,129 to a 'correction' after Friday's strong
finish. Light buying in the first hour saw the contract touch 3,140 but this
faded after the release of the money supply data. The figures were higher
than anticipated, increasing doubts about a further reduction in UK interest
rates.
The decline of sterling and the retreat in bonds increased the selling
pressure, as did nervousness about the outcome of tomorrow's local elections
in the UK. It left June to trade at a substantial discount to cash for a
large part of the session. Monument Securities and Goldman Sachs were said
to have been among the day's main sellers.
June closed at 3,091, down 43 on its previous close. Volume was 12,878. The
June mid 250 contract finished at 3,760 after trade of 101 lots.
Traded options were particularly dull with a mere 21,119 lots dealt by the
close. Volume in the FT-SE 100 option was 6,818 contracts and 1,547 in the
Euro FT-SE 100 option. HSBC was the most active stock option with a total of
2,163 lots dealt.

FT  04 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexican losses reversed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico
Stock prices reversed earlier losses to end firmer on a wave of technical
buying, analysts said.
The key IPC index of 36 top shares gained 8.5 points, a rise of 0.38 pe
rcent, to close at 2,239.23 after falling as low as 2,193.92 earlier in the
session.
Interest rates on benchmark 28-day treasury bills or Cetes were raised by 24
basis points to 16.49 per cent.
A flood of buy orders, the bulk of them for Telmex, came in shortly before
the closing bell. Some 36m shares of Telmex traded out of total turnover of
86.91m.
Telmex L shares, which may be held by foreigners, ended up 0.64 per cent
while the A shares ended unchanged.
Despite the positive finish, declining shares topped advancing shares 32 to
25.
Advancing issues were led by Bufete CPO series, rising 11.11 per cent, Dina,
up 5.88 per cent, Nadro L series, gaining 3.5 per cent, and Cemex CPO
shares, also up 3.5 per cent.
Venezuela
Shares on the Caracas stock exchange climbed strongly after the central bank
said that it was to hold an auction of dollars in an attempt to ease
pressure on the bolivar.
The Merinvest composite index rose 6.8 per cent to 112.39, recovering all of
Monday's losses. Electricidad de Caracas put on 34.50 bolivars to 310
bolivars.

FT  04 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US gains on news of Kodak
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue-chip stocks improved as news of Kodak's restructuring and a second big
healthcare acquisition provided a diversion from lingering concerns over
interest rates, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.39 higher at 3,714.41, climbing
back from an 18-point deficit during the afternoon. The more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 inched 0.01 ahead to 453.03, even though declining
issues led advances, 1,093 to 985, in thin trading.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 2.19 better at
442.39, but the Nasdaq composite eased 1.31 to 739.37.
Stocks meandered in a narrow range on either side of their opening levels
during the morning.
The day's only fresh economic news - the March index of leading indicators -
came in a little higher than expected, but not enough to spark any sustained
buying and selling.
Developments in the bond market were not encouraging, as the 30-year
benchmark government issue slipped again. But trading was thin, with many
accounts remaining on the sidelines ahead Friday's employment data for
April, a keenly awaited barometer of economic strength and inflationary
pressures.
The overall mood was subdued, with the Federal Reserve's next move to lift
rates expected soon.
Later in the afternoon, a fresh decline by the dollar against the yen and
D-mark hit bonds and in turn share prices. But both markets recovered
quickly, and the blue chips pushed well into positive ground in the final
hour of trading.
Kodak brought some cheer to what could have been a rather dull market. The
stock climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 46 1/8 after announcing that it would
sell-off three non-core businesses, including its Sterling Winthrop
over-the-counter drug subsidiary.
It was the second consecutive session driven by news in the pharmaceuticals
sector. Syntex, whose share price jumped on Monday on the announcement of
Roche's Dollars 5.3bn bid, was again on top of the NYSE's most active list,
ebbing Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 23 3/8 .
Yesterday also brought news that United Healthcare, one of the biggest
health maintenance organisations, had agreed to sell its drug-distribution
business to SmithKline Beecham for Dollars 2.3bn. The announcement pushed
United Dollars 2 3/8 higher to Dollars 46 1/2 . Elsewhere, Value Health
jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 44 1/2 after agreeing to form a 'strategic
relationship' with Pfizer.
Time Warner gained Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 39 1/4 amid speculation that the
company was ripe for takeover.
On the Nasdaq, technology stocks retreated following the previous session's
upturn. Wellfleet lost Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 75 1/4 , Microsoft shed
Dollars 2 to Dollars 93 1/2 and Lotus Development dropped Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 63 7/8 .
Canada
Toronto prices closed mixed in relatively light trading. The TSE-300
composite index rose 1.28 points, or 0.03 per cent, to close at 4,283.61.
But declining issues outnumbered advances 396 to 321.
Volume was 58.66m shares, down from Monday's record 109.35m, but trading
value rose to CDollars 552.4m from CDollars 548.6m.
The conglomerates group had the day's biggest decline, off 1.2%. The mining,
gold and industrial products groups also finished lower.

FT  04 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Caracas recovers 6.8%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela
Shares on the Caracas stock exchange climbed strongly after the central bank
said that it was to hold an auction of dollars in an attempt to ease
pressure on the bolivar.
The Merinvest composite index rose 6.8 per cent to 112.39, recovering all of
Monday's losses. Electricidad de Caracas put on 34.50 bolivars to 310
bolivars.
The currency has been under pressure since the resignation last week of the
central bank president, Mrs Ruth de Krivoy, over a disagreement with the
government regarding economic policy.
Analysts have maintained that the country's financial markets will remain
volatile until the central bank introduces measures designed to tackle
inflation and the budget deficit. The government and central bank tried to
calm the markets over the weekend with statements which ruled out immediate
currency controls or devaluation.
Mexico
The stock market was easier in early trading after a rise in domestic
interest rates at the weekly auction. The IPC index was off 20.54 or 1 per
cent at 2,210.19 in volume of 7.6m shares. Brokers now see short-term
technical support at the 2,200 level.
Interest rates on benchmark 28-day treasury bills or Cetes were raised by 24
basis points to 16.49 per cent.

FT  04 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Profit-taking in S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equities were hit by a wave of profit-taking following impressive gains in
the days leading up to last week's general election. The overall index lost
71 or 1.3 per cent to 5,291, industrials shed 31 to 6,384 and the gold
index, lacking support from a flat bullion price, fell 64 or 3.2 per cent to
1,935. The Johannesburg stock exchange yesterday announced proposals for an
'evolutionary', rather than 'Big Bang' approach towards deregulation, and
also said that it wished to enhance its role for international investors.
It added that foreign citizens should be allowed to become members provided
certain criteria were met. A foreign corporation which obtained membership
on the exchange would need to obtain local registration as an external
company so that it would be subject to local court jurisdiction.

FT  04 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Bombay falls sharply as
VSNL withdraws Dollars 1bn issue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Individual stories coloured trading in the region yesterday, while Tokyo was
closed for the Golden Week holiday. It reopens on Friday.
Following the sharp correction in many of the region's markets during the
first quarter, Kleinwort Benson suggested that the worst appeared to be
over.
In their latest global strategy report the investment bankers argued that
while the rest of the year would not be easy, valuations had come down to
'historically more acceptable levels'.
They continued: 'With a strengthening OECD recovery at their back, the Asian
markets can expect more upward earnings revisions over the next 12 to 24
months.'
Kleinworts selected Malaysia and Thailand as two of the region's markets
worth buying, both being helped by export growth.
BOMBAY fell sharply following the withdrawal of a Dollars 1bn Euroissue by
VSNL, the country's overseas telecommunication group.
The BSE index lost 47.21 to 3,673.51, with VSNL down Rs220 at Rs1,100.
The Euroissue of GDRs was to have been priced yesterday, with indications of
a range between Rs1,400 and Rs1,600 per share. Brokers commented that the
withdrawal would probably curtail similar issues which had been planned by a
number of other smaller Indian companies.
HONG KONG fell 1.4 per cent, as a lack of demand continued to plague the
market and any rebound was thought unlikely before the Japanese holiday was
over.
The Hang Seng index fell 120.57 to 8,679.13, having been as much as 220
points lower in the afternoon before technical support emerged.
Property stocks remained der pressure. SHK Properties fell 75 cents to
HKDollars 44.25, while Henderson Land was 50 cents down at HKDollars 37.25.
AUSTRALIA lost a little ground but activity was described as lacking
direction in the absence of both the UK and Japanese markets. The All
Ordinaries index closed 3.7 lower at 2,044.2 in turnover of ADollars 367m.
In the media sector, News Corp shed 9 cents to ADollars 9.49 ahead of its
release of earnings today.
BHP lost 2 cents to ADollars 16.90, although brokers commented that
investors were generally unperturbed by reports that the group is to be sued
for ADollars 4bn by villagers in Papua New Guinea who have alleged that the
Ok Tedi river has been polluted by the company.
KUALA LUMPUR was broadly lower, although shares of Golden Pharos were in
demand amid rumours of a takeover and asset injection. The composite index
closed down 12.48 at 1,042.02.
Golden Pharos rose 70 cents to MDollars 9.65. A major shareholder sold its
stake in the company last week, sparking speculation that a state government
agency was the purchaser and planned to inject capital.
SEOUL edged lower in spite of some institutional buying interest in a number
of blue chips. The composite index eased 1.71 to 917.55.
Most Hyundai group shares went up on the news that the founder, Chung
Ju-yung, had decided to leave the business for good. Many investors believed
that this would help to ease relationships between the group and government,
and that it could result in a resumption of financing.
Both Hyundai Engineering and Construction and Hyundai Corp went limit up,
gaining Won1,600 and Won1,000 to Won41,600 and Won25,900 respectively.
Samsung Electronics gained Won2,500 to Won85,500 and Goldstar Won1,000 to
Won26,700 after their financial statements detailed better than expected
profits.
MANILA saw heavy foreign buying which drove prices 1.8 per cent higher.
The composite index rose 52.49 to 2,937.93, the first time since February
that the index has peaked above 2,900. Volume soared to 2.53bn shares from
1.12bn.
PLDT led gainers, closing 80 pesos higher at 1,850 pesos.
San Miguel A shares gained another 2 pesos to 178 pesos as it announced that
it had won permission to sell or redevelop its Hong Kong brewery.
SINGAPORE was boosted by demand for a number of blue chips from
institutional investors, although overall sentiment remained cautious.
The Straits Times Industrials index advanced 14.37 to 2,310.56.
KARACHI was stronger on the last day of the account, with the KSE index
adding 6.11 to 2,384.96, supported by buying of blue chips.
NEW ZEALAND was slightly easier with only Fletcher Challenge, among leading
shares, reversing the trend with a gain of 4 cents to NZDollars 3.40.
The NZSE-40 capital index shed 10.56 to 2,085.58. Turnover was NZDollars
31.2m.
COLOMBO sustained its second successive record decline, on political and
economic uncertainty, the all share index losing 48.24 to 1,002.61 for a
two-day loss of 8.7 per cent.

FT  04 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): DSM up 3.3% as Amsterdam
defies downtrend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weakness in most senior bourses was offset by an intraday peak in Brussels,
and a further rise in Stockholm, writes Our Markets Staff.
AMSTERDAM had some hopes of the general election, which was expected to
result in a change of government, but most investors concentrated on results
from DSM which exceeded all expectations. The chemical group's shares saw an
all-time high of Fl 148 during the session before closing up Fl 4.70, or 3.3
per cent at Fl 145.
The AEX index improved 2.67 to 416.39. Attention turned to Philips, the
electronics group, up Fl 1.60 to Fl 57.00 and due to announce its first
quarter results today. Analysts were confidently expecting a strong rise in
profits, helped by efforts to bring down the group's debt level; Hoare
Govett estimated a 52 per cent rise in earnings per share.
FRANKFURT was unsettled by volatility in the bond market, and pulled back
from Monday's highs by mounting concern about the impact of the weak dollar
on exporters.
The Dax index fell 16.36 to 2,252.29, and while it recovered more than 9
points in the post bourse, there were fears that currency worries could
weigh heavily again today. Turnover rose from DM7.9bn to DM9.6bn.
On the session, exporters lost ground and sectors associated with the
domestic economy, like utilities and construction, moved up instead. In
chemicals, Hoechst led the way down with a fall of DM6 to DM354. Daimler
dropped DM14.50 to DM897.50.
Ms Heidemarie Hoppner, at B Metzler, said that worries about export pricing
were rife. 'Not many industrialists are thought to have hedged their dollar
positions,' she said, 'and there could be some nasty surprises, especially
if the situation gets worse.'
Meanwhile, Lufthansa rose DM5.80 to DM219.80; after hours the government
called a news conference for today, on the long awaited privatisation of the
flagship airline.
PARIS concentrated most of the day's activity on Elf Sanofi, following news
that it might acquire Eastman Kodak's stake in Sterling Winthrop, as well as
develop its pharmaceuticals strategy with further acquisitions. Sanofi lost
FFr43 to FFr975, off a session low of FFr965.
The CAC-40 index eased 7.24 to 2,178.99 in low turnover of FFr2.8bn.
By contrast Peugeot rose FFr7 to FFr915, helped by data which confirmed a
rise in April car sales.
Lafarge Coppee, the building materials company, put on FFr5.00 to FFr462.50
as it confirmed that it was selling its 61 per cent stake in Orsan, a
biotechnology group, to Tate &amp; Lyle of the UK.
ZURICH came under renewed foreign selling pressure, the SMI index falling
9.3 to 2,755.9.
Roche certificates fell SFr30 to SFr6,690 in response to its Dollars 5.3bn
bid for Syntex, the US drugs group. Analysts, who noted that the bearers
rose SFr230 to a year's high of SFr13,000, commented that much of the day's
buying of both issues was by one private Zurich bank.
Mr Mirko Sangiorgio at Bank Julius Baer said that the impact of the deal on
Roche's future financial income was unclear. He commented that in the short
term, Roche appeared to have paid a high price in view of uncertainties
about the value of Syntex's new product range. But in the three- to
five-year term, the impact of Roche's distribution network and its
management's contribution to Syntex's business made the deal look more
positive.
Banks remained under pressure with UBS bearers down SFr24 at a year's low of
SFr1,156. The bank said it planned to launch an ADR programme during the
summer in response to growing foreign demand.
MILAN was weak, the Mibtel index falling 76 to 12,693. Goldman Sachs,
however, maintained that a combination of earnings momentum, strong retail
inflows, further rate cuts and the possibility of equity-friendly policy
surprises should boost the market over the next year.
Fondiaria rose L1,031 or 6.8 per cent to L16,248 on speculation that
Mediobanca might use some of the cash from its forthcoming rights issue to
raise its stake. Mediobanca fell L1,072 to L17,697.
Montedison fell L26 to L1,545 and Ferruzzi lost L72 to L2,323 in response to
their announcements of heavier than expected losses.
MADRID read more threats of politically sensitive disclosures from the
former civil guard chief, incorporated the losses racked up by the Ibex
index on other exchanges on Monday, and came back from holiday with a fall
of 2.4 per cent, the general index closing 7.87 lower at 317.35.
Once again, speculation overrode caution in the case of Banesto, which hit
Pta1,435 before closing at Pta1,280, up another Pta30 on the day.
BRUSSELS, briefly, broke through its all time high, the Bel-20 index
touching 1,544.17 before it closed 17.40, or 1.1 per cent higher at
1,539.40.
Interest rate sensitive stocks, which have lagged behind the market, were
among the biggest gainers. The utility, Electrabel, climbed BFr120 to
BFr6,320.
STOCKHOLM recovered after a shaky opening as debt market yields eased late
in the session and the market built expectations of strong corporate
earnings to come. The Affarsvarlden index rose to 15.9 to 1,515.8.
Astra A shares added SKr5 to SKr165 while Electrolux B rose SKr15 to a
year's high of SKr423.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Dollar remains fragile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday fell to its lowest level in more than six months
against the D-Mark, but there was no public evidence of further central bank
support for the currency, writes Philip Gawith.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.6461, more than a pfennig down on its
Friday close of DM1.657. Against the yen it finished at Y101.315 from
Y101.485.
Trade was fairly quiet, following the UK long weekend and with Japanese
markets closed for most of the week.
The dollar's woes spilled over into sterling, which finished nearly three
pfennigs lower at DM2.483, from Friday's close of DM2.5126. Political
uncertainty ahead of tomorrow's local elections is also weighing on the UK
currency.
Elsewhere, a controversy in Spain surrounding the disappearance of a former
senior police official undermined the peseta and the escudo.
While there was no repeat of Friday's Fed support for the dollar, there was
talk of concerted European central bank dollar purchases at Dollars 1.6450.
Since these activities are normally conducted through commercial banks,
their origins are not always clear.
Current market consensus on the dollar is that it is likely to weaken in the
short term, in defiance of fundamentals. But Mr Avinash Persaud, head of
currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), argues that 'the dollar is
technically ripe for a large correction, were we to see co-ordinated and
sustained central bank intervention.'
He notes that a survey of clients, trading with 1-3 month time horizons,
shows this segment of the market to be significantly short of dollars, for
the first time in a year. Overall, says Mr Persaud, the market remains long
of dollars, but it is the marginal investors who will determine a turn.
Mr David Cocker, currency analyst at Chemical Bank, said the US currency
'would need very supportive comments from the Clinton administration to
really turn the dollar around.' US comments so far had been too ambiguous to
ease market nerves.
The D-Mark was stronger in Europe, helped by the improved outlook for the
German economy. The feature of European trading was the weakness of the
Iberian currencies. The peseta finished in London at Pta81.84 from Pta81.46
on Friday against the D-Mark, while the escudo fell in tandem to close at
Es103.1 from from Es103 .
The catalyst for currency weakness was the escalating political scandal
about the police chief, coming on top of an earlier embarrassment
surrounding a former Bank of Spain governor, which caused a minister to
resign and prime minister Felipe Gonzales to cancel an overseas visit.
But political scandal comes against a background of nervous investors
searching for security in European bond markets, which works against
high-yielding economies such as Spain and Portugal. Ms Wendy Niffikeer,
senior economist at IBJ International in London , said the scandal was 'an
excuse for investors to sell the Iberian markets, because the inflation
outlook was not as good as for some other European economies.'
The Bundesbank will announce today the results of its weekly repo tender.
Market estimates are for the central bank to allow the repo rate to fall by
5-12 basis points from 5.47 per cent currently. It dropped by 23 basis
points over the past two weeks.
But Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW, believes the market is
making the error of extrapolating from past trends. With the mid-point of
German call money yesterday at about 5.55 per cent, above the repo rate of
5.47 per cent, she predicts a cut of only 2-3 basis points.
In the futures market the June euromark contract closed at 94.89, down from
94.92.
Sterling gave up most of its recent gains with the sterling index closing at
79.6 from its previous close of 80.3. The pound normally trades in tandem
with the dollar, so the US currency's weakness is one explanation for
sterling's decline.
Political uncertainty is also weighing on the UK currency. Weekend press
reports drew attention to the weak position of prime minister Mr John Major,
and the market fears that heavy Tory losses in Thursday's local elections
will aggravate matters further.
In the futures market, short sterling lost ground as the likelihood of a
further rate cut receded. Stronger than expected growth in April M0 was
merely the latest in a string of data showing robust growth in the economy.
The June contract closed at 94.59 from 94.62 on Friday. The longer contracts
gave up more ground, with the December future finishing at 93.82 from 93.88.
Conditions in the money market remained easy as the Bank of England removed
a small Pounds 100m shortage.
The guilder was unaffected by elections in the Netherlands, closing at
Fl1.123 from Fl1.122. Investors also stood on the sideline in South Africa,
awaiting clarity about the outcome of the election. The financial rand
firmed to R4.6 against the dollar from R4.625.

group, and drastically reduced charges against them over futures trading
operations that resulted in losses of USDollars 207m.
Mr Juan Pablo Davila, Codelco's former chief futures operator, is now
charged with causing the company losses by deception, which carries a
maximum sentence of 541 days in prison. His two immediate superiors are now
charged with being accomplices, for having failed to keep a check on his
activities, and face a maximum sentence of 66 days.
Previous charges against all three of having defrauded the state were
dropped because Codelco workers are not classified as public employees for
penal purposes, although the company is 100 per cent state-owned. Those
charges could have resulted in five-year sentences, as well as hefty fines.
None of the three was had to put up bail as the new charges were not
considered sufficiently serious. Mr Davila had been in custody since March
11 and the others since April 8.
Codelco, which lost Dollars 13m after tax in 1993, compared with a Dollars
303m profit in 1992, no longer trades futures.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Foreign miners not ready to
invest in China - Progress has been made on liberalisation, but more is
needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When representatives of some of the world's leading mining companies
gathered in Beijing earlier this year for a minerals forum there was more
than usual interest in China's proposals for a new regulatory regime
governing foreign investment.
China's mining sector has lagged well behind others, including notably oil
and gas, in efforts to attract foreign involvement. Foreign investment and
with it new technology is now critical to China if it is to make up for lost
time in exploiting its mineral deposits to support a rapidly developing
economy.
Senior executives of companies like Teck Exploration of Canada, and CRA and
BHP of Australia came away encouraged by what they had heard from Chinese
officials. But to the question of whether they would commit large resources
to exploration in China their response was: 'Not yet'.
Mr Ian Gould, responsible for CRA's exploration worldwide, provided a
typical industry view of China prospects at this stage. 'China is very much
one of the countries we are monitoring carefully,' he said. 'But it is not
quite at the point where CRA might be prepared to come in.'
However, mining executives and academic experts involved in the minerals
forum organised by the Pacific Economic Co-operation Council, which is
sponsored by Pacific Rim countries, said China was making definite, albeit
relatively slow, progress in clearing away barriers to foreign involvement.
For the first time, according to Mr Gould, Chinese officials had begun
speaking publicly about a specific 'contract of work' for mining ventures
that would help facilitate negotiations that might otherwise become bogged
down under cumbersome state mining legislation.
Among regional countries, Indonesia has used the 'contract of work' approach
to good effect in attracting foreign investment. Foreign miners believe the
Chinese should follow the Indonesian model.
Mr Fu Mingke, deputy director of the Ministry of Geology's development
bureau admitted in an address to the forum that a 1986 mining law was now
'incompatible' with China's own market-oriented economy. It was also
'incomparable' with mining laws internationally.
He acknowledged that the framing of a mining law would be complex and
time-consuming, and therefore in the meantime China would 'develop a
standard investment agreement (or contract). . . as a document supplemental
to the mining regulations'.
Mr Allen Clark, assistant director of Resources Programmes at the East-West
centre in Hawaii, said there had been a 'very substantial change' in China's
basic approach to opening the country to foreign miners.
The country still had some way to go, however, before it could be regarded
as an appealing location. Indications that the government was planning a
'resources tax' of up to 30 per cent suggested that the Chinese were not yet
ready to fall into line internationally on standard royalties of between 1
and 5 per cent.
Mining companies entering China now might be liable to an effective tax rate
of 45 to 55 per cent, including taxes on profits and other levies, compared
with an international average of 30 to 40 per cent.
China, according to Mr Clark, was also mistaken in its apparent strategy of
offering marginal projects to foreign miners rather than 'green field'
sites. Chinese officials, fearful of criticism that they might be selling
out the country's birthright, are excessively concerned about a foreign
miner happening upon a high-grade and very profitable deposit.
But in the end, foreign mining experts believe, enormous pressures on the
mining sector from the China's leadership to provide more of the country's
base metal and other mineral requirements will inevitably force speedier
liberalisation.
Mr James Dorian, co-ordinator of the China Energy Project at Hawaii's
East-West Centre, pointed out at the forum that while China's mining
industry ranked fourth in the world in output value, it was operating well
below its potential. China, in fact, had a 'very low' per capita production
of metals and minerals.
Billions of dollars were required, Mr Dorian said, to modernise the
industry, which was suffering from 'numerous problems', including low
efficiencies in recovery, production and utilisation, outdated mining
equipment and technology and severe transport bottlenecks.
He added, however, that companies interested in business opportunities in
China would need to 'remain flexible and patient' in seeking to understand
not only the industry, but the 'often confusing' bureaucratic systems.
'The planned expansion and modernisation of China's mining industry will
require tremendous influx of foreign technology and financing,' he said.
'Firms that are able to establish a successful track record today in China
may be able to reap more substantial rewards in the long term.'

FT  04 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper price rise forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Copper is benefiting from rising European demand, analysts suggest, and
prices should be sharply up in the last quarter of 1994.
The market may see a supply deficit of 225,000 tonnes this year and of
350,000 tonnes in 1995, according to Mr Fred Demler, analyst with the ED &amp;
F. Man commodities group.
'This builds a case for volatile and rising prices, despite the large
increase in primary output (expected) in 1995,' he adds. Man in its latest
metals markets review is forecasting copper prices averaging 95 cents a
pound in the final quarter of this year.
Merrill Lynch is even more bullish and says Dollars 1 a pound is 'not an
unreasonble objective' while 83 cents seems to be the bottom of the trading
range. Merrill says in its Weekly Futures Report that the second quarter
could see some prices weakness develop but so far 'demand from Europe has
taken some of the pressure off the inevitable slowing of US demand. We
believe that the potential correction in copper prices will not be as great
as some are anticipating'.
European copper consumption rose about 4 per cent above late-1993 levels at
the begining of this year, Bloomsbury Minerals Economics points out in its
Copper Briefing Services. The turn-round in the automotive industries of the
UK, France and Spain was the most important factor.
Mr Peter Hollands of BME says that the most important source of uncertainty
is China. However, he guesses that light Chinese selling may occur every
time the copper price nears 90 cents and there may be speculative buying
when it falls below 85 cents.
'Two-way Chinese trade might keep the price within a fairly narrow range for
some time,' he adds
Nevertheless, BME suggests the copper price will bottom out at 83 to 85
cents in the next few weeks, then will trend slowly upwards through October
to about 90 cents and 'thereafter there looks likely to be scope for rapid
price increases towards Dollars 1 a pound'.

FT  04 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Aluminium breaks stubborn
resistance - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM and COPPER prices closed firmer at the London Metal Exchange
yesterday and looked set to clock up further gains, dealers said.
Aluminium finally broke through stubborn resistance just above the Dollars
1,320 level, for three months delivery, and finished at the highs, with
final business at Dollars 1,328, a Dollars 25 gain from last Friday's after
hours 'kerb' close.
'This is a very good close, and should bring in some further buying,' one
trader said.
Copper lost some impetus in the afternoon, but remained underpinned by
earlier speculative buying, and was content to hold just below the Dollars
1,970 level, prior to another attempt to break overhead resistance, dealers
suggested.
Other metals traded less actively, but were generally supported by the
overall upward trend.
LEAD advanced steadily in the afternoon, confirming a break above the
Dollars 470-a-tonne level for the three months position, which finished at
the day's high of Dollars 474, a Dollars 9 gain from pre-weekend levels.
ZINC matched other metals, and was supported on dips towards Dollars 950 a
tonne. Final business was at Dollars 953, up Dollars 5.
TIN prices were steadier throughout but were unable to attain a Dollars
5,500-a-tonne upside target for three months delivery and the market eased
back from the highs.
PRECIOUS METALS trading was mildly weaker after the New York markets opened
quietly and below previous closing levels. There was little obvious reaction
to the continuing vote count in South Africa, which showed the ANC, as
expected, winning a clear majority.
PLATINUM saw some profit-taking mid-afternoon taking it back to under
Dollars 400 a troy ounce and paring weekend gains.
COCOA prices picked at the London Commodity Exchange in the afternoon in
response to investment fund buying in New York. Near July closed Pounds 26
firmer at Pounds 885 a tonne.
One trader said the latest traders' commitments report showed investment
funds still had plenty of room to get into the market. But a volume of 5,249
lots, including 1,163 cross trades, reflected the fact that this was not a
move generated in London, he added.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: London coffee futures surge
past Dollars 1,600 mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee prices surged 5 per cent to fresh five-year highs on the London
Commodity Exchange yesterday, surprising even bullish traders by the speed
of the rise.
The continued tightness of physical supplies, coupled with a shortage of
stocks, pushed the July second position for robusta futures to a peak of
Dollars 1,655 a tonne. A buoyant opening in New York helped London maintain
most of its gains, with the July contract closing Dollars 80 up from
Friday's close at Dollars 1,643.
In early afternoon trading in New York, the second position arabica contract
was 3.80 cents higher at 93.65 cents a pound.
Yesterday's surge through Dollars 1,600 in London came less than two weeks
after the July contract broke the Dollars 1,500 barrier and put it 37 per
cent up on the year so far. The market is at its highest level since
mid-1989.
Growing interest in soft commodities among investment funds looking for
diversification is helping to fuel a market driven by a lack of readily
available robusta from west Africa and Indonesia and falling consumer
stocks, said one trader.
'It's a little bit of everything,' he said. 'But even so the severity and
speed of the move, particularly today, is surprising.' Buying came from the
trade as well as chartists and funds. 'There were just no sellers around
from the beginning.'
The continued squeeze on short positions was reflected in the nearby May
contract's Dollars 57 premium over July. But Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at
GNI, the London brokers, pointed out that July was at a growing premium to
September, 'which means people think this tightness could last through till
then.'
The fact that the world price for robusta has now reached the level where
export stocks can been released appears to be having little effect. The
Association of Coffee Producing Countries is not due to discuss the release
of stocks until a meeting on May 23.
The LCE yesterday reported a 41 per cent rise in volume in April compared
with March, with 333,874 contracts traded. That reflected more active
physical markets and growing investment fund interest, it said.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasury prices recede in thin trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds receded in thin trading yesterday as dealers adjusted
their positions ahead of Friday's important data on labour-market conditions
last month.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1/8 at
86 7/8 , with the yield rising to 7.34 per cent.
At the short end, the two-year note was  1/8 easier at 99 11/32 , to yield
5.837 per cent.
Early on, prices drifted lower as the market followed through on the
previous session's selling and on weakness in bonds overseas.
The negative tone was worsened when traders misconstrued comments made by Mr
Wayne Angell, a former Federal Reserve governor who was recently named chief
economist at Bear Stearns, the New York securities house.
He said that if the Federal Reserve intended to lift interest rates again
before its May 17 policy-making session, it would likely have done so
yesterday.
It was later made clear that Mr Angell thought the likelihood of a move
yesterday was remote.
But speculation over an immediate tightening had only a brief impact on
prices. The long end of the maturity range soon climbed off its session
lows, resulting in a flattening of the yield curve.
A fresh decline in the dollar against the yen and D-Mark had little impact
on the market, and neither did the day's economic news.
The Commerce Department said that the leading indicators, designed to
predict future economic strength, rose 0.7 per cent in March, against a
consensus forecast of 0.6 per cent.
Instead, most retail accounts were sitting on the sidelines, while dealers
were unwinding speculative positions set up earlier in anticipation of April
employment data due out at the end of the week. The result was a modest
slump across the board.
European government bond markets closed lower, with the UK and Spain
experiencing the sharpest declines yesterday.
UK government bonds were depressed by the combination of unfavourable M0
data, political jitters ahead of the local elections and lack of investor
interest, dealers said.
The narrow money-supply measure M0 was reported growing at an annual rate of
6.2 per cent in April, above the expected figure of 5.8 per cent.
Dealers said that the figure implied that consumer spending remains robust,
and therefore reduced the prospect of a near-term cut in the base rate.
Meanwhile, dealers complained at the poor investor interest in the gilts
market. 'Investors just remain sidelined in these conditions,' said one
gilts salesman.
The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 105.30, touching a high of 105.31
early in the day and settling at 104.28 - but shortly after settling, the
contract dropped down to a low of 104.18 in the late afternoon.
Spanish government bond prices were hit early in the day, mainly on
continuing twists and developments in the country's long-running political
scandals. The Meff futures contract dropped sharply from its opening level
of 97.10 and fell to a low of 96.35, settling at 96.50.
German bunds ended lower after a fairly volatile session, with little
immediate news to focus on apart from the prospect of another interest rate
cut at today's repo, traders said.
After fairly generous cuts at the last two weekly repo operations, the repo
rate stands at 5.47 per cent, and dealers said they expect to see a further
lowering of the rate by between three and seven basis points today.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 95.20 - which was also the high of
the day - fell back, then recovered and finally dropped down again to a low
of 94.88 by late afternoon.

FT  04 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Index shows widespread
declines for year to date
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most government bond markets suffered declines in the first four months of
1994, ranging from a 0.15 per cent drop in Italy to a 7.81 per cent decline
in the UK gilt market, J. P. Morgan's bond index shows.
Much of the negative performance was triggered by the sell-off in the US
Treasuries market, where strong economic growth, mounting inflation concerns
and Fed tightening combined to drive yields higher and increase volatility.
This spilled over into Europe, where signs of stronger-than-expected
economic revival added to market jitters, JP . Morgan states.
Japan was the only government bond market to post positive returns in April,
rising by 0.17 per cent in local currency terms on the back of a stronger
yen, low inflation and signs of continued weak economic activity.
European government bonds posted further losses last month, in spite of
continued easing by the Bundesbank and accompanying rate cuts by other
central banks.
Total returns in Europe fell by 0.81 per cent, with Sweden, the worst
performer, shedding as much as 1.56 per cent.
The UK market also performed poorly in April, falling by 1.21 per cent in
response to inflation concerns and increasing political uncertainty ahead of
forthcoming local and European parliamentary elections.
Shedding only 0.03 per cent, Italy was Europe's top performing market,
supported by hopes for a stable new government following the victory of the
right-wing alliance in the March elections.
Spain, Europe's other high-yielder, was the second-best performer, declining
by 0.41 per cent.
Unhedged US dollar investors benefited from the strength of most major
currencies against the dollar last month. In US dollar terms, the index rose
by 0.49 per cent. The yen's appreciation contributed to a total return of
1.41 per cent on Japanese government bonds in US dollar terms. Similarly,
the lira's strength helped Italian bonds show a 1.16 per cent return.

FT  04 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Buoyant Paris stock market
puts brokers back in black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's stockbrokers moved back into the black last year due to the buoyant
state of the Paris stock market, which helped them to return to profit after
three years of heavy losses.
The latest figures from the French Stockbrokers' Association show that the
57 French stockbrokers made collective net profits of FFr1.01bn (Dollars
179m) in 1993. The surplus compares with an aggregate deficit of FFr1.96bn
for the three preceding years.
The chief catalyst for the return to profits, according to the association,
was the 'explosion in volume trading' during the year combined with a
'significant reduction in restructuring costs' for the stockbrokers
themselves.
Last year marked a turning point for France's stockbrokers, which suffered
severely during the sluggish climate of the early 1990s.
The industry then faced the parallel problems of low volume - reflecting
weak demand for French equities following the bullish conditions of the
mid-1980s - and fierce competition fuelled by the arrival of foreign houses
in the Paris market.
These problems were aggravated by the strategy adopted by some of France's
big banks of using their stockbroking subsidiaries as loss-leaders to
protect their positions elsewhere in the financial sector, thereby
destabilising the market and making life more difficult for the incoming
foreign houses.
However, the Paris stock market rallied last year as foreign funds poured
into France. At the same time the supply of equity increased, due to a
stream of issues from private sector companies and the Balladur government's
privatisation programme.
The programme began last year with the sale of the state's stake in Banque
Nationale de Paris, and is continuing with the current Union des Assurances
de Paris issue.
As a result, the industry has benefited from increased demand and an
improvement in the Paris stock market's long-standing liquidity problem,
which has enabled the stockbrokers to return to profit.

FT  04 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Volatile conditions keep activity to a
minimum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurobond issuance dried to a trickle yesterday, with Japanese markets slowed
by Golden Week holiday, and tomorrow's UK local elections and Friday's US
jobs data looming.
Volatile conditions in some of the underlying government bond markets are
keeping activity to a minimum.
'A lack of investor interest doesn't usually stop underwriters from issuing
bonds, but given the current volatility, they're less inclined to hold
unplaced paper on their books,' said one syndicate official.
The Canadian Wheat Board braved the Canadian dollar sector ahead of
Ontario's budget announcement tomorrow. The triple-A rated government agency
issued CDollars 125m of 7 1/2 per cent three-year bonds priced to yield five
basis points over the interpolated government bond yield curve.
That spread widened to around 7 1/2 basis points by the close, said lead
manager Hambros Bank.
Targeted mainly at retail investors, the issue was said to be slow to place.
However, one dealer said the spread was likely to tighten, as it did with
the recent three-year issue for Canada's Export Development Corporation,
which now yields substantially less than government bonds after being issued
flat to them.
The day's other deal was a self-led L200bn issue of 9 3/4 per cent 10-year
bonds with a four-year call option for Credito Italiano. At less full fees,
the paper yields 10.03 per cent to maturity (80 basis points over the
corresponding government bond) and 10.29 per cent to its four-year call date
(130 basis points over).
According to Mr Niccolo Nuti, head of capital markets at Credito Italiano,
the issue saw strong demand from Italian investors attracted by the high
coupon and the familiar name. Although South Africa stands a good chance of
achieving a successful economic performance, its debt is unlikely to achieve
an investment grade credit rating in the foreseeable future, the European
rating agency IBCA said.
Examining prospects following last week's first multi-racial elections, IBCA
warned that overseas capital flows to South Africa are still smaller than
capital flight by current residents; that investment has been low and needs
to rise sharply; and that the balance of payments has been a traditional
weakness of the economy.
Consequently, the scope for a rise in living conditions is limited and there
is little scope for income redistribution if the skills of the middle class
white population are to be retained, IBCA said.

FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: IBM steps up battle for
mid-range market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines yesterday fired the latest salvo in the
battle for the important mid-range computer market.
It launched the latest version of its AS/400 mid-range computer family with
the claim that the machines have an important role in the increasingly
popular client-server computing systems.
The market for mid-range machines is important to IBM as it struggles to
regain satisfactory profitability after three years of losses. The mainframe
computer business is no longer growing as customers shift to smaller,
cheaper computers of equivalent power.
IBM has reversed its declining market share in personal computers, but
margins there are narrow. However, the company has held a strong position in
the mid-range through its System/34 and System/38 computer families.
This is a potentially large market as customers trade up from PC systems or
trade down from mainframes. A mid-range machine is frequently the first
computer many medium-sized companies buy.
IBM's mid-range success was maintained by the launch of the first version of
the AS/400, three years ago, a computer derived from the System/38. It has
sold more than 250,000 systems.
However, the AS/400 retained a number of idiosyncratic features including a
special operating system and a closed structure which raised question marks
about its prospects.
Yesterday's launch showed that IBM has rethought the hardware and the
software of the AS/400. It will be able to run AS/400 programs, Unix (open
system) programs or OS/2 (PC) programs.

FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Delayed issue damages emerging
markets - Stefan Wagstyl and Sara Webb examine the postponement of a Dollars
1bn Euroequity offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The postponement yesterday of the Dollars 1bn Euroequity issue by Videsh
Sanchar Nigam (VSNL), the state-owned Indian international
telecommunications monopoly, is a blow for the company, the country and for
emerging markets.
But it is a blow from which VSNL, India and the markets can all recover.
Financial ventures in developing countries are by nature risky. The fact
that one attempt to raise funds has failed will probably not cast a
permanent shadow over future offerings, though it may well make life
difficult for Indian issuers over the next few months.
VSNL's decision to defer the issue after frantic talks with the government
in Delhi and with the global co-ordinators, Salomon Brothers of the US and
Kleinwort Benson of the UK, has left all involved feeling embarrassed.
There will be recriminations, particularly in India, where economic
globalisation and the disposal of state-owned assets are sensitive political
questions.
The issue failed mainly because of bad timing, compounded by over-ambitious
pricing and, in the final stages, inflexibility in decision-making which
made it impossible for the issuers to cut the price to save the offer.
From the start, VSNL was no ordinary offering. The Indian government, which
owns 85 per cent, saw it as a flagship of its otherwise undistinguished
portfolio of state-owned enterprises.
When VSNL indicated late last year its interest in an international equity
offering, investment bankers drooled at the prospect, not least because
India was in fashion in international markets. Salomon and Kleinwort secured
the mandate for the issue against tough competition. Quite apart from the
prestige of handling India's biggest issue, there were the fees. The going
rate for complex international offerings such as European privatisations is
3 per cent of the amount raised. If VSNL had raised Dollars 1bn, it would
have paid about Dollars 30m - of which Salomon and Kleinwort would have
received at least half.
Shares prices in Bombay soared between November and February, taking VSNL
from about Rs650 to a peak of more than Rs1,700 in January and February.
This tempted VSNL and the government to double the size of the issue from
Dollars 500m to Dollars 1bn and to aim for a price of Rs1,400 to Rs1,600.
But by the time the issue was ready for market in early April, investor mood
had changed. An increase in US interest rates had soured the markets,
especially the volatile emerging markets. Potential investors told the
company that the shares, priced at about 90 times 1993 earnings, were too
expensive. In hasty talks last weekend, Salomon and Kleinwort tried to save
the issue by securing permission to approach fund managers informally with a
lower price. It emerged that the shares could be sold at Rs1,100 to Rs1,200,
raising some Dollars 700m, and that investor demand would be sufficient for
the deal to go relatively smoothly.
It seems that the VSNL board, gathered in London, wanted to proceed. So did
Mr N Vittal, chairman of the government's Telecommunications Commission and
an advocate of economic liberalisation, who was also in London. But in
Delhi, in meetings late on Monday, others counselled caution - notably Mr
Sukh Ram, the telecommunications minister who is opposed to over-hasty
deregulation and who insisted that price was an issue for the Cabinet. The
prime minister's office agreed. So at 4am London time yesterday, the lead
managers were asked to postpone the offer.
The decision has no immediate impact on VSNL since its investment plans are
flexible and do not depend on the issue for finance.
The Indian government, which needs privatisation proceeds to help cut its
fiscal deficit, will be under pressure to find funds elsewhere. It will also
face criticism for having mishandled the deal. However, it will avoid
accusations of having sold the 'family jewels' cheaply.
Indian companies, which raised about Dollars 2.5bn in 1993-94 in Euroissues,
are planning to raise a further Dollars 9bn in 1994-95. Brokers and fund
managers were divided last night how the VSNL failure would affect their
prospects. Some thought future issues might also be postponed, but others
thought the failure of VSNL would leave more funds available for other
offers.
Mr Jeff Chowdhry, director at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management,
said: 'Inevitably this will put further issues on hold but that may not be
such a bad thing as it will create time for digesting Indian paper.'

FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: US computer groups call off
merger plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The merger of Electronic Arts and Broderbund Software, two leading
developers of personal computer games software, has been called off. The
merger would have created the world's largest consumer software company.
The two companies said the recent trading prices of both companies' shares
led the board of directors at Broderbund to conclude that 'a combination
under the terms of the current agreement did not appropriately reflect the
relative values of the two companies'.
Since February, when the companies announced their merger plans, Electronic
Arts share price has fallen from Dollars 26 1/4 to close at a low of Dollars
21 3/4 on Monday while Broderbund fell from Dollars 37 1/2 to Dollars 34
3/4.
The companies said they were unable to reach agreement on revised terms for
the merger.
Electronic Arts was to have acquired Broderbund in a stock swap initially
valued at Dollars 400m.
Broderbund has agreed to make a one-time payment to Electronic Arts of
Dollars 10m in connection with the ending of the agreement.
In heavy trading in New York yesterday, Broderbund's share price closed at
Dollars 41 1/4 up from Dollars 34 3/4. Electronic Arts closed at Dollars 20
1/16, down from Dollars 21 3/4.
Analysts said that Broderbund appeared to have been undervalued by
Electronic Arts, particularly in comparison with the Dollars 462m that
Pearson of the UK, publisher of the Financial Times, is paying for Software
Toolworks, a smaller computer games developer that the publishing group
recently agreed to acquire for cash.

Ansett, the Australian airline owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation
and TNT, the transportation group, yesterday unveiled plans to become an
international carrier.
It will focus on routes to Japan and Hong Kong but defer plans for Malaysia,
Singapore and South Korea.
The services will start in September, using Boeing 747s leased from
Singapore Airlines. There will be five flights a week to Osaka, and three
services a week to Hong Kong.
Mr Ken Cowely, Ansett's chairman, said he expected the operation to generate
positive cashflow in the second year of operation. He said that start-up
losses in the first year should not exceed ADollars 50m (USDollars 36m)
while revenues should total about ADollars 150m.

Heavy pressure on operating margins meant that Pepkor, South Africa's
biggest retail group, was only able to increase operating profit by 3 per
cent for the year ending February, to R275m (Dollars 80.6m) from R267.2m.
However, lower tax and finance charges meant that after-tax profit increased
16 per cent to R184.7m from R161.35m.
Turnover rose to R8.24bn from R7.76bn, largely due to increased market share
achieved by core operation Pep stores, which target the mainly black, mass
market.
Shoprite, the subsidiary that controls supermarket chain Checkers, also
performed well, withstanding the effects of a five-week strike and a flat
trading market to boost after-tax profits 27 per cent to R43.56m from
R35.79m.
Announcing the results, management declared 1994 as the 'most difficult
(year) to date in the history of the group' but said the improving political
and economic climate, particularly among the black consumers that constitute
much of Pepkor's market, should help future performance.
The company is also involved in negotiations which may lead to a bid for
troubled UK retailer What Everyone Wants. Results of the bid will be known
on Monday at WEW's annual meeting.
Edgars, the clothing, footwear and textiles group in the South African
Breweries stable, increased after-tax profit 11 per cent to R171.2m from
R175.3m last year.
Sales increased 16 per cent to R3.68bn from R3.18bn, boosted by the
acquisition of Shoecorp.
The results, which were boosted by a slight reduction in taxation and net
financing costs, reflected an improvement in market share despite the
continued depressed overall trading environment.

FT  04 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P warns over Japanese
banks' asset problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Asset-quality problems at Japanese banks, which face increasing bad-loan
levels, will take several years to resolve, according to Standard &amp; Poor's,
the international credit rating agency.
While the pace of increases in problem loans has slowed, the agency
estimates that problem loans at 23 leading Japanese banks totalled Y30,000bn
to Y35,000bn (Dollars 275bn to Dollars 321bn) for the business year ended
last March - a substantial deterioration from the Y13,700bn in bad loans
disclosed by 21 leading banks last September.
The official figure given by the banks only includes loans to now-bankrupt
borrowers, or those who have not paid interest for more than six months,
while S&amp;P broadly considers loans with the likelihood of becoming
loss-making.
The credit agency recently downgraded its debt ratings on many of the
leading Japanese banks due to the mounting pressure the banking system
faces.
'Japanese banks' biggest challenge now is how to extricate themselves from
problem assets as quickly as possible without reporting red figures,' S&amp;P
says.
But without the prospect of a significant rebound in core earnings in the
near term and with the equity market remaining sluggish, the clean-up
process is expected to reduce financial flexibility as banks try to rebuild
their balance sheets and cope with financial reform.
However, due to the increasing transparency of the banks' asset problems and
the slowing of the increase in new problem loans, the agency predicts that
future downgrades of banks' ratings are less likely.
The Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, the bad-loan purchasing
organisation, said it bought Y65.1bn worth of bad loans from banks at a
price of Y22.9bn during April.
The company, set up by a consortium of banks, said it purchased a total
Y4,585.1bn worth of bad loans backed by real estate collateral for
Y2,253.9bn since it started operations in March last year. But only Y37.68bn
has been recovered through sales of the real estate due to the slump in the
property market.

Bank Bumiputra, the Malaysian state-owned bank which has been dogged by
controversy and bad debts, is fully underwriting a MDollars 587m (USDollars
212.7m) loan to a consortium of local companies involved in Malaysia's
independent power programme.
The consortium, Powerteck, has the license to build, own and operate a 440MW
gas fired power station in Malacca, on the west coast of peninsular
Malaysia.
This is the third loan Bank Bumiputra has made in recent months to companies
involved in Malaysia's plan to privatise part of the electricity industry.
The bank says the loans - all in ringgit, the Malaysian dollar  - show the
maturity of the local capital market.
However, some financiers have expressed concern that Malaysian financial
institutions, and Bank Bumiputra in particular, are too exposed in one
sector. They have also asked why foreign banks have chosen not to become
involved in the private power sector.

<TEXT>
Unilever, the UK-Dutch consumer goods group, has agreed plans to divest from
its Nigerian affiliate, UAC, in which it has a 40 per cent stake valued at
around Dollars 46m.
UAC has evolved from a trading operation into Nigeria's largest
manufacturing, packaging and distribution conglomerate, with the 60 per cent
Nigerian-owned shares held by both private and institutional investors.
Unilever will re-invest the cash from the divestment in its core sectors,
including food and personal products. UAC will remain the flagship company
of Nigeria but without foreign ownership and management for the first time
in its 74-year history.
The Nigerian authorities approved a complex restructuring of UAC and the
transfer of Unilever's assets to a new holding company, Unilever Nigeria,
ensuring that no capital leaves Nigeria.
Unilever will retain its 40 per cent share in UAC's tractors and equipment
division (the Caterpillar dealership), which will become a separate joint
venture, and acquire all the shares in AJ Seward, the consumer goods arm.
The two holdings account for half the value ofstake in UAC.
Unilever will sell its shares in the other divisions of UAC and re-invest
the capital in new ventures in Nigeria, all under the newly-formed Unilever
Nigeria.
Unilever's remaining UAC shares (worth about Dollars 21m at the current
share price) will be offered for sale to the public at the same time as UAC
issues new shares.
Company sources say that subject to clearance by an extraordinary general
meeting in May and by the courts in June, the share offer will follow as
soon possible.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Viacom, the US entertainment group, yesterday in effect put its Madison
Square Garden operations up for auction, signalling a disposal that analysts
expect to raise more than Dollars 1bn.
The company denied, though, that it was being forced into the sale by the
heavy debt load associated with its Dollars 10bn takeover of Paramount
Communications, the former owner of MSG.
Viacom said it had been approached by more than one potential buyer, and had
retained the investment bank Allen &amp; Co to evaluate offers.
Mr Sumner Redstone, the chairman of Viacom, said: 'While we have the option
of retaining this extraordinary asset and building on its many strengths, it
would be imprudent to ignore the many inquiries from possible buyers.'
Viacom would explore a sale of MSG 'as part of an orderly process for
determining how best to maximise shareholder value in the company.'
Mr Redstone's statement follows speculation that Viacom would be forced to
sell a number of assets. To help service debt resulting from the Paramount
takeover, the company has been counting on the completion of its planned
merger with Blockbuster Entertainment, the US video rental group.
Blockbuster itself has little debt and strong cashflow.
However, that transaction has looked in doubt as Viacom's B shares, the
currency for the deal, have tumbled in value in recent months - although the
shares rose Dollars 1 1/2 yesterday to close at Dollars 24 1/4 .
The MSG operations include the New York venue itself, two professional
sports franchises which play there - the Knicks basketball team and the
Rangers ice hockey team - and a sports cable television channel.
Viacom said that it had had 'expressions of interest from a number of
parties' interested in buying the operations, but did not say how far these
discussions had progressed or when it expected Allen to complete its
evaluation.

FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Disney to offer theme holidays
on cruise ships

Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, announced yesterday that it was to
enter the cruise vacation business by offering holidays afloat as part of a
package with its Florida theme parks.
It said it hoped to launch the first Disney cruise ship in 1998, with a
second following soon after. Each would be a 'mega ship' carrying about
2,400 passengers, indicating a purchase price of about Dollars 300m a
vessel.
Disney said cruise holidays were a popular and growing segment, and that
operating its own cruise line would allow it to bring a new dimension of
entertainment to its guests.
The ships will offer a variety of entertainments featuring Disney characters
and themes. During the voyage they will also call at an exclusive Disney
island for a day-long excursion.
Cruises will be offered as part of one-week holiday packages comprising
three or four days aboard the vessel and the balance of the week at the
Disney World theme parks in Florida.
Departure points and ports of call have not yet been established, but Disney
said the vessels would visit various places in the Caribbean. On their
return to Florida, passengers would be provided with transport direct to
Disney World hotels.
Disney said it had no plans at present to offer cruise vacations except as
part of packages with its theme parks. However, it might consider linking
cruises with other Disney theme parks.

FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak prepares for a new
image - The chairman decided the company should concentrate on its core
operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement by Mr George Fisher, chairman of Eastman Kodak, that the
group would sell its healthcare businesses delighted Wall Street for a
simple reason: many analysts and investors doubted that the new Kodak chief
had the guts to do it.
Ever since Mr Fisher joined the struggling photographic products group from
Motorola last December, Wall Street has waited for him to outline a strategy
for turning around Kodak, which has been criticised for its lacklustre
financial performance.
Most analysts were hoping Mr Fisher would choose to sell off Kodak's
non-core operations so it could concentrate on its photographic products and
imaging business. But few analysts were sure that he would be able to
engineer such a dramatic shift at a company renowned for its stodgy
corporate culture and resistance to change.
After all, Kodak had made five attempts in the past 10 years to restructure
its businesses and generate better earnings, and none had really worked. Why
would it be any different this time?
Yet, it was to be different because the new chairman realised soon after
joining Kodak that non-core operations were diverting much needed resources
away from the all-important imaging business. As he said yesterday: 'It
became increasingly apparent to me that we had this great set of businesses,
each of which had investment requirements that Kodak could not afford to
adequately cover.'
Consequently, Mr Fisher decided that if Kodak's imaging business was to
prosper in an increasingly competitive market, healthcare operations had to
go. Under the plan unveiled yesterday, the group will sell its
pharmaceutical and consumer health products unit Sterling Winthrop, its
personal care and household products business L&amp;F Products, and its Clinical
Diagnostics division. Between them, the three businesses generated almost a
quarter of Kodak's 1993 revenues of Dollars 16.4bn.
After the divestments, Kodak will be left with its imaging business and the
Health Sciences division. The latter, with its X-ray film and
electronics-based medical, cardiology, and dental diagnostic businesses, is
regarded as a vital part of Kodak's imaging strategy.
The ultimate aim of the restructuring is to allow Kodak to devote more funds
to developing its imaging business. Most of Kodak's photographic earnings
are derived from its traditional film products, which uses a chemical
process to create images. It is this business which is threatened by the
rapidly growing market for digital, electronic imaging.
Without the burden of supporting the healthcare operations, Kodak will be
able to spend more money on developing the electronic side of the imaging
business while simultaneously protecting its traditional imaging business
from competitors, and building sales of its photographic products.
The immediate impact of the divestments will be to improve dramatically the
group's financial condition. Kodak is labouring under Dollars 7bn of debt,
and the proceeds from the sale of the healthcare operations will go a long
way towards sharply reducing that figure. In turn, the reduction in debt
should lead to an improvement in the group's credit ratings.
Kodak does not expect the divestments to be dilutive. Mr Harry Kavetas,
chief financial officer, said: 'We would not expect any dilutive effect on
continuing earnings per share . . . because decreases in interest expense
that we will realise by applying the proceeds (of the sales) to debt
reductions should offset the loss of near-term profit contribution from the
sold units.'
Much depends, however, on what Kodak gets from the sale of its non-core
businesses. Although the group should have little trouble finding a buyer
for Sterling (the German group Bayer has already expressed an interest), few
expect it to recover the Dollars 5.1bn it spent acquiring the unit in 1988.

Telefonos de Mexico, the country's monopoly telephone utility, reported net
profits of 1.85bn pesos (Dollars 566m) in the first quarter, a drop of 14
per cent on the same period last year.
Telmex's profits were pushed down by an exchange rate loss of 719m pesos on
foreign currency debt resulting from the depreciation of the peso against
the dollar and weakness of the dollar against the yen.
Excluding the exchange rate loss, the underlying results showed robust
growth. Operating profits reached 2.94bn pesos, a 13 per cent advance, while
revenues climbed to 6.63bn pesos, an increase of the same amount.
The rise in sales was helped by unexpectedly strong growth of international
telephone traffic, which rose 22.3 per cent in the quarter, far higher than
last year's increase .
Long distance traffic was up by 11.6 per cent, and local calls grew by 12.3
per cent.

The announcement by Mr George Fisher, chairman of Eastman Kodak, that the
group would sell its healthcare and household products businesses delighted
Wall Street for a simple reason: many analysts and investors doubted that
the new Kodak chief had the guts to do it.
Ever since Mr Fisher took over the helm at the struggling photographic
products group last December following the resignation of his predecessor,
Mr Kay Whitmore, Wall Street has waited for the new chairman to outline his
strategy for turning around Kodak, which has been heavily criticised for its
lacklustre financial performance.
Most analysts were hoping Mr Fisher would choose to sell off Kodak's
non-core operations so that it could concentrate on its photographic
products and imaging business. But few were sure that he would be able to
engineer such a dramatic shift at a company renowned for its stodgy
corporate culture and resistance to change.
After all, Kodak had made five attempts in the past 10 years to restructure
its businesses and generate better earnings, and all had failed. Why,
critics asked, would it be any different this time?
Yet, judging by the planned restructuring, Mr Fisher - who made a name for
himself as a brilliant technologist and manager while chairman of Motorola -
has persuaded Kodak to embrace change wholeheartedly.
Under the divestment plan unveiled yesterday, the group will sell its
pharmaceutical and consumer health products unit Sterling Winthrop, its
personal care and household products business L&amp;F Products, and its Clinical
Diagnostics division. Between them, the three businesses generated almost a
quarter of Kodak's 1993 revenues of Dollars 16.4bn.
When the divestment is complete - and Mr Fisher would not be drawn on
whether the operations would be sold to another company or spun off in a
public share issue - Kodak will be reduced to two main components. These are
its imaging business, and its Health Sciences division, a unit which, with
its X-ray film and electronics-based medical, cardiology, and dental
diagnostic businesses, is regarded as a vital part of Kodak's imaging
strategy.
The first impact of the divestments will be to improve dramatically the
group's financial condition. Kodak is labouring under Dollars 7bn in debt,
and the proceeds from the sale of the healthcare operations could eliminate
the bulk of the group's debt at a single stroke.
Kodak paid Dollars 5.1bn for Sterling in 1988, but that purchase was
completed when US drug stocks were at their peak, so it is unlikely the unit
will sell for quite as much today.
The restructuring will also allow Kodak to concentrate on developing its
imaging business.
Most of Kodak's photographic earnings are derived from its traditional film
products, which uses a chemical process - the sensitivity to light from
silver halide salts. Yet this business is threatened by the rapidly growing
market for digital, electronic imaging.
Mr Fisher has taken steps to protect and develop Kodak's core business,
including the recent formation of a new unit to lead the group's involvement
in electronic imaging. Further, similar measures are likely soon; as Mr
Fisher said yesterday, the divestments will allow Kodak to 'attack a broader
array of imaging opportunities around the world.'
First, however, Kodak must dispose of its non-core businesses. The group
should have little trouble finding a buyer for Sterling Winthrop, given the
wave of merger activity in the pharmaceutical industry.
In fact, within hours of Kodak announcing its restructuring, the German
drugs group Bayer expressed an interest in acquiring Sterling.
Mr Fisher, however, said yesterday the French company Elf Sanofi, a partner
with Kodak in a worldwide drug sales venture, would get the first right of
refusal to buy part or all of Sterling.

purchasing pharmaceuticals businesses

<TEXT>
Elf Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals group, is interested in acquiring a
substantial part of Eastman Kodak's pharmaceuticals businesses, either on
its own or with partners, following the US group's announcement that it
would sell its healthcare activities.
The French group, a subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine, the recently privatised oil
group, already has a far-reaching alliance with Sterling Winthrop, the
pharmaceuticals arm of Kodak, which dates from 1991 and which is based on
the Elf Sanofi-Winthrop joint venture.
'Kodak's decision is a big opportunity for us to strengthen our
pharmaceuticals activities in a rapidly changing market,' said Mr
Jean-Francois Dehecq, Elf Sanofi chairman.
Elf sanofi said it was examining the possible acquisition of the businesses
in which it was already involved with Sterling, namely the US group's
prescription pharmaceuticals operations and its European over-the-counter
drugs businesses. It said it was not interested in Sterling's US OTC
operations, its household products or its diagnostic divisions.
Mr Dehecq said the acquisition could be done alone or with partners. 'There
are a number of possible partners,' he said, adding that Elf Sanofi was in a
strong position with respect to the sale of Kodak's pharmaceuticals
businesses because of its agreements with Sterling.
Mr Dehecq said it was too early to estimate the size of the possible deals,
but said Elf Sanofi would not need a capital increase. Instead, the company
raised the prospect of a sale of assets to help finance the operations.
'Given the size of the possible transaction, we have begun a strategic
review of business units in each of our three main activities,' the company
said, referring to its healthcare, beauty and bio-industry activities.
Industry observers said Elf Sanofi was a natural buyer for the bulk of
Kodak's pharmaceutical businesses because of their existing alliance.
Elf Sanofi and Sterling Winthrop have integrated their prescription drugs
and OTC products on a country-by-country basis. The French group controls
the European activities of the joint venture, with Sterling Winthrop
controlling operations in the US.
The stock market pushed Elf Sanofi shares down FFr43 to FFr975.

1.3bn share issue

<TEXT>
Falconbridge, the west's second-biggest nickel producer, plans to go public
again with a CDollars 1.3bn (USDollars 940m) share offer.
Pricing will be set around mid-June. The offer is being made in Canada and
by private placement internationally, said Mr Lars Eric Johannson, senior
vice-president. Proceeds will help to pay off Falconbridge's CDollars 1.8bn
debt.
Canada's Noranda and Trelleborg of Sweden each acquired 50 per cent of
Falconbridge five years ago for CDollars 2.2bn.
After the offer, Noranda's equity holding will be about 45 per cent. But
Trelleborg will not participate and its interest will drop to 30 per cent.
The public will hold about 25 per cent.
Falconbridge's main operations are the nickel mines at Sudbury, Ontario,
where new deep reserves have been found, the Kidd Creek copper-zinc mine in
northern Ontario, a nickel refinery in Norway and nickel mines in the
Dominican Republic. It also owns one-third of the CDollars 1bn Collahuasi
project in Chile.
Many analysts believe base metals prices are due for recovery with improving
world economic growth.
The underwriting group is led by Wood Gundy, Burns Fry, Gordon Capital and
RBC Dominion Securities.

FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Freeport-McMoRan to separate
units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Freeport-McMoRan, the New Orleans-based natural resources company, will
split its two principal businesses, copper and gold mining and agricultural
minerals, into two independent financial entities which will be distributed
in a complicated transaction to existing shareholders.
Shares of the two new companies are expected to be more valuable than when
they were combined as Freeport subsidiaries. The two businesses are quite
distinct, and their fortunes often move in opposite directions.
Mr Clarence Morrison, analyst with Prudential Securities, said the split
would offer investors a clearer play in either copper mining or fertilisers.
Mr James Moffett, Freeport-McMoRan chairman, said the proposed restructuring
would benefit the companies and their securities holders by improving access
to the credit markets, reducing debt service costs and eliminating possible
liability cross-overs between the two companies.
Freeport's earnings have been recovering, partly because copper and gold
output in Indonesian operations rose in the first quarter, and because the
company has insulated itself from copper price volatility using
derivatives-based price protection.
On the agricultural side, Freeport is in a joint venture with IMC-Agrico
that is expected to produce cost savings of Dollars 95m by the end of its
second full year. During the first quarter Freeport had net earnings of
Dollars 12.3m, or 9 cents a share. Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold had
operating earnings of Dollars 53m, and Freeport Resources Partners, the
agricultural division, had operating earnings of Dollars 21.1m.
The restructuring, which one Wall Street analyst called a 'fair
transaction', will have the effect of converting much of the company's debt
into equity without any share dilution. Freeport will distribute to its
existing shareholders all of its interest in Freeport-McMoRan Copper and
Gold in a transaction it hopes will be tax-free. The deal is contingent on a
favourable ruling by tax authorities, debt restructuring and shareholder
approval.
After the distribution, Freeport-McMoRan's business will consist solely of
its 51 per cent interest in Freeport-McMoRan Resources Partners, a company
which specialises in fertilisers and agricultural minerals.
As part of the deal, Freeport said it would begin to distribute
Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold shares to shareholders in lieu of
first-quarter dividends at a rate of one Copper and Gold share for each 80
Freeport-McMoRan shares.

<TEXT>
OMV, the Austrian oil, gas and chemicals group, yesterday reported record
losses for 1993 but a move back to profit in the first quarter of this year.
It said losses for last year totalled Sch4.43bn (Dollars 369m), against
Sch604.6m in 1992, on turnover of Sch81.93bn, down about 1 per cent. Losses
on ordinary activity were Sch924m, compared with Sch264.5m in 1992. But an
extraordinary loss of Sch3.49bn, to cover restructuring, inflated the
deficit. There will be no dividend for 1993.
Positive developments in the gas and trading branches, and in refining in
the second half of the year, could not compensate for losses in the
chemicals and plastics branches, Mr Richard Schenz, chairman, said.
The group has gone through a restructuring with plant closures and
cost-cutting. More than 900 jobs were cut leaving the group workforce at
11,743 at the end of 1993.
Gas and trading generated operating profits of Sch1.44bn and Sch160m
respectively, with all other activities showing a loss. The biggest deficit
was in the plastics division with an operating loss of Sch1.2bn.
The group made a Sch190m pre-tax profit for the first quarter of this year,
reflecting mainly the positive effect of restructuring over the past two
years, Mr Schenz said.

Den norske Bank, Norway's largest bank, moved back into the black with a net
profit with NKr586m (Dollars 79.2m) for the 1994 first quarter, from a loss
of NKr138m a year ago.
The turnround was helped by reduced losses on loans and guarantees and came
in spite of lower non-interest income.
Mr Finn Hvistendahl, group managing director, said the improved performance
continued a trend which began last year. Net interest income rose slightly
to NKr1.27bn from NKr1.23bn, helped by 'comfortable' margins in the face of
strong competition.
However, gross interest income was reduced by NKr1.44bn to NKr2.97bn as
interest expenses were cut by NKr1.48bn to NKr1.7bn. Non-interest income
fell by NKr296m to NKr662m with currency and securities gains falling to
NKr65m from NKr120m.
DnB explained that unrealised gains on shares amounted to NKr392m at end
March and that an increase in interest rates had led to a loss on bonds,
partly offset by an increase in value of other financial instruments used to
hedge interest rate risk.
Group operating profit, before losses on loans and guarantees, fell to
NKr780m from NKr1.06bn. Losses on loans and guarantees were cut to NKr180m
from NKr1.17bn.
DnB said there had been some strong recoveries, particularly where the
improvement in the Norwegian economy had a positive impact on customers'
ability to meet payments and on the value of the bank's collateral.
The volume of non-performing loans was NKr8.9bn, a reduction of NKr1.3bn
since the end of 1993. DnB said the volume of new non-performing loans
registered in the period was moderate while several previous non-performers
had been reinstated as performing assets.
'The quality of the bank's loan portfolio was enhanced during the first
quarter,' said Mr Hvistendahl.

Sydbank is to acquire Aktivbanken and become Denmark's sixth-largest bank
with assets of about DKr50bn (Dollars 7.5bn).
The takeover has solved a problem for Topdanmark, the insurance group, which
bought Aktivbanken in 1989 for DKr1.4bn. Since then Aktivbanken has run up
losses totalling DKr581m.
Topdanmark's involvement with Aktivbanken were factors in the resignation
last month of Mr Henning Birch, Topdanmark's chief executive, and Mr Oluf
von Lowzow, supervisory board chairman.
After the deal, Topdanmark will own 22.6 per cent of the shares in Sydbank
and Top's life assurance and accident policies will be sold through
Sydbank's branches.
Sydbank will pay krone for krone for Aktivbanken's net assets with an issue
of shares with a market value of about DKr410m. Sydbank will make an
underwritten issue of shares with a minimum price of DKr210 per share.
Following the share issues, Sydbank's capital adequacy ratio would be about
12 per cent, Topdanmark said.
Mr Carsten Andersen, Sydbank chief executive, said cost savings, equal to at
least 12 per cent of the combined costs of the two banks would be made.

FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Capital gains help Stora return
to first-term profit

Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, made a strong return to profit
in the first quarter after benefiting from increased demand, cost-cutting
and big capital gains.
The Swedish group swung to a SKr1.07bn (Dollars 135m) profit after financial
items from a SKr78m loss a year earlier.
Excluding one-off items, profit amounted to SKr430m compared with a SKr93m
deficit in 1992.
Mr Lars-Ake Helgesson, Stora president, said the market was recovering after
three years of over-capacity and falling prices.
He was particularly encouraged by evidence of faster-than-expected economic
recovery in Europe, the company's main market.
Group volume was 2.7 per cent higher than a year ago at 1.66m tonnes, but
prices were generally lower than in 1993.
'Increases in pulp prices have brought price rises in most paper and board
product areas, but with only a limited affect on earnings to date,' said Mr
Helgesson.
Disposals meant group sales fell to SKr11.46bn from SKr12.58bn. For
comparable units, sales were SKr425m higher reflecting the volume growth and
currency movements.
Operating profit improved strongly to SKr1.39bn from SKr358m.
A restructuring programme which has lowered costs by SKr4.5bn during the
recession was one reason for the upturn, but the main impact came from
SKr641m in capital gains.
The company said all units improved operating performance. Stora Feldmuhle
lifted profits to SKr127m from SKr47m, while Stora Billerud rose to SKr275m
from SKr191m.
The only area to record a worse performance was technical office papers,
where losses deepened to SKr17m from SKr9m. Profits from printing papers
climbed to SKr179m from SKr118m, and from board and packaging paper to
SKr303m from SKr228m. Pulp made a SKr10m profit, turning round a SKr38m
loss.
Financial expenses fell to SKr322m from SKr436m, reflecting lower interest
rates and reduced debt.

FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: DSM lifted by jump in sales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A jump in sales allowed DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, to report a near
14-fold increase in net profit in the first quarter compared with the same,
severely depressed period of 1993.
Net profit rose to Fl 83m (Dollars 43m) from Fl 6m a year earlier, on
turnover up 5 per cent at Fl 2.2bn. Sales by volume were up a strong 9 per
cent, reflecting greater demand for plastics and caprolactum, a raw material
used to make nylon.
DSM said part of the sales rise may have been due to non-recurring factors,
such as extra stockpiling by industrial customers and by a drop in exports
from competitors in central and eastern Europe.
Another factor behind the profit rise was a further decrease in fixed costs.
The workforce stood at 19,774 people at the end of the first quarter, an 11
per cent decline from the same period of 1993.
The economy in Europe, DSM's main market, showed signs of a hesitant
recovery in the first quarter, with some growth reported by European car
makers, an important customer group for the company.
The company said it expected business in the current quarter to be similar
to the first three months of the year. But DSM cautioned that results would
be influenced by maintenance shutdowns in the second quarter. It declined to
make a forecast for full-year results.
Mr Simon de Bree, chairman, said the results, which were above analysts'
predictions, were encouraging but noted the recovery was frail, and selling
prices were still low.
DSM's shares rallied strongly on the first-quarter results, closing up Fl
4.70, or 3.3 per cent, at Fl 145.00.

FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Marzotto falls 74% to L10.2bn

<TEXT>
A slump in demand on the world clothing market has hit 1993 profits at
Marzotto, one of Italy's largest clothing and textile groups.
The company, which controls Hugo Boss, Germany's biggest menswear designer,
yesterday reported a 74 per cent decline in net earnings to L10.2bn (Dollars
6m), against L39.8bn in 1992. Net earnings in 1991 were L40.1bn.
Sales were little changed at L1,953bn, against L1,955bn, of which
three-quarters came from the European Union.
The parent company announced a net profit of L4.4bn, compared with the 1992
loss of L44.7bn, which was struck only after some L70bn of extraordinary
provisions. Sales of the parent company fell 8.3 per cent to L956bn, and
operating profits were cut to L25.9bn from L55.2bn.
Marzotto's caution was reflected in its decision to recommend a cut in
dividends, to L150 per ordinary share from L280.
However, the group said orders were up in the first quarter of 1994, both in
Italy and in overseas markets. The end-March order book was worth L774bn,
nearly 20 per cent higher than at the same time last year.
Sales at the same date had reached L591bn, down 2 per cent on the first
quarter of 1992.
The company explained that it was in Italy - particularly in the market for
classic men's clothing - that Marzotto felt the pinch last year.
The group said the downturn had offset growth in net profits from its
textile manufacturing subsidiaries, and its holdings in Hugo Boss, and
Linificio, a thread manufacturer.
Marzotto owns nearly 64 per cent of the voting stock of Hugo Boss, which
last month announced 1993 profits 73 per cent higher at DM76.5m (Dollars
44.5m).

<TEXT>
Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank, one of Germany's two big
Bavaria-based banks, is planning a one-for-10 rights issue. The terms will
be fixed around June 20 and the issue of 2.3m new shares is likely to raise
about DM1bn (Dollars 588m).
The bank, which recently reported a 33 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for
last year, said it needed the money in the context of strong business growth
last year and in the early months of the current year.
In the first two months of the year, Hypo-Bank's group operating profits
rose by 17 per cent, reflecting the bank's strong position in the buoyant
mortgage lending market.
The issue is the fourth from a leading German bank in the past six months.
The most recent was Dresdner Bank's innovative DM1.2bn equity placing with
international investors, details of which were announced last month. Of
Germany's biggest five banks, only Deutsche Bank, the largest, has said it
will not tap the equity market for the time being.

FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: RWE expects to increase dividend
</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RWE, the industrial conglo-merate built around Germany's largest electricity
generator, expects to pay a higher dividend this year, in spite of heavier
losses in its waste disposal division.
Mr Friedhelm Gieske, chief executive, forecast a profit for the year ending
June, comparable to last year's DM881m (Dollars 512m) - but promised a
higher dividend on the basis of more favourable tax allowances.
Both the oil and chemicals division, and RWE Energie, the electricity
generator, will make bigger contributions to the outcome, with the buoyant
construction division maintaining its position.
Two US investments - the Consol mining group, hit by a seven-month strike,
and NuKEM, its waste disposal operation - are the main loss-makers in the
group so far this year, Mr Gieske said.
On the other hand, improved results in east Germany, with rising petrol
sales for RWE-DEA and expanding construction activity, helped two important
arms of the company to better results.
The mining and raw materials division, centred on Rheinbraun, Germany's
biggest producer of brown coal for power generation, saw a drop in turnover
of 13.6 per cent, without taking acquisitions into account.
Mr Gieske said the losses at Consol reached Dollars 42m as a result of the
miners' strike, leaving RWE to carry its DM36m share of that amount.
However, he promised much more favourable prospects for the US interest in
1994, with Consol strengthening its position in the low-sulphur coal market
with the purchase of Island Creek.
Waste disposal, an area into which RWE has expanded rapidly in recent years,
saw operating losses of Dollars 96m at NuKEM, where a big restructuring
programme has been carried out.
Mr Gieske said the entire amount had been provided for in the company
accounts up to December 31.
Overall group turnover increased by 3.4 per cent up to the end of March,
although the growth excluding acquisitions was only 0.9 per cent.
Electricity consumption stabilised at a growth rate of 0.3 per cent, after
18 months of decline in line with the German recession. However, RWE Energie
was the main beneficiary from improved depreciation allowances introduced by
the German government to increase corporate competitiveness.
In particular, RWE has been able to write off a large portion of the cost of
its big environmental programme to reduce emissions from power stations.

As promised in its prospectus, Premium Underwriting issued a progress report
yesterday showing pre-tax losses at Pounds 32,442 for the initial period to

The prospectus statement expected costs to exceed income until 1997 when
Lloyd's results for 1994 were declared and paid.
Although it was too early to make predictions of the underwriting results
for 1994, the directors believed the year had 'started satisfactorily'.

The single dividend is lifted from 0.5p to 1.25p.
Orders anticipated in the last quarter failed to materialise and this was
expected to affect operations during the opening half of 1994.
However, those orders had now been received and with a good order book at
good margins directors expected the second half performance to be

Nevertheless, the shares closed 8p lower at 66p.

FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Elswick focuses on core areas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Elswick reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.48m in a year of increasing
focus on its core areas of specialised print and packaging and
agrochemicals.
The outcome for the 12 months to end-January, struck after a restatement of
Pounds 5.59m of goodwill written off in prior years, came from turnover up
by Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 54.2m and compared with a profit of Pounds 1.91m.
The restatement of goodwill arose on the disposal of Bomford Turner, sold
for Pounds 7.7m last November, which helped to eliminate net borrowings.
At the operating level, profits rose by 23 per cent from Pounds 2.88m to
Pounds 3.55m, of which Pounds 1.35m came from discontinued operations.
An exceptional provision of Pounds 400,000 was made at the year end in
connection with surplus leasehold properties, compared with a Pounds 248,000
gain last time.
Interest charges were cut from Pounds 971,000 to Pounds 536,000.
Losses per share emerged at 1.14p (0.78p earnings) and a final dividend of
0.18p is proposed, making 0.33p (0.3p) for the year.

FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Reds launch an attack on off-field
operations - Manchester United's non-football activities have a growing
importance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On May 8, more than 44,000 of the faithful will file into Old Trafford to
watch one of Britain's more successful small companies at work.
When Manchester United takes the field for its last home game of the season,
all minds will be concentrated on football, its core business.
But for the directors watching that afternoon's clash with Coventry City,
the Reds represent much more than a talented squad dominated by Eric
Cantona, Ryan Giggs and Andrei Kanchelskis.
It has become a multi-layered business in which turnover from gate receipts
has been outstripped by secondary income from merchandising, television,
sponsorship, the conference business and catering.
Underlining their growing importance to the club, these non-footballing
activities helped lift first-half profits by 65 per cent to Pounds 7.6m.
Together they contributed more than Pounds 12m to turnover which rose 75 per
cent to Pounds 22.8m in the six months to January 31.
While the fans savour the prospects of the double - adding the FA Cup on May
14 to the Premiership won earlier this week - the board has turned its mind
increasingly to off-field activities which, it believes, could safeguard the
company's finances should the team be hit by a run of poor form, injuries
and failure to succeed in cup competitions.
That risk is minimised primarily by season ticket sales, which swell the
club's coffers in the July before each season. Following the completion of
the Pounds 10.3m Stretford End stand, boasting 49 boxes and 864 club class
seats, the portion of advance sales has increased sharply and helped lift
average turnover for each home game from Pounds 580,000 to Pounds 767,000.
Non-season ticket receipts, meanwhile, have been matched by sales from other
sources such as catering, programmes and merchandise.
Mr Robin Launders, finance director, believes the growth of non-core
activities, including financial services, sets Manchester United apart from
almost every other football club.
Their year-round contribution offsets the seasonal aspect of the footballing
business and generates profits long after the players have hung up their
boots.
All this enables the board to estimate, conservatively, what the company
will earn each season. It can calculate receipts from the guaranteed number
of home games, likely television distribution revenue, and profits on
sponsorship, royalties and merchandise.
It allows Manchester United - one of three quoted clubs  - to set aside a
portion of after-tax earnings for its transfer fee reserve - essentially a
pot of distributable cash for buying and selling players.
'We always budget for the worst scenario: that we are hovering near the
relegation zone and have failed in the cup competitions,' says Mr Launders.
'It's then that we would fall back on the transfer fee reserve to rebuild
the team.'
Profit from cup competitions can, therefore, be treated as exceptional gains
which can be used to top up the reserve and increase the club's ability to
buy new players.
The size of those profits will be substantially boosted next season by
inclusion in the European Cup competition - the Continent's premier
championship.
Seeded along with the likes of AC Milan and Ajax, Italian and Dutch
champions respectively, the club will accrue the benefit from three home
ties in the league stage, along with about Pounds 500,000 from UEFA. A
reasonable run in the competition could bring in about Pounds 2m.
Mr Launders regards the prospect as a virtuous circle, which will prompt
increased demand for season tickets and non-core products such as videos,
souvenirs and even financial services.
'If we can play football in an attractive way which wins competitions it is
a boon.
'We already have a guaranteed income, but if we can persuade more people to
support us it creates spin-off benefits for our other businesses.'
So far this year, success on the field and lucrative sideline businesses
have left the club with a transfer fee reserve increased from Pounds 2.25m
to Pounds 3.25m.
It has also generated Pounds 5.9m net cash which, true to his conservative
financial principles, Mr Launders has invested mostly in gilt-edged stock.
He says such investments not only give the club fixed interest rates, but
48-hour access to funds should it need a large sum to buy a player.
More importantly, it gives Manchester United financial stability in a
notoriously uncertain industry.
'We're in a unique position compared with most clubs,' he says. 'New
businesses like wholesaling have brought in more revenue and we don't need
to borrow to buy new assets.
'It shows we are still a football team but we're prepared to seize every
financial opportunity which comes out of that.'

FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BTR spins off Dartington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crystal gazing - Mr Eric Dancer (left), managing director of Dartington
Crystal, and Mr Russ Cummings of 3i, reflect on the future of the giftware
and tableware producer which has been purchased by its management from BTR
in a Pounds 10m deal, writes Peter Franklin.
Under the terms of the transaction, which is backed by 3i, the venture
capital group, BTR's Rockware Group received Pounds 4.71m for the sale of
its 95 per cent holding as well as repayment of Pounds 3.25m in loans.
The Dartington Hall Trust, which founded the company in 1967 to create
employment in north Devon, has also sold its 5 per cent holding.
In addition, Dartington Crystal will receive Pounds 2m from the deal to fund
future growth plans.
Mr Cummings said that his company had led, structured and underwritten the
transaction, while Bank of Scotland was providing debt and working capital.

4.5m.
Last year the group made an operating profit of Pounds 2.28m on turnover of
Pounds 21.4m.
Impact day is on May 17. The placing is expected to value the group at about
Pounds 50m and raise Pounds 17m, most of which will be used to clear debts
of about Pounds 10m.
Nightfreight specialises in industrial and just-in-time markets. It is the
distributor for The Independent newspaper.

FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: ASH makes Pounds 300,000 pension
contribution
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Automated Security (Holdings), the international electronic security systems
company, made an extra Pounds 300,000 pension contribution on behalf of Mr
Tom Buffett, its chairman and chief executive, in the year to November 30,
the annual report revealed.
The 1993 contribution totalled Pounds 338,000, against Pounds 33,000 the
previous year. The company said that the Pounds 300,000 contribution was
made 'in respect of a cumulative shortfall in contributions to his pension
fund', though the report did not specify over how many years Mr Buffett's
contributions had been falling short.
The report also revealed that while Mr Buffett's salary remained flat, his
total remuneration grew 12 per cent to Pounds 334,000 (Pounds 297,000)
thanks to the inclusion of a Pounds 38,300 performance-related payment.
Mr Clive Campion, the finance director who resigned in January 1993, was
paid Pounds 222,000 on the termination of his contract.
At the beginning of October, ASH issued a profits warning, which sent the
shares spiralling 23 per cent to 102p.

</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lafarge Coppee, the French building materials group, yesterday announced
that it is to sell its majority holding in Orsan, a food additives producer,
to Amylum of Belgium, a subsidiary of Tate and Lyle, for FFr414m.
The sale is part of Lafarge Coppee's strategy of withdrawing from the
bio-technology sector and effectively marks the end of this area of
diversification. It will also reduce Lafarge Coppe's borrowings by about
FFr1bn, following the transfer of debts to the Belgian company.
Orsan is involved in the manufacture of amino acids from starch and the
production of monosodium glutamate from molasses. It has an industrial
alliance with Ajinomoto of Japan, which holds 20 per cent of Orsan's shares.
Under the terms of the deal, Lafarge Coppee's Copabio division is to sell
its 61 per cent holding for FFr210 per share. This compares with a price of
FFr237 per share when Orsan was suspended on Monday.

FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Budget fears dampen Silentnight sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The change to a November Budget hindered recovery in the UK furniture
market, according to Silentnight Holdings, Europe's biggest manufacturer of
beds.
The Lancashire-based group said retailers found that the run-up to the
chancellor's package in November created financial uncertainty during what
had historically been its main selling season, before Christmas.
It added: 'The announcement of tax increases to take effect in April
undoubtedly hit consumer confidence and had a dampening effect on sales.'
Silentnight, which issued a profits warning in March, yesterday reported a 3
per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 12.4m in the year to January
29. Sales rose by 9 per cent to Pounds 167m.
Mr Bill Davies, executive chairman, said: 'There have been few tangible
signs yet of an improvement in the UK furniture market.'
He added that the sale of big-ticket price items was very sensitive to
changes in consumer sentiment, particularly in the middle to lower end of
the market, although the top end was more stable.
The group's UK beds business experienced significant margin pressure and
profits declined, although sales rose by 2 per cent to Pounds 101m.
Mr Davies said the production of Silentnight beds was being concentrated in
one factory, with the existing plant at Sutton being closed. This would
involve the loss of about 70 jobs at a cost of Pounds 750,000, which would
fall in the current year.
Sales in the UK cabinets business rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 43m and
profits also increased. Silentnight continued to invest about half its
capital expenditure of Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 8.8m) in the cabinets business,
which increased its estimated share of the UK market from 5 per cent to 6
per cent. The group's share of the UK bed market was stable at 32 per cent.
The group said overseas businesses had continued to improve. Its German
manufacturer of beds and mattresses, bought in 1992, contributed sales of
Pounds 12.5m and continued to provide a good return. The previously
lossmaking US subsidiary was now breaking even.
Earnings rose to 17.62p (17.14p). A 0.5p cut in the final dividend to 5.25p
maintains the total at 8p. Mr Davies said this was intended to restore the
one-to-two balance between interim and final payments, reflecting the
group's strong seasonal bias to the second half.
COMMENT
While accepting the Budget posed a particular problem last year, analysts
were surprised the group gave such a downbeat view on the trading outlook.
One asked whether the continuing pressure on margins meant the strategy of
having several brands in the mature market for beds was fundamentally
flawed. Whether or not it signals any more rationalisation, the combining of
the Silentnight plants will hit first-half profits. There is also irritation
that the group will not identify the profits contribution from cabinets, in
which it has been investing heavily. Forecast pre-tax profits put the
shares, unchanged yesterday at 304p, on a prospective multiple of 16.1 - a 5
per cent premium to the market, which looks high enough.

FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Thos Cook expands by 25% to Pounds 31.6m

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thomas Cook, the travel and financial services group which is owned by
Westdeutsche Landesbank, increased pre-tax profit by 25 per cent to Pounds
31.6m in 1993, writes Michael Skapinker.
The increase came in spite of the continental European recession, companies
cutting business travel costs, and low interest rates which depressed
travellers' cheque earnings.
Revenues rose 22 per cent to Pounds 595.6m.
Mr Christopher Rodrigues, chief executive, said leisure travel proved
resilient in most markets. He said holidays were 'now considered an
essential, not a luxury, for people throughout the developed world'.
Mr Rodrigues added that business travel, by contrast, was going through a
big change as companies sought ways of reducing costs.
There was evidence of increased demand for business travel as companies come
out of recession, but this, he said, remained a highly competitive market.

FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Murray Johnstone launches smaller companies
trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Murray Johnstone is seeking up to Pounds 60m with the launch of Murray
Acorn, an investment trust concentrating on the smallest end of the smaller
company range.
The trust will invest in companies with a market capitalisation of Pounds
50m or less, and principally those of less than Pounds 30m. Up to 10 per
cent of the fund may be invested in unquoted companies, mainly those in a
pre-listing phase. Special situations, such as management buy-ins or
refinancings, may account for up to 30 per cent.
Shares will be issued at 100p on a partly-paid basis, with 50p due when the
public offer closes on June 16, and the balance due on November 30. This is
to allow a more gradual investment of the fund in what can be an illiquid
market.
There are several smaller-company investment trusts listed in London, but
most invest in much larger companies than Murray Acorn's planned targets,
often having market capitalisations of up to Pounds 300m. However, two
relatively new trusts, Pilot and Eaglet, have similarly low-cap limits.
Murray Acorn will be aiming mainly for capital growth rather than income,
and will take the Extended Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index (excluding
investment trusts) as a benchmark.
Shirescot, the Shires High-Yielding Smaller Companies Trust, managed by
Glasgow Investment Managers, is hoping to expand by up to Pounds 25m with a
placing and offer for subscription of conversion shares. The shares will be
issued at 100p and on conversion, which will take place by October 14 at the
latest, warrants will be attached on a 1-for-5 basis. The public offer is
due to open on May 16, closing on June 7. First dealings are expected on
June 15.

FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Substantial increase to ADollars 76m at ICI
Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ICI Australia, the quoted Australian company in which Imperial Chemical
Industries holds a majority interest, reported a sharp increase to ADollars
76.4m (Pounds 36.7m) in profits after tax for the six months to end-March.
The outcome compared with ADollars 48.4m last time, struck before abnormal
items of ADollars 10.6m. There were no abnormal charges in the latest set of
figures.
ICI attributed the upturn to a 7 per cent volume increase, control of costs
and a reduction in interest charges, down from ADollars 19m to ADollars
13.9m.
In divisional terms, the chemicals business saw trading profits little
changed at ADollars 49m (ADollars 50m), with demand healthy but caustic soda
prices depressed.
The plastics division incurred a reduced loss of ADollars 6m (ADollars 12m)
as it continued to struggle against low world prices.
Trading profits from fertilisers and crop-care rose from ADollars 8m to
ADollars 15m, while the consumer and effect products division contributed
ADollars 76m (ADollars 55m).
ICI added that 'while prices generally seem likely to remain low and
competition keen, result for the full year should satisfactorily exceed 1993
if the improved business climate is maintained'.
The interim dividend goes up from 7 cents to 11 cents.
The company also revealed that a decision is likely to be reached this week
on whether to proceed with the construction of a ADollars 200m-plus ethane
pipeline, linking South Australia's Cooper Basin with ICI's ethylene plant
at Botany Bay.
ICI said that negotiations over terms for the supply from the South
Australian gasfields were at a critical stage and that the timing
necessitated a decision this week, although an announcement might not be
made immediately.

<TEXT>
Compass Group, the catering and healthcare company that last week announced
plans to buy Canteen Corporation, the third largest US caterer for Dollars
450m (Pounds 308m), yesterday switched its attention to France.
It is acquiring, through Scandinavian Service Partner, its European airport
catering arm, the airport restaurant division of Saresco for Pounds 10.7m
cash.
The business's main contract is with Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris,
although it also operates at Strasbourg and Toulon.
It has 28 restaurants and bars and made pre-tax profits last year of FFr3m
(Pounds 350,000) on turnover of FFr127m.
Assets were about Pounds 4.5m at the year end, including net cash of Pounds
2m.
Mr Fritz Ternofsky, chief executive of Compass's European catering
operations, described the acquisition as an 'ideal first step for the group
in France'.
Compass surprised the City with its US acquisition plans last week. Mr
Francis Mackay, chief executive, said the group would continue to expand
organically in Europe.

Everyone Wants chain.
B&amp;J shareholders are scheduled to vote at an EGM next Monday on the plan for
Mr Gerald and Mrs Vera Weisfeld to inject Pounds 6m to meet the lossmaking
group's immediate working capital needs, in return for a 19 per cent stake
and two seats on the board.
A Pepkor director said in Johannesburg: 'We certainly are negotiating but
discussions are at a very sensitive stage and we cannot yet confirm that we
are making a bid for the company.'
Neither Mr Christo Wiese, Pepkor's executive chairman, nor Mr CE Moore, the
group's finance director, were in South Africa on Monday - even though that
was the day of Pepkor's annual results. Both are currently believed to be in
England.
B&amp;J, which owns the Poundstretcher chain and had been in talks with its
bankers, said last night: 'We will not comment on market rumours. Ever since
our problems began, a number of people have been in touch. The only people
to put a deal on the table are the Weisfelds - and we are pleased with that
and them.'
Pepkor is Africa's largest mass-market retailer.
The group's core business, PEP, retails goods to a predominantly black
customer base.
Its international presence has been hitherto restricted to Scotland but it
has been on the lookout for further international acquisitions.
B&amp;J's shares were unchanged at 5 1/4 p yesterday.

FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Powell Duffryn unwinds Spanish joint
venture
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Powell Duffryn and its partner CEPSA have sold Proquimica, their joint
chemical storage business venture in Barcelona, Spain, to Terminales
Portuarias for Pta2.09bn (about Pounds 10m).
The sale follows CEPSA's strategic decision not to maintain an investment in
chemical storage facilities in the future.
The company, which also owns bulk storage facilities in the UK, US,
Australia and South Africa, intends to reinvest the proceeds in upgrading
and extending the range of services offered through its other storage
activities.
Mr Bill Andrews, Powell's chief executive, said that CEPSA's decision to
withdraw 'led us to conclude that our bulk liquid storage activities would
be better served by redeploying resources to our other terminal locations,
rather than increasing our investment in Barcelona'.

FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Laura Ashley sells Dollars 27m US stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US subsidiary of Laura Ashley, the clothing and furnishings retailer and
manufacturer, is selling its 44.4 per cent holding in Revman Industries, the
North American bed linen designer, manufacturer and wholesaler.
Laura Ashley will receive Dollars 27.1m (Pounds 18m), comprising Dollars 19m
in cash plus the redemption at par value of preferred stock which amounts to
Dollars 8.05m cash.
The directors stated that the company would also receive accrued dividends
on the preferred stock.
The purchaser is Aeon Group, the Japanese store concern, which holds 15 per
cent of Laura Ashley and is its joint venture partner in Japan.
Mr Andrew Higginson, Laura Ashley's finance director, said the disposal was
part of the group's policy of returning to its core business.
The proceeds could help accelerate capital expenditure plans, including
doubling the number of European stores to 120.
The improvement at the lossmaking US subsidiary was continuing, he said.
Revman would continue to sell Laura Ashley bed linen, the best selling brand
in the US, under licence.
Last year Laura Ashley's share of Revman's profits came to more than Pounds
2m.

FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Institutional unease over Lasmo bid terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in rival explorers Enterprise Oil and Lasmo were yesterday
expressing unease over the terms and structure of Enterprise's hostile
Pounds 1.5bn offer.
Some of the largest institutional stakeholders say they are not yet
convinced by Enterprise's arguments that it needs to reach a 'critical mass'
in order to increase the return to both companies' shareholders in a climate
of low oil prices.
'Enterprise would have to put together a more compelling argument for
merging the two businesses,' said one institutional investor in both
companies.
Enterprise yesterday posted its offer documents to Lasmo shareholders,
prompting Mr Rudolph Agnew, Lasmo chairman, to charge that the bid 'smacks
of desperation and the pursuit of size for its own sake'.
Shareholders' main concerns appear to be the valuation placed on Lasmo,
which so far excludes a cash alternative, the unusual equity structure and
the timing of the bid. The offer of 27 Enterprise A shares and 12 warrants
for every 80 Lasmo shares, in effect creates a new class of shareholder with
limited dividend rights.
One Enterprise shareholder said the equity structure prompted fears that the
company was seeking to offset risk which it was not prepared to take. It
'raises suspicions that there may be something they might be worried about,'
the investor said.
Another institution suggested the paper offer may have overvalued Lasmo's
assets. Enterprise says a cash element, either through a cash sweetener or
underwriting arrangements, could be contemplated. But executives are
concerned it would weaken its argument that the proposed financing
arrangement gives Enterprise maximum flexibility to develop the combined
assets of the two companies.
Mr Andrew Shilston, Enterprise finance director, said yesterday that a cash
bid 'forces you to run the assets for cash, and therefore doesn't give you
scope to unlock all the value of the assets'.
Enterprise is expected to try to persuade shareholders that an independent
Lasmo will miss opportunities while it completes large development
programmes, such as Liverpool Bay. But Mr Joe Darby, Lasmo chief executive,
yesterday said 'he wouldn't be too happy' spending much more than the Pounds
50m a year on exploration and assessment given the uncertainty over prices.

FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Govett Oriental assets rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Surging Pacific stock markets during 1993 led to a 52 per cent rise in net
asset value per share at Govett Oriental Investment Trust over the year to
March 31, writes Bethan Hutton.
The figure grew from 262.07p to 397.63p, but more than half of that rise was
achieved by the interim stage. Falls in most Asian markets since the start
of 1994 have limited second half growth.
Available revenue was Pounds 2.34m (Pounds 2.54m), for consolidated earnings
of 1.3p (1.41p) per share. A proposed final dividend of 0.75p makes a 1.15p
(0.95p) total.
As at end-March, 31.8 per cent of the trust's assets were in Japan, compared
to 25 per cent six months earlier.

FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Uncertainty is the only certainty - Heron
bondholders meet again on interest deferral
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only one thing is certain when Heron International's bondholders meet again
this morning to vote on a deferral of bond interest. This time there will be
a quorum.
When they first met, on March 31, holders of only 35 per cent of the bonds
voted. The quorum was 50 per cent. Today the quorum is only two bondholders.
The conclusion of the votes, though, is by no means sure. A yes vote would
mean that the interest payment, which was due on March 31, would be deferred
to June 30. But there is a strong chance that bondholders will vote no.
However, a no vote has become almost irrelevant to Heron. Events at Mr
Gerald Ronson's property and trading group have moved on since it originally
warned bondholders in March of a 'significant potential for cross defaults'
if they did not vote in favour of the deferral.
After the March 31 meeting Heron was technically in default on the bonds.
But investors did not require the trustee to take action for early payment
of the bonds and the Heron empire did not collapse.
Instead, Heron is embroiled in another full scale restructuring of its
balance sheet, only months after the completion, last September, of a
refinancing of its then Pounds 1.4bn of debts, which included a swap of some
bank debt into equity, and the replacement of other bank debt and existing
bonds with new bonds.
Inevitably, the second restructuring must bring more equity into the group.
Mr Basil Vasiliou, who chairs Vasiliou &amp; Company, a New York debt trader
which, with other Wall Street houses, reckons to speak for about 20 per cent
of the senior bondholders, argues that 'the solution is very apparent'.
He advocates swapping all Heron's remaining debt into equity, and then
arranging a listing for the shares which would provide liquidity for lenders
seeking a cash exit.
However, bank lenders are unlikely to find that an attractive route. Many
banks still have both a philosophical and a balance sheet problem with
taking equity, even though in Heron's case senior bank lenders have already
had 70 per cent of their debt exchanged for equity and can now see their
remaining senior debt trading at about 45p in the pound.
A listing could take some time to arrange, and might not be possible until
1996 or 1997, although some off-market transactions, for example allowing
banks to sell shares to institutions, could take place first.
A less attractive, but more likely solution, is that a bidder comes in to
buy all the group's debt and equity. Heron's preferred option seems to be
that a bidder would provide a cash exit for those lenders wanting to realise
and give others a continuing equity interest in the group.
A bid is likely to be worth substantially less than the 70p in the pound of
assets which Heron has to cover its Pounds 300m of senior debt, and nearer
the 45p where that debt is trading. But it would be more than the 30p or so
that a receiver might recoup.
As one interested party observes: 'Cash is always more persuasive than
equity in a bank's short-time horizon', and cash of 45p now might be more
attractive to banks than 70p in the medium term, and the possibility of even
more later.
UBS, Heron's adviser, is understood to have found good interest among a
range of potential bidders from venture capitalists to wealthy property
investors. Already some are said to be doing due diligence investigations
and Heron is believed to be confident that a firm offer will be available
for board consideration by the end of May.
That should enable proposals to be put to creditors by the end of June.
Whether or not the present management would be kept on by a new owner is
another matter, though many creditors, Mr Vasiliou included, are supportive
of Mr Ronson and his team.
With the prospect of a bid in view, a no vote at today's meeting would not
result in bondholders demanding action from the trustee.
Rather, bondholders are tempted to vote against the deferral as a protest at
the behaviour of one of Heron's groups of bank lenders.
These are the lenders to the Heron Corporation (HCP) subsidiary which are
seen to be obstructing the passing of Pounds 70m of cash in HCP to the 'head
office' company which would more than pay the bondholder's interest.
These lenders, of which about half are also lenders to the 'head office'
group, have a right to complete repayment of their loans before any cash is
'upstreamed' to the parent.
The 40 HCP lenders are enforcing this right, although HCP has assets
reckoned to be worth at least twice its debts, and the lenders have already
been repaid substantial amounts early. These include Pounds 150m paid last
November which was due in March this year, and a Pounds 67m payment last
week of Pounds 160m due next March.
While Heron's future should soon be secured, some doubt must remain while
groups of creditors with differing interests continue to fight in public.

FT  04 MAY 94 / India postpones VSNL Dollars 1bn issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian government yesterday postponed a planned Dollars 1bn (Pounds
663m) international equity issue by Videsh Sanchar Nigam (VSNL), the
state-controlled international telecommunications monopoly.
Fund managers balked at the high price set by the government in consultation
with the company and the global co-ordinators, Salomon Brothers of the US
and Britain's Kleinwort Benson.
The postponement is India's biggest setback in the international capital
markets since Indian issuers first raised funds in late 1992, after the
government's liberalisation programme permitted increased foreign trade and
investment. The decision could harm the prospects for future Indian issues
and will do little to help confidence in investing in emerging markets,
which have mostly fallen this year after rapid gains in 1993.
'This is really bad news for India,' said Mr Tony Singh, a stockbroker at
Cresvale, a London-based investment company. 'There were so many other
Euroissues from India which were hoping to ride on the back of VSNL's
success.'
When VSNL, which is 85 per cent government-owned, first considered the
international equity offering late last year, it considered raising Dollars
500m, which would still have been the biggest Indian international offering.
But the growing appetite of foreign fund managers for Indian stocks
persuaded the company and the government to increase the issue size to
Dollars 1bn. With the VSNL price rising on the BSE from Rs650 in early
November to a peak of Rs1,700 in January and February, the issuers fixed a
minimum issue price of Rs1,400.
But by the time the price was approved at a cabinet meeting in early April,
international markets had soured and were in a difficult state when the
company started its roadshow in Hong Kong in mid-April. Fund managers there,
and later, said with shares trading in Bombay around Rs1,300, Rs1,400 was
too high. There were talks over the weekend on proposals to cut the price to
between Rs1,100 and Rs1,200, to raise about Dollars 700m, but this would
have required cabinet approval.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Kodak to return to core with drug sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eastman Kodak, the struggling US photographic products group, plans to sell
its pharmaceutical and consumer healthcare divisions to concentrate on its
core imaging business.
Kodak's chairman, Mr George Fisher, said the divestment plan - which is
aimed at lightening the group's Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.7bn) debt, bolstering
its balance sheet and freeing funds to develop the core business - was
necessary because the group lacked the resources to meet the investment
requirements of all of its businesses.
The restructuring is Kodak's latest attempt to restore its flagging
fortunes. Mr Fisher became chairman last December after his predecessor, Mr
Kay Whitmore, resigned amid shareholder dissatisfaction with the group's
performance.
The three divisions up for sale - the drugs and consumer health products
unit Sterling Winthrop, the personal care and household products business,
L&amp;F Products, and the Clinical Diagnostics division - employ 18,500 people
and accounted for about Dollars 3.7bn of the group's Dollars 16.4bn revenues
last year.
Mr Fisher would not say whether the units would be sold or spun off in a
public offering. However, he said the group's partner in a worldwide drug
sales venture, the French company Elf Sanofi, would be given the right of
first refusal to buy parts of Sterling, which Kodak bought in 1988 for
Dollars 5.1bn. Yesterday Bayer, the German pharmaceuticals group, said it
was interested in buying Sterling.
Kodak said it was retaining its Health Sciences division because the unit
plays a pivotal role in its imaging strategy.
The group's shares climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to close at Dollars 46 1/8 .
Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, said it would consider
upgrading Kodak's debt rating in light of the divestment plan.
The plan continues Mr Fisher's strategy of devoting more resources to
Kodak's core imaging business. At the start of the year Kodak spun off its
chemicals division, and last month it formed a unit to spearhead its
involvement in the market for electronic imaging.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Northern Rock plans merger: Latest building society sector
shake-up expected today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The building societies sector is set to face a further shake-up as Northern
Rock, the UK's eleventh largest building society, is today expected to
announce plans to merge with another society.
Northern Rock has called a press conference for this morning to make a
statement about its future. The society would not comment yesterday on what
its plans were.
The announcement comes less than two weeks after Lloyds Bank offered Pounds
1.8bn for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the UK's sixth largest society. This
offer sparked expectations of a restructuring of the financial services
industry, and sharpened the interests of banks and other organisations in
acquiring societies.
However, in the wake of the Lloyds/C&amp;G deal, Mr Chris Sharp, Northern Rock
managing director, re-emphasised his commitment to mutuality.
Northern Rock is an ambitious society, which has made clear its
determination to grow both organically and by acquisition. Mr Sharp has
previously said that Northern Rock wants to be among the 10 largest
societies. By the end of last year, Northern Rock's assets had grown to
Pounds 7.3bn, narrowing the gap with Bristol &amp; West, the 10th largest
society with assets of Pounds 8.14bn.
Some society chief executives commented that the Lloyds' bid would signal
the end of the 'traditional' building society merger, because of the cash
payments of up to Pounds 10,000 which the deal offered each member.
Mergers between societies do not produce such significant windfalls because
ownership of the new organisation remains with its members. They must
approve any plans for a merger, takeover or conversion to plc status, and
the proposed pay-out to C&amp;G members was thought to sour the prospects for
other societies of winning their members' consent to a deal that would not
yield such an immediate cash benefit.
One medium-sized society which was planning a merger is thought to have
shelved this move for the moment.
Earlier this year, Northern Rock reported a 29 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits, from Pounds 69m to Pounds 89.3m.
There was also substantial balance sheet growth, despite a year in which
societies faced fierce competition for mortgage lending and retail savings.
The last big merger plans within the societies sector were announced last
summer by Leeds Permanent, the fifth largest society, and National &amp;
Provincial, the eighth largest. That merger foundered in the autumn over a
clash of management styles.

FT  04 MAY 94 / SmithKline's deal brings an expensive bargain: David Wighton
analyses the purchase of Diversified Pharmaceuticals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jan Leschly, chief executive officer of SmithKline Beecham, recently
described Merck's purchase of drug distributor Medco last year as
'strategically . . . a stroke of genius'. But he questioned the Dollars
6.7bn (Pounds 4.5bn) price tag.
So it should have come as little surprise that SmithKline wants to buy
Medco's smaller rival Diversified Pharmaceuticals - or that Mr Leschly
argues at only Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) it is a much better deal. Not
that it looks a bargain by normal standards. Diversified made an operating
profit of just Dollars 39.9m last year.
To be fair, Diversified is growing rapidly with profits rising by over 60
per cent last year on more than trebled sales of Dollars 142.1m.
But Mr Jean-Pierre Garnier, chairman of SB Pharmaceuticals, says its
importance for the group cannot be measured in traditional terms. He simply
warns that pharmaceuticals companies without similar deals 'will probably
not survive in the increasingly competitive environment'.
Mr Leschly sees the move as a vital part of his efforts to move the group
from being a 'manufacturer selling pills' to a supplier of 'total
pharmaceutical care'.
This transformation is deemed necessary because healthcare in the US is
moving from one controlled by doctors to one controlled by the payer - a
change which has been associated with the creation of two new groups of
businesses, health management organisations (HMOs) and pharmaceutical
benefit management companies.
Both act as intermediaries buying care and drugs on behalf of their
customers, which in the case of pharmaceutical benefit management companies
are usually HMOs. Mr Leschly says SmithKline's deal is unique in that it
involves not only the purchase of a pharmaceutical benefit management
company, Diversified, but also close links with its parent United
HealthCare, which owns health management organisations with 1.6m members.
'That triangle is essential for the strategic importance of the deal.'
SmithKline and United have agreed to a minimum six-year alliance, through
which SmithKline will have exclusive rights to data from those 1.6m members.
This data will help SmithKline to greater understanding of the cost/benefits
of drug use.
United will continue to use Diversified for its owned managed care
operations.
Mr Leschly says the acquisition will 'enhance' the 'presence' of
SmithKline's products in the managed care sector yet stresses it will not
attempt to force its products through Diversified. 'If we forced them to do
certain things it would not be competitive and that would not be in our
interests. We want them to continue their fruitful relationship with other
manufacturers.'
He argues SmithKline will bring benefits to Diversified, including access to
its salesforce and specialist clinical knowledge. As for the price, Mr
Leschly says SmithKline is paying Dollars 210 for each of the 11m people for
whom Diversified directly manages pharmaceutical benefits. On the same basis
he says Merck paid more than Dollars 325 a head for Medco.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Long hot summer to test the nerve of dollar bulls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dollar disappointment is on the edge of turning into a debacle as the US
Federal Reserve is forced to resort to propping up the ailing currency as it
sinks against the yen. At risk are many of the global investors who have
been almost unanimously bullish about the dollar for more than a year. In
1993 the dollar went down against the yen but at least it went up against
the D-Mark. This year it has been soft against most other currencies.
What has nobbled the dead cert? After all, with the US economy expanding
strongly while most of its G7 trading partners remained in recession, the
argument has been that a transformation in interest rate differentials would
push up dollar exchange rates. In practice the fall in continental European
interest rates has been rather slow, but whereas at the end of 1992 D-Mark
three-month rates were more than 500 basis points higher than the dollar
equivalent, today the differential is only just over 100 points. Pretty soon
the gap could reverse.
Has the negative response been irrational? There do, of course, have to be
reasons but they vary from time to time. Besides short-term interest rate
differentials, currency exchange rates may be driven by long-term investment
flows and by political uncertainty. There is also the basic economic factor
of trade imbalances, which this year may have become important again.
There are some big negatives here. The US current account deficit may be
heading for Dollars 140bn (Pounds 96bn) in 1994, pushed up by domestic
demand, and generating unwanted dollars overseas. Moreover, far from
supporting their local neighbourhood Treasury, US pension funds and mutual
fund investors have discovered the virtues of global investment, and poured
almost Dollars 130bn into foreign securities in 1993.
Offsetting that was Dollars 110bn of net purchases of US securities by
foreigners, but the point is that whereas in the 1980s the big investments
by foreigners (often, at that stage, Japanese financial institutions) were
vastly greater than the US outflows, now there is a rough balance.
The underlying US current account deficit is therefore having to be financed
by attracting hot money which is more sensitive to the prospects for
short-term capital gains through exchange rate volatility than it is to
small-scale interest rate differentials.
A low rate of domestic saving in the US is forcing the country to draw on
savings overseas, especially when the economic upturn is leading to a rise
in corporate investment. The mirror image is depressed in Japan, running a
current account surplus of about Dollars 130bn, but apparently no longer
willing to buy dollar securities as it was in the 1980s.
The Americans portray problems with Japan in terms of interference with
freedom of trade, but different propensities to save are at the heart of the
problem. The immediate difficulty is that Japanese life companies are no
longer willing to take risks with the dollar/yen rate which has cost them so
much in falling from over 200 10 years ago to scarcely above 100 today.
Seen this way, the challenge for Americans is to attract savings
domestically and internationally. Last year the banks and the hedge funds
were still healthy sources of support for US Treasuries but that game is now
over. The simple solution is a sharp rise in long-term dollar interest
rates, which has happened, with the 150 basis point rise in the benchmark
long bond yield since last October's trough. Apart from attracting foreign
money these higher returns will also, eventually, choke off the portfolio
outflows.
But anybody buying into rising yields is also buying into immediate capital
losses. So there is the potential for a hiatus as potential buyers of dollar
securities wait for the bond market to settle down. While long-term
portfolio investors hold off, the dollar is likely to wilt; and Japanese
institutions certainly have reason to bide their time until the yen is not
just overpriced but ridiculously priced.
At least we learned last week there are limits to the readiness of Americans
to encourage devaluation of their currency. But we could be in for an
unstable and unpredictable summer as the nerves of the dollar bulls are
tested.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Brussels backs Pounds 61m UK aid for Ulster factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 61m package of UK state aid for a Northern Ireland textile plant
which could create up to 2,000 jobs was given the go-ahead yesterday by the
European Commission.
The Pounds 157m Belfast factory will be one of the largest investment
projects in Britain in recent years.
The aid was approved after the commission ruled that the factory, for the
Hualon company, would not seriously distort the European Union's textile
sector.
The decision follows a 10-month commission investigation into the state aid
package. It represents a considerable victory for the British government,
which has been lobbying hard for the project in the face of opposition from
some member states.
The government, which argues that the project is badly needed to alleviate
unemployment in Northern Ireland, had proposed providing the Pounds 61m
worth of aid, or 38 per cent of the total investment.
Although this level of state aid does not contravene European Union
regulations for regional assistance, some member states have complained that
the project would create an unfair distortion in the European textile market
which is facing increased pressure as a result of international trade
liberalisation and excess capacity.
With Northern Ireland's low cost manufacturing base apparently one of the
key attractions for Hualon, textile producers in South Europe have also
expressed fears that the investment could draw jobs away from the rest of
Europe in the sector.
However, the commission yesterday said in a statement that it had weighed
the positive regional impact of the aid against its effect on the EU textile
sector and decided the aid met exemptions in state aid rules.
Mr Karel Van Miert, EU competition commissioner, said: 'This project will be
of prime importance for a region particularly affected by unemployment.
'It will reinforce the competitiveness of the European industry and
considerably reduce the unemployment level in the Belfast area.'
The project, which will be carried out in four phases spread over a
seven-year period will centre on the weaving, dyeing and finish of
polyester, polyamide and cotton fabrics.
With the total industrial workforce in Northern Ireland currently standing
at about 100,000, the new factory, which will be based in the outskirts of
Belfast, could boost the workforce by 2 per cent.
A UK government spokesman said yesterday: 'This is very good news. It will
bring much needed jobs.'

FT  04 MAY 94 / IBM to set up data 'highway' linking 500 Chinese cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines has been chosen by China's Ministry of
Electronics Industry to lead a vast project to link about 500 cities to a
national 'information highway' data network.
Under the terms of a memorandum of understanding signed by Mr Lou Gerstner,
IBM chairman and chief executive, and Mr Zou Jiahua, one of China's vice
premiers, IBM will lead the 'Golden Bridge' project, one of three
initiatives designed to modernise China's data communications and computing
infrastructure.
The project will involve designing and building regional networks in
selected cities across China, along with a 'backbone' network linking the
regional systems. The effort will be led by a newly established joint
venture, based in Beijing, between IBM China and Ji Tong Communications, a
company affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of Electronics Industry.
'This is China's version of the information highway. The Chinese government
has set very ambitious goals and we are thrilled to have been selected to
work with them,' said Mr Ned Lautenbach, head of IBM's international
operations.
IBM has also been chosen as the primary consultant on two other 'Golden
Projects': Golden Card will establish facilities for credit and debit cards
throughout China, and Golden Customs will create computerised record-keeping
and tracking systems for China's exports and imports.
IBM's presence in China dates back to 1935. The company left China when the
communist regime took over and came back in 1982 as an offshore business. In
September 1992 IBM China became a wholly owned foreign enterprise,
authorised to trade in local currency and to hire Chinese employees.
'In the last 18 months or so we have been growing our resources, our
commitment and our business in China,' said Mr Lautenbach. These moves
reflect the Clinton administration's liberalisation of export controls on
high technology goods sold to China.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Dutch coalition loses majority in election: Labour set to
emerge as the largest single party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Netherlands' two ruling parties, the centrist Christian Democrats and
Labour, lost their majority in parliament in yesterday's national elections,
paving the way for the first three-party coalition since 1981.
In a closely fought poll, Labour emerged as the largest party with 37 seats
in the 150-seat lower house, according to provisional final results. The CDA
took 34 seats.
However, both suffered heavy losses compared with the 1989 general election
and two smaller parties will play a crucial role in the coalition
negotiations. The rightwing Liberals gained nine seats for a total of 31,
while D66, a left-of-centre party, doubled its 1989 tally to finish with 24
seats.
The four main parties agree on most economic and foreign policy issues but
are divided on calls for reform of the country's extensive and generous
social security system.
Two new parties representing pensioners won a total of seven seats,
underlining the importance of social security as an issue in the campaign.
In the 1989 election the CDA captured 54 seats and Labour 49, giving the two
parties their governing majority. Mr Frits Bolkestein, the Liberal leader,
said last night: 'A political earthquake has taken place in this country.'
The two most likely coalitions are either a centre-left government
consisting of Labour, CDA and D66, or a right-left alliance of Labour,
Liberals and D66, which would shut the CDA out of power for the first time
since 1918.
Labour's emergence as the largest party means it will try to secure the
prime minister's job for only the third time since the second world war. Its
candidate is the current finance minister, Mr Wim Kok.
The dramatic loss of support for the CDA, the linchpin of every government
since the second world war, was caused mainly by the impending departure
from national politics of Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Netherlands' longest-serving
prime minister. His successor, Mr Elco Brinkman, does not have the same
authority.
Mr Brinkman expressed deep disappointment about the results but refused to
be drawn last night on what they would mean for the composition of the
future government. 'This has not been the CDA's best hour,' he said.
The results also showed a rise of support for the far-right Centrum
Democraten, which won three seats compared with one seat in 1989, although
the result was below the eight seats predicted by some recent opinion polls.

The Netherlands' two ruling parties, the centrist Christian Democrats and
Labour, look set to lose their majority in parliament as a result of
yesterday's national elections, holding out the prospect of a three-party
coalition for the first time since 1981.
Two smaller parties which made strong gains will play a crucial role in the
coalition negotiations that lie ahead. The rightwing Liberals are projected
to have gained eight new seats for a total of 30, while D66, a
left-of-centre party, is forecast to win 24 seats, double its number in
1989.
These four main parties share a broad consensus on economic, monetary and
foreign policy issues. Where they differ most is on the vexed question of
social security and how to continue paying for it at a time of rising
unemployment and the ageing of the population.
The two most likely coalitions are Labour, CDA and D66, or a right-left
alliance of Labour, Liberals and D66, which would shut the CDA out of power
for the first time since 1918.
The CDA of prime minister Ruud Lubbers had been trailing Labour in the
opinion polls but regained ground in the last few days before the election.
It won two seats less than Labour, which won 36, according to exit polls and
preliminary projections by Dutch television.
Both parties fell back sharply from the last general election in 1989, when
the CDA won 54 seats and Labour 49 seats, giving them a governing majority
in the 150-seat lower house of parliament.
The dramatic loss of support for the CDA, the linchpin of every government
since the second world war, was caused mainly by the impending departure
from national politics of Mr Lubbers, the Netherlands' longest-serving prime
minister. His successor, Mr Elco Brinkman, did not have the same authority.
Coalition talks could take weeks or months, and it is possible that a new
government will not be sworn in until the summer. The close finish between
CDA and Labour means that both parties will be in the running to provide the
next prime minister. Labour's candidate for the job is the current finance
minister, Mr Wim Kok.
The far-right Centrum Democraten won three seats compared with one seat in
1989, but some opinion polls had predicted it would win as many as eight.
Two new parties representing pensioners won a total of eight seats,
underlining the importance of social security as an issue.

FT  04 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Crest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is obviously embarrassing that the London stock market is unlikely to
meet the original deadline of next January for introducing five-day rolling
settlement. Five-day settlement has become the international standard, while
some rival markets are moving towards a three-day system. Delay makes London
look unprofessional, reinforcing the impression created by last year's
Taurus fiasco.
Nevertheless, delay is better than disaster. The move to five-day settlement
is due to occur under the old paper-based system. Fast paper settlement may
be feasible but there is clearly a risk that back offices and registrars
could be swamped by paper mountains. It certainly makes sense to see how
10-day settlement, due to start in July, beds down before progressing. There
may even be a case for postponing fast settlement until Crest, the
electronic system that fills the role that Taurus should have filled, is up
and running.
Meanwhile, the stock exchange has been snubbed in its ambition to hold a 30
per cent stake of Crest. Its share will be no higher than that held by at
least 17 other financial institutions, if indeed it decides to take part at
all. The exchange may yet receive the consolation prize of operating Crest
under contract - a possibility held out yesterday by the Bank of England.
But, to win the contract, it will have to compete. Success cannot be
guaranteed.

All credit to Lloyd's of London for trying to transform itself from an
expensive club into a rational market. The proposed introduction of
pre-emption rights for Names, similar to those enjoyed by shareholders in
the equity market, is a small step in this direction. Risk-based capital
requirements for underwriting syndicates should also bring returns more
closely into line with risks. Lloyd's might then stand a better chance of
developing a mix of business capable of generating consistent profits.
Lloyd's will look an odd-ball among financial markets until capital is
allocated to syndicates on the basis of price, rather than favours and
queueing as at present. That giant leap will probably involve Names
exchanging syndicate participations for shares in specialist Lloyd's
companies which can be traded. Exactly how that might happen, and what form
the new companies might take, was left open by yesterday's report.
In managing any such transition, though, the interests of Names will have to
be carefully protected. Having relied on private individuals to ride out the
recent underwriting storm, Lloyd's must give them a fair chance to recoup
their losses under the structure which is now emerging.

The strong growth in M0 money supply last month is about the best indication
yet that economic recovery has survived the immediate impact of the
chancellor's tax increases. But the jury must still be out on whether that
positive response will continue, especially now that consumers have banked
their April pay cheques. Anecdotal evidence suggests confidence is weak. Yet
spending may well turn out not to be too badly affected. Employment and
wages are growing, and higher turnover in the housing market, underlined by
yesterday's mortgage lending figures, should boost demand for consumer
durables.
Obviously the authorities cannot wish the recovery to falter, but such a
high rate of narrow money growth must also leave them uneasy. Year-on-year
growth of 6.2 per cent is way above the monitoring ceiling of 4 per cent,
and the excuse that individuals are inclined to hold cash because interest
rates are so low is wearing thin. Arguably, the original target range for M0
was too tight, but the authorities cannot let the aggregate expand at this
kind of level for more than a month or two without risking serious loss of
credibility.
Then talk would turn, not to whether there is room for one more rate cut,
but rather to the question of how soon rates would have to rise again. It is
perhaps unfortunate that news of such vigorous money growth coincided with
fresh nervousness over sterling. Its trade-weighted index dropped 0.9 per
cent yesterday, partly in the backwash of a weak dollar and partly in
response to political worries. There was no inflationary threat when
sterling left the ERM because the economy was so weak. Depreciation is more
risky now that the output gap is closing and unit labour costs have bottomed
out.

FT  04 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: SmithKline's prescription
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When Merck bought Medco for Dollars 6bn in July last year most other
pharmaceuticals companies were unconvinced of the commercial logic and
flabbergasted by the price. It is a measure of how far the market has come
in the last 10 months that SmithKline Beecham's decision to follow into
vertical integration seems to have immediately convinced on both counts.
True, SB seems to be paying a shade less than Merck for its US pharmacy
benefit manager. A handy tax break means that earnings will barely suffer
this year and should benefit thereafter. Even so, paying a multiple of
around 50 times last year's earnings demands a compelling case.
At its crudest level, buying Diversified Pharmaceutical Services allows SB
to recoup some of the margin now being lost to its new breed of customers.
DPS's earnings depend on its ability to negotiate aggressive deals with
drugs companies. There is also the promise of rapidly rising profits as
benefit managers cover more of the US population. It remains to be seen
whether DPS's customers will be happy about its loss of independence. The
relationship with SB will have to be played carefully. Still, the early
evidence from Medco is that large healthcare buyers are reluctant to take
their business elsewhere.
The wider benefits, including access to DPS's clinical data, will only
become apparent over time. The relative performance of SB's drugs will be
the critical test. As Roche's acquisition of rival drug company Syntex makes
clear, there is more than one way to tackle the margin squeeze now under
way. With two of the big three US benefit managers in the hands of drugs
companies, though, others in the sector will find that opportunities for
vertical integration are few and far between.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Post Office chief lobbies MPs over business plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive of the Post Office, revealed yesterday
that he has lobbied more than 150 MPs as part of his campaign to secure
commercial freedom from the government.
He also spelt out for the first time detailed business plans which could
only be put into operation if the corporation was privatised or given
commercial freedom within the public sector.
These include leasing some or all of the 16 trains owned by the Post Office,
the distribution of newspapers and handling private mail and parcels. The
measures could save the corporation tens of millions of pounds.
Under current rules, the Post Office is prevented by the Treasury from using
surplus cash to invest in such business ventures.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has said a strong
economic case exists for privatising the Royal Mail. But he has yet to
publish his department's 22 month-old review of the business.
Mr Cockburn said: 'If the government were to give us the commercial freedom
we have been pressing for, we would look at the whole of our balance sheet.
'This includes the ownership of our 16 trains, all Post Office buildings,
commercial vehicles and our charter air service.'
The corporation recently bought the 16 mail trains as part of a Pounds 150m
partnership with Rail Express Systems, British Rail's profitable
non-passenger business.
But instead of owning the trains the Post Office believes it could make more
commercial sense to sell them to a bank, for example, and lease them back.
It would also like to use its trains to distribute newspapers - particularly
Sunday papers - and carry private mail and parcels.
The Treasury has already told the Post Office that it will not 'bend the
rules' to allow the corporation to put its business plans into operation
while it remains in the public sector.
Mr Cockburn has been discretely 'wining and dining' MPs from all political
parties to impress upon them the need for commercial freedom.
Although he has been careful not to disclose publicly his preferred method
of commercial freedom, he said that if the government favoured privatisation
it should 'get on with it' immediately.
In order to allay the fears of Tory backbenchers that privatisation could
jeopardise rural post offices, Mr Cockburn has stressed his commitment to a
rural service when meeting MPs.
He has told MPs that he believes the maintenance of the rural service
ensures the Post Office its competitive edge over international rivals.
But he has also warned that failure to give the Post Office the freedom to
invest and plan would lead to the corporation becoming a liability instead
of an asset.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Haunted by the past: Bronwen Maddox on UK government
attempts to formulate a policy on contaminated land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A host of golden daffodils hardly seems a source of serious pollution. But
the UK's National Rivers Authority, the river quality watchdog, reported
last month that highly toxic insecticides had seeped from a Cornish daffodil
farm into local streams.
That was just one example of the threat posed by contaminated land revealed
in the NRA's survey, which also reported that in the Severn-Trent region of
central England alone, 186 sites were thought to be polluting water. Just
over half of those cases were of industrial contamination, and the rest of
leaking rubbish dumps.
Many similar instances have been cited in the responses - due in yesterday -
to the government's consultation paper on contaminated land, Paying for our
past. The paper, published in March after the government scrapped proposals
for a register of contaminated land, calls for comments on the size of the
problem and on who should foot the bill. Ministers say they are determined
that the chosen solution should avoid the problems which have bedevilled
Superfund.
So far the full scale of the problem has not been known, as there have been
no systematic surveys, just compilations of incidents such as the NRA
report. Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, has suggested that there
could be 100,000 problem sites in England, concentrated in the former
industrial heartland of the Midlands. The Confederation of British Industry
has also estimated that 200,000 hectares could be contaminated by industrial
use, and that cleaning it up could cost Pounds 20bn.
Not all that pollution may need tackling urgently. Mr Andrew Lees, campaigns
director of Friends of the Earth, says: 'If the pollution is fixed in the
soil and is not moving, then it is possible that it poses no problem. But if
it is contaminating water supplies, for example, then clearly it does.'
However, even if some contaminated sites do not need treatment, the
government is anxious to devise a clean-up policy because it fears that
uncertainty about potential liabilities will hinder development of former
industrial regions. Many of these areas suffer from high unemployment, and
the government is keen to encourage investment. It is also concerned to ease
pressure for construction on green field sites in the south.
Lawyers and bankers confirm the government's fears that uncertainty about
liabilities is making buying and selling property difficult in some regions.
Ms Clare Deanesly of Gouldens, the solicitors, says that a House of Lords
ruling in December - the much-publicised Cambridge Water case - 'only
answered some of lawyers' worries'.
In that case, the Lords ruled that Eastern Counties Leather, a leather
treatment company, could not be held responsible for pollution caused years
ago which had contaminated boreholes, because the company could not
reasonably have foreseen the damage. In doing so, the Lords rejected the
application of strict liability along Superfund lines - that is, polluters
are liable regardless of whether they foresaw the damage or took steps to
alleviate it.
However the case left open the question of whether adequate rules to
determine who should pay could evolve through the courts by the application
of common law, or whether they need to be defined by new legislation.
The government's paper ducks that question. Its only clear recommendation on
the question of who should pay is that banks should, in some circumstances,
be held liable for cleaning up pollution caused by companies to which they
have made loans.
This proposal has attracted fierce criticism: the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors has told the government that 'putting unreasonable
liability' on the financial sector could 'encourage (it) to withdraw from
environmentally vulnerable markets'. In other words, banks would lend money
only for the development of clean land.
The paper, however, points the way forward on some other problems, according
to lawyers, developers, banks and insurers. They have particularly welcomed
the proposal that land need not be cleaned up to a pristine state, only to
the level necessary for its intended use. The proposal - which has been
attacked by environmentalists such as Friends of the Earth - is an attempt
to avoid some of the huge clean-up bills which have arisen under Superfund.
But that does not compensate, according to the paper's critics, for the
paper's failure to address the central question of who should foot the bill
for past pollution. 'The courts passed the buck to parliament on the
Cambridge Water case, and Paying for our past passed it back again,' says Ms
Deanesly.
Because that central question remains untackled, many respondents have
called for the government to pay for cleaning up contamination, possibly by
setting up a fund through levies on industry.
Ms Deanesly says: 'My personal view is that we have all benefited from the
industrial revolution - it produced economic benefits. To the extent that it
has produced disadvantages, those should be funded from the public purse.'
In spite of the problems the US has had in operating such a fund, the
government is likely to find that many of the respondents to its
consultation paper have echoed those views.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Superfailure may yet be a success: Efforts are being made to
reform the US Superfund toxic waste clean-up scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government, business and environmentalists yesterday seized what may be
their last chance to reform the controversial Superfund law on toxic waste
dumps, striking a deal on a compromise set of proposals that could become
law in the US as early as this autumn.
'We've reached a delicate consensus,' said Senator Frank Lautenberg,
chairman of a Senate committee on Superfund, after a day of meetings at the
White House.
Proposals from the Clinton administration seek to distribute the costs of
dealing with toxic waste sites fairly among the polluters, to cut the money
spent on lawyers and to increase the amount spent on actually cleaning up.
But the contaminated land issue is so controversial that any one of many
interested parties - chemicals companies, insurers, local governments,
environmentalists - could torpedo a bill. Congressional leaders have thus
been unwilling to press ahead until they achieved consensus. The effects of
Superfund's faults, however, have been felt in insurance markets worldwide;
adding, for instance, to the travails of Lloyd's of London.
The Superfund programme has been dogged by problems of cost since it was set
up in 1980 and revised in 1986, despite resulting in the clean-up of at
least 220 toxic sites on a national priority list of 1,300. 'Despite the
creation of a multi-billion-dollar public works programme and an awesome new
overarching approach to hazardous waste liability, the Superfund solution
has become an implementation nightmare,' according to to Professor Daniel
Mazmanian, a professor of political science at California's Claremont
Graduate School, and Mr David Morell, head of Epics International, a
regulatory consultancy, in their book Beyond Superfailure.
Two issues remain fraught: first, what exactly should be done about the
chemical and mineral wastes that have for decades been freely dumped without
concern for their health and environmental consequences? Second, who should
pay?
Existing Superfund law is vague on the first question. Neither in 1980 nor
in 1986 was Congress able to establish how clean a cleaned site should be.
National standards for acceptable levels of contamination have proved
difficult to define without unnecessarily tying the hands of the
government's Environmental Protection Agency administrators, in charge of
drawing up a clean-up plan at each site. Cleanliness is defined in the law
not by substance but by process: were the right parties consulted and the
right procedures followed in drawing up the plan?
On the second question of who should pay, by contrast, Superfund law is
excessively clear. Liability for the costs of a Superfund clean-up is
legally defined as strict, retroactive, joint and several: anyone who
contributed in any way to contamination - the operator of a dump, the
landowner, the companies that sent waste there, even the road hauliers - can
be held liable for the entire cost.
In 1979, estimates showed a national clean-up, taking many decades, would
cost between Dollars 26.2bn and Dollars 44.1bn - and the latest assessment
from the Congressional Budget Office puts the bill to the public and private
sectors at Dollars 230bn in inflation-adjusted dollars. But the original
Superfund contained only Dollars 1.6bn, so the government's EPA has every
incentive to apply joint and several liability ferociously, in order to find
someone other than the fund to pay.
Industry, however, has every incentive to fight back, sue other polluters
for a share of the costs, and to argue with insurers over every penny. For
instance, ICI Americas, US offshoot of the British chemicals group and one
of the 'deep pocket' polluters initially targeted by the EPA to pay for
clean-up of Delaware's Tybouts Corner landfill, sent a 30-page questionnaire
to every manufacturer within 100 miles of Tybouts in its search for other
polluters. Litigation dragged on from 1980 until 1989 before agreement was
reached on sharing out costs of the clean-up.
Thus the result of both the vagueness and the clarity has been endless
litigation. Developers, meanwhile, shy away from once-used land for fear of
some future liability. 'Many claim that prospective owners who want to
develop property have an economic incentive to use undeveloped, or green
field, sites to avoid potential Superfund liability, thereby contributing to
suburban sprawl and exacerbating chronic unemployment often found in
inner-city industrial areas,' according to Ms Carol Browner, head of the
EPA.
Many flaws in the Superfund legislation are rooted in its creation. The
first law was passed in December 1980, as Congress rushed to complete
legislation before President-elect Ronald Reagan, committed to rolling back
the regulatory burden on industry, took office.
Mr Reagan's EPA proved unwilling to pursue polluters vigorously and unable,
in a period of tight budgets for all but defence, to spend much money on
clean-ups. So in 1986 Congress took fresh aim with the Superfund Amendments
and Reauthorisation Act (Sara).
Although Sara took modest steps to reduce application of strict, joint and
several liability by providing limited incentives for everyone to settle
early on fair distribution of costs, it did not get much closer to
determining how clean is clean.
The proposals outlined in February by Ms Browner aim to clarify the issue.
They would establish in law national goals, as yet not spelled out, for
health protection, and follow these up with regulations to set national
levels of permissible contamination for the most common chemicals. They
would also provide flexibility by linking the standard for a particular site
to its future use. 'If the community decides that a contaminated site is
going to be used for an industrial plant, we might not need to clean it up
to the same level as we would for a school,' Ms Browner said.
The administration bill would not reverse strict, joint and several
liability, but would exempt those responsible for very small amounts of
waste; it would seek to reduce litigation through a voluntary process under
which an independent expert would decide on fair allocation of costs to
polluters who agreed to take part.
The Clinton administration originally proposed a new fund financed by a levy
on insurers starting at Dollars 500m a year to help settle insurance claims
on waste dumped before 1986, when Sara was passed. But insurance and
chemical companies have agreed a somewhat different arrangement that has won
government approval, if not yet formal endorsement. It differs from the
administration proposal in the degree of acceptance a clean-up plan must
have before the fund could start to pay out.
With no dispute that Superfund badly needs reform, the process has so far
been different in spirit from previous attempts to legislate on toxic waste
clean-ups. The debate is not overshadowed by congressional distrust of the
administration, and the administration has sought out everyone involved in
an attempt to build consensus - though it has not yet achieved unanimity.
Ms Browner's proposals draw heavily on similar reports produced by an EPA
working party with public and private sector representatives. An independent
National Commission on Superfund, bringing together industrialists,
insurers, environmentalists, state and local governments and community
groups, worked towards very similar conclusions. That may be the lesson of
Superfund's superfailures: the secret of dealing with toxic wastes lies less
in detailed contamination remedies or precise cost allocation formulae than
in the process by which a nation reaches agreement on the balance between
economic and environmental values.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Back to the pork barrel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When is a manufacturing subsidy not a subsidy? The answer is when it is a
'focused research and development incentives programme'. This is the Clinton
administration's euphemism for its decision to underwrite the development of
a commercial industry to make flat panel displays, such as those used in
portable computers or aircraft cockpit displays. And it raises troubling
questions about a developing trend in US industrial policy.
Two themes are emerging. Government research money is being redirected away
from specific military projects towards more general commercial ventures.
Old fashioned industrial intervention is being glossed up and justified
under the heading of technology policy. But the familiar shape of the pork
barrel is already discernible.
The defence department acknowledges that its requirements for flat panel
displays will never amount to much more than about 5 per cent of the rapidly
growing US market. It also concedes that established foreign suppliers - all
from Japan - are already in a position to provide affordable products. But
it is worried about assured and early access to leading edge technology in
what will be the essential interface for the battleground of the future.
Research grants
So it is prepared to offer substantial research grants to those private
sector companies which are willing to commit themselves to build production
facilities. It envisages providing support for four world-scale
manufacturing facilities over the next five years, which will have the
capacity to take some 15 per cent of the world market for flat panel
displays. The initiative will cost the US taxpayer around Dollars 110m to
Dollars 120m a year over that period.
This development is worrying for several reasons. First, it suggests that
R&amp;D subsidies - which the Clinton fought to preserve during the Uruguay
round - are being abused in order to help domestic manufacturing industry.
Next, there is a long history in the US and elsewhere of government funds
being wasted under the heading of strategic technology policy. The attempt
to build a commercial synthetic fuels industry and the supersonic transport
project are only two of the more egregious examples. All the evidence is
that the net impact on productivity of US government R&amp;D spending is lower
than the return on privately funded spending, and may even be negative.
It is highly uncertain whether the latest initiative will be any more
successful, given that the Japanese are already several years ahead in terms
of technology.
Innovative designs
Moreover, these initiatives invariably favour older, established companies
at the expense of innovators. A case in point is Sematech, the
government-backed consortium for semiconductor manufacturing technology. It
is true that the US chip industry has recovered well in recent years, but
this has been based as much on innovative designs as on the manufacturing
technology which Sematech was designed to enhance.
Finally, the arguments being used to justify the flat panel display project
could easily be extended to cover a host of other industries where the
Japanese have a big commercial lead - from ceramics to machining. The
defence department has an enormous shopping list: where is the line to be
drawn?
All this is not to say that the US administration is powerless to help. It
could mount an assault on the Pentagon's extraordinarily cumbersome and
bureaucratic procurement procedures, in order to speed up the transfer of
advanced technology and reduce development costs. It could simplify the
patent system, and revise anti-trust procedures in order to make it easier
for companies to come together in joint ventures to develop new
technologies. It could consider putting temporary tax incentives for private
sector research on to a permanent footing.
A policy of doling out money to companies to help them get back into an
industry which they have abandoned is not likely to succeed. What is worse
is that it will encourage other governments, notably in the European Union,
down the same slippery path.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Leading Article: South Africa looks forward
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's transition from minority rule to democracy is something to
celebrate. Not even the painfully inefficient election count can spoil an
event of such moment and one whose significance extends well beyond the
region. A stable, democratic and economically successful South Africa might
yet offer hope for a continent debilitated by debt, disaster and disease. It
could even become a model for other countries where ethnic and racial
tensions present seemingly insuperable barriers to economic progress.
Fulfilment of these hopes will be as difficult as the transition itself, but
South Africa has made an encouraging start. President FW de Klerk has left
office with a grace that has enhanced his reputation and augurs well for his
expected role as second vice president. General Constand Viljoen, the former
armed services chief, steered the conservative right away from confrontation
and into the election. He deserves credit for defusing what could have been
a destabilising clash.
Above all, the president-elect, Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the victorious
African National Congress, is preparing for office with the pragmatism and
compassion that is his hallmark. With the grim legacy of apartheid all
around him, he was right to strike a note of urgency in his victory speech
on Monday night, promising that he and his team will roll up their sleeves
and get South Africa back to work.
Cabinet places
He was also wise to offer places in his cabinet to parties which failed to
reach the 5 per cent that would give them automatic representation in a
government of national unity: the liberal Democratic party, the radical Pan
Africanist Congress and Gen Viljoen's Freedom Front, which seeks reassurance
that Afrikaner culture will survive. It would be wise to extend a similar
invitation to Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, although his Inkatha Freedom party
may have attracted sufficient votes to secure it a cabinet seat. Chief
Buthelezi's difficulties with the ANC and its leader are well-known. Yet
nothing can be lost by attempting to bring this prickly personality into the
fold.
In selecting his cabinet Mr Mandela must also look beyond his domestic
constituency. A careful balance is needed to reassure international
investors, who look for stability. They will wish to see continuity of the
sound economic policies that have characterised the transition. The
retention of Mr Derek Keys, the present finance minister, in one of the main
economic portfolios would constitute a clear signal that this is understood.
Mr Chris Stals, the governor of the Reserve Bank, should be asked to stay in
his job. It may be difficult for Mr Mandela but room should be found for
both men, not as token whites but as key players in South Africa's new
economic team.
Investment code
Mr Mandela must also be on his guard against those who argue for an
investment code. Rev Leon Sullivan, the US-based campaigner, achieved some
success in urging foreign companies who decided to maintain their operations
in the old South Africa to end discrimination on the shop floor, introduce
training programmes and accept social responsibilities in the black
community. He and others now advocate similar terms for would-be foreign
investors. These objectives are well-meant, but to make them a condition
displays a misunderstanding of the tough competition for investment. No
lobby urges the same conditions for other developing nations.
Some investors are showing strong interest in post-apartheid South Africa,
whether as a market in its own right, or as a base for operations in the
rest of Africa. Yet the new government is in no position to lay down terms
that might drive investment capital to more attractive Asian homes. Indeed,
Mr Mandela should bear Asian lessons closely in mind as he looks to the
future. That implies a market-driven exchange rate, a competitive business
environment, a close partnership between government and the private sector,
trade liberalisation, encouragement of multinationals with their worldwide
marketing facilities, technology and management skills and an efficient
civil service. He will best serve the new South Africa if he applies these
principles. He might also then galvanise the rest of Africa, for whom he is
already an inspiration.

Naturally, the syndicate officials who slaved day and night on what was to
be India's biggest ever equity offering were more than a little nonplussed
when VSNL, the Indian international telecoms company, decided to postpone
its Dollars 1bn international equity offering at the eleventh hour. How to
commemorate their failure to pocket some whacking fees? A slap-up meal
seemed the perfect idea.
Understandably, the idea of dining out at one of London's superb Indian
restaurants made them feel a little queasy. So they all went out to Memories
of China.

Citroen's UK subsidiary is having a spot of bother with the parent company's
brainwaves on the vehicle naming front. With scant regard for prime minister
Edouard Balladur's campaign to defend the purity of the French language,
Citroen is calling its latest two-and-a-half tonne van the Citroen Jumper.
Company executives mutter obliquely about 'Jolly Jumper' being the name of
the horse belonging to 'Lucky Luke', some cartoon figure.
But the company's UK management is less than taken with calling a vehicle
after a woolly garment that may be comfortable but tends to be familiar,
old, tired . . . So it has plumped for Relay instead.
That still leaves the new multi-purpose vehicle - a competitor for Renault's
Espace - that the big bosses are christening the Citroen Evasion. The French
connotations may be of escape and adventure, but Pierre Boisjoly, managing
director of Citroen UK, reckons the Brits will think of tax evasion.
Anyone care to help him out?

Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester may have caught
analysts on the hop, but can it really have come as such a surprise to staff
at the Building Societies Association?
Back in December, its director-general Adrian Coles presciently chose Brian
Pitman to deliver his 'distinctive view of current and future developments
in the banking world' to the BSA's conference later this month.
Sadly, Coles's crystal ball contains a minor flaw. Lloyds Bank's boss will
be speaking shortly before the legality of the deal is tested in the High
Court. Had the conference been scheduled for just a little later in May,
Pitman might have been able to say rather more.

Is there no keeping that Peter de Savary down? Hot on the heels of the
collapse of his Placeton property-to-oil company, he now has plans for a
Pounds 100m network of 'autoparks' - sites where people can test-drive and
buy cars - which, he claims, will be great places for a family day out.
So where is he going to get the money from, seeing that Standard Chartered
has suffered a loss of up to Pounds 50m on the Placeton collapse? Well,
plenty of other banks have been on the phone in the past couple of days,
would you believe, perfectly ready to talk business. 'I have banks who are
very fond of me,' he points out.
Indeed, plans for 'four or five' autoparks around Britain are already well
advanced. De Savary says six big car companies - anonymous so far  - are
keen to support the idea. The first sites could be operational in 1996, with
London's Docklands and Southampton being among the contenders. Each would be
about 50 acres and include Disney-style amusements for children plus
restaurants and bars operating 18 hours a day.
Sounds absolutely heavenly, just what the bankers ordered. Wait a minute;
has he checked out Eurodisney recently . . ?

FT  04 MAY 94 / Observer: Caracas to take the job?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Antonio Casas Gonzalez could hardly wish for more testing circumstances in
which to prove his mettle. The new president of the central bank of
Venezuela flies in from London amid a full-blown bolivar crisis, to step
into the shoes of the immensely respected Ruth de Krivoy.
The latter's resignation, after a row over the central monetary authority's
independence, unsettled international investors - who are far from mollified
about what they fear is a political appointee in her place.
A sociable type who was well-liked during his four-year sojourn as UK boss
of the national oil company, PDVSA, Casas is also close to President Rafael
Caldera.
A couple of months ago, friends had expected him to return to Caracas with a
shot at the top job at PDVSA, or perhaps the oil portfolio in the new
cabinet, but those positions went elsewhere.
Casas is of course an experienced and well-travelled man. In addition to his
stint as head of the government's economic planning office during Caldera's
first administration in early 1970s, he also sat on the board of the central
bank for three years between 1972 and 1975.
He had held diplomatic posts in Washington and worked at the Inter-American
Development Bank before moving to PDVSA, where he rose to the position of
chief financial officer.
But while the Venezuelan economy is in far too much trouble for anyone to
worry about the academic niceties of central bank independence, Casas will
have to prove he is more than a Caldera stooge before any degree of
international confidence returns.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Remedies for a global sickness: Daniel Green looks at the
long-awaited start of restructuring in the international drugs industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pressures on the world's pharmaceuticals industry have exploded into
corporate action.
On Monday, Switzerland's Roche announced it would pay Dollars 5.3bn for US
drugs company Syntex. Yesterday, the Anglo-US company SmithKline Beecham
said it was buying Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, a US company, for
Dollars 2.3bn. Within hours, US conglomerate Eastman Kodak said it wanted to
sell its three healthcare divisions, including Sterling Winthrop, which have
combined annual sales of Dollars 3.7bn.
On the surface each deal looks different. SmithKline Beecham is buying a
passport to the dispensers and prescribers of drugs. Roche will absorb a
research-based company like itself. And Kodak is escaping from the industry
entirely.
But they represent three distinct solutions to one problem: that drugs
companies' profits in the industrialised world are under pressure from
governments, employers and insurance companies determined to drive down
costs.
These pressures have been particularly acute in the US. The Clinton
administration has proposed sweeping healthcare reforms in an effort to cut
the cost of treating sick Americans - including the possibility of capping
drug prices, a move which would alter the economics of drug development,
which depend on high returns from heavy investment.
Though the reforms have not yet been fully debated, the price of drugs is
already being squeezed. Those who ultimately pay for the drugs - insurance
companies who meet claims and employers who pay premiums - are employing
intermediate companies, called healthcare management organisations or
pharmacy benefit managers, to negotiate discounts with drugs manufacturers.
Mr Jan Leschly, chief executive of SmithKline Beecham's since last week,
yesterday outlined four further causes for consolidation in the sector:
Attempts by governments in Europe and Japan to control pharmaceuticals
prices, which have depressed prices generally - even for drugs not
specifically targeted. The trend towards generic substitution in which drugs
buyers abandon a branded product in favour of a cheaper, unbranded
alternative. This has been a particular problem for Syntex: the company's
profits in recent years were based largely on the success of an
anti-inflammatory drug, Naprosyn. At its peak two years ago, Naprosyn's
annual sales peaked at Dollars 1bn, but in December last year, Naprosyn's
patent protection expired, and its sales fell by more than 50 per cent in
four months.
Therapeutic substitution, in which a cheaper drug, often non-branded, is
used on grounds of price. This could happen later this month when SB's ulcer
treatment, Tagamet, loses patent protection and doctors could choose it over
Glaxo's more expensive Zantac.
Escalating development costs. The increasing popularity of generic and
therapeutic substitution means that many companies are focusing on trying to
create unique products. As research into well-understood areas is dropped in
favour of pioneer work, more scientists have to be employed and subsequent
clinical trials are more expensive and time-consuming.
Most healthcare executives agree with this analysis of the pressures on
their industry. But while they agree on the causes, the executives of Roche,
SmithKline Beecham and Kodak disagree on strategy.
SmithKline Beecham's purchase, Diversified Pharmaceuticals Services, is a
pharmaceuticals benefit manager (PBM). Such institutions were born in the
1980s in the US with the aim of providing services to insurance companies
and employers in their dealings with hospitals and drugs companies.
Typically they process claims, offer ranges of drugs secured at discount
prices and substitute generic alternatives for more expensive branded
treatments.
SmithKline's deal is an echo of last summer's Dollars 6bn purchase by Merck,
the biggest US drugs company, of drugs distributor Medco, whose business is
similar to Diversified's. SmithKline began talking to Diversified's parent
company, United Healthcare, in August 1993, just weeks after the Merck-Medco
announcement. Because of their direct contacts with purchasers and doctors,
Medco and Diversified can promote their owners' drugs to doctors at the
expense of rival offerings.
Mr Leschly stresses that SmithKline's acquisition represents more than this,
however. He says that the future of the healthcare industry lies not simply
in treating diseases but in 'managing them' for a set fee per person over a
set period. With its acquisition of Diversified, SmithKline would become
involved in all stages of looking after health, he maintains.
The reasons for Roche's takeover of Syntex are more traditional, with no
overarching vision of a transformed world of healthcare. Mr Paul Freiman,
Syntex chairman, says his company's pipeline of drugs in development has
simply become too expensive for it to develop alone. The main drug in
development is Mycophenolate Mofetil, used to prevent rejection in organ
transplant patients, which cost 'about Dollars 50m a year, before overheads
and support'.
'At Dollars 400m, (last year's R&amp;D budget) we could probably not absorb all
of the products in our pipeline if we kept the spending at that level. We
had decided in our strategic plan that we needed alliances - from joint
ventures to buying small companies, to selling to a bigger company,' says Mr
Freiman.
Roche sees its acquisition of Syntex in an even more old-fashioned light: it
can cut Syntex's costs as it merges the operations of the two companies, and
it gains access to drugs still in development.
Roche is cagey about how many of Syntex's 10,000 employees will lose their
jobs. It insists that the acquisition is only the latest stage in a
seven-year strategy for US growth. This began in earnest in 1990 when it
bought the California biotechnology company Genentech for Dollars 2.1bn.
While Genentech was the gateway to the latest science of biotechnology,
Roche sees Syntex as a route to the US over-the-counter drugs market.
OTC is gaining in importance as a means of making the patient pay directly
for a treatment rather than through taxes, as in Europe, or insurance
premiums, as in the US. Roche is strong in OTC through its vitamins business
and should be able to boost the sales of Naprosyn in the wake of the
approval last month by the US Food and Drug Administration of an OTC
version.
For Kodak, it appears that neither alliances nor acquisitions are the right
solutions to the problem of falling drugs prices. Its way of addressing the
turmoil in the healthcare industry is to bid it farewell.
The company wants to concentrate on its core businesses and its move
yesterday is an acknowledgement that the Dollars 5.1bn acquisition of
Sterling Drug in 1988 was an error. Elf Sanofi, Sterling's European partner,
has already begun a strategic review with a view to buying all or part of
Sterling. Asset sales of its own are possible, 'given the size of a possible
transaction,' it said.
There is no shortage of potential deals in the healthcare industry while the
pressures on profits remain. Companies in a similar position to Syntex
include Upjohn, the US company which has seen patent run out on its
biggest-selling products in recent months, for example on Xanax, an
anti-depressive. Other potential buyers have the cashpile that Roche and
SmithKline have been spending. Top of the list is Glaxo, the biggest
European drugs company, which has yet to find a home for cash reserves of
more than Dollars 2bn. Chief executive Mr Richard Sykes said recently that
he intends to do a deal in the US by spring next year.
This week's shake-out may be seen in retrospect as just the beginning of a
long-awaited industry restructuring.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN GILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The UK government's cultural bankruptcy and moral impoverishment is
surely complete with the announcement that the Treasury is to sell up and
beat an undignified retreat from the corridors of power ('Treasury
mandarins' cost controls strike home', April 29, 'Des res for buyer with
Pounds 60m', April 30).
The contrast with the Foreign Office could not be more complete. The FO
stiffened its lips, tightened its belt, and produced what must be one of the
most magnificent and uplifting restorations of government buildings at home
or overseas, demonstrating yet again its knowledge of the way the wider
world really works.
By all means let the Treasury mandarins send themselves and their servants
off to the Lubyankas of Croydon or Docklands - many would claim they
deserved no less; but hand the buildings over to some more worthy department
that understands their worth.

legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER JACKSON MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Europe's parliament' (April 3) makes many valuable
points - notably that the parliament is 'a case study in unwieldiness'.
However, the key problem to which you refer - our traipsing between Brussels
and Strasbourg - is forced on us by the governments of the member states,
including Britain. They have insisted that this costly and absurd state of
affairs shall continue. Do not forget Luxembourg, too, the place MEPs never
visit, but where parliament's main library is forced to remain; nor French
blackmail over the elections to the European parliament, forcing a
disgraceful signature by the parliament's president of a lease for a new,
unnecessary hemicycle in Strasbourg at great benefit to the French.
There is much to sort out. There are two crucial issues: increasing the
effectiveness of our communications with industry in the early stages of
consideration of the laws we make; and reducing (and repealing) unnecessary
and costly legislation of which we have had too much in the past five years
of the Labour-dominated European parliament.
Interest in this parliament is justified by its legislative power to affect
lives, jobs and Europe's wealth. That is why the European elections on June
9 matter.

<TEXT>
Sir, I suspect that the 'naive faith' on the part of some senior Whitehall
decision-takers ('Value for money', April 26) has far less to do with
perceived need for outside, objective endorsement for significant projects

indemnity insurance policy in the event of a failure.
More is the pity, for, as you say, management consultancy properly and
positively employed can prove excellent value for money.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Investment thrives on instability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Barry Riley's concerns at the instability in markets created by US
mutual funds flows ('American money brings new risks to markets', April 27)
ignores real life and common sense.
He reports that the financial economist Mr Henry Kaufman has 'worries' about
this instability - I would suggest that Mr Kaufman is pointing at the dragon
in the cave but ignoring the gold it is sitting on. In the words of the
billionaire investor Warren Buffet in his latest annual report: 'True
investors welcome volatility.' The risks of instability create opportunities
for those prepared to take advantage of them - the forced buying or selling
by mutual funds coping with customer money flows is confronted in the
marketplace by those with the nous to anticipate and capitalise on it.
I find Mr Kaufman's suggestion of a 60-90 day withdrawal notice period from
mutual funds laughable. First, he wrongly assumes that mutual fund managers
have no ability to anticipate redemptions and take appropriate action.
Second, the market would move to discount the ending of a particularly
choppy period by looking at fund flows - and could create the sort of
volatility Mr Kaufman is seeking to diminish. Third, his concerns presuppose
a 'correct' level of volatility to which the notice period would encourage
reversion. I would love to see his suggestions as to what this level should
be.
Perhaps Mr Riley's next article should be to examine how much money
investors could have made recently by actively taking advantage of market
conditions, rather than sitting around fretting about them like Mr Kaufman.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Free to be held captive: Britain's tough immigration laws
are unfair and carry an economic price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than two centuries ago Lord Justice Mansfield established the doctrine
that any human being who set foot on English soil automatically enjoyed the
rights of a free man under English law. First and foremost among those
rights is the one enshrined in the Habeas Corpus Act, passed in the reign of
Charles II, which forbids the detention or imprisonment of anyone unless due
cause is established in court.
But Lord Mansfield's doctrine took a severe knock when parliament passed the
Immigration Act in 1971. That law gives immigration officers the right to
detain anyone arriving in the UK for as long as it takes to decide whether
that person has a right to enter the country and, if not, whether he should
be given leave to do so.
Under this provision, people can be detained indefinitely. There is one
person now in HM Holding Centre Haslar (a prison near Portsmouth) who has
been in detention for a year and four months - and even that is not the
record.
After visiting Campsfield Detention Centre near Oxford earlier this year I
received many telephone calls from people held there who have requested
political asylum. One of them, Appolinaire Egny - a computer technician who
defected from the ruling party in the Ivory Coast, and fled the country
after his brother was arrested last autumn - wrote me a letter of such
eloquence that I felt I must try to help him. On the advice of the Refugee
Legal Centre I sent a fax to the chief immigration officer at Heathrow
airport, where Mr Egny's file is kept, asking that he be spared further
detention and offering to have him as a house guest pending a final decision
on his case.
In reply I got a courteous phone call. The officer regretted he could not
grant temporary admission to Mr Egny at this stage, 'for reasons I am not at
liberty to disclose'. I asked if Mr Egny's lawyer was aware of those
reasons. 'No. It's not our policy to give reasons. Our powers are
discretionary.'
The officers of Charles I or Charles II could not have put it better. As for
Lord Mansfield, he must be turning in his grave.
If Mr Egny had been arrested for a crime, the police would have had to
convince a magistrate that there were good reasons to remand him in custody;
otherwise he would be entitled to bail. But the Bail Act does not apply to
people held under immigration law.
To such complaints there is a standard reply: 'If you don't like it you are
free to go'; that is, to be deported to your country of origin. But that
begs the question which is being examined, namely whether the applicant can
safely return home. 'Alas,' wrote Mr Egny in his letter to me, 'today, if I
could return home I would, with fanfares and hymns of joy.' But to do so
'would be bold to the point of madness'.
The same catch 22, or a similar one, has overturned Lord Mansfield's
judgment even more directly. There are people in Britain today who are to
all intents and purposes slaves. They are domestic servants whose passports
are in their employer's possession. In some cases they do not even have
passports of their own, but enter the country on their employer's passport,
as if they were his or her child. They work up to 18 hours a day for very
low wages, and sometimes are not allowed out of the house or flat for weeks
on end. In most cases they dare not complain, for they know that if their
employer dismisses them they have no right to be in the country, and
therefore no chance of finding any other legal employment.
Mr Dudley Fishburn, a Tory MP, went to the Home Office last week to try to
win some protection for these people. But any protection they are offered
will be meaningless unless it includes the right to stay in the country and
seek work. Their situation is only an extreme form of the jeopardy in which
millions of illegal immigrants live throughout the industrialised world.
Such immigrants frequently work in health and safety conditions far below
the legal standard, but dare not complain for fear of being deported.
Thus tough immigration laws create a kind of apartheid between the legal
residents of a country, who enjoy various human, civil and social rights,
and the illegal residents who do not. Such laws also interfere with economic
freedom. According to Allan Findlay, director of the Applied Population
Research Unit at Glasgow University, 'the UK government's negative attitude
to immigration has sold the country short. It has failed to reap the
economic benefits from selective skilled migration, foregone the investment
and jobs which entrepreneurs could provide, and prevented companies from
benefiting fully from inter-company transfers.'
That is one of the conclusions of a recent study by the Institute for Public
Policy Research*, which exposes the protectionist reflexes behind current
British immigration policy. In trade policy the UK government is rightly
sceptical of the notions that economic activity is a zero-sum game, that
there is a finite pool of jobs to be shared out, and that rewards for
foreigners necessarily mean losses for UK citizens. Yet those are precisely
the assumptions that dominate immigration policy, and which are so
unquestioned that Home Office officials approached by the IPPR could not
even see 'what purpose new research would serve'. Ministers 'had already
decided what immigration policy should be,' and 'they doubted that ministers
would reconsider their approach'.
Perhaps new ministers are needed, as well as new research.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Challenge to human resource
management theory lacks evidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms SUE FERNIE and Mr DAVID METCALF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mark McKergow (Letters, April 11) expresses concern about the fact that
our measure of employee-management relations is subjective. This is so: how
can it not be? But the suggestion that human resource managers would be more
likely to report worse industrial relations than traditional managers is
mere speculation. After all, their whole raison d'etre is to improve such
relations. The fact that managers responsible for personnel report honestly
is supported by the high correlation between their responses and those of
worker representatives, which are almost identical across the 2,000 plus
workplaces. This implies that our measure accurately represents the climate
of relations in these work places.
No one denies that the bottom line in human resource management (HRM) is
profitability and financial performance; Duncan Brown (Letters, April 11)
seems to suggest we do. But surely HRM is also supposed to produce good
industrial relations? To the best of our knowledge ours is the first UK
study that attempts to relate HRM practices to either industrial relations
or economic outcomes. We shall be interested to see the evidence alluded to
by Mr Brown that 'HRM practitioners have been making major strides in
fighting the British disease' (whatever that is). We know of no other
research which relates HRM practices to economic outcomes.
Our own work suggests a dichotomy. HRM appears to be associated with better
economic outcomes in the workplace - higher productivity and better
performance on the jobs front - but worse industrial relations outcomes -
higher number of resignations, higher absenteeism and less good relations
between management and employees. Instead of making cheap points against
empirical research Mr Brown should give us his evidence on this important
topic.
Tom Barry (Letters, April 11) is reluctant to admit that personnel
hierarchies exist in workplaces. They do - you only have to look at National
Health Service trusts. But even in 'flatter' organisations someone has to
take decisions. Therefore it is important to consider what makes for good or
bad relations. Our own work casts doubt on the self-serving idea that HRM
techniques are the vision of the future, for better management/employee
relations.

Edith Wharton, the American turn-of-the-century novelist with a literary
style similar to that of her friend Henry James, has finally been discovered
by the movie people. The Age of Innocence was a blockbuster, but while Ethan
Frome is a much more powerful novel, or rather novella, its economy of
character and place hardly merits the Hollywood treatment, and it gets the
BBC2 touch (9pm). A story of thwarted love in the frozen wastes of New
England, it stars Liam Neeson in the title role.
The RSPCA is one of the UK's favourite charities and it should receive more
windfalls after QED's Casualties of the Wild (BBC 1, 9.35pm), which looks at
the work of the RSPCA's first purpose-built wildlife hospital in Norfolk.
This soft-centered alternative to Casualty features infected seals,
abandoned fox cubs, young deers knocked down by cars, and shot buzzards.
Veterinary manager Ian Robinson, who tends the wounded, may yet become the
most popular man in the country.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Arts: Unsullied by wit, taste or quality - Television /
Michael Thompson-Noel erases purveyors of small screen tosh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Soon, we are told, our homes will be bombarded by hundreds of television
channels, including, possibly, some from other planets. I look forward to
tuning into Planet Janet. But long before then, to help us chart a course
through the videogrunge of hundreds of earthly channels, we will enter the
era of MTN-TV.
We will buy a black box that will channel-surf for us, selecting, recording,
and, I hope, editing a nightly menu of programmes, or bits of programmes,
that will cater to our specific tastes and needs.
I wish I had MTN-TV now. By the longest of chalks, British television is the
best in the world - so good, indeed, that I cannot keep up with it. If I had
MTN-TV now, it would do the job for me by analysing my viewing habits and
noting my instructions. Despite the quality of British television, much
would be zapped, censored and expunged. Here are 10 things that would be
obliterated from MTN-TV:
1. Naffness, rubbish and condescension. This would erase, at a stroke, the
whole of ITV, which is now realising its destiny as a petfood-and-tampon
channel unsullied by wit, taste or quality. It is a channel for proles, to
imprison them in naffdom. What a load of tosh it is, personified, for me, by
such nightmarish visions as Matthew Kelly, Michael Barrymore, Bruce Forsyth
and Cilla Black - especially Black, whose squalidness and commonness,
calculated so precisely, is as malign as anti-matter. She should be shot
into space, to expire in near-vacuum.
Funnily enough, I like commercials. Federico Fellini once praised British
commercials as mini-wonders, so once a week MTN-TV will screen a 30-minute
carousel of the latest ads.
2. Violence. There will be plenty of (consensual) sex on MTN-TV, but no
violence whatsoever. I hate it desperately, especially in news shows, where
producers' fondness for hospital footage of war-wounded children and other
carnage is a form of pornography.
3. Channel 4 News. It is apparently well-regarded, yet it makes dreariness
an art form; preciousness, too. It is not so much a news show as a
'phone-in-cum-seminar with snippets of news. I watched it last Friday.
Presenter Jon Snow was still in South Africa, though there was no news to
speak of. His first item, on the South African election, lasted 15 minutes
and contained no news whatsoever. To learn what is going on, MTN-TV will
rely on the BBC.
4. Medical programmes. I am decaying away nicely. The last thing I would
want to watch is half an hour on the prostate. As genetics research makes
more and more progress, it will be possible for us to learn about the likely
nature of our deaths. Not me. In the brave new world of MTN-TV, ignorance
will foster happiness.
5. Party political broadcasts. These will not be censored out completely.
There was one recently for the Green Party that was rather good -
intelligent, modest in its claims and free of the gallimaufry of lies that
constitutes the party-political offerings of the three big grey parties.
6. Steve Rider, presenter of Grandstand (BBC1). I watch quite a lot of
sport, but the presenters have been lobotomised. These days, given the cost
of buying the rights, sports presenters have jettisoned almost all
objectivity. Ratings are everything. Everyone is gung-ho, especially Steve
Rider. His eyes are horribly close together. That apart, I was staggered at
the stupor of sulkiness into which he slumped at the Winter Olympics when it
became apparent that Britain's Torvill and Dean  - that pair of frozen
pilchards - were not going to win the ice-dancing gold medal. T&amp;A were lucky
to win the bronze. What Rider was doing there I could not imagine.
7. Soaps and situation comedies. I used to like Coronation Street (ITV), but
can no longer find the time for it. On the other hand, MTN-TV will screen
plenty of drama, films and current affairs. There is not much drama about at
present, unless you count The Lifeboat (BBC1), in which Lynda La Plante, of
Prime Suspect fame, is said to have had a hand. It is set, says the Beeb,
'off the rugged Welsh coast.' At first I wondered if they had shot it in
Welsh, as another filmic sop to all those Welsh whingers with nothing better
to do than blow up holiday cottages. They hadn't, though even in English I
found its hairy-chestedness silly.
If there is not much drama about at present, there is a surfeit of
first-rate documentaries. QED: Plastic Fantastic (BBC1) was a marvellous
account of the alleged discovery, by Maurice Ward, an eccentric
ex-hairdresser, of a miracle plastic, a so-called 'smart' material called
Starlight which can withstand amazing heat levels and may save mankind from
invasion by Planet Janet. Starlight HQ is a bungalow in Hartlepool. Some
scientists, including Nasa's, seem impressed with Ward's claims. By some
calculations, the invention is worth billions. But Ward is proving reluctant
to share or sell his formula.
Another excellent current affairs programme was The Disorderly House of
Windsor (Channel 4), which put the boot in so effectively that I wondered if
Queen Elizabeth II and her hapless family were not about to book one-way
tickets through the Channel Tunnel to start life afresh in a small town in
Germany.
8. David Bellamy. There will be a lot of wildlife programmes on MTN-TV. In
time, our children's grandchildren will view the late 20th-century wildlife
video library in horrified amazement that we presided over the extinction of
so many species. But I can no longer watch David Bellamy's self-indulgent
antics. His heart is in the right place but his mannerisms - especially the
leaping about on all fours - made Kingdoms in Conflict: The Owl and the
Timberman (Channel 4), about the endangered northern spotted owl in
Washington state, unwatchable.
9. Weather forecasts.
10. Angela Rippon. She is the antithesis of Cilla Black in every respect,
and thus just as harmful.
Media experts and bankers to whom I spoke yesterday were delirious with
excitement at the range of viewing likes and dislikes likely to be
encountered on MTN-TV, and urged me to make it commercially available. I
said that I might.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Arts: The Moscow Festival Ballet - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We are witnessing, albeit from a distance, the worst crisis in Russian
ballet since the Bolshevik Revolution. Then, for nearly a decade, ballet had
to fight to survive and justify itself in a new society. That it did so,
manacled by the doctrine of socialist realism, and flourished, says more for
the grand aspirations of the Russian spirit than for socialism. Now, without
the sanctions - or the support - of the former regime, Russian ballet must
seek to retain its dignity, must adjust to new market forces, must go into
the market-place, and must, ultimately, regenerate for a new era.
So the great companies tour, playing their traditional repertory in ever
bigger and less convincing arenas, haemorrhaging dancers and teachers,
living off an aesthetic that has faded with the commissars. So smaller and
opportunistic ensembles are formed, trading on the West's belief that the
words 'Russian' and 'Ballet' are guarantee enough of quality. That they are
not has latterly been all too clear: I have found little to admire in
performances by such outfits as Moscow City Ballet, with its rickety
classical stagings in tremulous performance.
It is pleasing, then, to welcome Moscow Festival Ballet, returned for a
third visit to smaller regional theatres. The company has 30 dancers. Its
repertory offers gems from the classics - at best, the second acts of Swan
Lake and Giselle - but its director, Sergey Radchenko, whom we remember with
the Bolshoi, has recruited interesting soloists, and his dancers are
well-trained. (None of those innocent bodies who look as if they should have
been in bed - or ballet class - hours ago). The added cachet is the
presence, as in previous visits, of Lubov Kunakova, a guest ballerina, a
real ballerina, from the Kirov.
There results an evening, as I saw at the Beck Theatre in Hayes on Monday
night, which neither cheats the public nor the idea of Russian ballet.
Staging is basic - the Hayes lighting was, one might say, unco-operative -
but the second act of Giselle which opened the evening was absolutely
credible, absolutely what it purported to be, a comment I would be reluctant
to make about other stagings, both here and abroad. After the initial shock
of Hilarion's entrance - he goes mad alone on stage before our very eyes -
the text and the performances were serious. In the case of Kunakova, we were
given an interpretation of complete authority. A sense of tradition (that
mysterious quality that makes the dance seem inevitable), eloquent lyricism,
showed us Giselle as it ought to be shown - by a ballerina mistress of her
art. It was in many ways an 'old-fashioned' performance  - this is where
tradition speaks most clearly about how each incident, each dance-phrase,
must be shaped - and I thought it commanding, true. The Albrecht, Alexey
Kremnyov, was promising, but still finding his way into the role. The
Myrtha, Saule Rakhmedova, and her wilis, were good. The Beck stage is
shallow, but the production (even with taped accompaniment) made one forget
this. As in those long-gone days when I used to go to the Mercury Theatre
and see ballet crammed on to a six-metre-square stage, I believed. There is
no greater tribute.
The second part of the evening (I saw one of two programmes which vary in
their components) was given over to divertissement numbers. The Pas de
Quatre looked coy - Taglioni as a nervous hostess - and a pas d'action from
Esmeralda was a dark moment of the soul, but in Marina Alexandrova there was
an Aurora of distinction, having a lovely seriousness for the last great
duet, while as fireworks we had the Solovyov-Sedoy Gopak, and the Spring
Waters duet, whose costumes (pale green chiffon outfits for him and her)
suggest mad cross-dressing, but whose athleticism is of Olympic standard.
One reproach: there was no indication of the casting from a list of
alternative names in the programme. The public is owed this courtesy.
Moscow Festival Ballet tours until May 31.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Arts: Berio roundly celebrated - David Murray welcomes
'Renderings' on the South Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the South Bank, a retrospective festival of Luciano Berio's music is well
underway. 'Renderings' - the label reflects Berio's penchant for doing
things over again, both other composers' things and his own - goes on until
May 14 (a semi-staged BBC performance of his opera La vera storia). It is
strange to think of this inquiring, playful, sensuous spirit as suddenly
belonging to a Grand Old Man. Actually his 70th anniversary is not this
year, but next; so we may be in for the protracted kind of musical birthday
party that has enjoyed a recent vogue.
On Friday Berio conducted the Halle Orchestra in a programme that might have
been designed to highlight his elusive twinkle, and his restless revisiting
of old sites. First we had Twice upon . . ., a new participation-piece
designed for children from a half-dozen primary schools, with ten Halle
players to guide them through noisy high-jinks. Not so much a score, more a
set of crowd-control directions, but there were unmistakable Berio moments:
some suspended chords, luminously spaced just so, and his comic relish for
superimposing disparate ideas without letting them blend.
We also heard his officially-titled Rendering (1990), a respectful mock-up
of late Schubert sketches (D936A) for a symphony in D, with dreamy,
celesta-iced interludes out of other late Schubert and Berio's own
knight's-move fancies. Not quite enough of the one or of the other, I
thought: Schubert's fragments too little fleshed out for a vital
reconstruction, Berio's elaborations too shy and bitty to turn the whole
thing into an honest post-modern exercise. But interesting, of course, and
attractive; Berio is never less than interesting or attractive.
Among the famous post-Schoenberg modernists of the 1950s and 1960s - Boulez,
Stockhausen, Barraque, Nono, Maderna - Berio already had more of a
pre-'modern' oeuvre to his name than most. Only in the early 1950s, when he
married a ground-breaking young artist, the American mezzo Cathy Berberian
(their creative partnership survived his subsequent marriages) and began
studying with Dallapiccola, did the new possibilities of atonality and
serialism seize his imagination. So did the extra-musical allure of
'semiotics', language as radically re-studied by Eco, Sanguineti and
Calvino.
Though British critics have preferred not to examine that side of Berio too
closely, it is no less central to his mature work than 'pure' musical
serialism. Even in his early, conscientiously formal experiments, Berio
scores sounded more transparent and lyrical, more direct and often more
mischievously inconsequent - more Italian  - than anything by his
Euro-revolutionary comrades. His fascination with procedures has always been
leavened by his concern for the human voice, and what - in countless
different ways  - it can say.
Friday's main work was his 'new' quasi-cantata Epiphanies, for mezzo and
orchestra. This is Berio's latest, joined-up and presumably definitive
version of what used to be his looser Epifanie sequence (1969), but was
originally a set of brief studies (1959-62: Quaderni, 'notebooks') for the
overweeningly large orchestra that a lucky young composer could command in
those palmy days. Berio soon wanted to interpolate vocal movements amongst
them. Sung, spoken or muttered, the 'epiphanies' are drawn from revered
Euro-authors (Proust and Joyce, Machado and Brecht); here, young Charlotte
Hellekant was superbly in command of Berberian's wide-ranging multilingual
role.
Re-adjusted by Berio's master hand, the dramatic half-hour sequence of
Epiphanies - more exactly, its rhetorical succession of highs and lows,
limpid breadths and gnomic compression - works a treat. It grips, surprises
and convinces.
In detail, however, it seems more of an autobiographical music-album than a
integral whole. The earliest Quaderni bits are impacted neo-Webern shards;
they share few of their manners with Berio's later solo-voice effusions,
when the challenges of his unadorned Sequenze forced him to seek plain,
ground-level ways of developing his music for ordinary ears. The fruits of
that experience can be heard in the remaining concerts, and in particular
the complete, astonishing Sequenze will be delivered by suitable virtuosi
this Thursday.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: Running on rubbish -
Christopher Brown-Humes on a plan to exploit the high energy value of waste
packaging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Applying the term 'value-added' to waste may seem odd, but it goes to the
heart of a European plastics industry initiative to use ordinary waste
packaging for energy.
The high energy value of plastics and paper usually discarded with the rest
of the household rubbish can be exploited by using them as a fuel in a
conventional power plant rather than a municipal solid waste incinerator
(MSW).
The project's backers claim the process saves fossil fuel resources and
reduces landfill requirements at a price that is both environmentally and
economically acceptable.
Tests at plants in Sweden and Finland have shown that the process is
technically viable. Now the challenge will be persuading local authorities
and power plants throughout Europe to adopt it.
If they do, as much as 30m tonnes of the 50m tonnes of combustible packaging
which Europe consumes every year could be used for power generation. That is
more than four times the current level, and would represent a saving of 14m
tonnes of oil worth Pounds 1bn.
The initiative is being promoted by the Association of Plastics
Manufacturers in Europe (APME), with support from a number of plastics and
packaging manufacturers and the Finnish government.
Combustible used packaging, when converted into a fuel, has a higher energy
value than peat, wood or brown coal - plastic is, after all, made from oil.
The basic product, refuse-derived fuel (RDF), is municipal solid waste from
which food, glass and metals have been removed. It has a net calorific value
of 15 megajoules per kilogram, compared with the 10 MJ/kg rating of ordinary
municipal solid waste. Packaging-derived fuel (PDF) is a refined, drier,
version of RDF, with a 20 MJ/kg calorific value.
The idea is to use the packaging as a co-fuel, rather than on its own,
because quantities of RDF and PDF are relatively limited and plants would
probably need to spend more on changing the combustion chamber and modifying
flue-gas cleaning equipment if the proportion of RDF/PDF feed were to rise
above 30 per cent.
'In most areas there will never be enough PDF to feed a plant. But there
will be a power plant that is able to take all the PDF waste in an area as
some 5 per cent to 20 per cent of its feed,' says Martin Frankenhaeuser, a
project manager in plastics and the environment at Borealis Polymers. He
says the technique brings energy from waste within the scope of small local
authorities which usually do not have access to an MSW incinerator.
At the Kauttua combined heat and power plant in Finland, RDF/PDF has been
used as a substitute for coal in trials over the past year. The tests have
demonstrated that packaging can be used as a substitute fuel without higher
overall emission levels and without damaging equipment.
Reduced coal use has cut sulphur dioxide pollution; however, the higher
plastics content has increased hydrogen chloride emissions. Chlorine is
present in substances such as PVC, and its corrosive power is the main
reason that the combustion equipment is being so closely inspected for signs
of damage.
Supporters of RDF and PDF combustion say it fits in well with the broader
recycling trend.
According to Fred Mader, deputy director general of APME, combustion and
recycling are different solutions to the problem of plastics waste, rather
than alternatives.
'Recycling can maximise the environmental benefit of recovering plastics
bottles and containers. But there is no benefit from collecting, sorting and
cleaning lightweight plastics films,' says Mader.
One reason for believing the initiative has a future is the increasing
political resistance to the burning of unsorted waste in municipal solid
waste incinerators. Older MSW plants have been condemned on both economic
and environmental grounds.
This had led plastics industry experts to suggest that, in future, building
plants capable of using RDF and PDF as a majority fuel may be more
attractive than constructing additional MSW incineration capacity. But this
applies only to densely populated areas where volume of supply could be
assured.
An important issue will be cost. Kauttua has not had to make significant
outlays because it has a suitable 'fluidised bed' boiler technology and
because it already has a suitable feeding system, handling waste paper from
a nearby mill.
Other power plants are likely to have to install a receiving area and
feeding line for the material, at the very least. But they could also have
to make much more substantial investments, particularly if they do not have
'fluidised bed' boilers.
Assessing the scale of such investments is just one of the tasks for the
APME to consider when it studies the potential for packaging combustion in
power plants in five countries - the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Sweden -
in the coming months.
It will also have to take into account the fact that many European countries
do not have well-developed networks for separating types of waste.
Establishing one would immediately create an extra cost burden.
There is also the vexed issue of who pays. Will power plants accept the
plastics industry's contention that packaging fuel has a positive value,
because it is cheaper than coal, and because savings on raw materials would
more than cover additional installation, operation and maintenance costs. In
other words, would power plants be prepared to pay for waste packaging?
It is a question that will almost certainly have to be taken up in the
broader context of recycling and landfill costs.
Mader stresses that there is a long way to go, not least because the public
tends to link incineration with pollution. This will inevitably complicate
the task of securing changes to current legislation, he says. But he still
believes that up to 15 per cent of Europe's plastics waste could be used for
energy recovery by 2000.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: A new look for an old forest -
David Lascelles discovers a woodland being remodelled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The wind is blowing so hard that it is all Brian Mahony can do to keep his
plans and maps straight. We are deep in the English Lakeland fells looking
across the Duddon Valley at the wooded slopes of Hardknott.
The forest is one of the most sensitive of the many managed by Forest
Enterprise, the operating arm of the Forestry Commission. It covers the east
flank of Harter Fell, a peak close to the central Scafell group which forms
the backdrop to some of the most dramatic scenery in the Lake District
National Park.
Mahony is Forest Enterprise's district manager, and his papers contain plans
to reshape the forest to take account of the growing environmental pressures
which now have to be balanced against the traditional goal of timber
production. It was not always this way.
The Forestry Commission acquired this huge estate at the head of the Duddon
Valley in 1936. But before it could smother the area with trees, it was
prevailed upon by the Council for the Protection of Rural England to sell
off a big part of it, keeping only Hardknott for planting.
The result is that much of the top of the valley remains unspoilt. But
Hardknott bears the marks of the production-driven planting practices of 50
years ago. The 1,400-acre forest is mostly fir, laid out in orderly ranks
with little regard for the contours of the surrounding landscape.
However, half a century later, Hardknott is now being harvested, and this
gives Mahony an opportunity to remodel the forest. He has two master plans.
The first is the felling plan. Rather than raze whole areas in angular
shapes, the aim is to phase the felling in order to soften the outlines and
introduce variety.
The second is the restocking plan. Landscape designers have prepared a
scheme to plant a greater variety of trees in groups which blend in with the
line of the fell.
Mahony's plans are a patchwork of coloured blobs representing different
varieties. Spruce will continue to dominate the upper slopes because it is
best suited to the cold, wet conditions there. The middle slopes will have
more larch and Scots pine with broad-leaved trees for the lower slopes.
Forest Enterprise now has forest design plans for each of its woodlands, all
based around 'multiple purpose forestry' which combines commercial forestry
with the environment, conservation and recreational uses.
Although the organisation would like Hardknott to be exemplary of its
approach to forestry in a national park, it is not typical. 'What we're
doing here is at the upper end of the spectrum because it's a very special
site,' says Geoff Hatfield, director of the north and east England region.
The difficulty is that while Forest Enterprise has become more
environmentally aware, it is also coming under increasing pressure to
operate commercially and transform its annual operating loss into a profit.
This pressure would grow if the government considers privatising the
Forestry Commission, which is one of the options currently before ministers.
The redesign of Hardknott forest will reduce its yield in the long term
because fewer trees will be planted, and a greater proportion will be
slow-growing hardwoods. Harvesting is also expensive there because felling
is to be phased over 30 years, and the logs hauled down the Duddon Valley's
tiny lanes in specially designed lorries which can only manage 100 tonnes a
week. And if the true Lakeland appearance of the forest is to be preserved,
dry stone walls will have to be rebuilt and maintained, at heavy cost.
'Would a private-sector company take so much trouble?' wonders Hatfield,
rather implying that they would not. He also stresses the wide public access
which the Forestry Commission grants to its woodlands, something which
private owners might restrict.
But at the same time, he says that Forest Enterprise 'does not pull its
punches' in its quest for commercial viability. Costs have been sharply
reduced, and much of the work is now contracted out to private firms.
Efficiency is one reason why Forest Enterprise will continue its unpopular
practice of planting trees in tidy rows at Hardknott because it makes access
easier and encourages trees to grow to the required size and shape.
Harvesting is done using highly efficient machines which can fell, strip and
saw several dozen trees per hour.
A few miles east of Hardknott lies Grizedale, the largest Lakeland forest,
where Forest Enterprise has already gone some way to try to balance timber
production with its environmental and leisure objectives. Tourists are
encouraged to use the forest: there is a visitor centre, and cyclists and
walkers can use the tracks and trails.
All told, Forest Enterprise has 11,500 ha of land in the Lake District, and
produces 75,000 tonnes of timber a year, which makes it one of the biggest
landowners and commercial operators in the national park. This puts a
premium on good relations with the park authority.
Alan Fishwick, the park's assistant chief planning officer, says that Forest
Enterprise's new approach based on forest design plans is a welcome
development. 'We are involved at an early stage, which has enabled common
objectives to be agreed,' he says.
Tony Juniper, forestry specialist at Friends of the Earth, agrees there has
been 'a dramatic change' in the Commission's approach. 'They juggle their
various objectives much better than they did 10 years ago,' he says.
But there is also concern in the Lake District park about the growing
commercial pressures on the Forestry Commission, and the possibility of
privatisation. These pressures, Fishwick says, 'are bound to have an
influence on what can be achieved, and we do have concerns about the scale
and impact of clear felling, for example'.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Management: Unwieldy giant reborn in a glen - James Buxton
explains how IBM's Greenock plant increased output while lowering
manufacturing costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The problems facing IBM's personal computer business have been highlighted
this week with news of another imminent shake-up in top management. Yet the
operating challenge for IBM is better illustrated by recent changes at its
manufacturing complex at Greenock in Scotland.
The aim of this reorganisation - to focus more on the needs of the customer
 -merely brings the company into line with its competitors. But the scale of
the transformation has been formidable, for the Greenock site is Big Blue's
biggest manufacturing site for personal computers.
Whether the changes will be sufficient to restore this IBM business to
healthy profitability remains to be seen - the personal computer market,
after all, is notorious for its volatility, for tiny margins and for the
tendency of competitors to rise from almost nowhere and gain market share.
What cannot be denied is that in the past 18 months the seemingly unwieldy
IBM facility at Greenock has greatly reduced its unit manufacturing costs,
while increasing the volume of output by 50 per cent.
The improvement followed the restructuring in September 1992 of IBM's
Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn) PC business, with the setting up of a
semi-autonomous company called IBM PC. It also involved a more radical
approach than the sort of job cutting which marked IBM's productivity gains
in the 1980s.
Despite this, IBM's leading share of the European PC market, which had
touched 15 per cent in 1990, had been eroded to about 12 per cent by 1992 as
rival manufacturers undercut IBM on price for broadly similar products, and
responded more speedily to orders.
IBM PC was set up in response to these pressures. Greenock, which is almost
entirely run by Scots, took over the distribution of PCs in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa, and 14 distribution operations in different
countries were wound up. Previously the country subsidiaries, such as IBM
France, had given Greenock a forecast of their needs and then stockpiled
computers when they arrived from the plant.
'We used to ship to plan,' says Bob Beaty, director of manufacturing and
operations at Greenock, 'regardless of actual demand or what the individual
customer wanted. We then realised that we had to ship to order.'
Companies such as Dell in the US and Vobis in Germany had already begun
manufacturing to order. But IBM faced the particular challenge of achieving
change in a large-scale manufacturing operation and over such a far-flung
distribution network.
Greenock began the process with its Valuepoint range of low-priced
computers, then moved on during 1993 to the PS/1, PS/2 and Thinkpad notebook
ranges. Beaty says the plant can now ship a product within 10 days of
receiving an order.
The orders come from dealers, country subsidiaries or even individuals. 'The
printer churns them out 24 hours a day,' he says. 'We might get an order for
400 Valuepoints all of the same configuration, but they could all be in
different permutations. The customer might want his applications software
preloaded in the factory.'
The plant, he says, can now respond to those demands. 'The complexity of the
business is not the manufacturing, it is the logistics. This is more of a
logistics machine than a manufacturing plant.'
A smooth components flow is essential to the successful running of the
Greenock plant, though many high-value items are common to many product
lines, reducing the diversity of the stocks needed. Beaty attributes the
cost savings to two factors: a higher degree of vertical integration in the
plant than many of its rivals; and the fact that it draws many of its inputs
from suppliers who are either a few dozen miles away or at least in the UK.
About half the mother boards which power the computer are loaded with their
tiny components inside the Greenock plant. The rest come from six outside
suppliers, four of them in other parts of central Scotland.
Some 50 per cent of all monitors are made in the plant, with the rest coming
from two local suppliers. Keyboards are made on site. Some assembly and
testing of computers is carried out by contract manufacturers nearby.
While many European computer makers import about half their components from
the Far East, Greenock depends for 40 to 50 per cent of its inputs on
businesses based in the UK. It brings in just 15 per cent from the Far East,
with the rest coming from Europe and a small amount from the US.
'We can compete against the Far East with UK costs,' says John McClelland,
Beaty's superior who has overall responsibility for supplying not only
Greenock's market area but also Australia and Japan. 'Having a local
supplier base is a pretty valuable resource.'
Beaty acknowledges that the change to manufacturing to order has been
'extremely difficult, but we feel much more in touch with what's happening
at the customer end. That is vitally important.'
Greenock executives say that since the plant switched to manufacturing to
order it has cut its inventory by 25 per cent in absolute terms, while
output has risen by between 15 and 20 per cent a year. The cost of what IBM
calls 'fulfilment' - the processing of orders and the delivery of the
product to the customer - has been reduced by two-thirds.
McClelland will not give financial details of Greenock's performance, though
Jerry York, chief financial officer of IBM, acknowledged recently that its
margins on PCs were lower than those of competitors.
McClelland says that thanks partly to reductions in production costs the
company has been regaining market share in Europe in the past year and a
half, and quotes an estimate by industry analysts Dataquest that its share
of the worldwide PC market rose to 13.6 per cent in 1993.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Management: On the road to procrastination - Adrian Furnham
offers tips on how to perfect your decision-avoidance technique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Having to make important decisions causes considerable stress. Psychologists
in the 1960s made monkeys develop stomach ulcers and other signs of
corporate stress simply by forcing them to make decisions. In the now
notorious 'executive monkey' studies, otherwise carefree animals had to
choose between options with significant physical consequences such as
electric shock. The consistent monitoring and worrying led them to become
ill.
And so it is with the modern manager. Told constantly about the importance
of change, development, customer satisfaction etc, many middle and senior
managers long for a period of stability or as the prayer-book has it,
'eternal changelessness'.
The stress of decision-making quite naturally leads to the development of
numerous effective decision-avoidance techniques. Without doubt, the most
popular is to appoint a committee to help the delaying tactics. A good
decision-avoidance committee is a group of people who individually prefer to
do nothing and who collectively can meet and decide that nothing can be
done. Furthermore, the possibility of avoiding a decision increases in
proportion to the square of the number of members of the committee.
Committee behaviour positively facilitates decision-avoidance. Thus, as
Parkinson observed, the time spent on any item on the agenda is inversely
proportional to the sum of money involved. But committees can also handle
trivial matters promptly, while the important issues are delayed and rarely
solved. But from the delay perspective there is always one sure result; if a
committee meets over a long enough period of time, the meetings become more
important than the problem they were intended to solve.
People are unused to thinking in groups - they talk, argue, adjudicate,
compromise, joke - but they do not think. In consequence, a really new
creative idea tends to destabilise groups and upset consensus. The committee
is thus a group which is impelled to agree and is instinctively hostile to
that which is divisive or new.
Failing the decision-by-committee avoidance tactic, individuals can resort
to their own preferred approach. These avoidance techniques can be used by
the same individuals in different situations with equal effectiveness,
depending on the type and consequences of the decision and personality of
the decision-taker. Probably the six most favoured methods of avoiding a
decision are:
The temper-tantrum method. Here the decision-avoider regresses to the
behaviour pattern of a spoilt two-year-old. Call the decision-requester
names, stamp the foot, appear outraged or insulted or even apoplectic. If
possible weep with indignation. Often the surprised and embarrassed
requester will immediately step down.
The hush-hush method. Call the requester to one side, and in a
conspiratorial stage whisper, point out that he/she is rushing in where
angels fear to tread. Suggest that they clearly don't understand the latest
company figures, the real wishes of the CEO, the contents of the secret
corporate plan etc, and that requesting such a decision will make them look
naive, even idiotic. Threatened with this sort of career-limiting move, most
decision-requesters will back off.
The clarification method. This is the 'more details please' approach. The
person requesting a decision is asked to provide more specifically the
reason for, and the nature and consequences of, the possible options
available. This analysis-paralysis method is aimed at exhausting the
decision-requester as a fisherman exhausts a great marlin at the end of a
line. The request for clarification is potentially endless and had nothing
to do with actually gaining information. Most requesters eventually give up
and thus no decision is made.
The double-talk method. This method is favoured by those with a command of
consultant psychobabble or consultant-speak. The use of management jargon
can easily confuse those not fully conversant in this ambiguous language.
Try: 'But that's against the delayering, re-engineering ethos of this
company' or 'How does that square with empowerment quality-circles?'. The
aim is to confuse the requester.
The denial method. Delay is the deadliest form of denial but also the most
primitive. By denying that a decision has to be made and that a situation
requires change can be very effective. Said with the square-jaw of 'they
shall not pass', the denial technique, if consistent, has been known to be
highly effective.
The 'that's your problem shorty' method. This method is to hand the problem
straight back to the requester. The idea is to make them feel weak, selfish,
even demanding, but this requires skill in developing the appropriate degree
of hauteur. Handing the problem back to the requester needs to make them
feel they should either be adapting to the current situation or making the
decision for themselves.
Some might side with Victor Kiam, who noted that 'procrastination is
opportunity's natural assassin'. But decision-avoiders are more likely to
believe Thurber's 'He who hesitates is often saved'. Don't procrastinate -
learn a decision-avoidance technique today.

FT  04 MAY 94 / People: No Roche at Morgan Stanley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of London's more charismatic market strategists, David Roche, 47, is
leaving Morgan Stanley International, where has has established a reputation
for forthright and accurate analysis and research covering areas as diverse
as the ERM and the internal problems of the former Soviet Union.
With Morgan Stanley since 1987, Roche is now setting up his own research
bureau.
Called Independent Strategy and based in Bond Street in the heart of
London's West End, the new company will produce briefings and generate
investment ideas for fund managers, in exchange for consulting fees.
Roche says the break away from Morgan Stanley is happening on the very best
of terms. As evidence of that, his erstwhile employer is to be one of
Independent Strategy's first and biggest clients.
Moreover, the move should suit both Roche and Morgan Stanley: 'It's absurd
to think in this day and age that all research should be conducted in-house.
I am moving from being Morgan Stanley's in-house general practitioner to
being its external specialist,' he says.
Roche argues that his strategy as an independent will be somewhat different,
in that it will allow him and his colleagues to give a much tighter focus to
their research and analysis.
At Morgan Stanley Roche played a key role in re-organising the bank's method
of research and analysis, forming industry teams from the previous
geographically-based style.
Among his more famous predictions was that the Berlin Wall would fall, but
he has also made a name for himself by being particularly outspoken on east
Europe and the European Union's exchange rate mechanism.
Before joining Morgan Stanley Roche worked for J P Morgan as a portfolio
manager looking at international asset allocation.
His only worry in the new role is physical - he will be cycling much less
than his current impressive daily round trip from west London to Canary
Wharf.

FT  04 MAY 94 / People: Computer People choose Roger Graham as new chairman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Computer People knows a thing or two about recruitment despite its somewhat
lacklustre performance of late. The London-based computer consultancy, which
is now back in the black after making a small loss in 1992, is undoubtedly
patting itself on the back for having snapped up Roger Graham as
non-executive chairman.
Graham (right), on the brink of 55, is one of the leading lights of the UK
computer business. A former president of the Computing Services Association
and chairman and chief executive of the BIS Group before its acquisition by
Birmingham-based ACT last year, he has been in the computer business since
1962.
He has not let the grass grow under his feet since leaving BIS. Last week he
was appointed non-executive chairman both of Mantix Systems, which
specialises in advanced business management, and of Braid Systems which
develops messaging software. Both are small, interesting companies with
novel products.
An engineer by background, Graham was educated at Cambridge University where
he crossed paths with several other individuals who became luminaries in the
UK computing services business. He says, however, that his chief interests
as a student was politics, an interest he still indulges, and flying small
aeroplanes.
He first joined International Business Machines as a systems engineer, made
his name in sales and then moved to BIS where he stayed for 24 years.
Graham's entrepreneurial spirit remains bright; he talks enthusiastically of
the opportunities in networked desk-top computers. The prerequisites for a
new venture would be, however, 'the right opportunity and the right people'.

<TEXT>
Mark Ellsmore has been appointed to the new full-time post of executive
director - Asia Pacific at TI Group, the specialist engineering concern.
The appointment comes two months after TI announced it had reached agreement
with the Sembawang Group, a leading Singapore-based industrial conglomerate,
to develop business opportunities in the Asia Pacific region.
TI said Ellsmore, aged 44, would pursue this initiative and ensure
appropriate group resources are allocated to other strategic opportunities
in the region.
The company believes the Asia Pacific offers strong growth opportunities for
all three of its core buinesses, John Crane, Bundy and Dowty.
Ellsmore joined TI Group in 1998 and became finance director of John Crane
International in 1992.
He will report to James Roe, director of strategic development, who said
Ellsmore's background in finance and marketing and his international
experience made him particularly well-suited to his new role.

Crestacare, the UK's third biggest private operator of nursing homes, has
made some board changes, promoting James Ramsay, 35, to be group finance
director. He joined the company in 1986, becoming group financial controller
in 1989. He succeeds Geoff Crowe, who remains company secretary.
The group now manages 37 nursing homes with 2,264 beds located in the north
of England, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man.
The group has picked up recently, converting a 1992 loss of Pounds 1.58m to
pre-tax profits of Pounds 341,000 in 1993, despite a number of managerial
upheavals and withdrawing from property activities. Andrew Taee, chief
executive, recently predicted the company 'will bloom' in 1994. The group is
looking at all areas of long-term health care.
Colin Brown has resigned from his non-executive directorship of the company.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Cobb, 58, a naval architect, is to take the helm of James Fisher, the
Cumbrian-based shipping group, which lost Pounds 5.6m pre-tax in its last
financial year.
He is expected to take over as full time chairman after the company's annual
meeting this month.
Fisher has been seeking a new chairman for several months following the
departure of John Hornby, who is understood to have been forced out by
shareholders unhappy with the company's performance.
Charitable trusts own nearly half the company's equity and their income has
been sharply reduced following the company's failure to pay a dividend.
Cobb has been managing director of Cochranes of Selby, chairman of Rowbotham
Tankships and was chief operating officer of Ingram International in the
mid-1980s. He will move his home to Barrow.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Recruitment: Laying down the laws of selection - The way
that psychometric tests are applied is attracting renewed scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why do recruiters place so much store on psychometric testing? It is a
question puzzling many would-be barristers who, in spite of sometimes
dazzling academic records, have failed to win a place at the Bar law school
this year.
One of the students who failed the selection system, which included the use
of a critical reasoning examination - a type of ability test  - was on
Tuesday given leave to have a judicial review of the decision. This will
examine the revised entry procedure, used this year for the first time in
awarding the 800 places on the one-year vocational course that is the main
requirement for entry to the Bar.
The irony is that the new system, devised partly to sift out perceived
prejudices, particularly against women and ethnic minority candidates,
appears to have given minorities no better chance of entry and perhaps less
than before.
There may be question marks, it seems, over the design of the selection
system which was intended to broaden the basis of recruitment to the Bar.
The motive was laudable. But some believe the law school should no longer
retain its monopoly as the only route to the Bar.
The Council of Legal Education, which runs the course, is now looking at the
possibilities of making changes to the way the tests are implemented. It may
not have been unreasonable, however, to introduce additional selection
criteria, looking beyond the possession of university degrees.
Part of any new test might involve knowledge of the real world with multiple
choice questions such as 'Is Gazza (a) a city in Italy, (b) a place where
Palestinians live, or (c) a footballer?' It is only two years ago, you may
recall, that the High Court judge, Sir Jeremiah Harman, asked 'Who is
Gazza?' during a court hearing.
Sometimes the way that tests are applied can make little sense. British Rail
was last year found to have discriminated against Asian rail guards who
wanted to be train drivers. They were given verbal tests which they failed.
When it was pointed out that verbal skills were ranked higher in the
requirements for the jobs they were already doing than the jobs they had
applied for, the industrial tribunal had no hesitation over ruling in their
favour.
The problem with psychometric tests, as in many selection procedures, is
probably one of balance in the way they are used. Finding that balance,
given the continuing debate about the effectiveness of testing, is proving
difficult and causing confusion among managers interested in exploring such
methods.
Psychometric testing is divided into two areas - ability tests and
personality tests or questionnaires. While ability tests in themselves
appear to have widespread support among psychologists, there is dissenting
opinion about the use of personality testing to measure performance
(personality criteria were not used for the bar exam).
Steve Blinkhorn and Charles Johnson, occupational psychologist at
Psychometric Research and Development, a St Alban's consultancy, earned the
opprobrium of many of their fellow practitioners three years ago for casting
doubt on the use of personality testing to predict job performance. They
accused those who applied some tests of using pseudo science which, they
said, 'bamboozles an unsophisticated public'.
It was strong stuff, particularly since it criticised some of the leading
tests on the market. In the April edition of The Psychologist magazine they
buttressed their arguments with further claims that 'proponents of the use
of personality tests for occupational selection continue to play fast and
loose with statistical methods, and to make claims which do not stand up to
close inspection.'
Their latest critique in The Psychologist concluded: 'There is no body of
public knowledge relating scores on personality tests taken as part of a
selection procedure to objective criteria of later performance sufficient to
form a basis of routine use of the tests, despite 40 or more years of
research. Yet their routine use is widespread and growing.'
Their argument is contradicted by leading test publishers such as Saville
and Holdsworth. Roy Davis, the company's head of marketing, said the value
of personality questionnaires as a predictor of success in a job was
'statistically proven' but, he added, 'they must be used with other
evidence'.
No wonder some recruiters have reservations. Many, however, do not.
Employers appear to be placing increasing trust on the recruitment skills of
their personnel departments who in turn are often eager to embrace the
latest testing methods. 'Going on tests and training courses is like getting
a badge in the boy scouts for personnel officers,' said Blinkhorn.
He suggests that psychometric testing is being commandeered by personnel
officers in order to better define their professional expertise. If this is
true there may well be a danger of too much weight given to testing in
selection. It should not become the altar on which budding careers are
sacrificed.
Whatever the outcome of the judicial review in the Bar selection case, the
argument for a more considered evaluation of tests seems convincing.
A report released by KPMG Peat Marwick last week showed that companies still
had some way to go to bring their recruitment of non-executive directors
into line with the requirements of the Cadbury report on corporate
governance.
The finding that some 51 per cent of appointments were personal selections
of the chairman might have raised a few eyebrows among Cadbury devotees but
would have caused little surprise in many boardrooms more versed in the
reality of selection.
That reality was underlined by other KPMG findings which showed that 12 per
cent of appointments were on the recommendation of an investment
institution, 12 per cent by another non-executive director, 11 per cent
sourced independently through a recruitment consultant, 13 per cent from a
nominations committee and just six per cent through Pro-Ned, the search
specialists for non-executive directorships. The reason the percentages add
up to more than 100 is that some replies gave multiple sources.
The fact that KPMG had done no specific analysis of women will have dismayed
those who have been championing women as an important source of fresh blood
for boardrooms.
Other findings of the report suggest that, while many companies may be
attracting the quality of non-executive that they deserve, it might
sometimes fall short of being the quality they require.
Nowhere is this more evident than in non-executives' use of information
sources. When they were asked from which sources they sought information
prior to their appointment, many relied heavily on information from the
company itself. Even after their appointment few of them did much in the way
of contacting external sources beyond talking to the auditors.
Less than a third of them said they consulted the press, spoke to brokers,
bankers or institutional shareholders. Less than 10 per cent bothered to
consult ProNed and hardly anyone got in touch with the Confederation of
British Industry.
The only group of non-executives more likely to look outside for information
both before and after their appointment, it said, were those who had been
recommended by an investment institution.
The report says rather delicately: 'This inward focus when seeking
information prior to the appointment could suggest either a high degree of
existing knowledge, complacency or lack of faith in external advisers.' It
could also reinforce the jaundiced belief that a non-executive directorship
can be money for old rope.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Murdoch shuffles team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three months after the Sun editor, Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, moved to satellite
television, Mr Rupert Murdoch has made further changes to his top team at
News International.
Eleven years after Mr Andrew Neil was offered the editorship of the Sunday
Times, he too is moving to television - at least for the next seven months.
At the same time the gradual disengagement of Mr Andrew Knight, once
identified by Mr Murdoch as his successor in the event of accident, went one
stage further.
For Mr Neil there is a stint as executive editor and 'star reporter' of a
new weekly current affairs programme on Mr Murdoch's Fox Television network
in the US.
As a new door opens for Mr Neil, there is, for Mr Knight, an end to
full-time employment at the newspaper group that owns five of Britain's
national newspapers.
Last November Mr Knight gave up the executive chairmanship of News
International and became chairman. Now the former chief executive of the
Daily Telegraph is stepping down as chairman of both News International and
Times Newspapers. He will be succeeded in those two posts by Mr Murdoch. Mr
Knight, a successful editor of The Economist, will remain as a non-executive
director of both companies and of their parent, News Corporation.
Mr Murdoch has produced a 'no lose' offer to tempt Mr Neil, who has long
made no secret of his desire to make some serious money away from his
editor's chair.
During the seven months that he is in New York, Mr Neil will remain editor
of the Sunday Times - although he will not edit the newspaper.
If the new show, which is designed to rival CBS' 60 Minutes, is a success,
Mr Neil is likely to sign a multi-million dollar contract.
During Mr Neil's absence, Mr John Witherow, currently managing editor (news)
will be acting editor. Mr Ivan Fallon, the present deputy editor, gives up
his executive role but 'will continue as a major columnist and writer'.

FT  04 MAY 94 / M0 increase eases fears over taxes: Indicators bolster
recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rise in money supply last month yesterday provided the first
tentative statistical evidence that the spring tax increases have not
damaged the economic recovery.
The Bank of England reported that its provisional estimate of M0, the narrow
measure of money supply, increased by a seasonally adjusted 6.2 per cent in
the year to April, well up on market expectations of a 5.8 per cent increase
and a year-on-year rise of 5.6 per cent in March.
The news strengthened market expectations that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor, would decide
against cutting bank base rates from 5.25 per cent at their monthly monetary
meeting today.
A decision to change rates was already considered highly unlikely in view of
tomorrow's local elections, recent indicators of steady first-quarter
economic growth and rising yields for UK government bonds.
Yesterday's figures for M0, normally regarded as a good guide to retail
sales, provided the first statistical evidence that the tax increases have
not deterred UK consumers. 'The figures showed there is quite a lot of
momentum in consumer demand,' said Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at James
Capel, the stockbrokers.
M0, which consists of notes and coins in circulation and banks' operational
deposits, is regarded as a normally good guide to consumer spending trends.
Although increased taxes, including value added tax on domestic fuel, higher
employee National Insurance payments and reduced mortgage interest relief,
took effect at the beginning of last month, the growth of M0 in April alone
was an adjusted 1.9 per cent, the biggest monthly rise since February 1981.
The annual rate of M0 growth continues to be well above the government's
'monitoring range' of zero to 4 per cent which is meant to be consistent
with steady non-inflationary growth. On a seasonally adjusted annualised
basis, M0 rose by 13.1 per cent in the latest three months and 9.1 per cent
in the six months to April.
Notes and coins, the core component of M0 with the most relevance to
consumer trends, increased by a seasonally adjusted 6.5 per cent in the year
to April.
Bank officials said they regarded the sharp rise in M0 as a continuing
reaction to lower UK interest rates, which reduced the cost to individuals
of holding cash balances, and the steady growth of consumer demand. However,
they did not rule out technical factors because March, April and May are
traditionally difficult months for seasonal adjustment.

A decision on the sites of additional stations on the Pounds 2.7bn Channel
tunnel rail link is expected within the next four weeks, Mr John Armitt,
chief executive of Union Railway and designer of the route, said yesterday,
Charles Batchelor writes.
The government will choose between one or more of three sites: Stratford in
east London, Rainham in Essex and Ebbsfleet in Kent, in addition to the
station being built at Ashford in Kent.
Following a decision last week on the route of the last two sections of the
link, this is the final unresolved issue before a detailed brief is issued
to prospective construction consortia in June.

FT  04 MAY 94 / CBI warns on rising wages: Factory pay 'up 2.7%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday warned manufacturers to keep
pay awards under control as it published figures that showed settlements
edging up and productivity increases slowing.
According to the latest report from the CBI's pay databank, manufacturing
pay awards averaged 2.7 per cent during the first quarter of the year.
This was a slight increase on the 2.5 per cent average for pay awards in the
three months to February and it is ahead of the current inflation rate of
2.3 per cent.
Productivity improvements fell marginally, averaging 4.4 per cent
provisionally for the first quarter, compared with 4.6 per cent in the
second half of last year.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, warned that pay behaviour during the
coming months would determine whether or not manufacturing consolidated the
competitive gains made over the past couple of years.
He said: 'Other countries in Europe are now tackling their cost
competitiveness in a determined way. German labour costs are falling and pay
settlements are running well below the inflation rate.'
Pay settlements in service companies continued to drop over the first three
months of this year. Pay awards averaged 2.4 per cent for the first three
months of the year compared with 2.6 per cent for the last quarter of 1993.
The CBI figures show that in both manufacturing and service sectors the
spread of pay awards has widened, which it believes reflects 'the varied
picture of economic activity in different industries'.
One-in-six manufacturers and one-in-four service companies had imposed pay
freezes for periods of up to 12 months in the first quarter.
Since last August, 44.7 per cent of manufacturing settlements were between
0.1 per cent and 2.5 per cent, with a further 26.4 per cent making
settlements of between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent and another 9.1 per
cent between 3.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent.
In services, 15.4 per cent of the private service settlements since last
August were freezes, while 34.8 per cent were between 0.1 and 2.5 per cent
and 28.5 per cent between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent.
Mr Alistair Hatchett of Incomes Data Services, the independent pay analysts,
said: 'Pay deals have been edging up since the start of the year reflecting
higher output and inflation. Firms appear to be settling faster because of
April's tax changes.'
The CBI databank annually covers about 1,200 settlements in manufacturing
and over 500 in services.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Banks report mortgage surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mortgage lending undertaken by leading British banks in March was more than
40 per cent higher than the equivalent figure in February, the British
Bankers' Association said yesterday.
Figures published by the association show gross lending at Pounds 1.55bn in
March, compared with Pounds 1.06bn in February, in a figure revised upwards
slightly from the originally published statistics.
There was also an increase in the number of new mortgages approved, which
reached 31,518, with a total value of Pounds 1.58bn. New mortgage approvals
are seen as an important indicator of prospects for the housing market, and
the total number for March is the highest since August last year.
Lord Inchyra, association director-general, said the figures for mortgage
approvals suggested that April's tax increases had had little immediate
impact on buyers' confidence.
While much of the increase in lending was attributed to seasonal factors, he
said that lending statistics provided 'welcome evidence of a recovery from
the normal seasonal weakness around the turn of the year'.
But the proportion of new mortgage approvals granted to first-time buyers
fell back to 46 per cent in March, from 50 per cent the month before.
The past year or so has seen intensifying competition for mortgage lending
between banks and building societies. In terms of market share, the
association said the increase in the value of new mortgages approved by
banks, at 38 per cent, was notably higher than the equivalent indicator for
building societies, where the rise in March amounted to 28 per cent.
House prices rose slightly in April, according to the Nationwide building
society index. This showed an increase of 0.2 per cent compared with March,
continuing a recent gently rising trend which takes the annual rate of
increase to 2.9 per cent.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Heseltine denies big spending ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, sought yesterday to
dampen speculation about his forthcoming white paper on competitiveness by
insisting that it would not propose big increases in government spending.
Mr Heseltine said the paper, to be published on May 16, would not contain
'gimmicks or short-term expedients' and would be consistent with the
evolutionary nature of the government's policies.
He said: 'The first priority of government in the promotion of UK
competitiveness is the proper management of the economy. Suggestions
therefore that we are about to indulge in an orgy of expenditure are not
only inaccurate but, much more to the point, would positively undermine our
own overriding priority.
'The white paper will not be the vehicle for announcing a range of lavish
new expenditure programmes. The government remains firmly committed to the
public expenditure ceilings announced by the chancellor in the Budget.'
Mr Heseltine said in a speech to the London International Financial Futures
and Options Exchange that the white paper had three main objectives: To set
out how the totality of the government's policies affected wealth-creating
businesses.
Assess the UK's competitive strengths and weaknesses.
Indicate 'how many of us in our own way are involved in the process of
helping our country to win'.
He also hinted that his proposals would contain a fresh broadside against
excessive regulation from Brussels, which he described as part of the
competitive challenge facing Britain. 'In Europe, we have hardly begun to
tackle the bureaucratic and restrictive nature of the procedures that are
characteristic of Community regulation,' he said.
He defended the government's record against criticisms in last week's report
on manufacturing competitiveness by the Commons trade and industry
committee. He said the report found much to applaud in the government's
policies towards industry.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Anger at fee for Woolmark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Wool Secretariat, which licenses the textile trademark,
the Woolmark, is about to introduce a Pounds 7,000 annual fee for the
symbol's use.
The IWS has announced that from May 1 next year it will charge spinners,
weavers and manufacturers for the use of the Woolmark and Woolblendmark,
which assure the presence of a minimum of 60 per cent of new wool.
Britain's wool industry has reacted angrily. The Confederation of British
Wool Textiles has been critical of the flat-rate fee, which it believes will
penalise small producers.

<TEXT>
Boarding schools, which suffered a 5.2 per cent drop in boarding-pupil
numbers last year, are discussing possible extra state funds with education
ministers.
Mr Ian Small, chairman of the Boarding Schools Association, which represents
both independent and state boarding schools, and headmaster of Bootham
School in York, said: 'At the moment there are a lot of financial
constraints on parents.
He suggested that the government could contribute towards independent
schools' salary bills or it could expand the assisted places scheme, which
funds children from low-income families to attend independent schools.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, was taunted by Labour MPs yesterday
over his 'humiliating climbdown' in agreeing not to renew his attempt to
impose stricter controls over the National Union of Students, Ivor Owen
writes.
Moving the second reading of the education bill in the Commons, he formally
confirmed his acceptance of the watered-down provisions on student unions
introduced by the government to avoid an embarrassing defeat in the Lords.
But Mr Patten was insistent that an amendment requiring closer co-operation
with universities by schools involved in training graduate teachers -
inserted as a result of a government defeat in the Lords - should be
overturned.
The bill was given a second reading by a government majority of 55
(299-244).

FT  04 MAY 94 / Treasury backs ID card
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury has thrown its weight behind the government efficiency unit's
recommendation that identity cards should be issued for benefit claimants to
combat fraud in the Pounds 80bn social security budget.
The unit, headed by Sir Peter Levene, the prime minister's adviser on
efficiency, wants the government to launch a trial scheme in a small town.
The recommendation follows the presentation of a report by social security
officials arguing that cards could eliminate fraud running to hundreds of
million pounds.
Whitehall officials believe the Treasury's intervention may tip the balance
of power in favour of launching the pilot scheme, although the Department of
Social Security is fiercely resisting it.
The Home Office has also voiced 'concern' that the potential savings may not
outweigh political risks associated with the introduction of the cards.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday told the Commons that he had
'considerable sympathy' with those in favour of identity cards.
'There are practical difficulties, but we are examining them to see if they
can be overcome,' he said.
Mr Nicholas Budgen, a member of the Commons Treasury and civil service
committee, said many backbenchers strongly favoured introducing an identity
card system.
Both the DSS and Home Office are concerned that there is no overseas model
which has a proven track record of combating fraud.
But Mr Budgen said other countries were not necessarily suffering from the
same degree of fraud problems as the UK.
An identity card system would probably involve benefit claimants being
issued with cards which store encoded data on the shape of their hands. The
cards would be 'read' by electronic scans each time a benefit was collected.
Although the error rate on such scans is small, DSS and Home Office
ministers fear that a huge row would be caused if anyone was wrongly denied
benefit.

FT  04 MAY 94 / City's share settlement system starting to show results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England's determination to deliver a faster, paperless share
settlement system to the City of London is showing some real results.
While the London Stock Exchange dithered for nearly seven years over its
failed Taurus system, the Bank has been able to lay the foundation for a far
simpler and cheaper system aimed at delivering the same thing.
But for all its efforts, the Bank faces some very real hurdles in the months
ahead. Yesterday it conceded that its timetable for a continuous system of
share settlement - when buyers obtain title to shares and sellers obtain
payment - five days after a deal has been struck may have been too
ambitious.
Privately, market participants yesterday heaved a sigh of relief. 'There is
a concern that we may have over-committed to January 1995 as a firm date for
T plus Five (settlement five days after trade date),' said an official at
one London merchant bank.
The London Investment Banking Association, the Institutional Fund Managers
Association and the Association of Private Client Stockbrokers and
Investment Managers have all urged the Bank of England to delay the date for
five-day rolling settlements.
Their concerns have focused on whether those who have promised to deliver
stock to customers will really be able to do so within the five-day period.
The Bank's research found that about 30 per cent of all deals struck within
six days of a settlement date failed to settle.
Even more worrying is that the majority of these are for small, private
clients, the portion of the securities industry whose interests the Bank of
England needs to protect most.
The only way for stockbrokers to ensure that they can deliver stock is to
improve the facilities available for borrowing stock from other shareholders
and that, they say, is both a legal and technological minefield.
Mr Michael Robarts, a director at Robert Fleming Asset Management, said that
one big problem is that current practice requires stock lenders - usually
pension funds or life insurers - to accept collateral in the form of
Talisman certificates. These are certificates showing the value of the
borrower's securities still lodged in the exchange's Talisman settlements
system.
'We believe - and we are convinced that most fund managers believe - that it
is inappropriate to lend pension trustees' stocks against equity-based
certificates,' Mr Robarts said.
The true value of these certificates and the lender's ownership position is
uncertain. If the borrower of the stock suddenly became insolvent, it is not
clear how the lender could recover the value of his securities.
Moreover, only marketmakers in a particular stock are allowed to borrow it
directly. That means that all others market participants, such as agency
stockbrokers, may still be unable to deliver shares on time. 'Already there
are a significant number of 'fails' in the Talisman system with 14-day
account settlement,' said one private client stockbroker.
On July 18, the stock exchange's Talisman system will change from the
current two-week account settlement period in which all bargains struck in
that time settle on the same date.
It aims to move to a five-day rolling settlement in which shares settle on
the fifth day after any deal is struck.
By the end of the year, the Bank should have a better idea of the
difficulties associated with faster settlement and will be able to set a
realistic date for T plus five, according to Mr Pen Kent, associate director
of the Bank of England.
Meanwhile, the Bank's ambitious drive to have its 'Crest' project wholly
owned by its users appears to have fallen somewhat short of its goal. The
Bank said yesterday that only 50 City institutions had signed up to be
shareholders in Crest. They will have to make a cash contribution ranging
from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 750,000 by October.

Mathematics teaching for post-16 students in England and Wales is
'inadequate and incoherent' and planned reforms could worsen it, says a
report published yesterday.
The report for the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, by
Mrs Alison Wolf of London University's Institute of Education, says the
structure of education 'positively discourages students from making maths,
science and engineering serious options for future study'.
It does this by forcing choices on 16-year-olds, when they must 'rule out
some choices, effectively for good'.
Mrs Wolf also criticises the new general national vocational qualifications
introduced this year to offer an alternative, more practical, route to
higher education and training.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Building inquiries point to upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inquiries for new construction work have risen for the first time in almost
five years, says a survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors
published today.
According to the institution, inquiries for work at 200 quantity surveying
firms rose by 2.5 per cent during the three months to the end of March
compared with the previous three months.
Much quantity surveying work occurs early in the construction process when
costings are provided for contracts. Their order books, therefore, provide a
good indicator of future workloads.
Mr Christopher Vickers, a senior partner at EC Harris, one of the largest
firms of quantity surveyors, said: 'At last the industry's fortunes are
beginning to change. We are seeing a return of client confidence and
interest but what we need now is commitment.
'If the improved activity in feasibility work feeds through to actual
projects then we can expect to see a steady upturn in workload over the next
six to nine months.'
Workloads fell by 9.5 per cent during the 12 months to the end of March.
Two-thirds of quantity surveyors, however, expect to increase output during
the next 12 months and 30 per cent of firms expect to increase staffing.
According to the survey, private housing workloads are continuing to
increase while there has also been a small increase in commercial work
reflecting the recent improvement in commercial property yields. Workloads
in the industrial sector have also stabilised. Public-sector housing work,
however, has declined, reflecting pressure on government spending.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Failures seem to hit steady rate: Business collapses reach
plateau
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of business failures appears to have steadied at about half the
level of 1992, says a survey published yesterday by Touche Ross, the
chartered accountants.
However, the number of receiverships and administrations, which totalled
about 2,500 in the last year, is running at well above pre-recession levels.
In 1989 there were 1,500 cases.
No clear pattern has yet emerged in the monthly receivership figures this
year. After two months when the number of receiverships increased, the
number of business failures dropped by 35 per cent in April to 171.
The average monthly number of failures in the first four months of this year
was 211, little lower than the average of 220 of the last 12 months.
Touche Ross said the recovery from recession continued to be slow and
cautious. Mr Ralph Preece, a partner at the firm, said: 'I remain of the
view that we are unlikely to see any dramatic fall in the number of business
failures unless and until there is a general resurgence in economic
confidence in the country at large.'
London and the south-east appeared to fare better in April at the expense of
the Midlands.
About 40 per cent of all failures were in the manufacturing sector, a
substantial increase over 1993 when the sector accounted for less than 30
per cent of failures. Part of this increase was accounted for by the
collapse of the Bimec Industries Group in the West Midlands.
Failures in the building and construction sector fell to 16 per cent of all
failures, compared with 20 per cent in 1993. Touche Ross based its figures
on the receivership and administration appointments advertised in the London
and Edinburgh Gazettes. The figures, which exclude liquidations, indicate
the pressures on larger companies although they are a fraction of the total
number of business failures.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Boarding schools seek extra funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boarding schools, which suffered a 5.2 per cent drop in boarding pupil
numbers last year, are discussing possible extra state funds with education
ministers.
Mr Ian Small, chairman of the Boarding Schools Association, which represents
both independent and state boarding schools, and headmaster of Bootham
School in York, said: 'At the moment there are a lot of financial
constraints on parents.
'There are a number of state boarding schools which have actually increased
their numbers recently, and there are various ways in which boarding schools
might be made more flexible.'
He suggested that the government could contribute towards independent
schools' salary bills, using a model used in Europe, or it could expand the
assisted places scheme, which funds children from low-income families to
attend independent schools.
Mr Paul High, headmaster of the Prior's Court preparatory school in
Berkshire, said the assisted places scheme could be extended to pupils aged
more than seven or nine. At present, the funding is only available from the
age of 11, effectively excluding most preparatory schools. He said: 'If the
government is acting to support education, why only start at 11? If they
have a commitment why shouldn't we be able to offer the facilities we have
to more parents?'
Mr Small expressed reservations about the scheme, unveiled at the end of
last year, to allow independent schools to 'opt in' to the state sector and
become grant-maintained schools. A number of schools were considering the
move, he said, but were not prepared to go further until government
regulations on eliminating surplus places had been clarified.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Names promised new deal: Lloyd's reform package aims to
strengthen rights of members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London yesterday paved the way for a further transformation of
its capital base by providing for the possible operation of syndicates
backed by a single corporate investor, effectively insurance companies, at
the market.
It has proposed a package of reforms which would strengthen the rights of
individual Names, whose assets support the market.
It has also suggested ways in which those Names continuing to trade may be
able to obtain cash or shares in new corporate syndicates or other vehicles
in exchange for their existing syndicate participations.
'The measures and proposals set out in this report maintain a programme of
radical reform which we initiated a year ago,' said Mr David Rowland,
Lloyd's chairman. Lloyd's introduced Pounds 800m in new corporate capital
last year.
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, said Lloyd's would consult on its
proposals for 'transferring or realising value' for syndicate
participations. 'The changes will have a profound and positive impact on the
future of Lloyd's,' he said.
The market does not intend to change rules limiting the amount of capital
corporate investors can supply to syndicates. Single corporate Names can
supply no more than 25 per cent of a syndicate's capacity - the amount of
premiums it can accept - while overall, syndicates can obtain no more than
50 per cent of their capacity from corporate Names.
However, Mr Rowland said Lloyd's Council, the body that governs the market,
could make exceptions and conceded that 'it is inevitable that at some point
in the future we will revisit these regulations'.
In its report Lloyd's said single corporate members, if introduced, would be
able to adopt annual accounting - in contrast to the three-year system of
existing syndicates.
Mr Robert Hiscox, Lloyd's deputy chairman and a keen supporter of the idea,
said the new type of syndicate would allow managers 'complete stability of
capital, and to retain earnings and plan long-term'.
The establishment of single corporate members is one of three possible ways
in which Names may be able to realise value from their participations.
Lloyd's will also examine the feasibility of a market where participations
can be traded, as well as the possibility that Names might sell a range of
syndicate participations to an investor, in exchange for shares, other
securities or cash.
The plan makes no provision for Names unable to trade because of past
losses, or for those who have already resigned or left the market.
The Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents about 9,000 Names,
welcomed the proposals and said that moves to introduce pre-emption rights
and syndicate voting rights amounted to an 'important recognition of the
inherent rights of Names'.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Syndicates to offer added value: Richard Lapper reports on
the details of the market's radical plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'A mountain of complications' to lead Lloyd's to the 'greenfields of
simplicity' was how Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, described
yesterday's package of reforms at the insurance market.
The reforms, outlined in a 64-page document entitled Value at Lloyd's, are
designed to allow Names to obtain value from their long-term interests in
syndicates - the one-year annual joint ventures that conduct insurance
business.
Names currently share only in the annual profits or losses of their
syndicates but Mr Rowland said he wanted them to be able to 'realise any
capital value or goodwill of the syndicate business'.
The document starts by giving the Names who continue to underwrite next year
pre-emption rights over the syndicates they support. These rights - similar
to those typically available to a shareholder in a listed company - would
allow Names to maintain their existing shares in syndicates from year to
year or increase them in proportion to the syndicate's increase in capacity
(the amount of business it can underwrite).
Names will also be given voting rights, allowing them to have more influence
in any decision by their agent to increase capacity.
Names are also to be given the right to transfer a participation for future
years of account to another member, through the introduction of
'assignment', a reform described as a 'fundamental building block' for any
system of value.
The Lloyd's agency agreement - which governs the current relationship
between a Name and his agent - is to be modified this year with the changes
also coming into effect in 1995.
On the basis of these initial steps, Lloyd's will then examine ways in which
a market can be set up, allowing Names to 'realise' the value of their
syndicate participations.
Here - for the moment at least - Lloyd's has been less proscriptive. Three
basic routes forward are outlined but each of them will require further
work.
'It is better to let outside brains work on how we should do it best,'
explains Mr Robert Hiscox, the deputy chairman who headed the team which
prepared yesterday's report.
Separately, Lloyd's also announced measures designed to secure a more
efficient allocation of capital. A system of risk-based capital, in which
the funds required by investors to back insurance business will vary
according to the risks underwritten and exposures, is to be introduced.
Lloyd's is also committed to intervening to prevent excessive increases in
the capacity of the market. A new system will be introduced for reviewing
significant increases proposed by managing agents, who administer
syndicates.
All this should mean Lloyd's will be better equipped to prevent another
period of disastrous losses as in the 1980s, when excessive capacity led
many underwriters to accept risks for too little premiums. But that will be
little comfort for the thousands of Names already ruined.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                    How Names might cash in
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Creation of a market administered by Lloyd's where Names could buy and
sell their participations in syndicates while maintaining their
existing status. The report reviews a number of ways that this might be
achieved. It concludes that a one-off auction-based tender system, in
which all sellers of a particular syndicate receive the same price, is
the most likely option in the short term.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Corporate pooling arrangements: members would 'assign' all their
syndicate participations to a corporate member in exchange for shares,
other securities or cash.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Corporate syndicates: in which members of one syndicate would 'assign'
future participations to a corporate member, again in exchange for

FT  04 MAY 94 / Trade unionists protest government moves on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, and other trade
unionists gathered outside parliament yesterday with an 18ft inflatable
model of Robert Maxwell to protest at government moves over pensions.
Under a banner saying: 'Ministers - don't do a Maxwell on our pensions', the
union leaders, representing 1m members of the Local Government
Superannuation Scheme and 1m pensioners, claimed the moves threaten the
future of the scheme.
Mr Morris said: 'The government aim is to force increasing numbers out and
then break up the Local Government Superannuation Scheme. First the personal
pensions disaster and now this attack on the LGSS threaten poverty in old
age for a generation of pensioners in the 21st century'

FT  04 MAY 94 / Mercury under fire over slow faxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fax bureau says that Mercury, the UK's second-largest telecommunications
carrier, overcharged it by up to Pounds 100,000 in 12 months by transmitting
its faxes too slowly. The bureau is preparing a formal complaint to Oftel,
the industry watchdog.
Comwave, the UK subsidiary of Swiss-based company Comwave Communications,
said network providers do not have to comply with regulatory standards while
manufacturers' equipment must pass stringent standards before it can be
connected to the network.
Oftel agreed this week that public telecommunications operators were not
obliged to guarantee that fax calls would be successful or completed at any
particular speed.
Comwave said that faxes sent on Mercury lines took an average of 18 per cent
more time than faxes on British Telecommunications lines. It warned that
other companies using Mercury could unwittingly be paying too much for fax
transmission. Comwave has switched to another network operator for its fax
business.
It claims to be the first company in the UK to have established a global fax
broadcast service. The service is used by customers such as McGraw Hill, the
US publisher, Swiss Bank and British Alcan to distribute time-critical
information.
Last year Comwave noticed that faxes sent on some of its 50 Mercury lines
were taking longer than they should.
The cause of the problem, which Mercury does not deny, was a mismatch
between Comwave's fax machines and a piece of Mercury equipment which
essentially persuaded the machine that it was transmitting over a
poor-quality line and dropped the transmission speed accordingly.
Mercury, while not admitting liability, has agreed to credit Comwave with
Pounds 20,000.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Eagle Trust action opens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eagle Trust, the film equipment conglomerate, yesterday began its High Court
action to recover Pounds 13.5m from Swiss Bank Corporation Investment
Banking.
Eagle Trust is suing Savory Milln, a stockbroking subsidiary of SBCI, over
its handling of the underwriting of the company's 1987 rights issue to fund
its takeover of Samuelson, a film equipment company. It claims the brokers
were reckless in accepting the Pounds 13.5m from Mr John Ferriday, Eagle
Trust's former chief executive, to meet his personal sub-underwriting
commitments to them.
Eagle Trust claims the money was misappropriated from the company by Mr
Ferriday to meet these sub-underwriting obligations and that Savory Milln
should have known this was the case. The case is expected to last three
weeks. Mr Ferriday was jailed for six years in April last year after being
convicted of six counts of theft from Eagle Trust to cover personal losses
sustained in the October 1987 stock market crash.
