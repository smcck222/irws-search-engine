FT  04 MAY 94 / Brussels to probe takeover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission said yesterday it would examine the takeover of UK
reinsurance group NRG Victory Reinsurance by Employers Reassurance and
Denmark's Nordisk Reinsurance Company, which are units of General Electric
Company.
The Commission said a preliminary probe showed that the takeover could fall
under EU merger rules, but it reserved a final decision.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Lobbying on home loans is renewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mortgage lenders are to renew their lobbying of ministers and MPs after
signs that the government is considering further cuts in the income support
available for mortgage interest, Alison Smith writes.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents building societies, banks
and centralised lenders, is to brief backbench Tory MPs about the likely
adverse impact of further restrictions on the fragile recovery in the
housing market. The arguments against a further limitation will also form a
significant element of the council's submission to the Treasury before
November's Budget. At least one building society chief executive believes
lenders should have concentrated more on preventing the reduction of
mortgage support than on opposing the cuts in tax relief on mortgage
interest payments.
While the Pounds 1.2bn spending on mortgage support last year is not a large
slice of the Pounds 85bn social security budget, ministers believe it is
among the fastest-growing elements. They are keen to encourage people to
take out private insurance against job loss rather than relying on the state
to help with mortgage payments if they become unemployed. Last August, a
ceiling of Pounds 150,000 was im-posed on the mortgage amount for which
income support would be available. This was lowered to Pounds 125,000 for
new claimants from early this month. A further restriction will come into
effect later this month when people on income support will no longer be able
to claim interest payments on mortgages which they have taken out or
increased while receiving benefit.
But the council believes that imposing tougher limits on mortgage support
payments will directly cut across the government's intention of extending
home ownership through initiatives such as the rents-into-mortgages scheme.
The original crackdown on support came after embarrassment over a case in
which amounts of almost Pounds 2,000 a week were paid to a former insurance
sales executive.

FT  04 MAY 94 / The by-election that everyone forgot: Despite Labour's
unassailable position, Rotherham has a tale to tell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rotherham is the by-election that everyone forgot.
When five Labour MPs gathered in All Saints Square beneath the church in the
heart of Rotherham to support the Labour party candidate, Mr Denis MacShane,
in a photocall, a total of six people turned out - and that included me.
The early morning shoppers walked blithely by. The pigeons declined to
scatter and went on foraging and pecking among the flagstones.
Mrs Winifred Sanders, one of the little band of onlookers, said to her
husband: 'Ronnie, which is our man?'
'The one with the rose.'
'They've all got roses.'
'I meant rosettes. The one in the middle with the glasses.'
'Eeeh, I don't know him at all.'
Mr Sanders, 67, was made redundant as a galvaniser in a steelworks 10 years
ago. 'I tried to get other jobs, but there is no work here,' he says.
Asked how he will vote on Thursday, he says: 'I'll be voting for the Labour
party. We should have a local man. A man who understands our needs.'
Mr MacShane, 45, is defending a majority of 17,561 out of a constituency of
61,000. The by-election was caused by the early death of Mr Jimmy Boyce, a
local man.
Mr MacShane's position is unassailable. The only discernible issue is the
fact that he is an outsider, imposed by the party in London.
Mr MacShane is a former journalist who currently works in Geneva. He says
he's the first candidate to be selected under the one-member-one-vote
system. 'Eighty per cent of the local party voted for me,' he says.
He describes accusations from Mr David Wildgoose, the Liberal Democrat
candidate, that he is a carpetbagger as an 'unpleasant touch of xenophobia'.
Mr Wildgoose admits that he has made great play of being the only local
Rotherham candidate.
'The interesting thing is that I am drawing support from the Labour party
more than from the Tories. The people of Rotherham are sick and tired of
being taken for granted as cannon fodder for the Labour party,' he says.
As the Conservative candidate Mr Nick Gibb, 34, is also a London-based
politician, the question of outsiders has come to dominate the campaign.
Mr Wildgoose may fare little better in the local elections where he is also
a candidate on Thursday. The Labour party holds 63 of the 66 council seats.
The Conservatives have the other three.
A third of the seats are being contested on Thursday. The redoubtable Sir
Jack Layden, leader of the Labour group on the council, says: 'I don't know
if you are rich, but bet your house and anything else you may own I will
still be leading the council on Friday.'
The dominance of the Labour party and the issue of non-local candidates have
tended to obscure the fact that Rotherham does have a real tale to tell.
Like many other northern cities and towns, it has gone into decline as
traditional manufacturing industries have faltered. But the first-time
visitor would never guess that Rotherham has been subject to a severe
shake-out. The town is green and bedecked with flowers. It is not dissimilar
to any town in southern England. The pedestrianised centre is lined with
building societies and banks where the shops used to be. Charity shops stand
in prime sites - a sure sign of recession.
But Rotherham's industries were on its periphery. It was heavily dependent
on coal mining and steel. It had 12 pits in 1980. Now it has one. The
rundown of the coal and steel industries has meant a loss of 25,000 mostly
male jobs. High technology industry and services have failed to replace
them.
Male unemployment is 21 per cent, almost double the national average. The
drop in employment has brought in its wake social collapse, with an
associated high level of crime.
The town has had its successes in attracting new companies. The Swindon
Laboratories and a British Steel technical centre employ hundreds of people.
But the gains have been in productivity, not job creation.
Thousands of jobs have been created but many of these have been in service
industries and for women and thus proportionately poorly paid.
Mr Gibb, an accountant in London, makes a spirited attempt to defend the
Conservative record. He cites regional selective assistance, the development
area status and the enterprise grants which have come Rotherham's way.
Labour's answer to places like Rotherham is to spend more money on housing
and projects such as the high-speed rail link in order to create jobs in
steel and construction.
In the end the significance of the Rotherham by-election may well be how
well the Conservative vote holds up. It has never been below 8,500.
At the last general election the turnout was 71.7 per cent, with Labour
polling 27,933, or 63.9 per cent, the Conservatives 10,372 or 23.7 per cent
and the Liberal Democrats 5,375 or 12.3 per cent.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Planning at Westminster council to be probed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westminster City Council is launching an independent review of whether its
proposed Unitary Development Plan could have been drawn up as part of a
gerrymandering exercise related to controversial sales of council houses.
The launch of the inquiry is the nearest the Conservative-controlled council
has come to admitting that the alleged gerrymandering exercise - supposedly
planned to boost Tory votes in eight marginal wards - may have extended
beyond council house sales to other activities, including the planning
process. It puts a question mark over Westminster's policies on the eve of
the local elections.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday said that the Westminster
Conservatives, who have a slim majority, deserve to be re-elected.
Mr John Magill, the district auditor, this year made a preliminary ruling
that the 'designated sales' of council houses in the late 1980s were
unlawful and recommended that 10 councillors and officers, including the
then leader, Dame Shirley Porter, should be surcharged Pounds 21.5m.
According to draft terms of reference of the inquiry, the review will be
carried out by an unspecified independent person because 'it has been
suggested that the director of planning and environment (Mr Syd Sporle) may
have been involved in the alleged improper regard to electoral advantage
(sic)'.
The review of the development plan follows assessments of its legality by
three QCs, two working for the council and one employed by the opposition
Labour group.
The review will focus on allegations by Labour's deputy leader in
Westminster, Mr Peter Bradley, that the development plan was 'decisively
influenced' by the Conservative party strategy called Building Stable
Communities. The strategy's alleged aim was to focus council resources
between 1987 and 1990 on boosting the Conservative vote.
The auditor has made a provisional ruling that the policy of removing 500
council properties a year from public ownership was designed with the aim of
increasing owner-occupancy in the eight marginal wards for political
purposes and at the price of failing to fulfil obligations to the homeless
and other priority housing groups. Mr Bradley has alleged that the Unitary
Development Plan, based on 1988 revisions to the district plan, was drawn up
with the same intention.
The draft terms of reference say the inquiry will look at three aspects of
the development plan:
The alleged deletion of any reference to the provision of council housing or
low-rent housing association accommodation, because any such reference could
have undermined the policy of selling council houses.
The inclusion of a clause that 'planning permission will normally be granted
for the change of use of hostels to residential use where the hostel is
surplus to the requirements of the institution or body which uses it'. Mr
Bradley alleges that this has already been used to justify planning consent
granted in connection with the eviction of residents from a hostel by
Westminster Cathedral.
An allegation that the policy on redevelopment of industrial mews is
intended to allow consent to be granted for high-cost residential
conversions for private-sector sale.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Backbench dismay over in-fighting on EMU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest ministerial in-fighting about a decision that a future UK
government may or may not have to take in the late 1990s provoked dismay
among the level-headed on the Tory back benches yesterday.
But it is a measure of the depths of the fundamental Tory divide on Europe
that Mr Michael Portillo's off-the-cuff dismissal at the weekend of a single
European currency could provoke such disarray.
The chief secretary's antipathy to European monetary union is well known.
His Euro-scepticism has propelled him within a few weeks into the position
of the leading candidate of the right in the event that Mr John Major is
forced from office. But in articulating in public what he and his rightwing
cabinet colleagues have long said in private - that a single currency would
fatally undermine British sovereignty - Mr Portillo broke a carefully
constructed cabinet truce. The official government stance on whether or not
the government would participate in a single currency was set out in a
European elections campaign document last month. It was a fudge,
deliberately designed to prevent the sort of row which has broken out in the
past few days.
The document states that because of the opt-out negotiated by Mr Major at
Maastricht, Britain retains the right to make its own decision on whether to
take on the obligations leading to a single currency. It adds: 'That will be
the subject of a separate decision by our national parliament at
Westminster, if and when that decision ever has to be taken'. And in the
meantime Britain will not rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism within
the 'foreseaable future'. Put another way, the formula says there is no need
now for the Tory party to tear itself apart over issues which will not
confront it at least during the next several years and, perhaps, not at all.
Mr Portillo, on instructions from Downing Street, yesterday fell in again
behind that neutral formula. But on the other side of the European fence, Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, made no secret of the fact that he could
envisage supporting a single currency.
Esoteric though it may seem to the voters the split will not go away. And
with five weeks of campaigning ahead of it before the European elections on
June 9, there is ample scope for further public squabbling.
The latest Scottish opinion poll shows support for the Scottish National
party growing. A System Three opinion poll for today's Herald newspaper
shows that support for Labour has dropped since March from 46 to 44 per
cent, while backing for the SNP has risen by one point to 27 per cent. The
Tories have improved to 14 per cent from 13 per cent in February, equal with
the Liberal Democrats.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Apathy wins landslide victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, CHRIS TIGHE and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The local elections have been billed as the elections that will decide
whether Mr John Major remains in Downing Street. With Mr Major's prime
ministership on the line, Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat party
managers in London have wheeled their guns on to the local election
battlefield in an unprecedented show of force.
But with only two days to go, the election campaign has failed to win the
hearts and minds of the British public. For all the sound and fury in
Westminster, it is hard to detect any great enthusiasm for these elections
in any part of the country.
In Birmingham, the chairman of the city's Conservative group, Mr Simon Lee,
has spoken of the 'enormous apathy and disillusionment' towards all the
political parties.
In Newcastle, Mr Gareth Edwards, a Green party activist, says that, walking
through the city, it is hard to believe there will be elections in less than
a week.
In north-east London, Ms Liz Pearce, leader of the Labour group on Redbridge
Borough Council, says she is depressed to find voters on the doorstep
telling her that local politicians are all the same.
The media interest has also been hard to rouse in some places. Officials at
Central TV in the Midlands complain of the 'low news values' of this
election while Mr Jeremy Beecham, Newcastle City Council's Labour leader,
complains of the low coverage by local press in the north-east.
'If you get cynical about politics, it becomes trivialised and demeaned and
people take less and less notice,' he says.
The cynicism is partly explained by the timing of the poll. With the
European elections in June, many voters dread the prospect of a series of
campaigns stretching out over two-and-a-half months.
Another numbing factor is that hard-core Tory voters who are disaffected
with Mr Major's leadership look likely to abstain. These voters want to
punish hime but they cannot bring themselves to cast a vote for any other
party.
And the growing disaffection with politics - increasingly felt in UK
elections - is playing its part. 'People don't want to display their
associations with political parties like they used to,' says Mr Mike
Summersby, leader of the Tory group on Newcastle City Council, remarking on
the absence of posters in the city's windows.
But the principal reason why the campaign has failed to ignite interest is
that the mixture of national and local themes has obscured the political
battleground.
In 1990, when the London boroughs last voted, Labour and the Liberal
Democrats managed to fight the campaign on a single issue: the introduction
of the deeply unpopular poll tax. The tax eventually led to Mrs Thatcher's
downfall later in the year.
This time, the Conservatives have tried to repeat that trick, by making the
council tax - which replaced the poll tax - the big issue. Tory party
managers believe there is a strong public belief that Labour councils charge
higher levels of council tax than the Conservatives, and are less efficient.
Labour has rebutted these claims. But Mr Jack Straw, Labour's campaign
manager, has instead attacked national government policies, in the belief
that voters will take their revenge for recent tax rises. As a result, there
has been little friction between the Labour and Tory campaigns.
That does not mean that the campaigning on the ground has been any less
vigorous.
Mr Keith Hanson, who is running Labour's campaign in Birmingham, thinks
there is an average of 400 canvassers out every night, more than in previous
local elections.
But, the signs are that the voters have been saturated rather than
stimulated. In many places, the key issue on Thursday will not be who wins
but how many turn out to vote.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Eurotunnel safety assessed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travelling through the Channel tunnel should be at least 30 times safer than
travelling by train above ground, says a safety manual prepared for the
Pounds 10bn project.
Eurotunnel, which will run trains through the tunnel, yesterday unveiled a
1,000-page analysis of the risks and the procedures it has adopted to reduce
them.
The tunnel 'safety case' is due to be published within the next two weeks.
It identifies more than 50 possible hazards including fires, derailments,
obstructions on the line and earthquakes.
After four months of testing of the tunnel procedures, including
round-the-clock operation of a full train service, Eurotunnel hopes to
obtain safety clearance to start freight services early next week.
Eurotunnel initially set itself a risk factor for foot passengers of no more
than 4.7 deaths per 100m journeys, while for passengers with their cars the
risk of death should not exceed 5.6 per 100m journeys. But the risk to
passengers without cars is 50 times lower than the criteria set, and those
with cars 30 times lower because of the safety measures adopted.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Post Office chief spells out business plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive of the Post Office, revealed yesterday
that he has lobbied more than 150 MPs as part of his campaign to secure
commercial freedom from the government.
He also spelt out for the first time detailed business plans which could
only be put into operation if the corporation was privatised or given
commercial freedom within the public sector.
These include leasing some or all of the 16 trains owned by the Post Office,
the distribution of newspapers and handling private mail and parcels. The
measures could save the corporation tens of millions of pounds. Under
current rules, the Post Office is prevented by the Treasury from using
surplus cash to invest in such business ventures.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has said a strong
economic case exists for privatising the Royal Mail. But he has yet to
publish his department's review of the business.
Mr Cockburn said: 'If the government were to give us the commercial freedom
we have been pressing for, we would look at the whole of our balance sheet.
'This includes the ownership of our 16 trains, all Post Office buildings,
commercial vehicles and our charter air service.'
The corporation recently bought the mail trains as part of a Pounds 150m
partnership with Rail Express Systems, British Rail's profitable
non-passenger business.
But instead of owning the trains the Post Office believes it could make more
commercial sense to sell them to a bank, for example, and lease them back.
The Treasury has already told the Post Office that it will not 'bend the
rules' to allow the corporation to put its business plans into operation
while it remains in the public sector.
Mr Cockburn has been discretely 'wining and dining' MPs from all political
parties to impress upon them the need for commercial freedom. Although he
has been careful not to disclose publicly his preferred method of commercial
freedom, he said that if the government favoured privatisation it should
'get on with it' immediately.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Tory MP who likes to hog the headlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was not until 4.45pm that the backbencher who hogged the bank holiday
headlines graced us with his presence yesterday in Westminster's corridors.
Mr David Evans, the irrepressible Tory MP for Welwyn Hatfield, stayed just
long enough to say that he did not regret calling for the heads of the
Conservative party chairman and nearly one-third of the cabinet on Monday in
an extraordinary radio outburst. He then strode into the Commons chamber
where MPs - including Mr John Patten, one of the six cabinet ministers Mr
Evans wants to see replaced - were debating education.
About 90 minutes earlier, he succeeded, in absentia, in playing a starring
role in prime minister's questions when Mr John Smith, Labour leader, used
Mr Evans' comments as a stick with which to beat Mr John Major.
It is all too easy to write Mr Evans off as a parliamentary clown. Since
entering the Commons in 1987, he has made his mark as a colourful loudmouth;
the sort of MP who sends newspaper sketch-writers scurrying for their
notebooks to capture a memorable barb fired at Labour ('the lot opposite')
or a robustly-phrased insult hurled at Mr Smith ('the wriggler from
Monklands East').
But there is a serious side to Mr Evans, a rightwinger now elevated to the
powerful executive of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers, that
Tory high command ignores at its peril - particularly with elections looming
and question marks hovering over Mr Major's leadership.
This is his aptitude for saying memorably in public what many of his
colleagues are whispering in private. Though his more cautious colleagues
were yesterday deploring Mr Evans' decision to regale the airwaves with
remarks they considered best confined to the Commons smoking room, many
admitted that his views were shared by a sizeable minority of Tory MPs.
An indication of his pulling power came two months ago when he attracted
scores of Tory MPs to a late-night debate on the back-to-basics policy. It
was vintage Evans - full of references to colleagues turning into 'spineless
jellies' and socialist intellectuals 'with breeze-blocks for brains' - and
they lapped it up.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Friendly society woos life company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Family Assurance friendly society plans to buy Templeton Life Assurance,
part of the Templeton Marketing Group, for Pounds 1.75m.
This is the first time a friendly society has tried to acquire a life
assurance company and is a sign of the changing financial services
marketplace.
Family Assurance, based in Brighton, says it wishes to acquire Templeton
Life for its pensions expertise. Templeton Life, which has Pounds 230m under
management, markets and underwrites life assurance and pension policies.
The acquisition on July 1 depends on Family Assurance members' agreement and
approval by the Friendly Societies' Commission.
Mr John Reeve, Family Assurance chief executive, said the acquisition would
place the society in a stronger position in the personal-pensions market. He
said: 'Our long-term aim is to be the country's most dominant provider of
tax-exempt savings and this acquisition is an important step nearer that
goal.'
The acquisition would add 32,000 policyholders to Family Assurance's 500,000
members and would bring its assets under management to just under Pounds
1bn. This would place it close to the second-largest friendly society, Royal
Liver Assurance, which has more than Pounds 1bn under management.
Templeton Life arose from the de-mutualisation in 1990 of Time Assurance
company, another friendly society. The company has found it hard to sell its

FT  04 MAY 94 / EU clears Pounds 61m aid for Ulster factory
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Government plans to contribute Pounds 61m to the Pounds 157m cost of a
textile plant in Northern Ireland received European Union clearance last
night. It will be built by the Taiwanese Hualon Corporation on the outskirts
of Belfast and may lead to the creation of 2,000 jobs.
The European Commission said last night that the state aid on offer to the
plant, which will produce more than 20,000 tonnes of fabric a year, would
affect trading conditions in the EU. But the impact would not be 'to an
extent contrary to the common interest'.
Mr Karel Van Miert, the commissioner responsible for competition law, said
the project was of prime importance for a region particularly hit by
unemployment.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Anger at fee for Woolmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Wool Secretariat, which licenses the world's most
recognised textile trademark, the Woolmark, is about to reap the rewards of
30 years of promotional work through the introduction of a Pounds 7,000
annual fee for the symbol's use.
The IWS has announced that from May 1 next year it will charge spinners,
weavers and manufacturers for the use of the Woolmark and Woolblendmark and
which assure the presence of a minimum of 60 per cent of new wool.
Britain's wool industry has reacted angrily. The Confederation of British
Wool Textiles has been particularly critical of the flat rate fee, which it
believes will penalise small producers. But the IWS argues that a sliding
scale of charges would incur excessive administrative costs.
The confederation and the IWS do agree, however, on the logic of
commercialising the symbol to raise funds to promote the use of wool.
A recent Harris poll found that 40 per cent of consumers in the UK, US,
Japan, Germany and France would pay more for a pure new wool garment
carrying the woolmark than for one without it.
Textile labelling looks set to become a lucrative business. The British
Textile Technology Group recently announced it would offer a label
certifying that textile products were free of harmful substances.

FT  04 MAY 94 / World Trade News: US and Chile to take 'first step' to trade
accord
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Chile will take 'a first step' towards negotiation of a free
trade agreement with the launch later this month of technical talks on
investment, according to Chile's finance minister.
Mr Eduardo Aninant yesterday said after talks with Mr Mickey Kantor, US
trade representative, that the US Congress might approve the Uruguay Round
global trade accords in September. This would clear the decks for the US and
Chile to conclude their negotiations in early 1995.
It has not yet been decided whether Chile will join the North American Free
Trade Agreement with Mexico, Canada and the US or directly negotiate a deal
with the US.
Mr Aninant said he wanted whichever route was 'the sooner, the neater, the
better'. Mexico, which already has a free trade pact with Chile, and Canada
have both signalled a willingness to admit Chile into Nafta. If a bilateral
deal with the US is agreed, the understanding would be that Nafta membership
would be the ultimate goal.
Mr Aninant said the Clinton administration would ask Congress for new 'fast
track' negotiating authority on trade matters this year along with
legislation implementing the Uruguay Round. It had not yet been decided if
Chile would be specified in the fast-track request, but some form of broad
authorisation would be required for the formal talks.
A free trade deal with Chile has raised little controversy in the US, but
the Clinton administration's failure to find Dollars 14bn (Pounds 9.5bn)
needed for the Uruguay Round has fanned fears that Gatt legislation would be
delayed until next year.
Mr Aninant said the 'informal conversations' on investment starting later
this month would be 'an exchange of information, a constructive dialogue'.

network
</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines has been chosen by China's Ministry of
Electronics Industry to lead a vast project to link about 500 cities to a
national 'information highway' data network.
Under the terms of a memorandum of understanding signed by Mr Lou Gerstner,
IBM chairman and chief executive, and Mr Zou Jiahua, one of China's vice
premiers, IBM will lead the 'Golden Bridge' project, one of three
initiatives designed to modernise China's data communications and computing
infrastructure.
The project will involve designing and building regional networks in
selected cities across China, along with a 'backbone' network linking the
regional systems. The effort will be led by a newly established joint
venture, based in Beijing, between IBM China and Ji Tong Communications, a
company affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of Electronics Industry.
'This is China's version of the information highway. The Chinese government
has set very ambitious goals and we are thrilled to have been selected to
work with them,' said Mr Ned Lautenbach, head of IBM's international
operations.
IBM has also been chosen as the primary consultant on two other 'Golden
Projects': Golden Card will establish facilities for the credit and debit
cards throughout China, and Golden Customs will create computerised
record-keeping and tracking systems for China's exports and imports.
IBM's presence in China dates back to 1935. The company left China when the
communist regime took over and came back in 1982 as an offshore business. In
September 1992 IBM China became a wholly owned foreign enterprise,
authorised to trade in local currency and to hire Chinese employees.

FT  04 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Sales of CDs near cassette total
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International unit sales of compact discs rose by 19.4 per cent last year to
1.39bn, raising the prospect that the CD will soon replace the audio
cassette as the world's principal music carrier.
Unit sales of cassettes fell 2 per cent to 1.44bn, according to figures from
the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which represents
music companies worldwide.
Although overall cassette sales remained higher than those of compact discs,
sales had begun to decline for the first time in 1993, the federation said.
Nevertheless, CDs now significantly outsell cassette tapes in all the
biggest music markets, apart from Mexico.
CD units sales rose by 21.5 per cent in the year. The value of the total
world market rose by 5.9 per cent, suggesting that most of the CD volume
growth was reported in the budget and mid-price sectors.
Unit sales of vinyl record albums fell 30 per cent to 80m. The federation
said the vinyl album had almost disappeared from all the developed music
markets.
The total value of recorded music sales last year rose 5.9 per cent to
Dollars 30.5bn (Pounds 20.2bn).

FT  04 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Turkish-US joint arms venture jams - John
Murray Brown on problems of a home-grown defence industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Costly delays of Turkey's largest defence industry collaboration project
could be ironed out this week when US and Turkish officials gather at the US
army's ballistics testing centre at Aberdeen in Maryland for a week-long
demonstration of Turkey's armoured personnel carrier produced by FMC of the
US.
This unusual move follows an intervention by General Dogan Gures, the
Turkish chief of general staff. Turkish concern about the quality of the FMC
vehicle's armour follows complaints by the Turkish land forces, which have
refused to take delivery from the FMC plant outside Ankara where more than
400 vehicles await collection.
The dispute has meant FMC has not been paid since November. The company has
informed the Turkish authorities it is setting off its debt payments against
some Dollars 60m (Pounds 41m) worth of debts owed by SSM, the government
procurement agency, for vehicles which FMC has already produced. With these
amounts denominated in Turkish lira, company officials estimate that as a
result of the recent lira devaluation the delay in payments has cost FMC an
additional Dollars 15m. With no response, FMC has stepped up the pressure
and in February took its case to the international court of arbitration in
Vienna.
The twists and turns of this Dollars 1bn deal - the first co-production
joint venture managed by the civilian-run SSM - provide a telling snapshot
of the problems of a homegrown defence industry. The project has been the
subject of the conflicting aims of cost and efficiency. FMC also seems to be
caught up in the rivalry between the civilian-run procurement authority and
the Turkish military over defence spending.
Despite cuts elsewhere in Europe, Turkey's defence sector has continued to
attract a growing share of the budget. But the issue has become particularly
acute at a time when the economy is under strain and the Kurdish
insurrection in the country's south east has reached a new intensity. The
challenge to the military's shopping list has intensified with the
appointment of a new head for the SSM, Mr Yalcn Burcak, a former Treasury
official, who has put all spending on hold and is reviewing on-going
projects.
The FMC contract when agreed in 1987 was to deliver 1,698 vehicles by August
1997. The project was a joint venture with the local Nurol group  - the
target was to achieve a local manufacturing content of about 70 per cent.
Some 200 vehicles have been produced, some of which were deployed to support
the Turkish troops in UN operations in Somalia. Others are in use in the
Turkish security forces' 10-year-old counter-insurgency operations against
Kurdish rebels.
However, since the summer of 1992 not a single completed vehicle has left
the Golbas factory. Defence experts say the cause of the problem was SSM's
decision in 1991 to change the contract terms. The original contract was a
turnkey arrangement, under which FMC would deliver the completed vehicle to
the Turkish army.
Now SSM has decided it will furnish such equipment as the engine, the gun
turret and the night-sighting equipment from its own sub-contractors.
Delays followed, some of which were not of SSM's making. For instance, the
25mm gun for the armoured fighting version was originally to be supplied by
Oerlikon of Switzerland but the contract was discontinued after the Swiss
parliament placed an arms embargo on Turkey because of its heavy handling of
Kurdish unrest.
The latest row concerns armour quality and follows a test at the Turkish
army's own centre. FMC says the testing was unscientific. It claims the
vehicle meets specifications of the contract and the armour quality is
exactly the same as that on the vehicles supplied to the Belgian military.
However, some defence experts say the army has deeper reservations, and is
using the FMC issue to signal a more general discontent with the way SSM, a
civilian authority, is now in charge of what has traditionally been part of
the military's preserve.

FT  04 MAY 94 / World Trade News: High duties against Japan - EU tackles
imports of broadcasting cameras
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union has imposed definitive anti-dumping duties of as much as
96.8 per cent on imports of broadcasting cameras made by five Japanese
electronics companies.
The duties are among the highest in any recent EU anti-dumping action
against Japanese imports.
The duties were imposed after an investigation by the European Commission of
complaints by BTS, part of Philips of the Netherlands, and Thomson Broadcast
of France, which are Europe's only makers of studio video-cameras.
The investigation found that Japanese exporters had increased their share of
the EU studio camera market from 52 per cent in 1989 to 70 per cent in 1992,
while the share of European producers fell from 48 per cent to 30 per cent.
The Commission said the market share gains were due to unfair pricing by the
Japanese companies. It put at 21 per cent to 60 per cent the 'dumping
margins' on the products - the gap between prices in the EU and Japan. It
said none of the Japanese companies disputed this finding.
However, Sony, one of the Japanese companies affected by the EU action,
accused the Commission of failure to take into consideration price
differences due to varying product specifications and service provisions. It
said the duties would result in 'significant' price increases.
The dumping duties on Sony cameras have been set at 62.6 per cent; those on
products by Ikegami Tsushinki and Hitachi Denshi are 82.9 per cent and 52.7
per cent.
Duties of 96.8 per cent have been imposed on products by Matsushita and JVC,
which the Commission said did not co-operate in its investigation.
Sony, the leader in the world broadcasting camera market, said many of its
customers had lobbied on its behalf during the EU investigation.
The Commission said several users of broadcast cameras had said European
products were inferior to those from Japan, but had not substantiated this
claim.
The Commission also rejected users' objections that the duties would force
them to switch to European cameras which were technically incompatible with
Japanese ones.
Capital Group Studios, a London indpendent television production studio
which lobbied against the duties, said yesterday that the decision would put
it at a competitive disadvantage by raising the prices it had to pay for
equipment.
The company said the most sophisticated broadcast camera technology had long
come from Japan, though BTS had recently launched a range of technically
advanced products.

<TEXT>
Developing countries are snatching a growing share of international
investment and this trend is likely to continue, according to a report by
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
Flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) to developing nations reached
record levels of nearly Dollars 50bn (Pounds 34.2bn) in 1992 and about
Dollars 70bn in 1993, Unctad estimates. As a proportion of total FDI flows,
they rose from 33 per cent in 1992 to 37 per cent last year as overseas
investment in the industrialised world continued to fall.
The report, presented to this week's meeting in Geneva of Unctad's
Commission on Transnational Corporations, notes that Asia continues to be
the largest host developing region while flows to Latin America have
increased since the late 1980s. Most African nations, and least-developed
countries, have seen FDI flows stagnate or decline.
Unctad attributes the rapid expansion of FDI to the strong economic
performance of many developing countries as well as to privatisation and
more open equity markets. However, FDI growth had created relatively few new
jobs in multinational corporations worldwide, fuelling criticisms that
multinationals were reshuffling jobs away from rich countries.
Talks restart this week in Geneva which aim to open individual country
markets in three services sectors - maritime transport, labour movement and
basic telecommunications. Trade officials agreed to continue the talks last
December when the rest of the Uruguay Round was completed.
The negotiations on freer labour movement to supply services abroad, a
priority area for developing countries, are due to be wrapped up next year,
in parallel with talks on financial services. The negotiations on shipping
and telecoms will extend until 1996.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Paraguay's first general strike in 35 years has claimed one life and clashes
with security forces have caused 20 injuries. Police shot a peasant in the
interior of the country participating in Monday's general strike, in which
protesters blocked roads throughout the country and demonstrated in the
capital Asuncion.
They demanded 40 per cent wage rises, a halt to the country's privatisation
programme and the suspension of economic integration with neighbouring
countries. The army deployed tanks to keep the roads open, but transport
workers paralysed the bus service, forcing shops and offices in Asuncion to
close.
The one-day strike followed months of growing tension in the interior, where
peasants are demanding land reform and government financial support to
compensate for falling cotton prices.
Growing trade links with Paraguay's large neighbours, Brazil and Argentina,
through the Mercosur customs union is also threatening smaller Paraguayan
companies.
This was the most serious challenge yet to President Juan Carlos Wasmosy,
who was elected last year. Mr Wasmosy's Colorado party backed General
Alfredo Stroessner during his 1954-89 military rule, but is now committed to
democracy and market reforms.

FT  04 MAY 94 / US indicators point to robust growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US index of leading indicators rose 0.7 per cent in March, more than
expected and suggesting that economic growth will be robust during the next
six months, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
Separately, the National Association of Purchasing Managers released a
bullish half-yearly forecast, predicting 7 per cent growth of corporate
revenues in cash terms this year and a 10.9 per cent increase in capital
spending. Purchasing managers expect the price of goods they buy to rise
only 1.5 per cent in 1994.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the jump in the leading index, led by
a sharp increase in the length of the average working week, indicated the
economic recovery was not losing momentum.
Nine of the 11 components of the leading index rose in March, with positive
contributions from higher commodity prices, an increase in building permits
and orders for durable goods, and a drop in weekly claims for jobless
benefits. The overall index rose 0.4 per cent in January and was revised to
show a zero change, rather than a 0.1 per cent decline, in February.
The jump in the index showed 'the economy continues to hit on all
cylinders,' said Mr Martin Realia, chief economist of the US Chamber of
Commerce.
Most forecasters believe preliminary reports of real economic growth at an
annualised rate of 2.6 per cent in the first quarter, against 7 per cent in
the fourth quarter, understated the US economy's momentum.
Purchasing managers were considerably more optimistic about the outlook for
1994 than they were last December, Mr Robert Bretz, head of the NAPM's
business survey committee, told the association's annual conference in
Atlanta yesterday. In December, purchasing executives forecast an increase
in revenues of 4.7 per cent this year.
Purchasing managers said operating rates at member companies had risen from
83.7 per cent last December to 87.9 per cent, the highest rate since they
began to compile operating rate figures in 1989. They said companies would
respond to capacity shortages by increasing capital spending by nearly 11
per cent in cash terms this year.
Their survey of export intentions was the most bullish since it began in
1987: 64 per cent of members said exports would rise this year, 7 per cent
said exports would decline; 79 per cent of member companies export
regularly.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Ecuador agrees bank debt deal: Pact aims to wipe out overdue
foreign interest payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ecuador and its leading bank creditors have reached an agreement in
principle on a fundamental restructuring of its foreign bank debt. The deal
is aimed at erasing overdue interest with foreign creditors for the first
time since 1987.
The accord, reached late on Monday by government negotiators and a committee
of banks led by Lloyds Bank, covers about Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 3.08bn) of
capital and up to Dollars 3bn of overdue interest.
Announcing the accord in Quito, President Sixto Duran Ballen emphasised that
the country's status as a delinquent debtor had resulted in 'enormous
difficulties in attracting foreign investment, generating employment and
obtaining the necessary technology to compete internationally'.
Under the Brady-style agreement, holders of debt principal will be able to
exchange it either for 30-year bonds carrying a floating interest rate and a
45 per cent discount to face value, or for 'par' bonds with interest
payments stepping up from 3 per cent to 5 per cent in the 11th year.
As is common in Brady agreements - named after former US Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady - the principal and one year of interest on the concessional
bonds will be guaranteed by US Treasury bonds to be held in escrow as
collateral.
The government claimed that it also achieved a 20 per cent reduction on
overdue interest of Dollars 3.1bn, although the calculation is based in part
on contractual interest penalties which are generally not levied on such
reschedulings. Most of the back interest will be repaid by the issue of
20-year bonds with a 10-year grace period before principal repayments are
due.
Mr William Camposano, senior vice-president at Lloyds in New York, said a
full term sheet of the agreement should be in place and an international
roadshow under way 'if all goes well' by the end of June. The government
hopes to complete the deal this year.
The government is expected to secure a standby loan agreement from the
International Monetary Fund this month, and possibly also a rescheduling of
its 1993 and 1994 maturities to the Paris Club of creditor governments.
A maximum of Dollars 800m is available to provide initial payments and
purchase collateral for the agreement. Ecuador never fully consolidated its
bank debt, and though it agreed partial reschedulings in 1983, 1984 and
1985, it ceased fully servicing its debt in 1987.
In the secondary market, the price of Ecuadorean debt rose yesterday before
easing back later. Bankers close to the agreement were keen to avoid the
negative reaction from banks that followed the recent agreement in principle
with Poland.
They emphasised that there would be no reallocation of choices once banks
had made their initial choice and that all the collateral for the exchange
bonds would be available immediately. This contrasts with the recently
completed Brazilian agreement. They argued that there had been no big
concessions on interest arrears.
One said that in negotiating the agreement, the government had been aware
that it would be 'presenting the package to a broader variety of creditors
than would have been the case a few years ago'.
This is a reference to the large number of private investors in such bank
debt. These include the Dart family of the US, who refused to join the
recent Brazil package and who are widely thought to hold positions in
Ecuadorean and Polish debt.
The accord will not need ratification by Congress, but some opposition
politicians, while welcoming the agreement, noted that the current
modernisation law forbids the use of the debt in privatisations.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Clinton toughens stance against Haitian junta
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday refused to rule out the use of force to
oust the Haitian military junta from power. 'It's time for them to go,' he
said, before leaving for Atlanta and an internationally televised news
conference on foreign policy.
However, he emphasised that the first step in renewed US pressure on Haiti
would be to have the United Nations Security Council agree to tighter
economic sanctions, aimed more precisely at the assets of junta members and
of prominent civilian supporters.
'We've tried other initiatives and they have not worked,' Mr Clinton
conceded, 'so we are now doing this sanctions regime as recommended by
President (Jean-Bertrand) Aristide and others.'
Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary, said that military
intervention in the Caribbean country was 'a little far down the way' and
would only be undertaken with congressional approval under the War Powers
Act.
Mr Clinton has come under growing pressure, particularly by the black caucus
in Congress, to act as evidence of atrocities in Haiti proliferates. Father
Aristide, exiled by the military coup of October 1991, has described US
policy towards his country as tantamount to racism.
The administration's stance came under fire yesterday from ex-president
George Bush, whose general policies towards Haiti Mr Clinton has followed,
and from Mr Lawrence Pezzullo, US former special envoy who resigned, under
pressure, last week.
In an interview with a Houston newspaper, in which he confessed to a change
of opinion, Mr Bush said it was time for 'a significant shift' in US policy.
This should combine intensified diplomatic efforts with an end to US support
for the return of the democratically elected President Aristide on the
grounds that it was now clear he lacked sufficient support in Haiti itself.
However, Mr Bush added, it would be 'a tremendous mistake' for the US to
intervene militarily because 'no US lives are at risk in Haiti today'.
Mr Pezzullo, heavily criticised by supporters of Fr Aristide, also warned -
in a letter to Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state  - of 'my grave
concern that we are heading down a path towards unilateral military
intervention'.
The White House yesterday declined comment on a report that it was thinking
of sending US military officials to seek to 'retrain' the Haitian army and
to provide some protection for humanitarian food supplies in Haiti. A
similar, lightly-armed mission was aborted last year off Port-au-Prince in
the face of junta-organised protests.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Castro targets illicit profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES

<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Cuban government is expected to implement a series of fiscal and
monetary measures in the next six weeks, after a two-day meeting of the
National Assembly.
President Fidel Castro said at the end of the meeting, late on Monday, that
the success of the measures would depend on a new law to curb the country's
thriving black market and allow the confiscation of illicit profits.
Mr Jose Luis Rodrguez, finance minister, outlined a series of proposals but
said they might not be the ones to be adopted and implemented by the
government.
There was no indication of reforms to increase production or build up the
supply side of the economy, but the series of proposals included measures to
mop up excess liquidity, to reduce a growing fiscal deficit and to give the
state increased access to the hard currency circulating on the island.
The government is expected to impose a wider income tax, extending it to
many more than the few thousand Cubans who now pay. It also plans to impose
taxes on incomes earned abroad.
The proposals also envisage increases in bus fares and in water and postal
rates. Subsidies on a range of food and medicines would be cut, leading to
higher prices. Prices for alcohol, cigarettes and petrol for private
vehicles would rise. Free entry to sporting and cultural events would end.
The government would also invite Cubans to put their money on fixed deposit.
The government is contemplating creation of a new currency. This would be
convertible, as well as valid at the special and relatively well-stocked
Cuban shops which accept only hard currency. Cubans would be encouraged to
exchange foreign currency for the new peso, thus putting more of the hard
currency in the country under official control.
The government has been increasingly concerned at the rapid devaluation of
the existing peso. The official rate keeps it at slightly more than a US
dollar, but the street rate is close to Ps100:Dollars 1. The government says
nearly 12bn pesos are in circulation, four times the amount needed.
Many of the fiscal measures outlined would be aimed to reduce the monetary
overhang. This would be difficult, given the rate of monetary creation
implied by the government's own figures - a Ps4.2bn budget deficit last year
and nearly 70 per cent of state enterprises losing money.
Mr Castro said the new measures would not be popular, but that a 'disaster'
would ensue if they were insufficient.
He said that the success of new measures would depend on the crackdown on
black marketeers, who have been doing thriving business, mostly in food,
because of shortages in the shops. The government intends to seize their
property and profits.
Cuba's economy has shrunk by half since the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the Caribbean island's main trading partner. The problems were compounded by
the failure of the Cuban sugar harvest last year and a significant reduction
in foreign earnings.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Mandela insists on fruits of liberation: Patti Waldmeir and
Mark Suzman ask whether the new South Africa can afford them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nelson Mandela made one thing abundantly clear when he claimed electoral
victory on Monday night: that he will be moved by the spirit of
reconciliation and compromise on all issues bar one - his economic plan for
uplifting black South Africans, known as the Reconstruction and Development
Programme (RDP).
The message of the man who will henceforth dominate South African politics
was unambiguous: he will tolerate no opposition in implementing this
programme; and anyone who disagrees with it need not bother entering the
government of national unity.
His comments demonstrate the fact that Mr Mandela and his African National
Congress see the advancement of black South Africans as the true goal of
decades of liberation struggle. If political power cannot be used to ease
black poverty, it is not worth having, they would argue.
The foreword to the RDP puts the case even more categorically: 'No political
democracy can survive and flourish if the mass of our people remain in
poverty, without land, without tangible prospects for a better life.'
The ANC cannot expect to remain in power unless it meets these basic needs.
Mr Jay Naidoo, who may be appointed to head a special ministry charged with
implementing the programme, says its objectives must be met or 'none of us
is going to survive'. The programme sets ambitious goals; over the next five
years 1m homes are to be built, 2.5m houses electrified, clean water,
sanitation and health care provided for all. But it also includes a
commitment to fiscal discipline and the need to maintain macro-economic
balance.
'We must finance the RDP in ways that do not cause undue inflation or
balance of payments difficulties,' it says, adding that 'the vast bulk of
the RDP will be financed by existing resources organised, rationalised and
directed within RDP guidelines'.
But the ANC's plans for 'increasing the efficiency of consumption
expenditure and improving the revenue recovery capacities of government'
display a touching faith in the powers of the new broom - and a naive belief
in the willingness of government to cut defence spending.
Mr Naidoo expects a 3 per cent annual rise in the productivity of the civil
service. But the ANC's agreement not to sack white civil servants in large
numbers, coupled with its commitment to promote blacks through affirmative
action, may, conversely, lead to a rise in the cost of the public service.
And with nine new provincial administrations set up under the constitution
and a host of new parastatal bodies created by the RDP itself, it is hard to
share the ANC's optimism about productivity gains. So too is it difficult to
believe that R3.83bn (Pounds 717m) will be saved from defence spending.
It is also worth noting that though the plan cites the need for fiscal
discipline, a commitment to keep the budget deficit at 6 per cent of gross
domestic product, included in early drafts, was removed from the final plan.
Costing the plan is difficult: the ANC says it has budgeted R39bn for the
five-year programme. The National party claims the true cost will be R70bn
in the first year alone, rising to more than R600bn for the full five years.
Given that the financing of the RDP is at best vague, at worst unrealistic,
only time will tell which will turn out to be the true figure.
Still, the South African business community does not seem to be panicking
over the plan, largely because the ANC has shown such eagerness to consult
widely on the programme and seek the commitment of business at every stage.
As economist Mr Rudolf Gouws of Rand Merchant Bank points out, the final
draft has removed many of the 'rough edges' of earlier drafts, making it
more difficult to criticise. And the original heavily 'statist' emphasis of
the draft has been substantially softened, with ANC officials keen to play
up the party's corporatist intentions, rather than its anti-capitalist past.
The real test will come if an ANC government must choose between either
implementing the plan or raising taxes and printing money.
For the moment, its intentions are virtuous; they will be sorely tested by a
spell in power.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Malaysia in row with BBC: News service withdrawn after item

Malaysia, which in late February imposed a ban on giving government
contracts to British companies following unflattering reports about the
country and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in the British press, has now
become involved in an argument with the BBC about its TV news broadcasts.
Satellite transmissions are illegal in Malaysia but since the beginning of
March the BBC has been supplying Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM), the local
state run broadcasting service, with a daily news programme.
Last weekend the BBC withdrew the service, saying RTM had broken agreements
that its news bulletins be run in full and not censored. At issue is an RTM
decision to drop a BBC news item which showed recent labour unrest involving
thousands of people in the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
An official at Malaysia's information ministry said the item had been
dropped so as not to jeopardise relations with Indonesia and accused the BBC
of 'blatantly disregarding Asian sensitivities'.
In place of the BBC news programme viewers will now watch American
wrestling.

FT  04 MAY 94 / US steps up peace efforts on Rwanda
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US has stepped up its involvement in efforts to end the fighting in
Rwanda with the despatch of two senior diplomats to the region and a promise
of Dollars 15m (Pounds 10.2m) of humanitarian aid.
Mr John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state for human rights, and Mr
David Rawson, former US ambassador in Kigali, were due to set out yesterday
for talks in neighbouring Uganda, Tanzania and Burundi.
But US officials said they were working mostly through the United Nations,
adding that US involvement might extend to providing money or logistical
support for a UN force though not to despatch of US troops.
State Department officials added that the US was pushing for the UN Security
Council to impose an arms embargo on Rwanda and had approached other
countries in the region in an effort to stop the flow of weapons into the
country.
Reuter adds from Nairobi: Rebels of the Rwanda Patriotic Front failed to
appear yesterday for peace talks in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha. A
delegation from a rump government which now controls barely a third of
Rwanda had already arrived in Arusha.
However, Mr Emanuel Ndahiro, RPF military spokesman, said the RPF was
prepared to talk to elements of the armed forces in an attempt to halt the
killings.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Johannesburg to relax market access restrictions: Committee
urges increased black participation in stockbroking community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Johannesburg Stock Exchange yesterday announced its intention to relax
restrictions on foreign participation and ownership of brokerages, allow
corporate membership, and lower barriers to entry for first-time investors,
especially blacks.
The exchange is the 11th biggest in the world by market capitalisation with
a value of some Dollars 170bn. The proposals are part of the findings of a
sub-committee that had been commissioned two years ago to 'advise on how the
JSE should be structured as South Africa enters a new era'.
The inquiry was prompted both by a need to increase the efficiency and
accessibility of the exchange in a time of political flux and address
pressure from institutions, such as merchant banks, for the right to deal on
the market.
The committee urges the encouraging of wider share ownership among the black
community, promoting small business and emerging black entrepreneurs, the
expansion of possible channels for black savings in the market, and
increased black participation in the stockbroking community.
The JSE proposes easing access to the exchange for small and medium-size
black companies through a restructuring of the largely moribund local
venture capital market as well as introducing a new class of members of the
exchange to make market entry simpler.
Operational questions addressed by the report centred on whether to permit
corporate members, whether to allow negotiated commissions, and whether to
switch from the current single trading capacity, where brokers act on behalf
of buyers and sellers, to dual capacity trading, where brokers can act as
principal as well as agent. Although divided, the majority report of the
committee decided that a London style, immediate 'Big Bang' was not
desirable for Johannesburg and that 'phased implementation' of deregulation
would be preferable.
It decided to retain fixed commissions at a slightly lower basic rate, but
allow for negotiation on commissions on trades over R3m. On corporate
memberships, it suggests that initially up to 30 per cent of a broking firm
may be sold to non-stockbrokers, with the proportion possibly expanding at a
later date.
As the report also recommends lifting the restriction on South African
citizens becoming brokers, this opens the door for foreign ownership of
broking firms. Several local brokers are already sounding out prospective
international partners.
'There is a great deal of interest among the foreign community in increasing
their involvement on the exchange,' admits Mr Roy Andersen, JSE president,
who described the proposals as an 'elegant solution' that would 'level the
playing field between brokers and bankers and allow the process of evolution
without disruption.'
On the more contentious debate over trading, a majority view decided to
retain the current single capacity so as to prevent possible abuses and
price manipulation. South Africa's banking sector is largely controlled by
conglomerates which have significant industrial interests as well, thus
opening up potential conflicts of interest.
However, the report acknowledged that, were South Africa's restrictive
exchange controls ever lifted as the committee favours, a shift to dual
trading capacity in the broader global market would be inevitable.
The report also blames the foreign currency controls for the problem of
market illiquidity - annual turnover currently amounts to only around 7 per
cent of market capitalisation - but suggests that the abolition of the
Marketable Securities Tax, currently levied at 1 per cent of transactions,
could also help address the problem.
The recommendations have to be passed on to the new parliament and then
legislated before they take effect. Among stockbrokers, the general reaction
was favourable, with some seeing it as a pre-emptive strike against possible
action by the new government. 'All in all it is good news and far better
than having it imposed by an external force,' said one dealer.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Western Cape will prosper, says Kriel
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hernus Kriel, who will head a National party government in South Africa's
Western Cape province, believes most money in any post-apartheid economic
boom will be attracted to his administration, Reuter reports from Cape Town.
Mr Kriel, law and order minister in the the outgoing white parliament, said
in an interview that investors would be drawn to the Cape by his commitment
to law and order and by the white-led NP's commitment to a free market.
'People will invest where they feel their property and profits are safe,'
said Mr Kriel, who is likely to be the only white provincial premier.
Mr Kriel dismissed speculation that the Cape could become a white homeland
or volkstaat, but he said investors would be drawn by the stability of NP
rule following the repeal of anti-apartheid sanctions that deepened the
country's four-year recession.
Economic analysts said, however, that growth would be due to the natural
advantages of the Cape. Mr David Bridgman of Wesgro, a regional economic
initiative, said the Cape was already the country's most attractive venue
for new manufacturing investment.
'There is a threat - and it would be very bad news  - that we could face a
race with the National party going all out to make the Western Cape work and
the ANC going all out to prove it a disaster,' he said.
'There is already a perception of the Cape as being high on lifestyle and
low on violence, which is attracting a lot of people.'
Mr Rob Lee, Board of Executors portfolio manager, said Mr Kriel would have
only limited powers to put the Western Cape on a different economic course
from the policy adopted by the central government. However, 'the National
party will want to make the Cape its showcase, so they'll put everything
into making it look better than the rest of the country.'
He said South Africa's post-apartheid growth would be fuelled by tourism and
manufactured exports and the Western Cape was favourably placed to take
advantage of both.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Founder of Hyundai to retire from management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chung Ju-yung, founder and honorary chairman of the Hyundai conglomerate,
said yesterday he would retire from management of South Korea's largest
business group.
His departure is meant to ease tension between Hyundai and the government,
which has discriminated against the group since Mr Chung unsuccessfully
stood against President Kim Young-sam in the 1992 election.
Since that election, Hyundai has not received low-interest industrial loans
from the state-run Korea Development Bank and has been restricted in raising
capital abroad. Three of its main subsidiaries have also been denied
listings on the Seoul bourse.
The retirement of 78-year-old Mr Chung would end a business career that
began with the founding of Hyundai in 1947 as a small motor service company.
During the next three decades he developed Hyundai into a symbol of Korean
industrial might with 48 subsidiaries and total assets of Won31,700bn
(Pounds 25.8bn).
Share prices for Hyundai companies rose in the expectation the government
would resume financing to the group.
Some government officials have urged that the restrictions against Hyundai
be removed for the sake of the national economy.
Aides to Mr Kim expressed scepticism that Mr Chung would in fact withdraw
from Hyundai's management and retire to live on his farming estate. They
noted that he will remain as honorary chairman and continue to provide
advice to his brother, Mr Chung Se-yung, the group chairman.
Mr Chung described the honorary chairmanship as a 'ceremonial' position, but
his status as group founder almost certainly guarantees he will continue to
guide the conglomerate from behind the scenes.
South Korea yesterday accused North Korea of violating the 1953 armistice
agreement that ended the Korean war by threatening to withdraw from the
military armistice commission.
North Korea said it would try to dismantle the commission unless the US
agreed to conduct negotiations on a peace treaty to replace the truce pact.

Mr Alan Bond, the failed Australian businessman, told a Sydney court
yesterday he was unable to remember anything about a series of Jersey-based
companies which allegedly handled his personal funds and made investments
but were never mentioned in the formal statement of affairs drawn up when he
went bankrupt in 1992.
The bankruptcy trustee is trying to find where Mr Bond's assets lie, to pay
his creditors. One of Australia's most-prominent entrepreneurs in the 1980s,
Mr Bond went into bankruptcy with debts totalling hundreds of millions of
dollars.
At the long-delayed public examination by his trustee in bankruptcy, he said
he had no recollection of telling the Jersey office of Touche Ross to accept
instructions from Mr John Bond, his son, Mr Harry Lodge, a Perth-based
solicitor, or two other business associates, to act on his behalf over his
personal affairs during the 1970s and 1980s.
Asked if he had authorised anyone to set up an offshore company for his
personal benefit, Mr Bond said he could not recall. In fact, Mr Bond could
not even remember Touche Ross.
A day of relentless questioning by Mr Francis Douglas QC, acting for the
trustee in bankruptcy, failed to have any impact on this amnesia. Neither
did the presentation of a deposition given by one of the Touche Ross
partners, a series of notes allegedly taken by Mr Lodge at a meeting with a
Touche Ross partner in Jersey, or letters signed by Mr Bond telling Touche
Ross to accept instructions from some of these individuals.
'What I'm suggesting is that you had substantial sums of money, amounting to
millions of dollars, administered for you through companies in the Channel
Islands,' said Mr Douglas.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Last-minute deal sets up Gaza signing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Palestinian officials early this morning said last-minute differences that
had soured the run-up to today's signing of an historic accord to withdraw
Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho had been overcome.
'We have finished everything, (today) we sign,' said Palestinian negotiator
Nabil Shaath after six hours of talks.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine
Liberation Organisation chairman, met last night in a final effort to
resolve the differences under the pressure of expectation and potential
embarrassment created by the arrival of 2,500 dignitaries and a host of
foreign ministers to witness today's event.
The disagreement occurred when PLO officials claimed Israel had 'reneged' on
more than 20 detailed points of the agreement.
Mr Arafat accused Israel of 'manoeuvres to obstruct the signing', prompting
Israeli officials to blame the disagreements on 'a last attempt' by the PLO
'to get a bit more'.
The points of disagreement included whether the Palestinians could issue
their own postage stamps and have their own phone codes for Gaza and
Jericho, and a dispute over the length of validity of proposed Palestinian
travel documents.
Israel had balked at the inclusion of Mr Faisal Husseini, a Palestinian
leader from Jerusalem, on the proposed list of 25 Palestinians to constitute
the Palestinian authority which will administer limited self-rule until
elections due in October. Israel says no Jerusalem-based Palestinians must
serve on the body.
PLO and Israeli negotiators had left Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat to resolve two
final points of disagreement: whether a uniformed Palestinian guard would be
allowed on the Allenby Bridge linking Israel and Jordan, and the delineation
of the area around Jericho to be ceded to Palestinian control.
The PLO had been seeking more than twice the 54 sq km offered by Israel.
The 200-page document, entitled Agreement on the Gaza Strip and Jericho
Area, would give the Palestinians their first limited degree of political
and economic autonomy since the Israeli state was created in 1948,
committing Israel to withdraw troops from land claimed by the Palestinians
and occupied by Israeli forces during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
The agreement is already 20 weeks behind the schedule under which Israel
should have completed its military withdrawal by April 13.
Once signed, the deal would prompt the immediate conclusion of Israeli
military withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Under a draft text, Israel will
complete the withdrawal within three weeks of signing.
Joint co-ordination and co-operation committees formed under the agreement
will also begin work immediately on overseeing the arrival of the eventual
9,000-strong Palestinian police force, the first 1,000 members of which are
due to begin arriving in Gaza and Jericho to-morrow.

FT  04 MAY 94 / BHP to face ADollars 4bn New Guinea suit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A ADollars 4bn (Pounds 1.97bn) damages suit against Broken Hill Proprietary,
Australia's largest company, is to be filed in Melbourne courts later this
week by about 6,000 Papua New Guinea villagers. The legal action seeks
redress for environmental damage allegedly caused by the Ok Tedi copper mine
in western PNG, which BHP manages.
The class action is believed to represent the largest compensation claim
ever mounted in Australia, with the ADollars 4bn figure comprising ADollars
2bn in compensatory damages and ADollars 2bn in exemplary damages. Shares in
BHP edged lower, by two cents to ADollars 16.90, on the news.
Details of the action were released by the Australian law firm acting for
the villagers, ahead of the actual court filing. The suit itself is likely
to be entered on Thursday by Mr Rex Dagi, leader of the Western Province's
Miripiki clan, in the Supreme Court.
Yesterday's statement from the lawyers said the suit would centre around the
alleged pollution and flooding of the Ok Tedi River, due to dumping of waste
material from the mine. The Western Province was concerned that the mine had
'caused major damage to wildlife dependent on the river, to most fertile
land beside the river, and possibly to the health of local people,' it said.
'The local villagers are demanding a dam be built to contain the waste from
the mine and that the river and the land affected by the dumping of waste be
restored,' it added. The lawyers said that the ADollars 2bn exemplary
damages figure was based on the estimated current cost to build such a dam.
Yesterday, BHP said that the Ok Tedi project 'operates in compliance with
PNG law and with the full support of the PNG government'. It added that any
legal action would be vigorously defended.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Nervous Jericho prepares to greet liberation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Palestinian schoolchildren armed with brooms began collecting rubbish from
the dusty streets of Jericho yesterday to celebrate today's planned signing
of the Palestinian self-rule agreement, Julian Ozanne reports.
Under the agreement, Jericho, a sleepy, palm-fringed town which claims to be
the oldest city in the world, will become the seat of the Palestinian
administration and home to Mr Yassir Arafat, the symbol of Palestinian
nationalism.
At the Israeli police post in the heart of the city, once the target of
Palestinian resistance, schoolchildren collected stones from under coils of
razor wire. Nervous Israeli soldiers armed with automatic rifles watched
from observation towers. But instead of throwing the stones, the children
carted them away to a nearby rubbish tip.
At a schoolteacher's house, youths were busy preparing banners which read:
'South Africa last week - Palestine today.'
Many of Jericho's 14,000 residents believe they are about to witness a
fundamental turning point in their lives after 27 years of Israeli
occupation and centuries of foreign domination. Within 21 days of today's
signing, Israeli troops are scheduled to complete their withdrawal from the
Gaza Strip and Jericho - the first Israeli surrender of Palestinian lands
occupied in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
'When the agreement is signed and the Palestinian police arrive it will be
the beginning of our liberation. The beginning of the liberation of
Palestine,' said Mr Isaac Shawa, a shopkeeper.
But although there are hopes in Jericho, there are also deep fears and
worries about the future. Many Jerichoans remember December 13 when they
prepared to celebrate the beginning of Israeli withdrawal and nothing
happened. The Israeli army exacerbated suspicions yesterday when it closed
the town to visitors.
More worrying is the response of young extremists of the Hamas Islamic
Resistance movement. 'When Arafat comes here we will put a bullet between
his eyes,' said Khalil, a garlic seller.
Ominous signs for future Arab-Jewish relations were also on show on the
outskirts of Jericho, where Jewish settlers protesting against the agreement
blocked a road with burning tyres and clashed with police. Some settlers
said they would not obey any orders from Palestinian police.
The army stopped Jewish settlers travelling through Jericho. For Arab and
Jew at the military checkpoint it seemed the agreement was heralding divorce
rather than co-existence.

<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday stepped up
France's drive to enter Asian markets by vaunting what his country had to
offer Asia in political, aid and commercial terms, David Buchan reports from
Nice.
Opening the annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank in Nice, the French
premier expressed his hope for Europe generally to strengthen its ties with
Asia, but then homed in on French export specialties in telecommunications,
transport and energy, citing South Korea's recent decision to buy the
French-designed TGV train.
Mr Balladur urged ADB member countries to join, and play a full role in, the
new World Trade Organisation which France had pushed for to replace the Gatt
organisation.
Welcoming the effort that 'most' Asian countries had made in the Uruguay
Round to liberalise their trade, he hoped all Asia would see the need to
reciprocate trade concessions made by others, as reciprocity was the only
basis for 'lasting agreements'.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Pyongyang 'violating 1953 truce'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea yesterday accused North Korea of violating the 1953 armistice
agreement that ended the Korean war by threatening to withdraw from the
military armistice commission.
North Korea said it would try to dismantle the commission unless the US
agreed to conduct negotiations on a peace treaty to replace the truce pact.
Pyongyang has violated the armistice agreement 'which provides that this
document may be amended or supplemented only by agreement between the
parties involved,' said the National Unification Board in Seoul.
Both the US and South Korea have said they will not consider the peace
treaty proposal until the North Korean nuclear inspection issue is resolved.
North Korea has refused to attend meetings of the armistice commission,
which helps supervise the 40-year old truce, since March 1991 when a South
Korean general was appointed chief delegate for the UN forces.
Pyongyang boycotted the meetings because it claimed South Korea was not a
signatory to the armistice agreement, which was signed by North Korea and
China on one side and the US-led UN forces on the other.
South Korean analysts believe North Korea is trying to gain several
advantages by raising the peace treaty proposal and linking it with the
nuclear issue.
The most important goal is to exchange nuclear inspections for a peace
treaty that would eventually lead to the withdrawal of US forces from South
Korea and weaken relations between Seoul and Washington.
The proposal is also part of the North's strategy to eliminate South Korea
from the current nuclear negotiations. The North is seeking direct
high-level talks with the US on possible diplomatic recognition, but
Washington has refused to hold discussions until Pyongyang accepts full
nuclear inspections of its seven declared nuclear sites.
Another motive behind the North's action is to blur the international focus
on the nuclear dispute.
'It's their way of moving the goalposts and obfuscating the issue,' said a
US official.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Sri Lanka economy ahead by 6.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sri Lanka's economy grew 6.9 per cent last year, despite the turmoil caused
by the assassination of President Ranasinghe Premadasa and the continuing
civil war in the north, an official report released this week says.
The country saw the highest growth rate since 1978, the report published by
the Central Bank of Sri Lanka shows. Growth was fuelled mainly by a recovery
in agriculture and a 24 per cent increase in investment.
The report comes amid mounting concern about prospects for this year. The
ruling United National party, preparing for presidential elections in late
1994 and a general election early next year, suffered its first serious
defeat in 17 years in provincial polls earlier this year.
Reacting to criticism from within his party, President DB Wijetunga has
launched a populist programme of tax cuts and hand-outs which could strain
the government's resources. Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Freedom party, the main
opposition, has been gathering support at rallies, notably a May Day rally
attended by 200,000 in Colombo.
The Colombo Stock Exchange's all-share index, which rose 62 per cent last
year, has fallen rapidly this year, with further sharp falls this week. The
all-share index lost 48.24 yesterday, falling to 1,002.61 for a two-day loss
of 8.7 per cent.
The report says the inflow of foreign capital soared 47 per cent to SDR490m
(Pounds 466.97m), taking accumulated foreign assets to SDR1.5bn in December
1993, as foreign fund managers poured money into the Colombo Stock Exchange.
Foreign direct investment picked up, notably in Colombo property.
Remittances from Sri Lankans working overseas rose 17 per cent to SDR454m.
Exports were SDR2.1bn and imports SDR2.9bn.
Inflation rose slightly to 11.7 per cent, due partly to higher defence costs
in the north.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Identity crisis for Asian Development Bank: Alexander Nicoll
on a debate about the role of 'soft' public funds in a less than poor region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What should a regional development bank do when its region has become - at
least partly - developed?
The question has occurred to the governments which support the Asian
Development Bank with taxpayers' money. Many industrialised countries feel
that, since borrowers have growing resources and access to private capital,
the ADB should focus on alleviating social problems - for example, reducing
poverty and improving the environment.
Zealous championing of this issue, particularly by the US, has dominated the
ritual discussions over a capital increase for the ADB over the past two
years and has upset some Asian countries even if they broadly agree with the
US arguments.
An even broader questioning of the modern role of international development
banks came from Sir William Ryrie, former head of the World Bank's private
sector arm, the International Finance Corporation, and now a director of
Barings, the merchant bank, during a seminar at the ADB's annual meeting in
Nice.
Massive private investment pouring into economies which were increasingly
market-oriented had made official lending, he said, 'less necessary and
sometimes undesirable'. Official lending could retard development of private
markets by introducing capital which was not subject to the same risk
discipline as private money. Development banks should lend to governments
for sound projects only when the private sector would not meet the need.
Though the debate about a capital increase is virtually over - negotiations
have been completed and ADB governors must vote on a doubling by May 22 -
discussion of the ADB's function continues to swirl.
The bank's new president, Mr Mitsuo Sato, faces a big challenge in
implementing the new strategy set by shareholders while at the same time
seeking to restore bruised dignities in an organisation which, in the Asian
manner, has a strong tradition of operating by consensus.
Simply interpreting the new conditions which are being attached to the ADB's
lending will be difficult. About half of lending from ordinary capital
resources (separate from soft loans) is to be devoted to social-sector
lending. Instead of just financing a road, the ADB should now ensure that
the road is of particular benefit to poor communities, or for example that
the borrowing government charges appropriate fees to trucks to limit
environmental damage.
Most sensitive is a demand by donor countries that loans be linked to 'good
governance' - a phrase with political overtones which alarm many borrowing
countries, particularly those with memories of past colonialism.
Mr Gunther Schulz, an ADB vice-president, says: 'We feel as a bank that we
can only use this term in an economic context, not a political context.'
ADB officials concede, however, that not all donor countries agree with this
interpretation. 'How can we judge human rights in a country?' asked one. 'We
are not Amnesty International. We do not have the tools.'
Mr PK Lahiri, Indian executive director of the bank, said India, while
supporting the capital increase, had reservations about its linkage to
policy and operational guidelines.
India and China also feel that if a high proportion of ordinary ADB lending
is to be devoted to social sector concerns, then they - the borrowing
countries with social problems on the biggest scale - should have access to
concessional loans from the Asian Development Fund which are naturally
targeted at such problems. India and China are denied access to the ADF on
the grounds that their sheer size would swamp the fund's resources.
The changes in policy take place just as the ADB is in any case tightening
up its practices so that loans are better prepared and monitored. The bank
has admitted that it suffered from an 'approvals culture' in which the
primary concern was to pump out loans rather than the quality of projects -
though it does not feel the performance record of projects it has financed
is any worse than that of other similar lenders.
ADB executives insist the bank still does have a valuable role to play. Mr
Sato told the annual meeting yesterday the bank's regional presence acts an
an incentive to others 'to participate in a broad-based portfolio of
investment for sustainable development'.
Mr Schulz said the bank will be much more selective in future lending and
that it should not compete with the private sector. He said the bank could
act as a catalyst by taking small stakes in, for example, big
infrastructural projects, and could also assist longer-term development by
financing education and health.
Donor countries will be closely watching the ADB over the next two years as
they discuss the next replenishment of the ADF - negotiations which, given
the present debate, promise to be difficult.

FT  04 MAY 94 / World Bank plans Dollars 1.2bn Palestinian aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank has produced a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 820m) emergency
assistance programme designed to yield improvements over three years in
living standards in the occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip.
The programme is intended to serve as a sketch map to help co-ordinate aid
flows from a wide range of donors, with the hope of avoiding some of the
problems that could follow as money is pumped into a region with only
rudimentary governmental and institutional structures.
'It is in one sense a blessing not to have a long history of government
bureaucracy. The negative side is you don't have any institutional
structures,' said Mr Ram Chopra, World Bank director in charge of the
occupied territories programme.
The programme proposes investing Dollars 234m for Gaza and Dollars 366m for
the West Bank over the next three years in infrastructure projects such as
water, sewers, transportation, electricity and education, as well as Dollars
300m to support private-sector development of housing, telecommunications
and industry.
But it also includes an unusual Dollars 225m start-up expenditure programme
intended to provide temporary funding for a new Palestinian central
administration, and to finance a social safety net through the public sector
and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) already working in the area.
'It is critical in this period to work with existing institutions and
programmes, composed mainly of municipal structures authorised under the
Israeli government, and the NGOs,' Mr Chopra said.
The World Bank has been working with the Palestinian Council for Economic
Development and Reconstruction, set up by the Palestinian assembly last year
to manage economic issues in a transition period.
The emergency assistance programme represents a first tranche of aid
commitments from donor countries to the occupied territories totalling
Dollars 2.4bn over four years.
Mr Chopra said the Bank's task force had examined proposals totalling about
Dollars 2.8bn, but had cut them to Dollars 1.2bn to include only projects
with the most immediate impact and which could be effectively implemented.
'That does not mean the ones we did not include are not a priority; they may
just not have been ready,' he added.
Earlier Palestinian estimates of the money needed went as high as Dollars
10bn, but Mr Chopra said that included projects over a much longer period,
as well as private-sector investment.
Official statistics suggest an average annual income of around Dollars 1,275
per capita for Palestinians in the occupied territories, higher than in
Jordan and more than double Egypt's income level.
But World Bank studies showed that services such as power, water and
sewerage are often on a par with the least-developed countries.

A last-minute row over details of an historic accord to withdraw Israeli
troops from Gaza and Jericho yesterday soured final preparations for today's
scheduled signing of the agreement, locking both sides into a further and
recriminatory round of negotiations.
Israeli officials insisted the signing would go ahead as planned, even if
the outstanding disputes were not settled. 'Time has its limits and tomorrow
at 11 o'clock we shall sign,' Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister,
said in Cairo.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine
Liberation Organisation chairman, were due to meet last night in a final
effort to resolve the differences under the pressure of expectation and
potential embarrassment created by the arrival of 2,500 dignitaries and a
host of foreign ministers to witness today's planned event.
The last-minute disagreement occurred when PLO officials claimed Israel had
'reneged' on more than 20 detailed points of the agreement.
Mr Arafat accused Israel of 'manoeuvres to obstruct the signing', prompting
Israeli officials to blame the disagreements on 'a last attempt' by the PLO
'to get a bit more'.
The points of disagreement included whether the Palestinians could issue
their own postage stamps and have their own phone codes for Gaza and
Jericho, and a dispute over the length of validity of proposed Palestinian
travel documents.
Israel had balked at the inclusion of Mr Faisal Husseini, a Palestinian
leader from Jerusalem, on the proposed list of 25 Palestinians to constitute
the Palestinian authority which will administer limited self-rule until
elections due in October. Israel says no Jerusalem-based Palestinians must
serve on the body.
PLO and Israeli negotiators had left Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat to resolve two
final points of disagreement: whether a uniformed Palestinian guard would be
allowed on the Allenby Bridge linking Israel and Jordan, and the delineation
of the area around Jericho to be ceded to Palestinian control. The PLO had
been seeking more than twice the 54 sq km offered by Israel.
Mr Rabin's spokesman, Mr Ben Ari, said it was unclear whether the two
leaders would announce any agreement on this and other outstanding issues
before this morning.
The 200-page document, entitled Agreement on the Gaza Strip and Jericho
Area, would give the Palestinians their first limited degree of political
and economic autonomy since the Israeli state was created in 1948,
committing Israel to withdraw troops from land claimed by the Palestinians
and occupied by Israeli forces during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
The agreement is already 20 weeks behind the schedule under which Israel
should have completed its military withdrawal by April 13.
Once signed, the deal would prompt the immediate conclusion of Israeli
military withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Under a draft text, Israel will
complete the withdrawal within three weeks of signing.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Arafat faces storm over self-rule jobs

<TEXT>
Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, is
likely to face a storm of controversy among Palestinians in the occupied
territories over his appointments to the Palestinian national authority
almost immediately after he seals today's Palestinian self-rule agreement.
Details of Mr Arafat's provisional list for the 24-member authority, which
will govern the Gaza Strip and West Bank enclave of Jericho before elections
due later this year and which will act as a de facto cabinet, reveal that he
is determined to stack it with loyalists and members of the Palestinian
diaspora.
Palestinians who live in the occupied territories are critical of the
agreement and deeply suspicious of their leaders who have lived in exile for
several decades. The 'insiders' want a real slice of power in the self-rule
authority.
Officials of Mr Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO have warned of a mutiny
unless Mr Arafat includes many of the younger local leaders who emerged
during the intifada - or uprising.
However, according to senior PLO officials in Cairo and Jerusalem the
authority, to be headed by Mr Arafat, will be largely drawn from outside the
territories and from within Mr Arafat's loyal political factions.
The list includes Mr Hakam Balawi, PLO ambassador to Tunis, who will be in
charge of security; Mr Yassir Amr, a Jordan-based Fatah central committee
member, to head the education department; Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, a PLO
executive committee member, to take charge of communications; Ibtisem
al-Wazir (Umm Jihad), wife of the assassinated PLO's former number two
Khalil al-Wazir (Abu Jihad), who will oversee women's issues; and Mr Ahmed
Qurie (Abu Ala'a), a Fatah central committee member and Arafat loyalist, who
will be finance 'minister'.
The only two Palestinian 'insiders' are Mr Faisal al-Husseini, PLO leader in
the West Bank, in charge of liaison with Israel and Mr Zakaria al-Agra, the
PLO boss of the Gaza Strip.
PLO officials say the list, which has been partially leaked in Jerusalem and
Cairo, could be made public today. Other officials say the PLO is determined
to wait until the Palestinian police force takes control of the self-rule
areas before risking a backlash which the list may provoke.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Hyundai chief retires in attempt to ease tension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chung Ju-yung, founder and honorary chairman of the Hyundai conglomerate,
said yesterday he would retire from the management of South Korea's largest
business group.
His departure is meant to ease tensions between Hyundai and the government,
which has discriminated against the group since Mr Chung unsuccessfully
stood against President Kim Young-sam in the 1992 election.
Since the election, Hyundai has not received low-interest industrial loans
from the state-run Korea Development Bank and has been restricted in raising
capital abroad.
Share prices for Hyundai companies rose in expectation that the government
would resume financing to the group.
But some government officials expressed scepticism that Mr Chung would
actually withdraw from Hyundai's management and retire to live on his remote
farming estate.
They noted he would remain as honorary chairman and continue to provide
advice to his brother, Mr Chung Se-yung, the group's chairman.
The retirement announcement coincides with a legal appeal to overturn Mr
Chung Ju-yung's conviction for illegally financing his presidential campaign
with corporate funds.
Mr Chung received a suspended jail sentence last October and is awaiting a
second trial to review the conviction. Mr Chung severed ties with his
political group, the United People's party, last year and vowed to stay out
of politics in an attempt to appease the government.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Hungarian Socialists attract mixed bag of supporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a party that once believed in monolithic dictatorship of the
proletariat, Hungary's Socialists attract a surprising social mix, writes
Nicholas Denton. State employees, pensioners and the unemployed, the losers
in the transition to a market economy, are their natural and most numerous
supporters. But opinion polls show the Socialists command the most
concentrated support among 'top leaders'. 'If the new Hungarian bourgeoisie
have a party at all, it is the Socialist party,' says Mr Peter Tolgyessy, a
liberal politician. 'The Socialist party has two wings: one is like the
British Tories and one like Labour in the 1950s.'
For Hungary's business elite did not spring into life instantaneously when
the Soviet bloc collapsed in 1990. In Hungary economic liberalisation began
as far back as 1968 and the nomenklatura, leading communists, had time to
translate political power into economic weight.
The Socialists have a constituency that stretches from the new rich to the
unemployed coalminer. Mr Laszlo Bekesi, the Socialists' former and perhaps
future finance minister, matches any conservative or neo-liberal for fiscal
orthodoxy. Socialist campaign posters promise to 'get the expertise back
into government'. The line has broad electoral appeal, says Mr Gaspar Miklos
Tamas, a liberal commentator. 'Voters see the Socialists as the
aristocrats.' At the same time, however, Mr Gyula Horn, the Socialist
leader, has led pensioners and state employees to believe he can halt the
deterioration of living standards.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Left thrives in Hungary's disenchanted soil: Ex-communists
are set for a comeback in Sunday's elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The left, fresh from electoral success in Lithuania, Poland, Russia and
Ukraine, is poised for a comeback in Hungary's parliamentary elections next
Sunday. Voters, disillusioned with four years of a conservative coalition
led by the Hungarian Democratic Forum, are turning to the former communists
of the Hungarian Socialist party.
The Socialists, who scored just 11 per cent in the 1990 national vote, have
surged to well over 30 per cent in latest opinion surveys. 'I did believe
the pendulum would swing back. I did not believe that it could swing back so
far,' says Mr Viktor Polgar, head of the Socialists' Budapest campaign.
The Socialist party is the successor to the communist regime that ruled
Hungary, often brutally, for 40 years. Mr Gyula Horn, the 61-year-old
Socialist leader, went to college in the Soviet Union and joined the 'padded
coats,' the volunteers who helped put down the 1956 uprising against
communist rule.
Government television has taken a literal approach to the search for
skeletons in the Socialists' cupboard. One TV documentary covered the search
for prison cells, torture chambers and bones beneath Socialist party
headquarters in Budapest. Another broadcast an account of Mr Horn kicking in
the teeth of a 'counter-revolutionary' prisoner.
But the TV campaign against the Socialists, so close to the vote and so
reliant on unsubstantiated accusation, has lacked credibility. 'The attacks
actually help us,' Mr Andras Bard, Socialist spokesman, admits cheerfully.
In any case, many Hungarians are inclined to forgive and forget. 'People
change,' shrugs Eva, a Forum voter in 1990 and a Socialist supporter now.
Horn the young communist became Horn the reformist foreign minister of the
last communist government, who let East German 'tourists' out through
Hungary to the west and so helped bring down the Berlin wall.
A despairing conservative official asks: 'Do people forget so quickly?' Yes,
the bad things, at any rate. Voters associate the left less with the horrors
of the 1950s and more with the easy going 'goulash communism' that made
Hungary the 'jolliest barracks in the socialist camp'.
'People who lived in places with the toilet at the end of the courtyard were
able to move into a decent tower block and live in civilised surroundings,'
says Mr Istvan Dobrogi, a worker at the light-bulb maker, Tungsram,
pensioned off after General Electric of the US bought the company.
'There was a bathroom. They could pay the elec-tricity bill and the rent,
keep a small plot and main-tain a Trabant. Only a few people can manage that
now.'
Living standards for most pensioners and state employees have fallen over
the last four years as gross domestic product has shrunk by 20 per cent.
Unemployment has now risen to 12.2 per cent of the labour force. Mr Janos
Plyevszky, a car mechanic, complains: 'Now there is no social safety net, at
least then there was. There are terrible layoffs. They turn off the
electricity if people can't pay.'
Electricity bills do not preoccupy the mobile phone wielding drivers in
Mercedes cars who cruise through central Budapest past boutiques, western
brand-name stores, gleaming new hotels and banks. But the new rich are few
and their conspicuous consumption, though impressive to foreigners, is
galling to many less fortunate locals.
Only 18 per cent of Hungarians polled say they are better off than before,
fewer than in any other east European country except Russia. The
conservative government takes a leaf out of the standard practice for
beleaguered western governments and argues that recession has been as bad,
if not worse, among all Hungary's eastern neighbours.
To no avail. 'Before the collapse of communism Hungarians compared
themselves to Romania and they thought they were doing well,' says Mr Peter
Tolgyessy, a prominent politician of the liberal Free Democrats. 'Now they
compare themselves with Austria.'
The Socialists are the beneficiaries of the public's disgruntlement. 'We get
our support from the fact that most people have had it up to here,' says Mr
Polgar.
It is not fair, respond Hungary's increasingly despondent conservatives. It
was the communist regime that built up eastern Europe's highest per capita
debt and left their successors to repay it. 'For years and years we consumed
more than we produced,' says Mr Tamas Katona, state secretary at the prime
minister's office. 'Ordinary people are paying the price for the previous
system.' And the conservatives, he might have added.

The International Committee of the Red Cross yesterday said that recent
fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh had caused hundreds of casualties and 50,000 people to flee
their homes. ICRC spokesman Pierre Gauthier said most of the dead and
wounded were soldiers. The agency was awaiting word from staff on the front
line on exact numbers.
The ICRC said it had sent tents, foods and medicines to the area but was
stretched by the sheer numbers of people who had fled their homes in
Azerbaijan over the past three weeks. Before the latest exodus there were
about 600,000 displaced people in Azerbaijan as a result of the six-year
civil war. In a statement, the ICRC said it was 'seriously concerned about
the serious turn of events in the northern and eastern fronts in the
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict'. Nagorno-Karabakh is populated mostly by ethnic
Armenians.

Former King Constantine of Greece said yesterday he would launch a legal
battle against the Greek government's decision to seize his property and
strip his family of their passports. 'I will certainly claim my property
with all legal means provided by the (Greek) constitution and laws,' he said
in an interview with the Athens newspaper Apogevmantini. Last month the
Greek parliament approved a bill giving the state control of Constantine's
Mon Repos estate on the island of Corfu, a summer palace in Tatoi north of
Athens, and hundreds of acres in Polydendri in central Greece. Most other
property owned by the former royals before they fled Greece had been given
to the state to cover unpaid taxes.

Poland Partners, a new Dollars 65m (Pounds 44m) venture capital fund, backed
by a US government agency and created to boost the private sector in Poland,
will include five pension funds from US trade unions. Although the unions
have been generally hostile towards overseas investment, US labour rallied
around Poland's Solidarity movement during its days underground, and the
relationship is still close, according to Mr Bob Kalaski, director of
communications for the machinists' union.
The concept for Poland Partners originated after a speech in 1990 to US
unions by President Lech Walesa and the fund has been strongly supported by
the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the US government agency. Opic
has already backed 22 ventures in Poland involving US companies with Dollars
400m in financing and risk insurance, and Dollars 1.2bn in financing in the
former eastern bloc. For this fund it will provide up to Dollars 39m in
investment guarantees. The fund will be managed by the Poland Partners
Management Company, which is owned by California-based Avalon Ventures,
Company Assistance Ltd of Warsaw and Landon Butler &amp; Co of Washington.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italian consumer prices grew 0.3 per cent in April giving an annualised
inflation rate of 4.1 per cent. The monthly rate was marginally up on March
largely due to a rise in cigarette prices. But so far this year the biggest
single rises have been in housing and health. The rise in housing costs in
particular has almost doubled the index average. The prospective rate for
the year as a whole is now running at 4 per cent against 4.2 per cent for
1993. The outgoing government hoped to have a year-end inflation rate
running at an annualised 3.5 per cent. Economists indicated yesterday that
the new government would inherit inflation rates still relatively high by EU
standards and this made cautious management of Italy's timid recovery
essential.

spokesman said 'excellent progress' had been made by Sir Leon Brittan,
European commissioner responsible for external economic relations, and Mr
Alexander Shokin, the Russian deputy prime minister, who met earlier this
week to discuss the two remaining obstacles to the accord - the rules
governing the trade in uranium and access for European banks to the Russian
banking sector. However, he cautioned that the accord still needed to be
approved by member states. France, in particular, is keen to protect its
uranium producers. Mr Shokin and Sir Leon agreed to work on an exchange of

<TEXT>
IG Metall, Germany's engineering union, and Riva, the Italian-owned private
steel company, are locked in an eleventh-hour dispute which could disrupt
the privatisation of Ekostahl, eastern Germany's largest steel mill. The
dispute centres on the composition of Ekostahl's supervisory board after
privatisation. The purchase contract, scheduled for signing last Monday, was
postponed after the union and the family-owned Italian company failed to
reach a compromise. The 11-strong supervisory board will be equally divided
between IG Metall and Riva, with the remaining member holding a neutral
position. However, according to union officials, Riva opposes IG Metall's
nomination of Mr Hans Apel, a social democrat and former federal finance and
defence minister.
The dispute has astonished officials principally because it took the
Treuhand privatisation agency more than two years to find a buyer, and
protracted negotiations with the European Commission, to back a DM1.1bn
(Pounds 440m) restructuring programme which Riva will undertake.

<TEXT>
The recovery in new car sales in France accelerated last month with a 17.2
per cent increase year-on-year to 184,900, according to preliminary figures
from the industry. Sales in the first four months were 13.8 per cent higher
at 638,300 than in the corresponding period a year ago. The French motor
industry has revised upwards its forecast for west European sales this year
to 11.79m, an increase of 3 per cent compared with its previous forecast for
a rise of only 0.8 per cent. Peugeot Citroen and Renault both gained ground
in their domestic market in April with year-on-year increases of 22.6 per
cent and 27 per cent respectively and a combined rise in domestic market
share to 63.6 per cent.
West German industrial output fell in March by 0.8 per cent, adjusted for
price and season, from a revised February figure. It also declined by 0.8
per cent from March 1993, according to a preliminary report by the Economics
Ministry. The ministry had revised the industrial output index for February
to 111.5 from a preliminary 111.4.
Retail sales in Switzerland rose an inflation-adjusted 8.8 per cent in March
year-on-year compared with 3.1 per cent the month before, the federal
statistics office said yesterday.
France's official reserves of gold and foreign currencies rose by FFr1.46bn
(Pounds 170m) in March to FFr317.84bn, according to official figures.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Gonzalez digs in his heels: PM 'will not resign' over
corruption scandals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spain's embattled prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, is determined to beat
off calls to take the blame for growing corruption scandals involving former
leading members of his administration.
A senior aide said yesterday Mr Gonzalez had 'absolutely no intention of
resigning'. Mr Miguel Gil, the government's spokesman, said political
stability was assured because the Catalan nationalists had agreed to
continue backing the government. 'Their support is not in danger,' he said.
The 17 Catalan nationalist members of the Madrid parliament have now become
the power brokers of domestic politics after their vote ensured Mr
Gonzalez's nomination as prime minister following last June's general
elections, which left his Socialist party short of an overall majority,
The assurance of continued Catalan support was given on Monday by Mr Jordi
Pujol, leader of Catalonia's home rule government, the Generalitat, in a
telephone conversation with Mr Gonzalez. Mr Pujol reiterated his decision to
aid the 'governability of Spain' at a later meeting in Barcelona with Mr
Narcs Serra, the Catalan-born deputy prime minister. A former mayor of
Barcelona, Mr Serra would be the politician most likely to succeed Mr
Gonzalez should the premier resign.
The Catalan leader's stand may have gained Mr Gonzalez a breathing space in
which he will seek to regain the political initiative in the face of
continuing pressure from the main opposition party, the conservative Partido
Popular.
Conservative leader Mr Jose Mara Aznar told the FT that Mr Gonzalez had
'become an obstacle in Spanish politics, an obstacle we have to overcome'.
Mr Aznar believes the government has been so discredited by the spate of
scandals that Mr Gonzalez's position is unsustainable. 'It is not reasonable
to ask now for new elections. . . . but I can envisage the prime minister
will (first) hand over power to somebody else.'
Unable to unseat Mr Gonzalez in a parliamentary censure motion, Mr Aznar is
pinning his hopes on next month's European elections when he expects that a
clear conservative triumph 'will accelerate developments'. He forecasts that
general elections in Spain will take place between the autumn and next
spring.

The young man on duty outside the Civil Guard headquarters in Madrid

The 'blemish' is the extraordinary story of Mr Lus Roldan, six months ago

paramilitary police he used to have under his orders.
Mr Roldan, 51, who managed to combine the post with extensive property
purchases and a jet-setting lifestyle, was last year tipped as a candidate
for interior minister. The man who got the job instead, Mr Antoni Asuncion,
handed in his resignation at the weekend over Mr Roldan's embarrassing
disappearance, becoming the first senior victim of Spain's current scandals.
Opposition politicians are now baying for more blood, including that of Mr
Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister, who appointed Mr Roldan.
The headquarters building was where Mr Roldan's business partner, Mr Jorge
Esparza, would (according to the latter's evidence to a parliamentary
committee) walk out with briefcases stuffed with money on his way to a bank.
Mr Esparza said he did not know where the cash came from.
A Civil Guard general told the committee Mr Roldan would choose contractors
for new barracks after calling them into his office. Mr Roldan has denied
taking commissions.
Controversy also surrounds the use of 'reserved funds', alleged to have been
used to provide pay bonuses. Mr Roldan, who denies using these funds, has
said the records have routinely been destroyed.
While in his post, Mr Roldan bought houses and other properties, mostly
through a company called Europe Capital. He and Mr Esparza also travelled
extensively. In one instance, confirmed by Mr Roldan, an official chauffeur
drove his car to Switzerland for the use of his wife, who had travelled
there by air.
The Civil Guard has not made such headlines since Lieutenant Colonel Antonio
Tejero held up parliament at gunpoint in 1981.
The latest publicity has spoilt the forthcoming 150th anniversary of the
75,000-strong force, which polices the Spanish countryside and roads,
protects official buildings and which has borne the brunt of Basque
terrorism. The force's shiny black tricorn hats have given way to green
cloth caps, softening the image of what the poet Lorca called 'those
patent-leather men with their patent-leather souls'.
Mr Roldan, a Socialist party member until his recent expulsion, was the
first civilian to head the force. For an administration already hit by
allegations against a former Bank of Spain governor, the controversy has
eclipsed all other affairs of government. Interviewed in hiding by the daily
El Mundo, Mr Roldan said there were similar irregularities elsewhere in the
Interior Ministry and other departments. 'If I go to prison, I could easily
not go alone.'

FT  04 MAY 94 / Kohl seeks to smooth vote on enlargement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday joined a last-minute push to ensure the
European parliament today ratifies the treaty to bring Austria, Sweden,
Finland and Norway into the European Union.
Ratification requires approval by at least 260 of the 518 MEPs, and party
managers were yesterday making frenetic efforts to ensure enough Yes votes.
According to an official, special travel arrangements were being made to
ensure that several MEPs arrived in time.
In letters to leaders of the main political groups in the Strasbourg
assembly, Mr Kohl promised to ensure the parliament would get the top-table
seat it wants in the run-up to the 1996 constitutional review of
power-sharing in the EU and the Maastricht treaty.
Apart from Mr Kohl's assurance, Mr Ruud Lubbers and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the
Dutch and Belgian premiers (and both candidates to succeed Mr Jacques Delors
as European Commission president) have also made similar pledges.
Germany takes over the EU presidency at the end of next month when a
high-level committee should be set up to prepare the 1996 inter-governmental
conference.
Mr Kohl reminded MEP leaders that he had long argued for strengthening the
parliament as the basis for a more democratic and federal Union.
The parliament has been making its mandatory ratification of the EU's
biggest expansion conditional on a further enhancement of its own role. In
March, it made clear it would not ratify if Britain had its way in the
voting rights row, making it easier for a minority of member states in the
larger Union to block decisions.
Germany took the lead in ensuring Britain received only cosmetic
concessions, but even these have provoked many MEPs into fighting for
postponement of enlargement until the institutional and power balance in the
EU is sorted out.
At least 100 MEPs are today expected to press for a postponement. This
motion will almost certainly be defeated. But the question is whether enough
of the dissidents will then vote Yes on entry for the four newcomers.
Mr Kohl's intervention will bolster arguments that the failure of the
enlargement vote would create an institutional crisis that would hinder
reform. But the British Conservative government faces further discomfort
with its Euro-phobe faction if it backs the Chancellor's pledge to support a
body which is markedly Socialist and federalist.
Polls suggest that after next month's Euro-elections, the parliament will be
even more dominated by Socialists than it is now. Officials in Strasbourg
point out, moreover, that additional seats for Germany to reflect
unification means that federalist Germans will occupy many of the key
positions in the new assembly.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Yeltsin aide wants pledges to the IMF relaxed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin's chief aide on the economy said yesterday that
Russia could not fulfil International Monetary Fund conditions agreed for a
Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.02bn) loan in March and that higher inflation was
the only way to save the Russian economy from collapse.
Mr Alexander Livshits, who heads the group of economists on whom the Russian
president relies for much of his advice, said in an interview that the
reduction in inflation to between 7 and 8 per cent a month had been achieved
too soon. 'It is one thing to have it as a target for December, but to have
it in March-April is destroying our economy.'
The IMF agreed the systemic transformation facility on condition that the
government increased revenues this year and kept expenditure at a target of
Rbs183,000bn (Pounds 65.8bn).
But Mr Livshits said the bulk of expenditure had been absorbed by the energy
andagricultural sectors, 'the two most powerful lobbies in this country by
far,' and the rest was grossly inadequate for the needs of the economy.
'The IMF must learn the reality of the situation and see what is happening,'
he said. 'You can of course continue with the policy of tight money, but it
will mean that industry collapses. The policy must be loosened.'
Mr Livshits, a former economics professor, said the government of Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin appeared to lack the political will to undertake economic
reforms or industrial restructuring beyond tightly controlling credit and
money supply. He agreed the political impetus should come from Mr Yeltsin,
but said: 'We have a separation of powers here and the president doesn't
want to issue orders - do this or do that in the economy.'
Steep falls in production of around 25 per cent in the first quarter of this
year continued in April, he said. The fall in production last month was 29
per cent, compared to 28 per cent in March. 'April is usually not a bad
month for production because there are no holidays, but May is bad (there
are three days of public holidays and many take more) and so we can expect
terrible figures for this month.'
Mr Livshits admitted the official statistics for the economy were unreliable
because they omitted or under-counted the private sector. But they gave an
indication of what was happening in the state sector where, he said,
'factories are just at a standstill'.
Even in growing industries such as consumer electronics and white goods,
production has plummeted this year, he said. Part of the problem was the
huge level of inter-enterprise debts and the refusal of most concerns to
supply parts or goods without pre-payment.
Mr Livshits called for a series of reforms to break up state enterprises and
to end supply monopolies. He also proposed creation of a new commission,
headed by a first deputy prime minister, to deal with strategic economic
issues - paralleling the work of Mr Oleg Soskovets, at present the only
first deputy premier, who heads a committee on operational issues. 'If we
had had such a commission, we wouldn't have had the budget we now have.'
The struggle over the budget has only just begun. It has been passed 'in
principle' by parliament, which is still demanding fundamental changes,
including an increase in expenditure of the kind Mr Livshits is proposing.
But he said the budget might yet be passed because the powerful agrarian
lobby was satisfied with the support it gave.

FT  04 MAY 94 / SmithKline pays Dollars 2bn for US group: European companies
step up transatlantic assault; Kodak to sell drugs division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham yesterday launched a further European assault on the
troubled US drugs industry, offering Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) for
Diversified Pharmaceuticals Services.
In a separate move, Eastman Kodak of the US is to sell its pharmaceutical
division, valued at well over Dollars 5bn, possibly to its French partner
Elf Sanofi.
Together with Monday's Dollars 5.3bn sale of US drug group Syntex to Roche
of Switzerland, this brings the total of US healthcare assets changing hands
this week to more than Dollars 12bn. The moves follow acute pressure on the
US healthcare industry, partly caused by the Clinton administration's effort
to contain costs.
European companies are increasingly seeking bargains in troubled sectors of
the US economy. Last week the UK tobacco giant BAT Industries paid Dollars
1bn for American Tobacco, in an industry also under pressure from the
Clinton administration.
SmithKline Beecham is paying cash for Diversified Pharmaceutical Services,
one of the four largest drug wholesalers in the US. The deal mirrors Merck's
Dollars 6.7bn acquisition last year of the leading drug wholesaler Medco,
which sent shock waves through the US drug industry. Like Medco, Diversified
Pharmaceutical is a so-called pharmaceutical benefit management company,
seeking to obtain bulk discounts from the drug companies on behalf of a
claimed 11m patients.
SmithKline Beecham's chief executive Mr Jan Leschly, who recently described
the Merck deal as 'a stroke of genius', said: 'We must evolve from a
pharmaceuticals manufacturer selling pills to managing total pharmaceutical
care.'
He said the deal marked a transition in the company's strategy that
reflected the change in the business environment in the US. Rather than
simply selling disease treatments, SmithKline Beecham would use economic
data gathered from the millions of patients and potential patients on
Diversified's books to 'manage diseases'.
SmithKline Beecham is the UK's second-biggest drug company after Glaxo. The
deal will not increase its drug sales directly, but aims to use Diversified
Pharmaceuticals to promote its products to drug buyers in preference to
rival drugs.
The deal comes a fortnight before the expiry of the US patent on
SmithKline's ulcer treatment Tagamet, once the company's biggest product and
the world's largest selling drug. US drug buyers have been increasingly
swift to switch to generic versions of drugs as soon as patents run out. Mr
Leschly said: 'We all know the environment in which we work is changing
rapidly . . . Those who fail to adapt will lose.'
United Healthcare, owners of Diversified Pharmaceutical, said it had been
approached by a number of companies since the Medco deal took place 10
months ago. Mr Leschly said discussions had opened last August.
Mr Hugh Collum, SmithKline Beecham's finance director, said the deal was
likely to reduce earnings by less than 3 per cent this year and next. The
price is equivalent to almost 60 times Diversified's operating profits last
year. However, Mr Collum said the purchase was justified by the rapid growth
prospects.
Although Eastman Kodak did not name a firm buyer for its healthcare
business, Elf Sanofi has first refusal on parts of it through joint ventures
with the Kodak subsidiary Sterling Winthrop, bought for Dollars 5.1bn in
1988 in an auction against Roche.
Elf Sanofi said yesterday the Kodak announcement was 'an opportunity to go
the final stage in merging the two businesses', adding that it was
considering the sale of assets to finance a possible purchase.
Kodak's share price rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 46 1/8 at the close, as
the market welcomed its moves to reduce its heavy debt burden. Elf Sanofi's
fell FFr43 to FFr975. SmithKline Beecham's share price rose 26p to 416p.

FT  04 MAY 94 / S Africa poll results halted as officials review vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's electoral machinery ground to a temporary halt last night as
officials fought to reconcile anomalies and irregularities in voting returns
the day after President FW de Klerk conceded defeat to Mr Nelson Mandela's
African National Congress.
Counting was understood to have been completed in most areas, but the
release of results was halted by the Independent Electoral Commission, the
body charged with conducting elections and certifying the poll.
The delay forced the postponement until Monday of the first session of the
national assembly, which was to have been convened on Friday.
Officials privately acknow-ledged that the exercise amounted to an attempt
to determine an outcome that would be broadly acceptable to the three main
political parties - the ANC, Mr de Klerk's National party and Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party.
This involves decisions on how disputed ballots are to be counted. Under the
electoral act, political parties may agree among themselves on how to
resolve anomalies and discrepancies in the vote, if necessary by amending
party totals.
Mr Mandela, due to be nominated as the next president, held talks during the
day with Mr de Klerk, dealing with both the practicalities of the handover
and widespread concerns about the integrity of the voting procedures and the
count itself.
Officials on both sides privately expressed concern that both the momentum
of the transition be maintained and the broad integrity of the result be
accepted. Officials of the long-ruling National party privately expressed
fears over the trend in the results.
They spoke of 'two psychological thresholds' which, if crossed, could strain
the transition and the authority of the yet to be appointed government of
national unity.
They said there would be serious reservations about the outcome if, under
such disputed conditions, the ANC were to achieve more than 66 per cent of
votes cast, allowing it to control the process determining the final shape
of the country's constitution, and if the National party support fell below
20 per cent.
Latest national results, based on half the estimated votes cast, show the
ANC holding steady at 62.5 per cent of the vote and the share of the
National party falling slightly to 22.1 per cent.
Government officials added a third consideration: if the Inkatha Freedom
party gets a substantial majority in its Natal heartland, the ANC may
challenge the result.
A senior ANC leader in the province last night gave notice of a possible
dispute by saying that the lead was 'not a true reflection of the IFP's
popularity', while Chief Buthelezi continued to reserve his position on the
outcome of the poll until the results were known.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Major rebukes Portillo over single currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday rebuked Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief
secretary, as cabinet tensions over Europe and the party leadership left the
government in visible disarray on the eve of tomorrow's local elections.
Facing a fierce opposition attack in the House of Commons, the prime
minister denied the cabinet was split over whether Britain should
participate in a single currency during the next stage of European
integration.
His response coincided with calls from a procession of senior ministers led
by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, for the party to end its factional
infighting.
The ministers sought to dismiss a call from a senior backbench MP, Mr David
Evans, for large-scale cabinet sackings and the appointment of a new party
chairman to replace Sir Norman Fowler. But the damage-limitation exercise
did little to dispel the speculation among Tory MPs that heavy defeats
tomorrow and in the European elections on June 9 would seriously imperil Mr
Major's leadership.
Amid alarm among party managers about the threat of an electoral
catastrophe, Mr Portillo said he had not broken cabinet ranks in voicing
opposition to a single currency.
He told a Westminster press conference that he fully backed the government's
stance that it would decide whether sterling should be subsumed by a single
currency only if and when the occasion arose. Remarks he made at the weekend
had been misreported, he said.
Turning to the leadership, Mr Portillo, the emerging candidate of the right
in any possible contest, insisted he did not expect a challenge to Mr Major.
He was not encouraging friends to campaign on his behalf. But party insiders
did little to disguise Mr Major's anger at the way Mr Portillo had reopened
the European debate in the last critical days of the local elections
campaign.
Officials said the chief secretary had issued his clarifying statement on
the direct instruction of the prime minister's office.
Mr Major's personal irritation was visible when he told MPs that Mr Portillo
had 'made clear this morning that he fully supports our policy on a single
currency, a policy agreed by the whole cabinet of which he is a member'. Mr
Clarke also distanced himself from his deputy at the Treasury.
But ministers on the Euro-sceptic wing of the party backed the chief
secretary. Mr Peter Lilley, the social services secretary and another
prominent cabinet sceptic, was among those said to be angered at the
suggestion that senior ministers were not allowed to voice their opinions.
In the Commons, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, and Mr Alan Beith, the
Liberal Democrat deputy, ridiculed the prime minister for failing to assert
his authority.

FT  04 MAY 94 / Bank of England share settlement system faces delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England yesterday acknowledged that its timetable for speeding
share settlement will not be met.
It said the second phase of the project to introduce paperless settlement
would be delayed, it hoped by no more than six months.
The Bank indicated that the cost of the system, Crest, might be higher than
expected. It announced a 'cap' on Crest's cost of Pounds 35m, compared with
an initial estimate of Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m.
Crest is intended to replace the London Stock Exchange's failed Taurus
system.
However the Stock Exchange's request to be a significant minority
shareholder in Crest was rebuffed, although the Bank said that the exchange
could still be chosen as the 'operator' of Crest.
The operation of Crest, set for 1996, requires a large reduction in the
number of days between the striking of a bargain and receipt of the shares
or payment for them.
From July 18, share transactions will settle 10 days after bargains are
struck, but the Bank had planned to move to a five-day gap from next
January. It will decide by year end when 'Trade Date Plus Five' should be
phased in.
'I expect it will be in the first half of 1995. If it is any later than that
I will be very disappointed,' said Mr Pen Kent, associate director of the
Bank of England who is spearheading the project.
The Stock Exchange said yesterday that it 'understands that the Bank is not
in a position to offer participation in the ownership structure on the basis
of a significant minority interest, as proposed'.
However, it will be a member of a consultative committee advising the Bank
of England-appointed board and will consider whether a small shareholding is
still appropriate.
Large Stock Exchange members have supported its application but fund
managers and bankers have been concerned that a large stake would give it
undue influence over Crest which it could use to advance its own interests.
The Bank said yesterday that 50 City institutions had signed up to become
Crest shareholders and that it was extending the deadline for additional
shareholders by one month.
While these shareholders will not have a direct vote in the ultimate design
of Crest, the Bank will appoint a 'shadow board' of representatives of some
shareholder companies who will make key decisions.
The Bank will not be legally obligated to follow the wishes of the shadow
board but will be minded to abide by its recommendations.

HJ Heinz, the international food group, has asked us to clarify remarks by

FT  04 MAY 94 / (CORRECTED) Survey of Greater Philadelphia (4): Acquisitive
CoreStates becomes a target - In the financial sector, the region has a bit
of everything
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 13th May 1994) appended to this article.
Like two other historic port cities on the eastern coast of the US,
Philadelphia is a mature financial centre. But while New York is the focus
of the banking and securities businesses, and Boston is the home of the
mutual fund industry, Philadelphia's financial industry is less clearly
defined.
Philadelphia does, however, have a bit of everything.
The city and outlying region has large banks: CoreStates is headquartered
there; and several other big 'super-regionals', such as PNC and Mellon of
Pittsburgh and First Fidelity of New Jersey, have a strong presence in the
city.
It has insurance companies: Cigna is one of the nation's largest. It has
brokerage firms and investment banks: Janney Montgomery Scott is the biggest
local firm, and every major Wall Street house operates in the city. It has
money management firms: the Vanguard Group, one of the largest mutual fund
groups, has Dollars 127bn under management. And it has the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange, best known for its thriving currency options business.
Not surprisingly, the financial services sector is a big employer in the
Philadelphia area: CoreStates employs 8,400; Cigna 6,500; the stock exchange
upwards of 3,000; and Vanguard 3,600, at its headquarters in Valley Forge
just outside the city.
Banking, the largest single sector in Philadelphia's financial services
industry, has an interesting story to tell. As in other regions, banks in
the 'tri-state' area around Philadelphia (Pennsylvania, New Jersey and
Delaware) have been part of an industrywide consolidation process that has
trimmed the number of banks through mergers, acquisitions and failures.
In the Philadelphia region, many of the mergers were completed in the first
wave of consolidation at the start of the 1990s. That was when larger
regional banks began to expand by aggressively acquiring smaller ones in
their area. The result was the creation of 'Super-regionals' such as PNC and
Mellon, both based in Pittsburgh, and First Fidelity, based in in New
Jersey.
CoreStates, Philadelphia's biggest bank with net income last year of Dollars
327.9m and assets of almost Dollars 26bn, joined in this trend during that
period with its acquisition of First Pennsylvania. Yet the bank did not hit
its stride in the acquisitions business until the past year, by which time
the other super-regionals from the area had exhausted their appetite for
expansion.
In the past eight months, CoreStates has spent Dollars 1.15bn purchasing
three banks (Constellation of New Jersey, and Independence Bancorp and
Germantown Savings Bank of Pennsylvania) and one asset management company
(Rittenhouse Financial Services of Pennsylvania) from within the tri-state
area.
Two of the bank acquisitions - Independence and Germantown  - were widely
viewed as astute moves. Richard Lawrence, banking analyst at Janney
Montgomery, described the two banks as 'gems', and both will strengthen
CoreStates' presence in Pennsylvania.
The Constellation deal, however, was another matter. Analysts were quick to
point out that the bank had its fair share of problem loans, and many
believed the Dollars 320m price tag was too steep. Terrence Larsen, chairman
of CoreStates, says some of the Constellation deal criticism is valid. 'It
was seen as being pricey and difficult, and I think that's a fair
assessment. We paid full price for it, and we'll have to work very hard to
make it work.'
For CoreStates, however, Constellation 'finishes what we need to do in
northern Jersey,' says Mr Larsen. The bank will be quickly merged into
CoreStates' New Jersey National Bank affiliate. As for the problem loans:
they will either be sold off or taken as a charge against earnings.
Although the acquisitions were primarily about building CoreStates' retail
franchise, the bank also has a flourishing wholesale and electronic banking
business. On the commercial side, the bank focuses on servicing mid-sized
companies in the region, with annual sales of anything between Dollars 15m
and Dollars 20m, while in electronic banking it has long been an industry
leader in providing cash management and transaction processing services to
clients.
The bank also has a sizeable presence overseas, having stuck with its
international business during the 1980s when other US banks pulled out.
Funds transfer and trade finance are trademark businesses, and Asia is where
CoreStates is enjoying the most growth.
The one big question hovering over CoreStates is whether it can retain its
independence for much longer. It is the right size, and is sufficiently
profitable to make it a tempting target for bigger banks, such as PNC, which
has often been mentioned as a potential suitor.
Mr Larsen takes a sanguine approach to the issue. 'I would like to think
we're on some people's list, sure. We're a very attractive franchise. But
we're not interested in being acquired. At the same time, we have not put in
place any shark repellants, and I've never refused to talk to anyone.'
While CoreStates stands out among banks in Philadelphia, the region's
insurance industry is dominated by Cigna, one of the largest insurers in the
US. The company is involved in a wide range of businesses, including
property/casualty and life insurance, reinsurance, pension management, and
financial services. Cigna is also heavily involved in the healthcare
business, being one of the largest, and most profitable, providers of
managed care services in the US as the operator of 48 HMOs (health
maintenance organisations).
It is Cigna's property/casualty business, however, that has attracted most
of the attention recently, and for all the wrong reasons. Since 1989, the
company has lost Dollars 1bn on its p/c business, primarily because of high
asbestosis and environmental insurance claims and the generally 'soft'
pricing environment.
In an attempt to turn the business around, last year Cigna hired Gerald
Isom, head of Transamerica Insurance, to clean up the p/c operation. Mr Isom
quickly restructured the business, cut back the underwriting book, and
reduced the payroll.
With the help of a more favourable pricing climate, Cigna is expecting to
see the first improvement in the p/c operation's bottom line this year.
Given the 'long-tail' nature of the insurance business, however, it is not
likely to return to profitability for several more years.
CORRECTION
CoreStates, the Philadelphia-based bank, serves companies with sales of
between Dollars 15m and Dollars 250m. This range of figures was incorrectly
stated in our survey on Greater Philadelphia (May 4).

FT  03 MAY 94 / IBM to shake up its PC division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines is to change the senior management of its
Dollars 11bn personal computer business which is facing intense competition.
The changes come at a critical time for IBM's PC business, where sales rose
40 per cent last year to achieve a 12 per cent share of the worldwide
market, according to market analysts. However, IBM is believed to have lost
ground to Compaq Computer in the first quarter.
Mr Robert Corrigan, president of IBM PC, who led a restructuring of the PC
business that has led to a strong resurgence in sales, will retire.
His responsibilities for running IBM Personal Computer go to Mr Richard
Thoman, a former Nabisco International and American Express marketing
executive who joined IBM last year. Mr Thoman's career moves have followed
those of Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM's new chairman and chief executive, who also
formerly worked at RJR Nabisco and American Express.
Mr Thoman will now be responsible for the IBM PC company; the Power Personal
Systems division, which is developing a generation of PCs based on IBM's
microprocessor technology; and IBM's printer divisions.
In other management changes, IBM assigned worldwide responsibilities to
senior executives for marketing, product development and finance.
Previously, these duties had been divided along geographic lines.
IBM also announced the appointment of Mr Anthony Santelli, formerly head of
product development for the IBM PC company, to general manager of the Power
Personal Systems division.
IBM said Mr Corrigan had decided to retire at the end of last year, but
agreed to stay on to assist Mr Thoman in the management transition.
Mr Thoman, who has no prior technology experience, is expected to bring a
more consumer-focused approach to IBM's PC business. By taking direct
responsibility for the PC operations, and effectively eliminating a layer of
management, Mr Thoman has also created a direct link between the erstwhile
'independent' IBM PC company and IBM's central corporate executive
committee, which is responsible for corporate strategy.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Formula 1 safety meeting follows deaths
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An emergency meeting to consider Formula One safety has been called for
tomorrow by the world governing body of motor sport, the Federation
Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), after the deaths at the weekend of
grand prix drivers Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger.
The move to ascertain as quickly as possible the precise causes of the
double tragedy came as tributes were paid around the world to Senna, the
34-year-old triple world champion from Sao Paulo.
Mr Itamar Franco, Brazil's president, has declared three days of national
mourning for Senna, who died of head injuries on Sunday when his
Renault-Williams car left the track at 180mph during the San Marino Grand
Prix at Imola.
Austrian driver Ratzenberger was killed 24 hours earlier when his MTV Simtek
Ford left the track near the same spot at similar speed during practice.
The FIA said last night that tomorrow's meeting in Paris would examine
technical, medical, safety and supervisory staff reports, as well as take
evidence from team and circuit personnel.
By last night, no firm evidence had emerged of the cause of either fatality,
Mr Max Mosley, FIA president, said. Defending rule changes imposed by the
FIA which this year have outlawed electronic driver aids, such as traction
control to prevent wheelspin, Mr Mosley said there was nothing to link the
accidents with the technology ban.
Grand prix drivers are to make their own reassessment of the safety
situation at a meeting before the Monaco grand prix in two weeks' time.
Ford and Renault, both major engine suppliers to leading teams, last night
supported calls for a further safety review.
An indication that grand prix racing may now face a period of public
controversy came with a strong attack by the Vatican newspaper,
L'Osservatore Romano.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Palestinians to have right to set up stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Palestinians preparing for self-government in the Gaza Strip and West Bank
enclave of Jericho will have the right to establish a stock market, issue
bonds, create an embryonic central bank and work towards a trade surplus
with Israel, Israeli officials said yesterday.
Although the economic accord signed between Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation last week makes no reference to a stock market or
Palestinian bonds, Israeli officials said they were implicit in the
agreement.
Mr Avi Ben-Basat, head of research at the Bank of Israel, said yesterday the
incoming Palestinian Interim Self-Governing Authority could establish a
stock exchange which would be governed by a securities authority similar to
Israel's. Palestinians, foreigners and Israeli citizens would be able to
invest.
Under the economic protocol, Palestinians will create a Palestinian Monetary
Authority(PMA) responsible for licensing, supervising and inspecting banks;
determining the liquidity requirements on all deposits held by banks
operating in the self-rule areas; and managing foreign exchange reserves and
foreign currency transactions.
The agreement says the PMA will also have the power to regulate and
supervise capital activities in the self-rule areas including the licensing
of capital market institutions, finance companies and investment funds.
Mr Basat said these provisions implicitly allowed for a stock exchange
although he thought the Palestinians would first build up a money market.
'They may concentrate on the money market because it is not developed enough
today,' he said. 'But they have the right to create all the institutions
they need for an efficient capital market.'
Mr Basat said the new trade policy of the accord, which allows Palestinians
to import directly and boost exports, could eliminate the current Dollars
300m trade deficit with Israel, possibly creating a trade surplus with
Israel leaving the self-rule areas with an excess of Israeli shekels which
would remain the legal tender.
Under the accord the PMA has the right to convert excess Israeli shekels
into foreign currency at the Bank of Israel according to a mutually agreed
annual estimate of the flow of goods and services between Israel and the
self-rule areas.
Mr Basat said this, combined with exports to the rest of the world, foreign
aid and loans, could lead the Palestinian self-government to accumulate
foreign currency reserves which could back significant bond issues.
Palestinian and other Arab nationals would be the most likely investors in
the new bonds. which would be an important source of financing for the
activities of the self-government.
Mr Basat said the monetary authority was not a central bank because under
the agreement the Palestinians would not be allowed for the moment to issue
their own currency, and would therefore be limited in their ability to
influence monetary policy.
Israeli officials said the decision not to allow a Palestinian currency was
largely political because it was an issue of 'sovereignty'. But Mr Basat
said there were also significant economic reasons behinds Israel's refusal.
He said a common currency made trade relations much easier and cheaper,
prevented Palestinian migrant workers from incurring high conversion fees
and allayed Israeli fears that the Palestinian self-government would print
money to finance its activities rather than work on collecting taxes and so
risk high inflation.
'You could say high inflation was a Palestinian problem but we have a big
interest in their success because their success will stabilise the peace in
the area,' he said
However, Palestinian economists and bankers said the PMA would be
effectively an embryonic central bank that would be well poised to take full
control over monetary policy within a year or two.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Taiwan deputies shout out about overseas votes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
About 40 opposition deputies yesterday stormed out of a session of Taiwan's
National Assembly after leaping onto their seats, screaming and unfurling
protest banners as President Lee Teng-hui began an address, Reuter reports
from Taipei.
'Long live Taiwanese. Oppose overseas Chinese voting for the president,'
deputies in the main opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP) chanted
as the assembly convened a three-month session to debate constitutional
reforms.
'Look clearly Mr President,' a DPP assemblyman screamed as he and colleagues
held up banners reading: 'Giving overseas Chinese the right to vote for the
president is like luring a wolf into one's home.'
Under a political reform package proposed by the ruling Nationalist party,
ethnic Chinese living outside Taiwan and China will have the right to vote
for the island's president.
DPP deputies oppose the proposal, arguing many of the overseas Chinese do
not pay taxes and have dual citizenship. 'The loyalty of overseas Chinese to
Taiwan is questionable,' one DPP assemblyman said.
According to government statistics, there are about 34m overseas Chinese
worldwide. Taiwanese authorities are still studying how many would be
eligible for absentee balloting.
The package needs the approval of the 314-member assembly, dominated by the
Nationalists who hold 247 seats.
Mr Lee appeared indifferent to the walkout and screaming, and continued with
his speech.
'We cannot cut ourselves off from society and amend the constitution without
basis . . . We must gradually revise concepts, laws and systems which are
out of keeping with the times,' he told the session.
Outside the assembly chambers, DPP deputies shouted insults at deputies
appointed to represent overseas Chinese.
Earlier, a group of DPP assemblymen charged the podium, jumped onto the
chairman's table and ripped away microphones to protest the presence of
plainclothesmen in the chambers, delaying the start of the session.
The reform package also calls for the introduction of direct presidential
elections by popular vote - an issue which had previously divided the
Nationalists.

FT  03 MAY 94 / White House pushes gun control
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration has begun an all-out drive to win support for a
ban on assault weapons and large-magazine guns, but still faces possible
defeat when the measure comes to a vote in the House of Representatives
later this week.
White House officials acknowledge they are still around 15 votes short in
the House, despite the support of Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois, a
senior Republican who has in the past opposed similar bans but who voted for
the measure in committee last week. The proposed law closely resembles a
measure included last year by the Senate in a much broader crime bill, and
would outlaw 19 specific weapons, as well as high capacity magazines.
It would also impose a more general ban on semi-automatic weapons which have
additional features such as flash suppressors, but would specifically exempt
over 600 types of gun considered to have a legitimate sporting purpose.
But Congressman Jack Brooks, a Texas Democrat who is chairman of the House
judiciary committee, opposes the ban and kept it out of the House's broad
crime bill, hoping that if it is defeated on its own on the floor of the
House he will have more leverage to resist it as the House and Senate try to
reconcile their versions of the crime bill.
Senior administration officials have tried to tackle the National Rifle
Association, the potent gun lobbying group which opposes the measure, by
mobilising police officers and hunters to argue for it.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, pointed out that the bill seeks to
restrict magazines that hold as many as 90 rounds, while federal law
restricts hunting for migratory birds to guns with no more than three
shells.
'Now, why should we have laws that protect ducks more than human beings?' Mr
Bentsen asked.

Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, has ordered an inquiry
into public criticisms of US policy towards former Yugoslavia by senior UN
officials in Bosnia that were the subject of a sharp protest by the Clinton
administration.
Mr Boutros Ghali told Mr Yasushi Akashi, the top UN mediator, that his
suggestion the US had become 'afraid, timid and tentative' since the Somalia
debacle, was 'completely unacceptable'.
In an exchange of letters made public last night, Mr Boutros Ghali informed
Mrs Madeleine Albright, the US delegate to the UN, that he shared her
'profound concern' over the affair.
Mr Akashi had been told to 'take every measure to ensure that there are no
recurrences' on his part or that of other UN officials.

probe into safety
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An emergency meeting to consider Formula One safety following the deaths of
grand prix drivers Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger has been called by
the world governing body of motor sport, the Federation Internationale de
l'Automobile. The move to ascertain the precise causes of the double tragedy
came as tributes were paid around the world to Senna, the 34-year-old triple
world champion from Sao Paulo. Brazil's president Itamar Franco declared
three days of national mourning for Senna, who died of head injuries when
his Renault-Williams car left the track at 180mph during Sunday's San Marino
Grand Prix at Imola.

TUESDAY
Dutch general election
A closely-contested general election in the Netherlands sees the retirement
from national politics of veteran prime minister Ruud Lubbers (left).
Support for Mr Lubbers' Christian Democrats is forecast to fall by about
half, and the party may be forced into opposition.
The Labour Party, junior partners in the current coalition, also faces a
severe electoral decline. Increased support for smaller parties will
probably result in a three-party coalition.
Bond hearing: The long-postponed public examination of Alan Bond, the failed
Australian businessman, by his bankruptcy trustee begins. Two weeks ago,
lawyers for the former tycoon withdrew a request for an adjournment until Mr
Bond's mental state improved. They had previously argued he was severely
depressed and his IQ had plummeted from 150 to 90 because of brain damage
suffered during cardiac surgery.
Contaminated land: Responses to the UK government's consultation paper on
contaminated land, Paying for our Past, are due in today. The paper, which
follows the government's scrapping of proposals for a register of
contaminated land, calls for comments on the size of the problem and to
determine who should foot the bill of cleaning land.
Saleroom: Two weeks of big money spending in the art market start tonight in
New York with a Christie's auction of contemporary art. 'Number 22', a
painting by Jackson Pollock, created in 1949 by the dripping and pouring
technique rather than the paint brush, is estimated at up to Dollars 3m,
while Mark Rothko's atmospheric blur 'Four Reds' should make Dollars 1.8m.
FT Survey: Romania.
Japan's Golden Week:
Japan is on its annual 10-day spring break, which ends on May 7. This year,
an estimated 66.7m people are heading off on holiday, a record 450,000 of
them abroad, attracted by the strength of the yen, which has made Haiwaii
cheaper, for Japanese holidaymakers, than Hokkaido.
Holidays: Japan (Constitution Day), Sri Lanka, Thailand.
WEDNESDAY
MID-EAST SIGNING CEREMONY
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation are due to sign an
agreement granting limited Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and
Jericho. A ceremony is to be held in Cairo in the presence of President
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Warren Christopher, US secretary of State, Yitzhak
Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Yassir Arafat, chairman of the PLO.
The European Parliament, holding its last plenary session before the
European elections, votes on the accession treaties of Norway, Sweden,
Finland and Austria. It must approve the treaties by today to make entry on
January 1 1995 possible. With many MEPs campaigning or not standing for
re-election, worries are that not enough will show up to produce the 260
votes needed to gain an absolute majority out of the 518 seats.
Australian White Paper: Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister (left),
unveils the federal government's white paper on industry and employment. It
will detail measures to address Australia's vexatious unemployment, along
with regional development policy and help for Australian companies selling
into Asian markets. The white paper's release comes a week before the
federal budget statement, and Mr Keating's announcement is likely to
pre-empt big expenditure items.
South Korea's defence minister, Rhee Byoung-tae, arrives in Germany
following a six-day visit to Russia, where he discussed the possible
purchase of advanced weapons as payment for an outstanding Dollars 1.5bn
loan that Seoul gave the former Soviet Union in 1991. He will be discussing
possible arms purchases in Germany as well.
Nigeria's long-heralded and oft-postponed 'war against indiscipline and
corruption' is scheduled to begin.
Saleroom: The highlight of Sotheby's auction of contemporary art in New York
tonight is 'Highway' by Jasper Johns. Inspired by the artist's experience of
driving on a New York highway at night, this blur of reds, blues and yellows
is estimated at a hefty Dollars 8m, showing a return of confidence to this
section of the art market.
Football: In the European Cup Winners' Cup Final, England's Arsenal play
Italy's Parma in Copenhagen.
FT Surveys: Restructuring Eastern Germany and Greater Philadelphia.
Holidays: Japan, Russia (Orthodox Easter).
THURSDAY
Local elections in Britain
England, Wales and Scotland vote in local elections that will determine
whether the Conservative party remains a force in local government and - no
less importantly - whether John Major is likely to face a leadership
challenge from disaffected Tory MPs later this year. Elections are being
held for metropolitan and shire councils, but attention will focus on the
results in outer London, where the Tories have traditionally been dominant.
Palestinian police force: The ending of more than a quarter-century of
Israeli occupation begins, as Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank
town of Jericho see the deployment of their own police force. An advance
guard of 1,000 Palestinian police will cross into Gaza and Jericho to begin
to take over security from the departing Israeli army. Israel is expected to
complete its military withdrawal and the transfer of civilian administration
to the PLO within a maximum of three weeks.
Tsutomu Hata, Japan's prime minister, on a trip to Western Europe originally
organised for his predecessor, visits Germany. He meets Chancellor Kohl,
Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, and Johannes Rau, prime minister of
North Rhine-Westphalia, where the city of Dusseldorf is home to the largest
concentration of Japanese in Germany.
Beirut renewal: Shareholders of Solidere, the Dollars 1.8bn company that
plans to rebuild central Beirut, hold their second meeting to incorporate
the company.
The Badminton Horse Trials, England's premier equestrian event begin at
Badminton House, Avon (to May 8).
Savoury tooth: The British Association for Toothfriendly Sweets launches its
campaign in London.
FT Surveys: International Corporate Finance and FT Exporter.
Holidays: Japan, South Korea (Children's Day), Mexico, Thailand (Coronation
Day).
FRIDAY
Channel Tunnel 'opening'
Today sees the official inauguration of the Channel Tunnel. However, more
than a year behind schedule and more than twice the original budget, it will
not actually open to passengers until at least the autumn.
In the morning, the Queen opens the Waterloo International rail terminal in
London (below), while in Paris President Francois Mitterrand opens a
terminal at Gard du Nord.
Both will then take Eurostar trains to Calais for an opening ceremony. The
Queen and President Mitterrand will then drive, in her Rolls Royce, on to a
vehicle shuttle and head through the 55km tunnel to Folkestone for more
ceremony on the British side.
South Africa's president is due to be elected by the National Assembly. The
president, almost certain to be Nelson Mandela, will be sworn in on May 10
in Pretoria.
Ethnic Armenian separatists in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh enclave in
Azerbaijan have accepted Russian proposals for a cease-fire starting today.
Hong Kong: Lu Ping, Beijing's top official on Hong Kong affairs, is expected
to lift the veil on China's policy towards the colony, when he addresses a
lunch sponsored by the combined chambers of commerce in Hong Kong.
Making his first visit since Chris Patten became governor, Mr Lu is expected
to indicate how Beijing will deal with Britain on 'non-political' matters
arising from the transfer of sovereignty in 1997. Bilateral co-operation on
political development collapsed last year. Since then, there have been signs
that Beijing is prepared to discuss economic matters.
East Timor: Indonesia and Portuguese foreign ministers meet for United
Nations-sponsored talks on the former Portuguese colony, annexed by
Indonesia in 1975, a move not recognised by the UN. The UN secretary-general
Boutros Boutros-Ghali is expected to attend.
Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister holds a meeting with his Austrian
and Swiss counterparts in Munich. Among the items on the agenda will
doubtless be how to plan co-operation with Austria in and Switzerland
outside the European Union.
FT Surveys: Madeira and The Channel Tunnel.
SATURDAY
Hata returns to Japan
Tsutomu Hata, Japan's prime minister, returns to problems at home after a
trip to Europe. The aim was to strengthen relations before the Naples summit
of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in July.
Last week, the Socialists, the biggest party in the ruling alliance, dropped
out of the coalition, depriving it of a parliamentary majority. Hata's
minority government is likely to be shortlived.
Vietnam celebrates the 40th anniversary of the battle of Dien Bien Phu,
which ended nearly a century of French colonial rule.
Time warp: British and French vintage cars, taking part in a rally from
London to Paris to mark the Channel tunnel inauguration, will travel through
it by shuttle.
Under fours: A special handicap mile at the Iffley Road track in Oxford is
part of the celebrations of Roger Bannister's breaking of the four-minute
barrier there in 1954.
The Kentucky Derby is run at the Churchill Downs course, Louisville.
SUNDAY
Panamanian elections
Five years after the US invasion, the presidential candidate for the party
of General Manuel Noriega is going into the election as favourite. Ernesto
Perez Balladares of the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) leads the
polls.
His nearest challenger is the lawyer-actor-salsa singer, Ruben Blades, who
heads a new green-leaning political movement Papa Egoro (Mother Earth in a
local indian language).
Costa Rican presidency: Jose Mara Figueres, the son of 'Pepe' Figueres, the
popular former president who dominated Costa Rican politics for two decades,
assumes the presidency. Mr Figueres has pledged to place a greater emphasis
on social issues than the outgoing government.
Hungary holds the first round of parliamentary elections. The second round
is due to be held on May 29.
Sumo-time: The 15-day Grand Summer Sumo Tournament starts in Tokyo.

Tuesday: Figures for M0, the narrowest measure of the UK money supply, are
expected to show growth of 5.9 per cent in the 12 months to April. This is
still well above the government's 0-4 per cent monitoring range and would
provide further evidence that consumer demand remains buoyant despite the
tax rises.
The Treasury's panel of independent forecasters, the so-called 'wise men',
meet to discuss the prospects for the UK economy. Their findings will be
published on May 17.
German industrial production data for March are expected some time this
week. Analysts forecast a monthly rise of 0.5 per cent, compared with
February's 1.2 per cent.
Wednesday: The UK's official reserves are expected to show no change in
April, after falling by Dollars 45m in March. The Treasury will release its
monthly monetary report, to coincide with the meeting between the chancellor
and the governor of the Bank of England.
Thursday: German unemployment statistics for April are expected to show a
seasonally adjusted rise of 23,000 in the west and an unadjusted fall of
20,000 in the east.

FT  03 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Strong financials take
Frankfurt to record high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The absence of British participation took the edge of bourse trading, but
German investors seemed happy to do without foreign support, writes Our
Markets Staff.
Other senior bourse had their problems: technical bugs delayed the Paris
opening by four-and-a-half hours; Milan, after extended attempts to clear a
blockage in the system, suspended trading for the whole day; and Madrid,
taking a local holiday, saw its thunder stolen by a combination of
Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia.
FRANKFURT hit a record closing high, although strength in financials was
offset by a less enthusiastic performance in many cyclicals, and falls in
the big three chemicals stocks after profit-taking.
The Dax index rose 22.67 to 2,268.5 with German traders especially
encouraged by the DM67, or 2.6 per cent gain to DM2,655 in Allianz on a
higher dividend, the deep discount on the insurer's planned rights issue and
on relief that rumours of a negative weekend magazine article on the company
turned out to be unfounded.
Brokers also saw switching from chemicals, which saw gains of around 10 per
cent on last week's first quarter figures, into financials, where
Bayernverein rose DM13 to DM524, Commerzbank by DM7.50 to DM366.50, and
Deutsche Bank DM15.30 to DM796.50 as shock waves following the Schneider
property debacle continued to diminish.
Turnover eased from DM9.1bn to DM7.9bn. In chemicals, Bayer and Hoechst both
fell DM4.50, to DM389.30 and DM3.60 respectively, BASF losing DM2.30 at
DM327.
PARIS finished below its highs after a delayed, but strong start, the CAC-40
index closing 20.27 higher at 2,186.23. Turnover was thin at FFr2.07bn.
The market had little time to react to initial issues but it marked its
satisfaction with the stake-holding deal involving LVMH, the world's largest
luxury goods group, Christian Dior and Guerlain, the French fragrance house.
LVMH rose FFr15 to FFr944 and Dior by FFr12.60 to FFr425. In the same
general area, L'Oreal extended its uptrend with a rise of FFr27 to FFr1,262.
Meanwhile, Club Mediterannee, the leisure group, had what dealers called a
technical bounce, recovering FFr19.90, or 4.8 per cent to FFr433.90 after
Friday's 7 per cent drop.
The SBF, the French stock exchange association, said yesterday that that
work at the weekend to increase the number of connections to its trading
network had disrupted the exchange's software, causing delays in the
re-booting of the computer system, writes John Ridding in Paris.
The disruption was the latest in a series of technical hitches over recent
months, resulting from increased demands on the system and a programme of
modernisation. The Paris bourse has seen a sharp rise in trading volume,
partly because of the French government's privatisation programme, and an
increase in the number of connections demanded by stock brokers.
AMSTERDAM saw thin trading with many foreign investors hesitant ahead of
today's general election. The AEX index rose 0.66 to 413.92.
Chemicals continued their rally. DSM put on Fl 1.90 to Fl 140.30 in advance
of today's results while Akzo added Fl 2.60 to Fl 226.30 in continued
response to last week's better than expected figures.
Philips rose Fl 1.10 to Fl 55.40 amid bullish forecasts for first quarter
net profits, due tomorrow: analysts expect profits to rise by up to 200 per
cent.
In contrast, the dollar's weakness left Royal Dutch Fl 4.10 down at Fl
200.20.
ZURICH turned higher, with London's closure removing some of the selling
pressure which was evident at the end of last week. The SMI index added 31.9
to 2,768.2.
Ciba registered rose SFr31 or 3.7 per cent to SFr868.
Brown Boveri put on SFr13 to SFr1,303 on news that Asea had won a German
power-plant contract in a consortium worth Dollars 330m, of which around
Dollars 240m is earmarked for Asea.
Rieter, in textile machinery, added SFr50 to SFr1,780 ahead of today's
annual news conference. In telecoms, Ascom rose SFr20 to SFr1,330 as it
named a new chief financial officer.
MADRID, closed for financial news, heard threats of further revelations on
the political corruption front. Based on trading in other Spanish bourses,
the Ibex 35 index fell 28.64 to 3,492.09. Telefonica reflected mid-morning
weakness on Wall Street with a fall of Pta40 to Pta1,790; but the linked
banks, Santander and Banesto, escaped the downtrend with rises of Pta80 to
Pta5,890, and Pta125 to Pta1,250 respectively.
STOCKHOLM was supported by a firmer bond market and the Affarsvarlden index
put on 22.4 to 1,499.9. Pharmacia B added SKr5 to SKr118. OSLO fell 1.2 per
cent in response to the weak dollar and the all-share index dipped 7.57 to
626.56 in in thin turnover of NKr265m.
COPENHAGEN fell 1.1 per cent with trading dominated by profit-taking in the
newly-privatised Tele Danmark. The KFX index fell 1.21 to 108.65 in heavy
turnover of DKr1.3bn.
Tele Danmark, gave up DKr5 to DKrDKr329, compared with the privatisation
price of DKr310.
TEL AVIV held its ground after a 3.9 per cent increase on Sunday, the
Mishtanim index easing a mere 0.32 to 228.77. Sunday's rise of 8.6 points
reflected optimism over Israeli peace prospects with the PLO and Syria.
ISTANBUL fell another 6 per cent after a drop of 18.3 per cent last week,
the composite index closing 903.83 lower at 14,192.85. The focus of
investors' fears moved away from last Friday's suspension of eight brokerage
houses, and into uncertainties about the general direction of money markets.

FT  03 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rebounds after sharp
early decline

Wall Street
US stocks, led by cyclical and pharmaceutical issues, rebounded yesterday
even though bonds were stubbornly anchored in negative territory, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 19.33 better at 3,701.02, while
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.11 higher at 453.02 in
brisk trading.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite edged 0.29 ahead to
440.20, but the Nasdaq composite gained 6.84 to 740.68.
A downward drift in share prices at the opening accelerated into a
full-scale retreat soon after the National Association of Purchasing
Management released its April survey at 10am.
A more bullish market may have interpreted the data as the best of both
worlds, as it indicated the economy had grown at a better-than-expected pace
last month, while price increases moderated. The overall index of business
activity came in at 57.7, against a March reading of 56.7. The prices-paid
component slipped to 63.2, from 64.2 the previous month.
In the event, stocks chose to focus on the US Treasury market, a path which
led to solid losses by mid-morning. With sentiment weighed down by a host of
unfavourable technical factors and an overriding uneasiness over monetary
policy, bonds were showing moderate losses over the entire session.
Still, share prices managed to battle back to near their opening levels by
midday, and powered solidly ahead late in the afternoon.
In the end, investors apparently decided to take the good economic news at
face value, bidding up the share prices of companies expected to benefit
from healthy growth. Alcoa jumped Dollars 3 to Dollars 70 1/2 , DuPont
gained Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 58 1/2 and Ford climbed Dollars 2 1/2 to
Dollars 60 7/8 .
The pharmaceuticals sector was in play following news that Roche, the Swiss
drugs group, had made an agreed Dollars 5.3bn takeover bid for Syntex. The
offer, which valued Syntex shares at Dollars 24 each, propelled the stock
Dollars 8 3/8 higher to Dollars 23 1/2 .
Elsewhere, Upjohn gained Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 28 1/2 amid speculation
that its weak new-product development program would make it the sector's
next target. Buying spilled over into Merck's stock, pushing it up Dollars 1
1/2 at Dollars 31 1/8 and contributing to the Dow industrial index's rally.
Warner Lambert jumped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 69 1/2 and Pfizer Dollars 2
1/8 to Dollars 61 1/8 .
On the Nasdaq, Wellfleet climbed Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 77 5/8 and Cisco
Dollars 2 3/16 to 32 1/2. Microsoft added Dollars 3 to Dollars 95 1/2 after
announcing a development pact with Texas Instruments.

FT  03 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region mixed as Nikkei
falls 0.8% in low turnover

Shares lost some ground in thin conditions as investors held back from
trading ahead of the three-day holiday, which begins today. The sharp rise
in the yen provided a further disincentive, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index fell 155.04, or 0.8 per cent, to 19,570.21 after a high
of 19,648.53 and a low of 19,488.90. Arbitrage trading depressed prices, but
late overseas demand eroded some of the earlier losses. Volume totaled 130m
shares against 217m.
Some analysts said that the rise in the yen, which reached an eight-month
high against the dollar, had already been discounted into stock prices
following the inauguration of Mr Tsutomu Hata's minority government.
Investors, however, said that the rise had increased the risk of committing
funds to the stock market.
'With the price to earnings ratio at 100 and the yen at these levels, people
have started to realise that their initial forecasts for the market were a
little optimistic,' said an official at Nippon Life, the largest life
assurer. He said the Nikkei index could fall to as low as 18,000 in the near
term.
The recent volatility of the yen was seen as a threat to the earnings
recovery expected during the second half of the year. Some traders feared
that overseas investors, who had bought Japanese stocks during the first
quarter, might start to take profits as the yen's appreciation pushed up the
value of their portfolios.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 9.85 to 1,593.48 while the
Nikkei 300 lost 1.85 to 291.25. Losers led gainers by 736 to 223, with 157
issues remaining unchanged.
High-technology stocks lost ground on profit-taking. Hitachi fell Y9 to Y951
and Fujitsu lost Y20 to Y1,000. Large-capital stocks were also sold, with
Nippon Steel down Y3 to Y344 and Mitsubishi Heavy losing Y1 to Y674.
Arbitrage selling depressed some banking stocks. Industrial Bank of Japan
fell Y10 to Y3,150 and Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank declined Y20 to Y1,880.
Speculative shares were picked up by individual investors looking for quick
profits. Brother Industries, the most active issue of the day, rose Y27 to
Y665.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 125.94 to 21,892.55 in volume of 32.3m
shares.
Roundup
The region offered a study in contrasts, with its biggest equity markets
depressed in thin trade but Manila and Seoul in upbeat mood. Singapore,
Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Colombo were closed for holidays.
HONG KONG dropped 1.9 per cent in thin trade amid uncertainty over interest
rates, the Hang Seng index closing 166.37 lower at 8,799.70 after
futures-led selling emerged in the afternoon.
Turnover fell from HKDollars 3.11bn to HKDollars 2.38bn, property shares
continuing to slide on newspaper reports of a softening in the real estate
market, the sector index falling 393.03, or 2.55 per cent to 15,012.47.
SHK Properties tumbled HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 45.00, and Cheung Kong
HKDollars 1.00 to HKDollars 35.50.
AUSTRALIA saw turnover hit a seven-month low as the All Ordinaries index
fell 18.2 to 2,047.9. Volume was 128.2m shares valued at ADollars 253.9m.
Southcorp shares were suspended after tumbling 17 cents to ADollars 3.14,
pending an announcement. The company later announced the resignation of its
managing director, Mr Ross Wilson.
A sharp fall by Samantha Gold dragged the golds index down by nearly 2 per
cent, Samantha losing 80 cents, or 14.3 per cent, to ADollars 4.80 following
news that reserves at its Chalice prospect have been downgraded.
NEW ZEALAND fell mostly on a 7 cent decline in Telecom as local and
international support for leading issues failed to materialise. The NZSE-40
index fell 14.06 to 2,096.15 although the broader market fared better, the
small companies index gaining 11.37 to 4,672.45.
KARACHI fell in dull trade with dealers reluctant to enter the market amid
widespread disturbances in the city. The KSE 100 slipped 25.01 to 2,377.31.
BOMBAY recovered slightly towards the close on buying by Indian mutual
funds. The BSE 30-share index ended 0.72 higher at 3,746.19. Turnover stayed
low, depressed by the mid-March ban on forward trading imposed by the
Securities and Exchange Board of India.
MANILA rose on expectations of strong first quarter Philippine economic
growth. The composite index closed 41.22 higher at 2,885.44, also boosted by
a 5 peso rise to 176 pesos in San Miguel A shares on speculation that the
company would convert its Hong Kong brewery into a high-class residential
development. Turnover, however, fell from 987.6m pesos to 697.8m.
SEOUL did big business on institutional buying of medium-priced blue chips,
the composite stock index closing 10.54 higher at 919.26. Turnover was
Won1,001bn, representing the highest volume of trading since March 17.
TAIWAN's weighted index rose 40.13 to 5,777.48 in thin trade. Interest was
seen in selected industrials, late buying in financials.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (9): Middleweight with mission - An open
line foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic, an international pariah in the
eyes of the United Nations, visited Bucharest in April he was given the full
red carpet treatment by his Romanian hosts.
For President Ion Iliescu and Mr Teodor Melescanu, his foreign minister, the
niceties of international protocol mattered less than the opportunity to
continue a dialogue with their Balkan neighbour. The Serbian leader's visit
allowed them to offer their good offices for the resolution of a conflict
which has already cost Romania billions of dollars and which could still
develop into a wider conflict.
'Starting from the idea that there is no military solution but a kind of
balance of forces in former Yugoslavia, we see our role to encourage and
assist the parties to find a solution and keep the lines of communication
open,' says Mr Melescanu, who earlier had been host to the Croat president
Franjo Tudjman and is expecting a visit shortly from the Bosnian president
Mr Alija Izetbegovic.
'We believe that there can be no solution without Serbia and that pushing
isolation too far encourages extremist forces. Many Serbs believe that an
international conspiracy is ranged against them,' he added.
But Romania's foreign policy interests range well beyond the Balkans and the
wider Black Sea region which Bucharest sees as a promising focus for future
economic development as well as a forum for promoting greater stability and
co-operation in the region.
As in Britain, Romanian politicians believe that Romania should 'punch above
its weight' in international diplomacy. This belief was taken to extreme
lengths during the Ceausescu years when the dictator persuaded western
countries to turn a blind eye to his repressive domestic policies by defying
Moscow and vying with Yugoslavia's Marshal Tito for influence among the
'non-aligned countries' of the third world. An active and highly
personalised foreign policy gave Mr Ceausescu an excuse to jet-set around
the world, hob-nob with the mighty, sleep in Buckingham Palace and develop
political and economic ties with countries as diverse as China and Israel.
The foreign policy of the post-Ceausescu regime is more modest and more
closely tied to national interests. Romania's close interest in the
evolution of the Yugoslav imbroglio for example can be easily explained by
the long common border with Serbia which means, Mr Melescanu underlines,
that 'we are vitally interested in containing the conflict and preventing
its extension'.
It is not only a security issue. The UN embargo on trade with Serbia has
severely damaged transit down the Danube and a once thriving trade between
the two countries and blocked several Romanian-Yugoslav joint ventures. On
the other hand, the break up of Yugoslavia has reinforced Romania's status
as the biggest state in the Balkan region, capable of playing an important
role in the wider Black Sea region.
To this extent, Romania looks both east and west, maintaining good relations
with Greece and Turkey and anxious to rebuild its economic links with middle
eastern markets. The present government is more at home with this
two-dimenensional policy than opposition leaders who tend to argue that
Romania's future security and prosperity depends upon the greatest possible
integration into western economic and security organisations, particularly
the European Union and Nato.
Mr Corneliu Coposu, president of the National Peasants Party, the mainstay
of the Democratic Convention, says 'the government wants to maintain its
non-orientated path, to rotate the wheel to east or west'.
But Mr Melescanu points to a series of recent moves that underline Romania's
desire for closer ties to the west. Last year, Romania signed an association
agreement with the EU and recently became the first post-communist state to
sign up to Nato's proposed partnership for peace. 'No country in this area
can survive on its own and neutrality is no longer applicable,' he adds.
'The only choice for us is membership of Nato which we see as an efficient
supporter of democratic values.'
Romania is acutely aware that economic weakness prevents it pulling its full
weight as a country with 23m inhabitants and good connections to the Middle
East as well as both eastern and western Europe. But its image in the west
has also been adversely affected in the past by outbreaks of intolerance
against ethnic minorities, especially the nearly 2m ethnic Hungarians,
concentrated mainly in Transylvania, and the large gypsy communities.
The exodus of hard working, ethnic Germans from the Transylvanian towns and
villages, settled since the 13th century by descendants of Saxon immigrants,
has already been a great cultural and economic loss. The airing of
historical resentments against ethnic Hungarians by Romanian nationalists
risks causing a similar haemorrhage of talent and skills unless sensitively
handled by leaders of both communities.
Both can rely on a degree of moral and practical support from governments in
Bonn and Budapest. But such support is not available to gypsies, whose
plight has worsened substantially throughout former communist Europe with
the new freedom to express ancient resentments and the bitter economic
contest for housing, jobs and other scarce resources.
Romanians are probably no less tolerant, nor more violent, than other
people. But life here is hard and still getting harder for millions of
people. Until prosperity returns, an undercurrent of ethnic tension will
continue to test the patience and tolerance of majority and minority alike,
and affect the image which Romania presents to the wider world.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (10): Capitalist instincts sprout /
Examining the effects of an agricultural revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Picture the 1992 Los Angeles riots taking place in the countryside and you
will get a fairly accurate picture of how Romania's agricultural reforms
were conducted after the 1989 revolution.
Irrigation systems were torn apart by peasants who needed pipes and spare
parts, tractors were cannibalised and herds of livestock were split
haphazardly among their shepherds. 'After 1989, everyone grabbed everything
he could,' explains Valentina Vladoiu,who runs what is left of the state
farm in the mountain village of Calvini. She is also president of an
association of 28 private farmers who have teamed up to create a 32 hectare
farm.
Three gutted barns 200m from Mrs Vladoiu's two-storey home show the scant
resources the farmers have to work with. Timbers, window frames and even
electrical fuses have been looted, leaving skeletal structures. Mrs Vladoiu
says: 'Those who were stronger and quicker took everything.'
Thisbrutal privatisation was made formal in 1991, when the government passed
a land decree meant to return property to its pre-war owners. More than 80
per cent of arable land in Romania is in private hands, although the new
owners do not yet have the right to buy and sell their holdings.
Survival of the fittest proved to be the guiding principle in the
redistribution of agricultural land. Driving over a muddy dirt track through
her village Mrs Vladoiu points to the most fertile, black, loamy fields in
the valley and reels off the names of their owners. One belongs to the
mayor; the next to his brother; further along are the new, private holdings
of his best friends.
The picturesque but barely fertile fields that climb up the slopes of the
mountains surrounding Calvini were reserved for less well-connected
villagers. 'Of course this is causing tension in the village,' says Mrs
Vladoiu. 'Those who had the best land before the war now have the worst and
vice versa.'
Giving land back to the peasants, who account for 45 per cent of Romania's
population, wiped out one of the few achievements of socialism in the
agricultural sector. The large collective farms were cut into the
inefficient, handkerchief-sized plots that were the Eastern European norm
before the second world war.
These radical and chaotic rural reforms led to a disastrous fall in
agricultural production in 1990-92 of between 20 and 30 per cent on the
figures of the late seventies and early eighties. But agricultural
production is recovering. The harvest in 1993 was 12.4 per cent higher than
1992.
Western experts say that, in the agricultural sector,Romania's radical
approach has brought irreversible reforms.
'The beauty of the big bang approach is that it brings a creative
destruction,' says Mr Mike Hicks, deputy head of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development in Bucharest. 'In Romania they broke their
legs in the fall, but now agriculture is starting to crawl its way up and
eventually the bones will heal.'
Shops full of meat and cheese - a minormiracle in a country that, in the
1980s, had one of the lowest average calorie consumptions in Europe  - is
one sign of healing. Another is that ever-more-prosperous entrepreneurs are
assembling large, viable farms by leasing land from dozens of individual
owners.
Two hurdles must be cleared before Romania can reclaim its traditional
position as one of the chief agricultural producers in central Europe.
First, farmers have not been given formal, legal title to their land, and
sale of the newly privatised rural properties is banned for ten years.
Without clear titles, farmers are finding it difficult to obtain credits to
buy machinery, seed, fertilisers and herbicides. The ban on the sale of land
is slowing the creation of larger, more efficient farms.
The second issue, often overlooked by the architects of agricultural reform
in post-communist economies, is howagriculturalmaterials and products are
distributed.
In highly centralised Romania a single organisation, Romcereal, supplied all
agricultural materials: seed, fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides and fuel.
It collected, stored and distributed all the agricultural products in the
autumn. A sister organisation controlled most heavy agricultural machinery.
Romcereal maintains its monopoly on distribution, despite land
privatisation. Many private farmers - often unable to get credits and with
limited access to agricultural materials and machinery - have little
alternative but to indenture themselves to Romcereal.
In return for a guaranteed supply of materials, they agree to sell part of
their grain to Romcereal at reduced prices.
Gradually Romcereal's monopoly is being eroded. It faces stiff competition
from western commodities companies offering similar package deals, but with
higher quality products and better prices. Some rural entrepreneurs are
becoming rich enough to buy their own materials, build their own granaries
and sell their crops at market prices.
Better still, Romcereal is beginning to collapse from within, as capitalist
instincts start to sprout in the hearts of the old agricultural bosses. Mr
Alexandru Chioreanu, the head of Romcereal's branch in the Transylvanian
town of Arad, is eager to break away from the domination of his head-office
in Bucharest and, eventually, to break up and privatise Romcereal.
'We are not very interested in what Bucharest has to say anymore,' Mr
Chioreanu says. 'Instead, it is they who must listen to us. There is no
doubt that Romcereal should be broken up. The state should retain two or
three silos and the rest should be completely privatised.' When that
happens, Mr Chioreanu will probably have the option of becoming the head of
a local commodities trading company, Arad's version of Cargill.
But he has a different capitalist dream. He is trying to piece together a
100 hectare farm which he will run as soon as Romcereal is pushed into the
private sector.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (8): Same team is still in charge -
Romanian politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After winning the sympathy of millions around the globe who watched the 1989
Christmas revolution on their television sets, Romanians confounded their
new-found western friends by electing former communists to power just five
months later.
Four years on, the same team, grouped behind President Ion Iliescu, is still
in charge, having won general elections in 1990 and 1992 despite its dubious
political tactics, notably the use of coalminers to intimidate or assault
opponents on several occasions in 1990 and 1991.
However, even President Iliescu's most fierce rivals recognise that, under
his leadership, Romania has undergone great political and economic changes
albeit at a pace slower than many would have wished.
'The team which hijacked the revolution from the young generation has been
forced to accept several democratic changes such as a multi-party political
system, a free press and the right to hold demonstrations,' says Mr Corneliu
Coposu, a 77-year-old former dissident who heads the National Peasants
Party, mainstay of the Democratic Convention (DC), the main opposition
group.
Since narrowly winning the September 1992 elections, President Iliescu's
party, now called the Party of Social Democracy of Romania (PSDR), has
sought to change its image as a group of unreformed, unrepentant communists
by co-opting younger members and espousing market-led reforms.
'The challenge is to combine the experience of the old with the imagination
of the young,' says Mr Adrian Nastase, 43, the former foreign minister who
became executive president of the PSDR last year.
To this end, the party has begun talks with the Democratic Convention and
the Democrat Party, the other main opposition group which is led by Mr Petre
Roman, Romania's first post-revolution prime minister, and which has become
the standard-bearer of International Monetary Fund and World Bank-backed
reforms.
The talks are aimed at broadening parliamentary support for the PSDR
minority government which relies on three small former communist and extreme
nationalist parties to reach a slim 53 per cent majority.
The hope is that a political pact will make parliament more effective after
a year and a half in which internecine battles over often minor issues have
held up important reform legislation such as the bankruptcy and securities
laws.
Few, however, believe the talks will be successful in the near future,
despite opinion polls indicating popular disenchantment with the PSDR
government.
According to Irsop, a local market research organisation, most Romanians
perceive the government as lacking direction, moving too slowly on many key
reforms and acting to protect its own interests rather than those of the
country.
Irsop polls indicate that two thirds of the population would like to see the
opposition form a government or take part in a coalition with the PSDR.
Despite the government's breakthrough this spring with the IMF, the
opposition says the ruling party still has no clear reform strategy and
remains held together only by allegiance to President Ion Iliescu and by the
desire to stay in power. PSDR members, they say, cover too wide a political
spectrum to formulate coherent policies.
The opposition has conditioned any political pact on the exclusion of the
PSDR's extremist allies, the Socialist Labour Party (SLP), the former
communist party, which is led by Mr Ilie Verdet, a Ceausescu-era prime
minister, and the Greater Romania (Romania Mare) party, a xenophobic,
anti-semitic organisation.
However, it is not clear the PSDR is prepared to ditch the two groups which
in the past year have acted more like satellite parties than separate
entities. Both have faithfully supported the PSDR in parliament and taken up
second-level posts in the administration. Their intemperate outbursts and
slur campaigns against reformers in the government and opposition have drawn
little public criticism from the PSDR.
The opposition says the real agenda of the PSDR and its allies - drawn from
the former communist nomenklatura of state factory bosses, secret police and
second-level bureaucrats - is to stall reform while they attempt to maintain
their control of state institutions and state property.
'They are no longer fighting for Marxist-Leninist ideals but to protect
their interests,' Mr Coposu says, alluding to many recent corruption cases
involving members of the PSDR or those close to it.
The PSDR has attempted to consolidate its power not just in central
government but in state enterprises and at the lower levels of the
administration where competent technocrats have been weeded out in favour of
the loyal. The party has also been unwilling to devolve power to local
government, preferring to rule the country's disparate and ethnically
diverse regions from Bucharest.
It is only now introducing local tax laws to provide revenues for elected
local governments which, in many areas, are controlled by the opposition.
The opposition, which includes the party of Romania's 1.7m ethnic Hungarian
minority, is pushing for western European-style subsidiarity and a high
degree of local autonomy.
However, the inclusion in the Democratic Convention of the Hungarian party
has been one of the many sources of tension within the Convention. The DC, a
loose coalition of anti-communist, intellectual and liberal parties, has
failed to use its time in opposition to resolve differences over issues
ranging from economic policy to the restoration of the monarchy and the
Hungarian minority.
The DC's internal divisions have been exploited by the ruling alliance which
includes the Romanian National Unity Party, an anti-Hungarian group which,
like the Hungarian minority, is based in Transylvania, Romania's western
province which was ruled by Budapest until 1920.
With its populist, nationalist slogans, the RNUP, like the SLP and Romania
Mare, has won support by playing on the fears and ignorance of a population
emerging from totalitarian rule and struggling to survive a severe economic
recession.
Mr Coposu says: 'After 45 years of Soviet and communist darkness, Romanians
have lost their political intuition. The civic level needs to increase for
people to be able to fashion political positions normally again.'
The fear is that - as in Russia - extremists will gain more ground if an
ailing economy causes living standards to fall further and prevents the
formation of a solid middle class capable of supporting centre-right parties
and western-style democracy.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (7): Convert to capitalist ways / Profile
of President Ion Iliescu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Romania has come a long way since it shed the Stalinist-style cult of
personality which characterised the Ceausescu regime
But the forces of continuity remain strong and the post-Ceausescu
constitution leaves many key powers in the hands of the president and
commander-in-chief, including the choice of a prime minister.
Ultimately, the buck still stops with the president, which for the last four
years has meant at the desk of Mr Ion Iliescu in Cotroceni, the former royal
palace on the outskirts of Bucharest.
Mr Iliescu, who is also the eminence grise behind the left-wing ruling
party, the recently re-named Party of Social Democracy of Romania(PSDR), is
a man with his emotional roots in the communist past.
Like many of his generation, however, he appears to have undergone an
intellectual conversion to the virtues of privatisation and capitalist
development as a more efficient and less damaging instrument for achieving
the social and political development which he once thought would be
delivered through Marxism.
Mr Iliescu's father Alexandru was a leading member of the communist youth
movement in Romania's small pre-war communist party, and the president
himself was a senior figure under Nicolae Ceausescu before being sidelined
in the early 1970s as the dictator rid himself of potential rivals.
After 18 years of semi-obscurity, latterly as the head of a state-owned
publishing house, Mr Iliescu re-emerged at the head of the self-appointed
National Salvation Front in December 1989 after angry crowds forced
Ceausescu to flee Bucharest in a doomed escape bid.
The re-emergence of a key figure from the distant communist past rather than
someone clearly identified as an opponent of the previous regime, still
rankles with many Romanians who hoped for a clearer break with the old
regime. But such was the degree of social and political control under
Ceausescu that few Romanians were untainted by some form of collaboration
with 'the power' and no-one else emerged to challenge the political skills
and back-up enjoyed by Mr Iliescu.
Since the chaotic early days of the post-Ceausescu period, Mr Iliescu has
consolidated his position and his legitimacy by winning two presidential
elections. He resembles his Ukrainian counterpart, President Leonid
Kravchuk, another professional politician trained in the hard school of
communist realpolitik.
His background gives him a shrewd grasp of the realities of power in a
country of great regional variation, ethnic and cultural complexity, and,
perhaps above all, a fragmented opposition and poorly developed civil
society. But Mr Iliescu's greatest good fortune is his 18-year estrangement
from power. This permits him to share the anger of millions of Romanians for
the humiliation and waste of the Ceausescu years.
Looking back on his predecessor he recalls 'an uneducated man who became
more and more suspicious', especially after his Asian tour in 1971 when he
became fascinated by Kim Il Sung (the North Korean dictator). Mr Iliescu,
who accompanied Ceausescu on his procession around Asia says: 'I opposed his
plans to emulate the Korean model, arguing that it was simply not possible
to treat human beings in this way, to suppress their humanity.'
But, looking back at the evolution of his split with Ceausescu, the
president concentrates on the mid-1960s, a time when Romania started taking
an foreign policy line independent from Moscow and, together with
Czechoslovakia, was in the forefront of moves to try and liberalise the
Stalinist economic and political model.
Mr Iliescu was an enthusiastic supporter of such reform in the 1960s, but he
draws a veil over the 1950s when he was picked out for rapid promotion by
Ceausescu, then in charge of party cadres, after ruthlessly conducting a
purge of politically and socially 'unreliable' university students.
In the 1950s, Stalinism and Stalinist methods were still universally
practised, even by the successors who partially debunked him. But Mr
Iliescu's track record as a 'reformist' in the years leading to the Prague
spring was known to the 'reform communists' surrounding Mikhail Gorbachev.
In the late 1980s Moscow sought to replace the old Brezhnevite leaders of
Warsaw Pact Europe with like-minded 'new men', before reluctantly coming to
the conclusion that such managed change was beyond the grasp of a weakened
and demoralised Soviet Union.
Mr Iliescu declines to be drawn into a discussion of whether 'the
revolution' of December 1989 was part of a planned neo-communist restoration
similar to that attempted, unsuccessfully, in east Germany. Asked whether
the events of 1989 were a revolution or a palace coup he replies that 'it
was a process determined by objective factors', before launching into a list
of reasons why perestroika failed in the Soviet Union.
It is likely that Romanians would have been spared much suffering and
indignity had Mr Ilisecu rather than the Ceausescu clan been in charge for a
quarter century. Romania would probably have developed along the lines
pioneered by Janos Kadar, the post-1956 leader of Hungary's 'goulash
communism'. But then Mr Iliescu would almost certainly have shared the fate
of other communist leaders in 1989 when the Soviet leadership lost its will
to retain the Red Army's wartime acquisitions in central Europe.
Instead, Mr Iliescu returned to the centre of power after the Ceausescus
were conveniently shot.
On several occasions since then Mr Iliescu has demonstrated his willingness
to employ the iron fist, notably when the Jiu valley coalminers were called
in to intimidate political opponents in June 1990 and September 1991.
Mostly, however, this mean streak is kept under wraps by a wily politician
whose sensitive antennae and smiling avuncular image allows him to appear as
the guarantor of stability in a potentially volatile environment.
After a lengthy period of indecision following the 1992 elections he
recently emerged as a supporter of the tough monetary and fiscal policies
required to gain the backing of financial institutions and foreign
investors.
In a long interview he underlined his support for economic policies which
satisfy the lending institutions but which have led to several potentially
threatening protest strikes in recent months. 'There is a danger that
people's patience will snap. Four years ago all applauded the return of
liberty, but standards of living have fallen, unemployment has risen and
many now question the value of democracy. But I think the worst is now
over,' he says.
'Last year we removed subsidies, introduced VAT and other taxes and
inflation soared to nearly 300 per cent. But inflation was down to 5-7 per
cent a month over the first two months and we are liberalising the foreign
exchange market.'
'Meanwhile the collapse of industrial production has been reversed, exports
are rising and this year we shall benefit from higher foreign investment and
new loans from the IMF, World Bank and other institutions,' he adds.
The president, like several of his ministers, criticises the international
institutions for dragging their heels. 'When we needed their help most they
were very reluctant and conservative. Now the situation is better and the
co-operation is excellent, but we would have preferred help when we needed
it most,' he says.
But those close to the World Bank - opposition critics like Mr Petre Roman
and Mr Adrian Severin and even economic advisers to the president himself -
blame the government's slow-down of privatisation, its failure to close or
downsize persistent heavy loss makers among the biggest state-owned
industries, and a general ambivalence about market reform for '18 wasted
months'.
Now, even the fiercest critics acknowledge that Romania again has an
opportunity to move ahead with economic reform amid thus far desultory
efforts to form a parliamentary pact between the ruling party and the
opposition so as to underpin the reform process.
The attempt to form a government of 'national unity' in Romania failed 18
months ago and the price has been a slowdown in the pace of reform which the
country can ill afford.
It remains to be seen whether better use will be made of the new window of
opportunity which has emerged with the evolution of an economic policy
framework acceptable to the international institutions, and relatively
encouraging for the private sector.
Mr. Iliescu was interviewed by Anthony Robinson, Virginia Marsh and Chrystia
Freeland.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (3): Success story needed - A fresh
attempt at privatisation is planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH

<TEXT>
Reformers are hoping that this summer's planned public offer of up to 10
state companies will re-launch Romania's privatisation programme which last
year ground to a halt after becoming the focus of political battles between
reformers and conservatives.
'We hope to involve as many people as possible in the public offer and to
create a critical mass behind privatisation after a year of inactivity,'
says Mr Adrian Nitu, vice-president of the Private Ownership Fund (POF) in
the western Banat-Crisana region, one of six funds which own and manage the
6,300 companies earmarked for privatisation under a 1991 law.
'We've deliberately chosen very attractive firms - our first choice is a
furniture company - as we badly need to give the public a privatisation
success story.'
If the offer goes ahead, Romanians will, for the first time, be able to
exchange privatisation vouchers - distributed free to all adults in 1992 -
for shares in state companies.
The vouchers, or Certificates of Ownership, represent the population's 30
per cent share in the 6,300 companies and are held by five regionally-based
POFs. The state's remaining 70 per cent is held by the State Ownership Fund
(SOF) in Bucharest.
The aim is to follow up the public offer with the launching of a stock
exchange later this year. A securities commission has already been set up,
under the aegis of the finance ministry, while in March, parliament finally
began to discuss the securities law, drawn up with Canadian help in 1992.
The public offer and stock exchange projects are among the first joint
projects in which all bodies involved in privatisation - namely the six
funds, the government's economic reform council and its co-ordinating body
the National Agency for Privatisation - have co-operated.
Relations between the different groups were tense last year, partly due to
the appointment of Mr Emil Dima, a conservative senator in the ruling Social
Democracy party, as president of the SOF.
Under Mr Dima, the SOF last year pursued management and or employee buy-outs
as the main method of privatisation, invested privatisation proceeds in
decapitalised, loss-making state companies, sat on plans to close down or
restructure large, highly unprofitable enterprises blacklisted by the
government, appointed party loyalists to company boards and management, and
refused to decentralise power to the POFs as provided for under the
privatisation law.
The result was that just 250 mainly small companies were privatised, well
short of the initial target of 800-1,000; the rate of foreign investment in
Romania dropped and, in 15 months, the SOF went through three general
managers who were either sacked by Mr Dima or were unable to get along with
him.
However, since the appointment of Mr Constantin Dumitru in February, the
situation has improved.
Mr Dumitru, 54, a communist-era deputy minister of machine-building, appears
determined to make the privatisation scheme work and to have more political
clout than his predecessors.
He is co-operating closely with the POFs on the public offer and has worked
out a draft mandate giving the five funds the right to negotiate sales of
100 per cent of companies on behalf of the SOF.
He has also signed an agreement with the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development under which the bank will analyse 25-30 medium-sized
companies, short-list 10-12 and appoint a western merchant bank to find
foreign buyers for them.
Mr Nitu of the Banat-Crisana POF, however, fears privatisation will remain
highly politicised. He says the POFs' recently-appointed new boards, are
'small parliaments', representing a cross-section of the political spectrum.
He points out that Mr Dima remains head of the SOF, even though asked on
several occasions by the government and reportedly also by President Ion
Iliescu to make a choice between being a senator and SOF president. He is
also concerned by plans to extend the MEBO methodology to medium-sized and
large companies.
The fear is this will enable the former communist nomenklatura at the head
of state companies to retain control of much of the economy. Mr Dumitru says
unco-operative managers are one of the biggest obstacles to privatisation.
There are also many corruption cases involving company officials. Typical
frauds include managers or their friends and family setting up private
trading companies to handle a state company's inputs and output. Huge
profits can be made by overcharging the state company for its raw materials
and underpaying for its goods.
Analysts fear such companies account for a not insignificant part of
Romania's emerging private sector which, in just four years, has risen from
nearly zero to contribute 25-30 per cent of GDP, 55 per cent of retail sales
and 30 per cent of foreign trade.
The private sector already employs more than a quarter of the 10.5m
workforce - mainly in agriculture - and comprises more than half a million
companies or registered entrepreneurs and family associations.
Many private companies, however, have now accumulated enough capital from
trade to move into production or services. Mr Mike Hicks, deputy head of the
EBRD's Bucharest office, says that in the past two years the bank has looked
at private sector projects in, for example, ceramics, glass, wood,
furniture, bakeries, mineral water bottling, yoghurt-making, tourism,
construction, computer software, plastics and textiles.
Outside the capital, the private sector is most active in Transylvania,
Romania's ethnically-mixed western province, and in Constanta, the Black Sea
port and tourist region.
Mr Hicks says: 'Romanians are natural entrepreneurs. . . Good people are
moving from the state sector into private business. The private sector has
its own dynamic - there is definitely an impetus building up.'
However, many private sector projects are too small for direct EBRD
participation. The bank has therefore opened credit lines at local banks for
lending to small and medium-sized companies and for projects in agriculture.
It has also taken equity stakes in three new local banks which concentrate
on private sector lending. These include the Ion Tiriac Bank, set up by the
Romanian-born tennis star, and a joint venture with Wasserstein Perella, the
US boutique bank.
But private entrepreneurs say high taxes, prohibitive interest rates and
limited access to credits are starving them of capital for medium or
long-term investments.
Corporate and income tax rates are 45 per cent and up to 60 per cent
respectively, while in the autumn, lending rates soared to 180 per cent at
the central bank's weekly credit auction. The move was an emergency measure
to bring down 300 per cent annual inflation but it forced many small,
private businesses to shelve investment plans.
The hope is that in 1994 a more stable macro-economy and greater efforts to
privatise or restructure loss-making state companies will free more
resources for private business.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (4): Slow reforms threatened - The Unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We have a saying in Romanian - you can't cut a cat's tail in stages. That
is why we must implement market reforms more rapidly,' says Miron Mitrea, a
well-dressed, well-built, chain-smoking man.
'I very, very strongly support privatisation - the faster, the better.'
Equally, ardent followers of the market can be found throughout eastern
Europe. But coming from Mr Mitrea, who also supports the central bank's
tight monetary policy, praises the toughness of the International Monetary
Fund and is not overly worried about unemployment, these accolades for
economic reform have a distinctly surprising ring.
For Mr Mitrea is the president of the CNSLR-Fratia, which, together with the
Alfa Cartel, Romania's other main trade union block, represents 5.5 million
people - more than half of the country's workforce.
Dismal television pictures of coal miners from the Jiu valley brutally
beating student protestors in June 1990, won trade unions international
notoriety as the rough enforcers of an ex-communist government's continued
rule.
This is, however, a distorted image.
Romania's two leading trade unions are strong advocates of market reform,
and at the end of February held a national strike to protest the
government's failure to privatise more rapidly or to reform the social
security system.
But Mr Mitrea, who was an engineer in a construction company before the 1989
revolution inspired him to organise the truck drivers in the company into a
trade union which they elected him to lead, is afraid that the sluggish pace
of reforms in Romania may be wearing out the patience of rank-and-file
members.
'The attitudes of our membership towards economic reforms are changing in a
negative way, and we, their leaders, do not know what to do about it,' Mr
Mitrea said.
'Three years ago it was easy to explain why we were pro-re form. Reform
meant a good economy and good jobs.
'Now our members say this 'good economy' is good for nothing.'
Although Mr Mitrea is confident that in the short-term the union's
progressive leadership will prevail over the populist instincts of some of
its members, he worries that eventually Romania's unions might turn against
economic reforms.
If that does happen, Mr Mitrea will probably no longer be in charge.
Mr Mitrea, who many believe will opt for a career in politics, is pushing
for the entire leadership of the union, including himself, to resign to make
way for a new generation.
'War needs one kind of general, peace needs a different kind,' Mr Mitrea
says.
'Our revolution is over, but by nature I am a war general.'

FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (6): A fighter's comeback / Profile of an
entrepreneur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Teodor Nachescu's career as a top communist boss came to an abrupt end in
December 1989 when angry workers turned him out of Aris, the
machine-building factory in Arad which he had headed for the last ten years
of the Ceausescu regime.
It did not take long for the 50-year-old engineer - a self-proclaimed
fighter - to make a comeback.
Within months, he was using the entrepreneurial skills which he had gleaned
while at Aris, one of the town's two largest firms, to set up his own
private company.
Today, he heads one of the most successful private groups in Banat,
Romania's westernmost region. Avi Floria, the company he set up with his own
small savings and those of 14 like-minded individuals in 1990, now has an
annual turnover of Lei1.8bn (USDollars 1.4m) and more than 100 shareholders.
Its interests range from pig and fur farms to a laboratory providing
scientific analysis for farmers and a share holding in the town's recently
established commodities exchange.
'I was more prepared than others in 1989,' he says. 'With Aris, I had the
chance to travel and to see how companies in western countries worked ..I
became convinced that a system based on state property could not lead the
economy forward.'
Like many of eastern Europe's most successful entrepreneurs, Mr Nachescu and
his partners started in trade in order to accumulate capital for production.
Taking advantage of Arad's close proximity to the Hungarian border, in 1990
Floria began to barter Romanian fertilisers, wood, furniture and machines
for food, car batteries and agricultural machinery imported from Hungary and
the west. By the autumn of 1991, the company had raised enough funds to set
up its first chicken farm and a metal-welding workshop.
Mr Nachescu says he went into agriculture and agro-business - one of the
sectors most frequently targeted by new private firms - because of the
comparatively small initial investment needed, and because he was sure there
was a big market for food in Romania. He started with chicken-raising
because of the quick turnover.
Every seven to eight weeks, Floria's farm outside Arad produces 90,000
chickens of 1.5kg average weight, raised from one day chicks. Mr Nachescu
says his prices are the lowest in Banat and that although Floria is smaller
than state-owned chicken companies, it already has a 15 per cent market
share in the area.
Plans for this year include a Lei200m investment in a new 25,000 head pig
farm and an animal feed plant. He had hoped to invest more this year but
last autumn's interest rate rise to 120 per cent a year has forced him to
cut back.
Now he is considering applying for a dollar loan with single digit interest
from the local Banca Agricola. This operates Dollars 170m in credit lines
for small farmers on behalf of the World Bank and European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (11): Daewoo leads drive - Foreign
Investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Romania hopes a planned half-billion dollar investment in its car industry
by South Korean industrial giant Daewoo will soon put its foreign investment
drive on the map, after four years of lagging well-behind central European
countries in the race to attract western capital.
Under the deal, which is close to completion, Daewoo would take a 51 per
cent stake in Oltcit, Romania's second car manufacturer, for Dollars 156m.
It aims to invest a further Dollars 370m to lift production capacity to
200,000 cars a year by 1998.
The proposed deal, by far the largest single post-communist investment in
Romania, comes after a disappointing year in 1993 in which the rate of
foreign investment slowed compared with the paltry levels of 1992. Only a
further Dollars 227.4m was committed during 1993, bringing the total to
Dollars 760.5m since 1990, according to the Romanian Development Agency
(RDA), the country's inward investment body.
The adoption of a liberal foreign investment law in April 1991 led to a
spate of landmark deals that year and in 1992. These included investments in
industry by companies such as Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish
engineering group, Colgate-Palmolive, the consumer products manufacturer,
and Siemens, the German telecommunications and engineering group. Bouygues,
the French construction company, began work on a Dollars 120m World Trade
centre due to open this week while oil companies Shell, Amoco, Canadian
Occidental and Enterprise Oil were awarded on-shore and Black Sea
exploration contracts.
Investor confidence was, however, shaken by the victory of former communists
in the September 1992 general election and the new government's failure, in
1993, to achieve macro-economic stability or to implement the privatisation
scheme it inherited.
The hope is that agreements this spring with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and World Bank will create a better investment climate after last
autumn's near descent into hyperinflation.
Maintaining internal convertibility of the Leu, recently achieved for the
first time since the summer of 1992, is one of the government's goals this
year and remains a critical issue for foreign investors. Although foreign
companies are allowed to repatriate 100 per cent of profits, acute shortages
of hard currency last year made this almost impossible. It also restricted
companies' ability to import raw materials and other goods needed for local
production.
The privatisation scheme was slow to get off the ground, making joint
ventures with state firms the main vehicle for foreign investment in
Romania. Even these were held up last year when the RDA had to clear deals
through the newly-established State Ownership Fund, the main engine of
privatisation, which was plagued with start-up problems and saw four general
managers in its first 15 months.
However, under Mr Constantin Dumitru, general manager, the SOF has begun to
tackle its mandate more seriously. It has asked the development agency to
find foreign partners for some 100 priority companies after making just two
sales to foreign companies before Mr Dumitru's arrival in February.
The SOF is also co-operating in a series of public offers this summer, to be
followed by the much-delayed opening of a stock market later in the year.
The hope is that the Bucharest exchange will suck in significant foreign
investment.
External financing for projects has also eased. Most Western European
countries have extended investment and credit guarantees which remained
limited owing to the political and social instability of 1990 and 1991.
International financial institutions such as the World Bank and European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development have also started to open credit
lines at Romanian banks for local projects.
The largest of these is Dollars 170m for agriculture and agro-business
which, with other consumer goods industries, are among the top areas of
foreign interest.
Romanians, who were starved of food and western goods in the 1980s, have a
huge appetite for consumer products. The country, with a population of 23m,
is eastern Europe's second largest market after Poland.
Infrastructure projects, often financed from abroad, are also attracting
foreign investors. Siemens, for example, formed a local joint venture to
manufacture digital switchboards for the Romanian telecommunications company
which has embarked on a multi-billion dollar, 10-year modernisation
programme.
Similarly, Italian firms are teaming up with local partners to upgrade
border crossings and 1,000km of roads as part of a Dollars 400m project
co-financed by the World Bank, EBRD and European Investment Bank.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (1): A wounded country strives to rebuild
 -There are grounds for hope that the winter of 1993 was a low from which
recovery has since begun
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Romania was the last to fall as communist regimes across central Europe
collapsed in the fateful autumn of 1989. Unlike the bloodless 'velvet'
revolutions elsewhere in Soviet dominated Europe, the transfer of power came
violently. Confused days of fighting in the streets came to a climax in the
hail of bullets that killed a loathed tyrant and his even more hated wife,
after a Christmas Day trial by a kangaroo court.
Since the execution of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu, which ended a 24-year
reign of tragic absurdity, the 23m inhabitants of this beautiful,
potentially prosperous but deeply wounded countryhave been coming to terms
with their painful inheritance.
The task has been complicated by a political transition that left many from
the old regime in positions of power, and the absence of a period of reform
before the abrupt change of government. While Hungary, Poland and even the
Soviet Union were experimenting with market mechanisms and pluralistic
political structures, the last decade of the Ceausescu regime was a period
of increased megalomania, repression and intellectual isolation.
Behind the screen of a pervasive and brutal security service, the
securitate, the Ceausescu regime decided to repay all foreign debt, while
building a presidential palace of pharaonic proportions, and stunning bad
taste, in the heart of historic Bucharest.
Productive investment for maintaining and modernising industry and
infrastructure was halted for the best part of a decade, health and
education budgets were slashed and food and raw materials were exported.
Romanians went hungry and lived miserable lives in unheated, ill-lit homes
and work places. Living standards, already the lowest in Europe apart from
Albania, plunged as debt was paid off and the architectural heart of
Bucharest was ripped out.
It is hardly surprising in these circumstances that the euphoria over the
bloody downfall of the Ceausescu clan was replaced so soon by a sense of
disorientation and dismay, as the full extent of the psychological,
spiritual and physical damage to the nation became clear.
Perplexity began with the emergence of Mr Ion Iliescu as head of the
National Salvation Front which assumed power in December 1989. He had been a
leading figure in the previous regime before he fell out with Ceausescu in
the late 1970s, but he was elected president with an overwhelming majority
in May 1990. He was re-elected in October 1992, even though many Romanians
held him responsible for the rampage of hundreds of coalminers through
Bucharest only three weeks after the May 1990 election.
The failure of Mr Petre Roman, the prime minister, and his young reformist
colleagues to resign in protest against the miners' bloody assault on
intellectuals and selected opposition leaders, weakened the position of the
younger generation of political leaders. They had the courage and energy to
begin the reform process against daunting odds, but were dismissed in
September 1991 after a second miners' excursion to the capital.
Mr Iliescu, a shrewd, if cynical, judge of his countrymen's political
awareness, increased his own grasp on power after the departure of Mr Roman
and was re-elected president with quasi-Gaullist powers in the 1992
presidential elections. At the same time his party, the Democratic National
Salvation Front, since renamed as the Party of Social Democracy of Romania
(PSDR), was confirmed as the linchpin of the political system. It won 28 per
cent of the votes cast at the parliamentary elections, compared with the 27
per cent share won by the Democratic Convention (DC) - a loose 18-party
coalition of the centre-right, including the ethnic Hungarian party.
The coalition is headed by Mr Emil Constantinescu, an academic. Mr Roman's
hived off National Salvation Front, since renamed the Democratic Party, won
10 per cent. After the elections, the president tried to put together a
grand coalition government to provide a stable parliamentary platform for
the difficult reforms required to restructure the economy and create the
middle class needed to underpin social progress.
The move was repulsed by the 'democratic' opposition, and Mr Iliescu's
political allies in the PSDR were obliged to accept a parliamentary alliance
with the Socialist Labour Party (the renamed communist party) and two
xenophobic nationalist parties.
The nationalist bedfellows are the Romanian National Unity Party (RNUP) led
by Mr Gheorghe Funar, the anti-Hungarian mayor of the ethnically mixed
Transylvanian city of Cluj, and Romania Mare, the ultra-nationalists led by
Mr Corneliu Vadim Tudor.
The president picked Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu, a former middle-level bureaucrat
from the communist central planning bureau, as prime minister. The result
has been a mediocre government of drift and indecisiveness, while talent has
drained abroad or into the private sector, which has been steadily growing
despite the slow pace of formal privatisation. The emergence of half a
million small private enterprises is one of the most encouraging signs of
renewed economic vitality.
But, with political power mainly in the hands of men over 50 brought up in
the communist school, foreign investors have held back. International
financial institutions have also delayed granting the loans that are so
badly needed to finance structural modernisation and infrastructure
development.
There are grounds for hope that the winter of 1993, when the Leu sank to
record levels against the dollar and inflation reached an annual rate of
nearly 300 per cent, was a low from which recovery has since begun. If this
is so, it is largely due to steady pressure from the international financial
institutions and Mr Mugur Isarescu, governor of the National Bank of
Romania, who appears to be backed by President Iliescu himself.
The central bank's tight monetary policy has led to the emergence of
positive real interest rates, a stronger Leu, a sharp decline in inflation
and a convergence between the black market and official foreign exchange
rate.
The convergence has allowed a free-floating foreign exchange system to be
established, which will meet one of the International Monetary Fund
conditions attached to the granting of a new standby agreement.
On April 5 the World Bank board approved a Dollars 175m loan for a petroleum
sector project. The bank also disbursed the Dollars 180m second tranche of a
structural adjustment loan last month and is prepared to lend around Dollars
400m annually over the next five years.
Such lending, which is conditional on continuing privatisation and on market
reforms, will be backed up by additional funding from the European
Investment Bank and the European bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD). The latter has been particularly active in Romania, especially in
helping to finance the commercial banking system.
At the same time, there are signs of growing foreign investor interest in
Romania, which is the second largest country in the region after Poland and
possesses considerable natural resources including oil, gas, fertile soil
and a largely untapped tourist potential.
Romania has an association agreement with the European Union, enjoys a
restored most favoured nation (MFN) status with the US and proximity to
Middle East markets. It is also a member of the the potentially fast-growing
Black Sea economic zone
Progress is, however, slow. Only Dollars 800m of foreign equity investment
has flowed into Romania over the last four years, small beer for a country
which is the largest in the Balkan peninsula. Hungary, with only 10m people
but a sophisticated business class and market infrastructure, has attracted
more than Dollars 5bn in the same period.
Established investors include Shell, Amoco, Enterprise Oil and Canadian
Occidental, who are busy exploring both on-shore and off-shore oil and gas
deposits, and European and US consumer goods multinationals such as
Coca-Cola, Colgate Palmolive and Kraft Jacobs Suchard.
The government, prompted by Mr Mircea Cosea, the minister for economic
reform, is introducing new legislation which offers especially attractive
terms to those investing over Dollars 50m in the country.
The first to benefit from the new law should be Daewoo, the South Korean
industrial group, which plans to invest more than Dollars 1bn in a series of
projects.
The biggest is a Dollars 156m car assembly joint venture with Olcit,
formerly the assembler of Citroen models under licence from the French car
company.
But much hangs on the government's ability to convince Romanian
entrepreneurs and the international financial institutions and investors
that it is fully committed to speeding up the pace of privatisation,
reducing the dead weight of over-sized and obsolescent industries and
encouraging the emergence of more efficient private farming and privately
run service and production companies.
With real incomes an average 40 per cent below the already pathetic levels
of 1989, and unemployment destined to rise well above the current 11.5 per
cent of the work force, the patience and fortitude of ordinary Romanians
have been dangerously stretched.
A way still has to be found to bring into government and economic management
a younger generation less marked by the the communist past and more
receptive to the needs of an open society and competitive economy.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (2): Twilight of the monoliths - Chrystia
Freeland and Virginia Marsh explain a two-sided economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bucharest's monument to Nicolae Ceausescu's megalomania, the People's
Palace, is so vast it is visible on satellite pictures.
It devoured as much as 10 per cent of the country's GNP during the 1980s
when many of Romania's 23m inhabitants lived in the dark after 10p. m.
because electricity was rationed while average food consumption was among
the lowest in Europe.
Yet less than half a mile away from the People's Palace, and the socialist
moonscape which surrounds it, once elegant pre-war buildings adorn narrow
streets bustling with busy side-walk cafes and window shoppers cheerfully
admiring high-heeled shoes and frilly skirts.
The People's Palace and the re-emerging retail districts embody the two
disparate sides of the Romanian economy, now locked in a struggle over the
future of a country which has the potential to be the economic engine of the
Balkans.
On one hand, Romania is still a hostage of Ceausescu's particularly brutal
brand of socialism, the most austere and centrally planned in Eastern Europe
apart from Albania. Under Ceausescu, Romania pursued a particularly
pig-headed version of socialist autarky. It focused on heavy industry, which
rose to 59 per cent of industrial production, and the construction of the
monolithic factories beloved by central planners.
In 1990, factories employing more than 2,000 people accounted for nearly two
thirds of the workforce.
This legacy of unwieldy heavy industry, the sector which all post-communist
countries have found most difficult to reform, means that in many ways
Bucharest's economic dilemma bears more resemblance to the difficulties
faced by the former Soviet republics to the east than those being resolved
by the Visegrad countries - the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland
 -on Romania's western flank.
In the four years since the fall of Ceausescu's regime, however, a private
sector economy has emerged which now employs more than a quarter of the
nation's labour force and dominates agriculture, traditionally Romania's
mainstay.
Since the collapse of the Iron Curtain in 1989, Romania has returned to its
historic place at the back of the East European pack. While neighbouring
Hungary and nearby Poland and the Czech republic last year reduced their
double digit inflation, Romania's prices rose to an annual inflation rate of
295 per cent.
It was a sad relapse for a country that, in the immediate aftermath of the
Ceausescu regime, established a framework for market reforms among the most
impressive in Eastern Europe. 'Petre Roman's administration, the first
government after the revolution, brought creative destruction. The second
government, under Theodor Stolojan, introduced rigour,' explains Mr Dan
Pascariu, head of a new Greek-Romanian bank, backed by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, launched last month. 'But the third, current
administration of Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu brought stagnation,' he adds.
The administrations led by Mr Roman and Mr Stolojan, which lasted until the
September 1992 elections, privatised agricultural lands, began price
liberalisation and introduced the legal framework for mass privatisation of
Romania's 6,300 state enterprises. But the seeds of reform have lain fallow
since the coalition of former communists and right wing nationalists was
formed under Mr Vacaroiu's stewardship after the elections.
Mass privatisation, vigorously pursued in Poland, the Czech republic and
even Russia, has hardly begun in Romania. The government is still talking
about establishing a stock exchange later this year. Macro-economic
stabilisation, which appeared within grasp 18 months ago, was sabotaged by
the government's failure to improve financial discipline on loss-making
factories and to introduce positive interest rates.
Frightened by the prospect of hyper-inflationary free-fall and hobbled by
the refusal of the International Monetary Fund to extend new credits until
Bucharest proved its ability to impose financial discipline, Romania now
appears to have a second chance.
The tight monetary policy pursued by the country's technically polished
central bank over the past few months appears to be working. Interest rates,
highly negative for much of 1993, are now determined by weekly credit
auctions and are strongly positive. By mid-April short-term rates had risen
to the equivalent of several hundred per cent annually.
As a result, inflation fell sharply over the first quarter of 1994 to less
than 7 per cent a month by March before a blip caused by higher domestic
energy prices. The fierce squeeze on short-term interest rates has helped
the central bank converge the official exchange rate with the black market
rates, while rising exports have helped to boost reserves. This combination
has helped create the pre-conditions for internal convertibility of the lei
to move from the realm of theory to practical implementation.
There is still a danger, however, that the blighted economy inherited from
Ceausescu, and the slowness in implementing structural reforms at the micro
level, could undermine the country's promising macro-economic stabilisation.
The question Romania will face over the next few months - a local version of
the issue which dominates all debates about reform in post-communist
economies - is the extent to which a tough and successful macro-economic
policy can overcome, or perhaps serve as a catalyst for, deeper structural
reforms.
The immediate outlook is fairly gloomy. At the heart of the problem is the
manner in which loss-making state enterprises, dominated by heavy industry
and the energy sector, have evaded the central bank's tight monetary policy
by amassing enormous inter-enterprise arrears which are believed to exceed
4,200bn lei (Dollars 2.5bn), more than the entire budget expenditure in
1993.
Prevented by positive interest rates from subsidising their inefficiency by
borrowing money from the banks, large state enterprises have continued to
conduct business as usual, with one exception. Instead of paying each other,
they have become wrapped in an obscure web of inter-enterprise indebtedness.
'In normal countries bankers speak of M0, M1, M2 and M3,' moans Mr Razvan
Temesan, the chairman of the Banca Romana de Comert Exterior. 'But here in
Romania we have invented another category: 'M-question mark', representing
the unquantifiable inter-enterprise arrears.'
This increasingly shaky pyramid of inter-enterprise arrears will, within the
next few months, compel Bucharest to address the tough question at the heart
of market reforms. Will it bail out the loss-making giants, and shatter the
country's fragile macro-economic stabilisation? Or will it allow the
mountain of debt to come tumbling down, dragging with it spendthrift
factories and risking high unemployment and social unrest?
A report written by McKinsey, the management consultancy, in 1993 suggested
that 130 enterprises were disproportionately responsible for most of the
country's economic woes. Were the government to restructure forcefully or
close down these monoliths, some of Romania's economic angst would dissolve.
But systematically demolishing the heavy industrial structure would require
a political will the nation's ex-communist leadership has yet to
demonstrate. Even if, as seems likely, Romania's crippled industrial giants
are allowed to continue lumbering along, the private sector is already
beginning to come to the nation's rescue.
Some of the most hopeful developments are in the countryside, where 80 per
cent of land has been privatised, albeit in a chaotic fashion described
elsewhere in this survey.
The other point of light, or more precisely half a million points of light,
is provided by the new businesses which have emerged since 1989. Although
only 1 per cent of the state economy has been sold off under privatisation,
Romania now boasts 500,000 private enterprises.
The private sector will receive another boost if the government makes good
on even a fraction of its promise to the IMF to privatise 2,000 companies by
the end of 1994.
Under the leadership of its new boss, Mr Constantin Dumitru, a communist era
deputy minister, the State Ownership Fund, which currently owns 70 per cent
of state enterprises and is responsible for selling it off, is gearing up
for mass privatisation this year. If Mr Dumitru, who has shown he has the
political muscle to coerce his erst-while colleagues, pulls off his
ambitious plans, Romania's Stock Exchange will have something to trade. That
would be a boon for a country which many insiders believe has vast, untapped
capital resources.
Lacking a better outlet, Romanians have poured their money into shady
schemes such as the Caritas pyramid scam, which collapsed earlier this year,
or have taken it abroad.
Mass privatisation and the creation of a stock exchange would give them an
opportunity to make legitimate investments in their own country, like their
Polish and Czech confreres.
Romania's nascent bourgeoisie is confident that, willy nilly, market reforms
will take root in their country.
'Reforms will go ahead in the long run no matter what,' explains Mr
Pascariu. 'We are in a narrow corridor and are being pushed forward,
sometimes despite ourselves. There might be zig zags in our course, but our
destination is clearly a market economy.'

FT  03 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: Treasury set to defend dollar - Currency
Markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week could see battle joined between the foreign exchange market and
the US Treasury in a manner reminiscent of the the ERM dislocations in
1992-93.
The difference this time is that it will be the dollar that is the focus of
attention. Last Friday the Fed had to step in, at the behest of the
Treasury, to prevent the US currency falling to a record low below Y100.
The central bank's efforts were successful in preventing the dollar from
testing its all time low of Y100.30, but few are confident that the market
will not again test Y100.
Friday provided the first evidence that the Treasury does care about the
fate of the dollar. Previously, the market believed the US administration
favoured a stronger yen as a means of exerting pressure on the Japanese
government to enact fiscal and trade reforms.
Just how much the Treasury is prepared to spend supporting the dollar
remains to be seen. Market accounts suggest that fairly small sums were
spent on Friday. Analysts believe that considerably more will have to be
spent if the market is to be kept at bay.
Apart from the activities of the Fed, dollar watchers will have some
substantive economic data to chew on: the release on Wednesday of the Tan
book, setting out the economic background to the May 17 meeting of the
Federal Open Market Committee, and payrolls data on Friday.
The market is expecting further tightening of policy from the Fed, but it is
doubtful whether economic data supportive of this stance will help the
dollar. There has been little evidence in recent months that interest rate
differentials have played much of a role in the market's view of the dollar.
Elsewhere, sterling is vulnerable if the Tories, as predicted, suffer heavy
losses in Thursday's UK local elections. This will renew speculation about
the future of Mr John Major, prime minister. Uncertainty is likely to
persist at least until next month's European elections, where Tory prospects
are predicted to be even worse.
The chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England meet for their
monthly monetary policy discussion on Wednesday, but there is little
expectation of this producing any change in interest rates.
In the Netherlands, opinion polls suggest the ruling Christian Democrat -
Labour coalition may lose its majority in today's election. This is not
expected to effect the guilder's close link to the D-Mark.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA
It was a volatile week in the country's capital markets after the
resignation of Mrs Ruth de Krivoy, the governor of the central bank,
following disagreements over monetary policy.
The appointment of a new governor, Mr Antonio Casas Gonzalez, does not
necessarily provide an end to the difficulties, according to some analysts.
Mr Victor Galliano of Latinvest in London commented that the key issue was
whether the new governor would exercise independence. However, Mr Galliano
added that the finance ministry had indicated that it was not willing to
reduce interest rates until inflation was down - inflation currently stands
at about 50 per cent annualised - a factor which lay behind Mrs de Frivoy's
resignation.
TURKEY
Istanbul's composite index closed the week 18 per cent down as the market
was buffeted once again by negative news.
Standard and Poor's cut its rating on the country's long-term currency debt
to B-plus from BB.
S &amp; P said that the downgrade and an ongoing review for a further potential
downgrade reflected growing external liquidity and balance-of-payments
pressures.
Attention has now turned to the IMF which is meeting economic officials in
Ankara this week for talks on a standby agreement.
SRI LANKA
Equities in Colombo recorded their sharpest ever one day fall last Friday on
worries over political and economic uncertainty. The all share index shed
4.3 per cent.
Investors have been unnerved by the victory of opposition parties in local
government elections at the end of March.
Share prices have been falling after the market gained some 40 per cent in
the first two months. According to IFC data, Sri Lanka remains 14 per cent
up in dollar terms since the beginning of the year.

FT  03 MAY 94 / The Emerging Investor: Captivation with China by proxy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does the downward correction in Asian markets during the first quarter mean
a hasty end to foreign investors' enthusiasm for them?
Almost certainly not. Most economies are still set fair for such substantial
growth that it will be hard to ignore them.
The Asian Development Bank, which begins its annual meeting in Nice today,
predicts 7 per cent growth rates for developing Asia this year and next. The
region's expansion appears to some extent self-fuelling.
Mr Satish Jha, the ADB's chief economist, says Asia has become 'its own most
important and rapidly expanding market'.
The intra-Asian share of Asian exports rose from 37 per cent in 1986 to 47
per cent in 1991, with the proportions for imports rising from 48 per cent
to 55 per cent respectively.
Speaking to a Financial Times conference on Asian capital markets in London
last week, Mr Jha cautioned however that Asia's self-sufficiency should not
be over-stated.
A considerable amount of intra - regional trade was within individual
industries - for example, a Japanese company shipping parts for assembly to
a subsidiary in south-east Asia.
Many 'exported' goods were destined ultimately for sale in the west, so
'Asian countries may be more dependent on markets outside the region than
the trade data indicate'.
Nevertheless, the 'flying geese' sequence of complementarity between Asian
economies, with richer countries shifting manufacturing capacity to poorer
ones, still has some way to run.
Each rapidly growing country has a growing middle class with rising
expectations as consumers. And most have huge domestic savings yet to be
mobilised.
Add to that the growth which could be released by further liberalisation in
China, India, and even relatively advanced countries such as South Korea and
Taiwan, still beset by bureaucratic control.
Mr Edward Kim, general manager for international finance of Korea
Development Securities in Seoul, told the FT conference the reforms of
President Kim Young-sam - provided they overcome entrenched opposition from
the Korean establishment - will put pressure on local companies to operate
more efficiently, causing consolidation through mergers.
But they will significantly reduce the government's control over the private
sector and will foster economic prosperity.
Given these prospects for Asia, there will be plenty of value to seek in
stock markets, even though portfolio weightings have been re-adjusted in
favour of the industrialised world.
The question is not whether to invest, but how and where to find good value.
Most Asian markets showed big rises last year, but in terms of cash invested
it was largely a China boom.
According to the US Securities Industry Association, net US purchases of
Asian stocks doubled in 1993 to Dollars 17bn. Of this, Dollars 6.1bn was in
Japan and an astonishing Dollars 6.2bn in Hong Kong, with Dollars 1.3bn in
Korea. This left only Dollars 3.4bn for all other Asian markets combined.
The figures underline US investors' sudden captivation with China and their
use of Hong Kong as its proxy.
The SIA figures are also, however, a reminder of the relative small size of
other markets - and thus of their potential, given the right conditions, for
growth.
Mr Hugh Peyman, Singapore-based managing director of Kleinwort Benson
Research (Asia), summed up those conditions as transparency and efficiency
of markets, regulators who sought to develop rather than inhibit markets,
good flow of information, and new listings.
There are still a number of newer markets which remain immature and
illiquid, and some which are so mature that adapting to the new world is
difficult.
Mr Robert Lloyd George, chairman of Lloyd George Management, a Hong
Kong-based fund manager, said for example that investors had difficulties in
trading stock during the recent shake-outs in the Philippines and Indonesia.
India presents the biggest problems, despite which it is currently the pet
of many fund managers who salivate over its 6,000 listed stocks and huge
domestic investor base. Mr Lloyd George, who saw India as 'the emerging
market of 1994,' nevertheless listed the headaches as inefficient custodian
banks, over-long settlement periods, slow registration of shares, and a
requirement for a capital gains tax audit before repatriation of funds.
Leaving aside these problems, how do you select stocks?
Even though there is now a wealth of research material on Asian companies,
the biggest need is still for information.
Disclosure requirements of many exchanges are far from stringent. There is
plenty of insider dealing, even in relatively advanced countries.
Most difficult of all, investors may not be confident that, even with a set
of accounts which looks completely intelligible, they really have a handle
on a company's operations. This is because of the opaque nature of many
Asian businesses, particularly the largest conglomerates.
Investors will naturally tend to look for the Asian companies which are the
global forces of the future. There is a growing list of candidates.
Mr Mark Mobius, Hong-based director of Templeton Investment Management,
divided Asian multi-nationals into two basic types: the Japanese/Korean
model, and the Chinese.
Among characteristics he noted of Korean chaebol are authoritarian
management styles, emphasis on size rather than profitability, and
consequently - since all are competing to be big - a tendency towards
over-capacity and price wars.
Conglomerates run by ethnic Chinese in both 'greater China' and south-east
Asia are perhaps more difficult for the investor to fathom. Many are using
the fruits of success to diversify into unfamiliar businesses and territory.
They tend to have both listed and unlisted arms, which tend to do a lot of
business with each other.
Control is often in the hands of one man, which may lead to a group making
some risky bets. Companies are inscrutable to investors because 'too often
the only person who knows how money is moving around the multitude of
companies is the patriarch,' Mr Mobius said.
But such companies can hardly be ignored. In Indonesia, for example, Mr
Mobius noted that the Salim Group run by Mr Liem Sioe Liong is estimated to
account for 5 per cent of the economy. For a man with Dollars 5bn under
management, Mr Mobius was refreshingly candid, even resigned, about the
risks.
It was difficult not to be tempted to fund expansion of companies which had
already been successful.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Investors wary ahead of April jobs data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
This week's calendar is dotted with important economic readings, culminating
with Friday's report on April employment trends.
With the Federal Reserve in the process of tightening monetary policy, and
its next move to higher interest rates expected any day, the mood is wary.
However, it is even more difficult than usual to forecast the direction
share prices will take as Friday approaches.
Yesterday's action revealed the market's mercurial bent. Cyclical stocks
finished with solid gains, despite the flat reaction during the morning to a
seemingly favourable report from the National Association of Purchasing
Management. The NAPM's April survey showed the industrial sector continued
to grow at a healthy pace in April, while prices were rising at more
moderate rate than in the previous two months.
'Greenspan (the Fed chairman) told us basically in February to watch for any
scrap of inflation information we can find, so that's what we are doing,'
says Mr Donald Straszheim, of Merrill Lynch in New York. Looking ahead to
the employment data, Mr Straszheim is forecasting that payrolls increased by
140,000 in April, a gain consistent with second-quarter economic growth of
about 4 per cent.
At first glance, the financial markets certainly seem inclined to accentuate
the negative. Last Thursday, bonds were battered on the announcement that
gross domestic product had grown at weaker-than-expected 2.6 per cent in the
first quarter. Investors apparently suspected that the economy had
accelerated as soon as the harsh winter weather lifted.
Two worrying inflation readings included in the GDP report also weighed
heavily in the fixed-income markets. 'The inflation figures scared people
and so they figured the Fed is going to lean even heavier on the brakes and
abort the recovery,' says Mr Alfred Goldman, of AG Edwards in St Louis.
Spooked by the prospect of tighter money, equity investors ran scared.
Or did they? Sure, the Dow industrials fell 31 points on the day, but the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was only marginally lower. 'In my
opinion, stocks handled a very weak bond market very well,' says Mr Don
Hays, of Wheat First Butcher &amp; Singer in Norfolk.
He characterises the session as 'neutral', pointing out that each successive
sell-off since February's shift in monetary policy has been milder than the
previous one.
Mr Hays expects another steep decline in the next two or three weeks,
probably when the Fed decides to tighten again. 'That will be the next
little test of the market,' he says. But in the middle term, the analyst is
bullish, predicting a big upturn soon after the Fed's next policy-making
session on May 17.
Mr Goldman holds much the same view. 'I'm looking for three or four more
weeks of backing and filling - up a little, down a little - but basically
building a base for an interim rally going into the summer,' he says.

AMSTERDAM
The Netherlands goes to the polls today and a change of government is
expected. Lehman Brothers says that it would be unrealistic to expect swift,
radical changes in Dutch politics. Nevertheless, all the serious contenders
for a share in governmental power advocate reductions in government
expenditure, along with cuts in the cost of real labour and the share of
labour in national income.
Lehman says the extensive reforms of government expenditure should be good
news for financial markets. Bond markets should react favourably to renewed
efforts to reduce budget deficits but on balance, there is probably greater
scope for reaction in the equity markets.
DSM, the petrochemical group is expected today to report a return to profit
in the first quarter of 1994 after two loss-making quarters in the second
half of 1993. Analysts expect net profits before extraordinary items of Fl
15m - 50m, against Fl 6m in the first quarter of 1993.
Philips announces first-quarter results tomorrow. Hoare Govett forecasts a
52 per cent rise in earnings per share, with higher sales compensating for
negative price effects and earnings to be positively influenced by currency
effects and lower financial charges.
FRANKFURT
Last week's surprisingly large cut in the repo rate to 5.47 per cent was
very encouraging, says James Capel, which notes that over the past two
weeks, the rate has fallen by nearly as much as the April 14 discount rate
reduction. The broker says a smaller decline in the repo is likely at
tomorrow's tender, although the scale of recent falls bodes well for a
further cut in the discount rate, probably at the May 26 Bundesbank meeting.
Schering has its annual shareholders meeting tomorrow. The drugs group said
last month that sales rose 21 per cent in the first two months of this year
and forecast earnings for the year would at least match last time's DM254m.
MILAN
INA, the state insurer, meets today to prepare the ground for its
privatisation which is scheduled for late June.
The Italian Treasury has not said exactly how much of the insurance group it
plans to sell, although INA executives have said they hoped at least 51 per
cent would be offered. The company is seeking a listing in Italy and the US.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Decoupling hopes face another test

Hopes for a decoupling of UK equities from global bond markets will be put
to the test again this week in a confused-looking stock market. Market
strategists are asking why, with increased dividends appearing on all sides,
with investors and even the Confederation of British Industries more relaxed
on the base rate outlook, with inflation subdued and the market alive with
bid speculation, equities cannot perform better.
'Above all else, equities need gilt market stability,' commented Edmond
Warner at Kleinwort Benson Securities. This is easier said than done, in a
market which can still move through a range of more than 1 per cent because
the European and US bond markets remember that the Federal Reserve may
tighten credit again soon.
From this point of view, there are at least some signs of a change of step.
On Friday, equities remained relatively steady in spite of overnight
weakness in the US, at least until the sudden excitement in the dollar
pushed all other considerations into the background and put the Federal bond
market back in the driving seat.
Kleinwort Benson remains cautious on the influence on equities cast by the
bond markets, which Mr Warner believes relates to the re-rating of future
dividend flows following the dramatic fall in bond yields during the
recession; the problem was compounded by disappointing corporate earnings.
He fears that equities may be 'condemned' to a long period of consolidation
while investor portfolios readjust and warns that, even if decoupling is on
the way, the transition could be painful.
At Strauss Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett suspects that bonds and equities could
begin to decouple this week if, as expected, the local elections deliver a
drubbing to Mr John Major's government.
This could put sterling under pressure, warns Strauss, and that scenario has
historically seen equities rising while bonds fall. The markets have been
slow to discount the political factor.
The setback in bond markets has been another adverse factor for property
shares. The sector has shown a relative decline of 6 per cent since
mid-March as stock market investors have stubbornly refused to believe in a
recovery in property shares. But BZW, warning that while rental growth
prospects remain weak the sector cannot decouple from bond yields, continues
to urge clients to be underweight in the property sector.
BZW is still highly negative on the outlook for UK office property which is
underperforming retail and industrial property and likely to continue to do
so, according to BZW's Mr David Nighy. He identifies a problem of
over-renting in London and the South-east and believes the sector still
under-rates the significance of obsolescence in valuing properties.
The UK investment bank sees Asda Property Holdings showing attractive net
asset value on the back of strong 1993 capital growth rates on both its
retail and industrial holdings.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Need for greater clarity on creditworthiness
 -Risk and Reward

<TEXT>
Last week's introduction by Moody's of specific ratings based on an
institution's creditworthiness as a counterparty in the derivatives market
highlighted the confusion in over how far existing ratings take account of
derivatives activities.
Moody's approach is only one way of tackling an increasingly troublesome
issue, which now affects industrial companies and fund management companies
as well as financial institutions.
Mr John Kriz, associate director of Moody's, says the agency addresses the
effects of derivatives activities on creditworthiness in its existing debt
ratings, but greater precision is needed by participants in the derivatives
market.
He notes that many market participants apply existing ratings of an entity's
debt as if they were general ratings of the entity's creditworthiness. 'This
assumes a debt claim is on a par with a derivatives counterparty claim,' he
warns. 'Looking at a debt rating as a proxy has pitfalls. The question is
whether they are going to honour a financial contract: its a specific type
of claim.'
He also points out that many entities are not rated at all, but may be
members of a group whose affiliates are rated. 'People often attribute a
rated affiliate's rating to an unrated affiliate. This can lead to extreme
misjudgment.'
Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's greatest rival, introduced counterparty ratings
in 1991, because of the broadening use of derivatives. However, unlike
Moody's, S&amp;P only assigns these ratings on request, arguing that the full
co-operation of management is needed for the process to be meaningful.
As a result, S&amp;P has rated only about 50 counterparties. (Moody's, on the
other hand, plans to assign counterparty ratings to more than 1,000
securities firms, banks, central governments, insurance companies, pension
funds, industrial companies and others in coming months.)
'We do find that our existing deposit ratings - assigned to around 450 banks
around the world - are used as proxies for counterparty risk,' said Mr Cliff
Griep, executive managing director, financial institutions at S&amp;P.
However, there are legal differences between the two, he warns, especially
in the US, where there is a depositor preference law which 'puts the
depositor in a slightly stronger position than other senior creditors in
liquidation'.
The gap, he says, is likely to be greater for lower rated entities, where
liquidation analysis is a more important component of the rating process.
Meanwhile, IBCA, which specialises in rating financial institutions, takes a
different approach, assigning a broad credit rating to each entity (rather
than to its long-term debt or deposits).
'I think our view has always been that ratings are not just for issues. If
you look at the financial condition of an entity you can come out with a
risk assessment for that entity,' says Mr Charles Prescott, director of
IBCA.
The rating agencies are striving to satisfy the growing appetite for credit
information in the derivatives markets, heightened by a spate of large
losses on derivatives positions, in particular the Dollars 1bn hit which
nearly bankrupted German giant Metallgesellschaft.
The importance of the Moody's ratings, and others which factor in
derivatives exposure, is set to increase but the task of assigning them
accurately is becoming increasingly daunting.
Since many of the losses suffered in the derivatives markets have been the
result of breaches of internal controls, it is hard to see how rating
agencies could have factored the potential for such losses into the rating
process.

The outcome of the wrangling over Japan's new cabinet has had little affect
on long-term interest rates, although investors in the short-term money
markets were encouraged by the creation of Mr Tsutomu Hata's minority
government.
Traders believe Mr Hata is unlikely to deliver the tax reform package,
including income tax cuts to be financed by a rise in consumption taxes,
because of the departure of the socialist party from the coalition. He may,
therefore, try to avert pressure from the US by cutting interest rates to
stimulate the economy.
If a general election is called following the passage of the budget bill, as
many analysts are forecasting, the Bank of Japan may be tempted to ease its
monetary policy to counter the rise in negative sentiment towards the
economy, which has just started to stabilise.
Bond market investors, however, had little incentive to commit funds ahead
of the Golden Week holidays. Financial markets this week will be closed for
three days starting today.
Institutional investors, which have indicated they would put most of their
new money into the bond market rather than stocks, are expected to start
investing after the holidays but the upside of bond prices may be limited by
the rise in bond issues by municipal governments.

Fear of inflation continues to dominate the US bond market. At the end of
last week the price of the benchmark 30-year bond sank by more than two
basis points, lifting the yield to 7.3 per cent, after key indicators in the
GDP figures pointed towards growing inflationary pressures.
The market is convinced that the Federal Reserve will push the Fed funds
rate up by another  1/4 percentage point when it meets on May 17, if not
before.
Yesterday, the National Association of Purchasing Managers' monthly index of
business activity came in at 57.7 per cent, much as expected, yet bond
prices lost another half point or so in early trading.
The rest of the week will provide more data to feed the market's fear.
Tomorrow's index of leading indicators could show an increase of 0.6 per
cent for March after slipping 0.1 per cent in February.
On Wednesday, figures for factory orders are likely to show an increase of
0.5 per cent for March.
The productivity figures, due out on Thursday, may indicate that output per
hour grew by barely 1 per cent in the first quarter.
But the climax of the week will come with the publication of the employment
figures on Friday: anything much bigger than a 170,000 increase could send
yields rising again.

FT  03 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Sweden pays price for sins of the past -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A modest rally in Swedish bonds last week suggested the market might finally
be coming back into favour for the first time in months.
On many counts a correction is overdue given the mauling which has taken
Swedish 10-year bonds to a spread of more than 200 basis points over German
bonds, from just 90 points three months ago.
Yet there are plenty of reasons for believing the market will find it hard
to break decisively out of its current range.
These include general turbulence in international financial markets, worries
about Sweden's burgeoning state debt, and the prospect of a tough
re-election battle for the centre-right government this September.
Mr Andrew Davies, bond analyst at the London Bond Broking Co, though a
buyer, says the attractions of Swedish market are relative. 'We are buyers
of Swedish bonds because yields are now only 45 to 55 basis points below
those of Italy and Spain,' he states.
In one sense Sweden's bond market drop is surprising, given that inflation
has fallen to only 1.8 per cent in spite of a 20 per cent drop in the value
of the Swedish krona over the last 18 months.
Government projections suggest inflation will be held to 1.9 per cent for
the year as a whole, before climbing to 2.8 per cent next year.
What has happened is that foreign investors, who last year were big buyers
of Swedish bonds, have this year been big sellers - and they have been
selling into a relatively narrow domestic market.
The rationale for the buying was that Sweden's economic problems were so
severe that it would be forced to bring down interest rates very sharply. In
fact, the central bank has pursued a much more cautious monetary policy than
many pundits expected. This meant that when turbulence hit international
bond markets in February, many of Sweden's foreign bondholders headed for
the door.
Although very much in thrall to what happens in Germany, Swedish bond yields
have risen much more than German. Here it seems the country is paying a
price for the sins of its past.
It is a point acknowledged by Mrs Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance minister,
who said last week: 'The market has a long memory of our very large
devaluation in 1982 and a long memory of our poor inflation performance
during the 1980s.'
The country's track record explains why the Riksbank, the central bank, has
made inflation its top priority in the months since Sweden floated the krona
in November 1992. It also explains why the country resorted to its first
issue of index-linked bonds two weeks ago.
Effectively, the Riksbank has ruled out further cuts in its key marginal
rate - currently 7.25 per cent - until either the krona strengthens or there
is evidence of fiscal tightening.
Fiscal tightening, though, is not on the cards in the short-term, as the
supplementary budget presented by Mrs Wibble last week made clear.
The markets were not surprised by the absence of tough measures, both
because of the election and because the government has lost the guarantee of
support from New Democracy, the populist party on which it relied for its
majority.
The savings promised by the government for the second half of the decade - a
total of SKr100bn in the six years to 1999 - are not something which can be
guaranteed, especially with opinion polls indicating that it will be the
opposition Social Democrats who triumph at the election.
Although it would be natural to think that the Social Democrats might seek
to lower unemployment by expanding the public sector, the markets are taking
a different view.
They seem to believe that Sweden will tighten fiscally, whoever comes to
power in September, otherwise bond yields would almost certainly be higher
than they are, given the size of the country's budget deficit in relation to
GNP.
The budget did contain some encouraging news, particularly evidence that the
budget deficit and borrowing requirements are falling by more than was
expected.
The budget deficit for the year beginning July 1 is estimated at SKr150bn,
or 9.7 per cent of GNP, while the borrowing requirement is put at SKr195bn.
In the current fiscal year, the deficit is predicted to be SKr198bn and the
borrowing requirement SKr240bn.
Optimists about the Swedish bond market say the cyclical component of the
budget deficit is much greater than the structural one, which means the
deficit will fall relatively quickly as the economy recovers.
Heartened by recent inflation projections, the optimists expect the currency
to strengthen, as the economy improves, allowing further interest rate cuts.
Pessimists remain to be convinced on the inflation score. They also doubt
that Sweden can achieve the 3 per cent a year growth it needs between 1996
and 1999 to meet its target of stabilising public debt at 45 per cent of
GNP.
The play-off between the two factions almost certainly guarantees continued
volatility in trading over the next few weeks. The crucial elements in the
equation will be developments in the German market and the position adopted
by foreign traders.

The market for German government securities is in a grumpy mood. With little
trading in the underlying bunds - most price movements are driven by trading
in derivatives - the market reacts with oversensitivity to whatever may be
perceived as bad news.
This week's bad news is likely to come from two sets of economic data due in
the next few days - details of order intake and industrial production for
March.
To the extent that the data show evidence of recovery in the German economy,
they will unsettle a market already weakened by the knock-on effects of the
US interest rate environment.
Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, an economist at Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft in
Frankfurt, predicts that manufacturing orders will increase by 0.5 per cent
month-on-month, which corresponds to a healthy 6.5 per cent annual increase.
He thinks industrial production will be unchanged month-on-month, but after
February's rise of 1.2 per cent that means an annual rate of 0.2 per cent.
If these robust figures cause nervousness in the markets, there is also
scope for disappointment at tomorrow's outcome of this week's repo
operations. After a 23 basis point cut in this key rate in the past two
weeks, the scope for further reduction this week is limited.

FT  03 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Bank casts a wider net to fund PSBR -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After last year's effortless run, the Bank of England may find funding the
UK public sector borrowing requirement more of a challenge this year,
especially if difficult market conditions persist.
However, a much lower PSBR for the current financial year, coupled with the
Bank's increasingly innovative approach to gilt issuance, is unlikely to
make supply a major problem for the gilt market, most analysts say.
Helped by falling interest rates and a global bond market rally, funding
last year's Pounds 45.9bn PSBR was child's play, enabling the Bank to
overfund by an estimated Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn. Overseas investors,
including highly leveraged hedge funds, were keen buyers of gilts - but that
backfired early this year, when many overseas players dumped their positions
amid widespread inflation jitters and rising US interest rates, all of which
sent world bond markets into a tailspin.
Having posted the most spectacular gains last year, the gilt market was
especially badly hit. Salomon Brothers' World Government Bond Index shows
10-year gilts have fallen by 7.96 per cent in the year to date. The
ultra-long end has fared even worse, dropping about 10 per cent.
Funding the deficit, albeit a much smaller one, may prove more tricky in
these conditions. Investors are keeping a low profile, preferring large cash
positions to braving the unpredictable market.
Moreover, many gilt houses have suffered heavy losses, prompting some to
reduce their exposure sharply .
The most recent casualty was discount house Gerrard &amp; National, which pulled
out of gilt market-making last week saying 'the obligations and risks of
gilt-edged market-making exceed the benefits and rewards'. Still, most
economists don't expect the gilt market to be overwhelmed by this year's
funding programme.
With an estimated Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn overfunding from last year to
carry forward, one auction under the belt and the Pounds 6.8bn of bank and
building society purchases from 1992 - 93 also going towards this year's
funding, 'our PSBR forecast of Pounds 35bn (compared with the Treasury's
Pounds 38bn) implies net gilt sales of around half that completed in the
last year', says Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at S. G. Warburg Securities.
This implies that Pounds 12bn, or roughly a third of the funding for this
year, has already been completed.
What is more, the Bank of England appears to have adopted a more innovative
stance, as illustrated by its recent issue of floating-rate gilts, the first
since 1979.
By issuing floaters, the Bank is 'tapping a different source of
institutional cashflow', says Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi
International. 'They're widening the net and are attracting banks and
monetary institutions who may not have looked at gilts.'
Floaters have a particular appeal to banks and building societies, which buy
them to match their short-term liquidity needs. They also attract investors
who expect interest rates to rise over coming years and want bonds whose
coupons will increase as rates rise.
For the government, 'floating-rate funding has the advantage of securing
finance, without worries about bunching or refinancing, while enabling the
Exchequer to benefit from a further fall in interest rates', says Mr Roger
Bootle, chief economist at Greenwell Montagu. While non-bank appetite for
floaters may be limited, bank demand could be more substantial, he says.
At its recent auction of 6 per cent gilts due 1999, the Bank made another
small shift from its usual approach: rather than being partly paid (where
investors pay for only a portion of the paper and settle the rest several
weeks later, delaying the fungibility of the paper with the existing stock),
the issue was fully paid and the bonds immediately became fungible. This
relieved a technical shortage in the five-year benchmark stock, traders
said.
Talk of other possible innovations includes convertible gilts, where the
Bank issues shorter-dated paper that can be converted into long-dated stock
at a later stage. It hasn't issued convertibles since the late 1970s but
their appeal to investors at times of interest rate uncertainty may prompt
the Bank to revive the instrument.
Moreover, the conversion into longer-dated stock would allow the Bank
back-door access to the long end of the yield curve, which it has been
starving of supply for months because it does not want to lock in
excessively high rates for the long term.
Concentrating issuance at the short end - seven out of the last eight
auctions were for gilts of 10 years or less - has led to severe illiquidity
at the ultra-long end, causing the yield curve to flatten markedly. However,
few observers believe the Bank is completely boycotting the long end. 'We
would expect some long and ultra-long issuance this year, but while yields
are at current levels we expect it to be taps rather than a full-blown
auction,' says Mr Briscoe.
Most analysts expect the Bank to hold another 10 auctions this year, each
raising about Pounds 2bn to Pounds 2.5bn, with the remainder raised through
tap issues of existing stock.

While the minutes of tomorrow's meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke,
chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of
England, will not be known for six weeks, analysts do not think the two men
will agree to a base rate reduction.
'It is apparent from official comments that rate cuts have to be clearly
justified on economic grounds and recent data have shown that the economy is
growing at a steady pace, so no cut is needed,' says Mr Nick Stamenkovic,
economist at DKB International. He adds that 'if they cut rates ahead of the
local and European elections, it will be viewed as political. Sterling will
suffer and gilt yields will rise'.
M0 statistics, published today, are expected to show that the narrowest
measure of the money supply grew strongly in April, which may be a guide to
the strength of retail sales. However, Mr Don Smith of Midland Global
Markets, points out that M0 growth was also buoyant in April 1993, so there
may be a problem with the seasonal adjustment.
With little else in the way of economic data to the published this week,
gilts may be affected by political nervousness following Thursday's local
council elections. International investors might take fright at bad results
for the government.

FT  03 MAY 94 / The Markets: Derivatives attract some hostile attention -
Economics Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are tough times for the whizz-kids who make their fortunes at the
innovative frontiers of financial markets.
Recent bond market gyrations and corporate calamities, such as the Dollars
102m after-tax charge at Procter &amp; Gamble arising from swap transactions and
the near bankruptcy of Metallgesellschaft of Germany after oil futures
speculation, have brought derivatives and other sophisticated financial
products to the hostile attention of politicians and regulators.
Mr Eugene Ludwig, the US comptroller of the currency, has hinted at tougher
controls over US banks' derivatives trading. A week ago, finance ministers
from the Group of 10 leading industrial countries agreed on the need to
strengthen co-operation in gathering statistics and assessing the
implications for the world financial system of 'the innovative segments of
financial markets'.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, and Mr Andrew Crockett, the
general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, called in
separate speeches last Tuesday for improved disclosure requirements and
sufficient capital adequacy standards among financial institutions to
underpin their risky activities.
Although Mr Tietmeyer said there was no need for specific new regulation
'for the time being', tighter regulation of derivatives seems highly likely.
Yet just as markets overshoot and become indiscriminating, regulators and
legislators must beware of becoming excessively worried about financial
innovation.
But derivatives, such as options and futures, are not just speculators'
toys. Derivatives and swaps, which are agreements to exchange specified cash
flows such as interest rate or currency liabilities, can yield broader
economic benefits.
Although Mr Crockett focused mainly on the risks posed by financial
innovation, he acknowledged that derivatives, by allowing sophisticated risk
management, can improve the productivity of an investment. They also could
contribute to the integration of global capital markets, so improving the
global allocation of savings and fostering higher investment levels.
In a recent study*, the World Bank has emphasised how market-based
instruments such as futures, options and swaps are being used with
increasing success to combat the adverse effects of volatile commodity
prices on the economies of developing nations.
Commodity exporting countries can suffer large scale shocks through big and
sudden changes in the prices of their main products. The World Bank cites
the case of the Ivory Coast, an exporter of cocoa and coffee and an oil
importer. In the 1970s and 1980s, it suffered six terms-of-trade shocks (two
favourable and four unfavourable), each of which moved its gross domestic
product by more than 10 per cent.
Such shifts would make economic management difficult enough in an advanced
industrial country. In certain poor developing nations they have encouraged
policy errors, including big budget deficits and soaring external debts that
act even today as a brake on growth.
Traditional means of smoothing the effects of commodity price volatility
have yielded scant success. The 1980s saw the failure of several
international commodity arrangements that sought to stabilise prices.
Domestic stabilisation schemes have a similar poor record and have tended to
put a strain on already hard-pressed budgets. Little wonder, therefore, that
interest has focused in recent years on market-based techniques such as
hedging in commercial futures markets to manage risk.
Commodity futures markets have been around for a long time and are spread
across the globe. Only in recent decades have they developed great depth and
liquidity, however. The top chart gives one example of how dealing on crude
oil futures has grown over the past decade. According to the World Bank, the
volume of crude oil futures and options traded on the New York Mercantile
Exchange now amounts to roughly 200m barrels a day or almost four times
world production of crude.
Forward prices tend to be less volatile than spot prices, giving commodity
producers an opportunity to reduce the volatility of the price of their
output through hedging. The middle chart, based on a study of the oil
futures market in the late 1980s, suggests that a producer, routinely
hedging 15 months in advance, could cut price volatility by a half.
Governments and corporations in developing countries have taken advantage of
exchanges to hedge their commodity exposure. For many years, Ghana and the
Ivory Coast have sold part of their cocoa crop ahead of the harvest while
Indonesia's rubber and coffee exporters routinely hedge.
Codelco, Chile's state owned copper company, has used financial derivatives
linked to the copper price and interest rate hedging instruments. But news
earlier this year that it had incurred a Dollars 206m loss in trading on the
London Metal Exchange shows that futures trading is not risk free.
However, when finance and development ministers from the world's
industrialised and developing nations met in the joint World Bank -
International Monetary Fund development committee last week, they gave their
backing to the use of hedging instruments in futures markets by commodity
producers.
They also supported efforts of the World Bank and other agencies to provide
know-how to smaller producer countries so that they could use such markets.
Although the official mood has swung against the young 'rocket scientists'
who construct and deal in derivatives on Wall Street, governments are still
prepared to back sophisticated market practices when they are seen to do
some good.

FT  03 MAY 94 / The Markets: Desperately seeking surprises - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Towards the world-weary resolution of The Age of Innocence, Edith Wharton's
classic novel now playing as an award-winning film, the hero and his new
bride set off to tour Europe. She buys a wardrobe of gowns in Paris, he
picks up a set of suits in London, and they settle onto the boat heading
back to the New World, content that they have picked the best - meaning the
most predictable - of each country's wares.
Any investors - American or otherwise - who follow that approach to the
European equity markets at the moment will find value eluding them. The only
survival game at present - and it is hardly an enjoyable one - is to dig
hard for the few surprises in future earnings growth that remain.
It is a peculiarly awkward point at which to try to squeeze money into the
equity markets. Coming out of recession, companies should have several years
of strong growth before threats of inflationary pressures and rising
interest rates re-emerge.
But investors have had months - about 18 months in the UK's case - to scour
the markets for stocks which should perform well in those conditions. The
main question now is whether all of that potential is already captured by
share prices.
Of all the European equity markets, Germany looks the most attractive by
some way. Recent company announcements have delivered a handful of surprises
already - shares have risen sharply as the figures emerge.
The market's capacity for delivering unexpectedly good results should
continue, at least for this year. Surveys show business confidence improving
rapidly as exports pick up on the back of American and Asian demand.
Last week five of the country's independent economic research institutes
threw their considerable weight behind politicians' optimism about the
economy, with a forecast that gross domestic product would grow by 1 per
cent in western Germany in 1994 and by 7.5 per cent in the east. Broking
houses, which had typically been sketching in no growth for this year, are
upgrading earnings estimates.
The threats to that picture are that the present weakness of the dollar
against the deutschemark restricts exports, and that inflationary pressures
could revive. Given the dependence of German companies on bank finance, the
equity market has historically been even more sensitive to a rise in
interest rates than other European markets.
However, the recent low wage settlements have gone some way to addressing
inflationary fears. They have also, as Mr Michael Hughes, currency analyst
at Barclays de Zoete Wedd has been arguing, taken some of the strain off the
currency.
Exchange rates of DM1.85 to DM1.90 to the dollar by the autumn, which was
widely predicted several months ago, now look unlikely. But a weakening
towards DM1.75 in the next few months, compared with DM1.65 at the end of
last week, still looks on the cards and should ease some of the market's
remaining fears.
After Germany, Sweden deserves to be the next stop. With more adventurous
financial structures than their German rivals, and with profits more
sensitive to export volumes, Swedish companies have tended to offer the
attractions - and risks - of Germany, multiplied several times.
The paper and pulp sector may have shown all the performance of which it is
capable for some time, but industrial stocks should have further to rise.
Beyond that, the pickings become much thinner. To rely on the constants that
underpin the Italian market, such as a fair proportion of savings continuing
to make their way into the market (at 18 per cent, the savings ratio is
Europe's highest), is to allow nothing for disillusionment with the new
government.
In the UK's case, the rewards of chasing after growth stocks may now be so
elusive that the opposite principles should apply. Investors may well find
it worthwhile picking up countercyclical, high-yielding shares such as the
financial sector instead.
It is hard, with yields on long bonds still drifting up, to see the UK
market doing more than tracking sideways, or perhaps edging forwards as
dividend growth comes through. According to Mr Edmond Warner, head of
strategy at Kleinwort Benson Securities, 'the UK market is condemned to a
lengthy period of consolidation while returns to shareholders build'.
The markets are now also settling firmly into a view of rising interest
rates: three-month sterling contracts are now discounting 8 per cent
interest rates in December 1995.
It is becoming increasingly hard to believe that all the earnings growth
which is assumed in current valuations will in fact appear. General
manufacturing stocks, for example, are on a multiple of some 16 times
estimates of 1995 earnings, compared with the All Share Index's rating of
less than 13 times earnings. That is a large premium for a group of
companies which trade at a discount to the market at the peak of the
economic cycle.
Against that background, the virtues of dividend growth offer considerable
appeal. The financial sector, which has that attraction, offers no hiding
place from the gloom of the bond markets, it must be said.
The yield on the sector and on bonds have tracked each other closely (see
chart). But the past few years suggest that the sector demands only
stability in the bond markets, not recovery, to perform better. While it
offers few surprises, it at least does not ask that investors pay top prices
for earnings.
BOILED IN OIL
Enterprise Oil's bid for Lasmo apart, oil shares have seen aggressive buying
in the past few weeks, driven by the strength of underlying oil prices.
There is a case, though, that both shares and futures have gone far enough
in the short run.
After the Opec meeting at the end of March, which agreed to maintain output
levels, Brent crude touched Dollars 12.70 but has now revived to Dollars
15.30. But views in the market on the direction from here are sharply
divided.
Those - like Mr Simon Flowers at Natwest Securities - who think oil could
reach Dollars 18 to Dollars 19 a barrel within a year and rise further
beyond then, are taking a bet that growth in demand will be enough to soak
up the impact of future Iraqi supplies, for example.
At current prices, British Petroleum and Shell Transport are valued on
between 17 and 19 times 1994 earnings. Even looking several years out,
prices seem to have caught up with events.
THE SUPERHIGHWAY
It does not take much exposure to the current cable enthusiasm to question
the valuations being put on the 'superhighway', which will pipe every kind
of communication service to our doors.
Last week Telewest, the largest cable operator in Britain, confirmed plans
for a global share offering this summer which could value the company at
Pounds 1.7bn. That is based on the reckoning that cable's revenues from
delivering telephony will outstrip revenues from television by the end of
the decade.
But investors might well ask whether cable is underplaying the risk that
British Telecom will eventually be allowed to provide entertainment over its
telephone lines, such as 'video-on-demand' - programmes dialled up from a
video library.
BT is barred from doing that until at least 2001 by the 1991 Duopoly Review,
but that ban will be reviewed in 1998.
If allowed to go ahead, BT would have little of cable's expense of digging
up streets - its trunk lines are now fibre optic cable, capable of carrying
television programmes.
True, most BT connections to houses are still through copper wires, which
deliver less good pictures, but recent trials have had some success.
The outcome of the 1998 review is unpredictable: it will depend on the
nature of the government in power and on any obligation it feels to protect
the cable industry. But cable's vulnerability on this point emphasises that
British media is hardly the brave new deregulated world that media barons
sometimes portray.
On the contrary: investment success in British media has always depended on
getting judgments about future regulatory changes right. If the rules do
change, the cable valuations now mooted will look unforgivingly high.

FT  03 MAY 94 / International Company News: Earnings to rise by 10% at
Henkel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Henkel, the German chemicals and consumer products group, expects pre-tax
earnings to increase by more than 10 per cent this year following a 3 per
cent rise in the first quarter.
Such an increase was possible even though the costs of restructuring in the
current period could not yet be accurately forecast, Mr Hans-Dietrich
Winkhaus, chairman, said.
Reporting a 1 per cent decline in turnover in the first three months, the
company based its optimism on its balanced product portfolio and
geographical spread.
Meanwhile, there had been few signs of a convincing recovery in Europe,
particularly in consumer goods.
Turnover and earnings in chemicals and special chemicals had improved, while
the detergents business had become more difficult partly because of reduced
consumer spending power.
Previously-announced plans for the loss of 1,000 German jobs would go ahead,
as would the progressive closure of five factories and other sites.
Restructuring costs this year would be markedly lower than in 1993, the
chairman said.
The main current project, a DM20m (Dollars 11.6m) investment in a 70 per
cent stake in a chemicals joint venture in Shanghai, is on the verge of
completion.

AT&amp;T, the US telecommuni-cations company, and Novell, the leader in computer
networking software, have formed an alliance to create worldwide inter- and
intra-company communications services for businesses.
The new service, called AT&amp;T NetWare Connect Services, will combine Novell's
widely-used local area network software with AT&amp;T's telephone network to
form a global network of business networks, in effect a 'business internet',
the companies said.
Business use of the Internet, a global network of computer networks with an
estimated 25m users, is rapidly expanding. However, concerns about security
and the complexity of using the Internet have limited most business use to
electronic mail.
AT&amp;T said its new service will address these problems.
Applications will include workgroup collaboration, information retrieval and
manipulation, electronic commerce, distributed computing, messaging and fax
services.
'Our alliance with Novell is a significant step in expanding the electronic
highway on which commerce, business collaboration, and knowledge sharing
will ride,' said Mr John Petrillo, president of AT&amp;T's Business
Communications Services unit.
The advent of public data services will enable business customers to avoid
the expense of building and operating their own private inter networks said
Mr David Taylor, industry analyst at the Gartner Group, a market research
firm.

FT  03 MAY 94 / International Company News: Brash calls in administrator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Brash Holdings, the Australian consumer electronic retailer and once the
nation's largest specialist stores group, yesterday called in an
administrator after its main bankers - which include ANZ, Westpac and
Societe Generale - withdrew their support. Brash's shares were suspended on
the Australian Stock Exchange at ADollars 2.26.
ANZ said recent developments in Brash's financial condition, coupled with
business plans presented by the group last week, failed to provide the
banking group with 'sufficient confidence' for it to renew a ADollars 61m
(USDollars 43m) facility. It added that an independent assessment of Brash's
condition was thought desirable.
The voluntary administrators will be Mr David Beatty and Mr Michael Humphris
from Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm. They said yesterday that all
options for Brash's will be considered, ranging from a return to normal
operations to a winding up of the company.
The company suffered a loss of around ADollars 15m (USDollars 10.7m) in the
year to July 1993, on sales of around ADollars 706m. It subsequently pulled
out of the loss-making book retailing business but still posted a further,
and larger, interim loss last month.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Great-West Life, a key company in Mr Paul Desmarais's North American
financial services group, is taking effective control of Confederation Life,
Canada's fourth biggest life company, with an initial cash infusion of
CDollars 225m.
The planned merger will create Canada's biggest group health and life
company.
Confederation, a mutually-owned company with US and European operations, was
caught by the property market collapse and lost CDollars 29m in 1993 after a
CDollars 137m loan loss provision. It finished 1993 with nearly CDollars 1bn
of non-performing assets. Total assets were almost CDollars 20bn (USDollars
14.4bn).
Great-West, held indirectly by Mr Desmarais's Power Corp of Canada, now
ranks as Canada's third biggest life company with CDollars 25bn assets. Its
business is split evenly between Canada and the US.
It will buy CDollars 75m of Confederation preferred stock and make another
CDollars 150m capital available, and take a majority of boardroom seats.
Several other Confederation assets will be sold and the total initial
capital infusion will rise to CDollars 400m.
But Great-West will not assume Confederation's troubled mortgage and
property portfolio.
Negotiations were complicated by problems in linking a mutual company with
shareholder-owned Great-West. About 276,000 Confederation policyholders are
likely to approve the deal and the government reaction was positive.

Star

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MTV Networks, the US-based pop music television programming company, is to
launch two wholly-owned channels for the Asian market in the fourth quarter
of this year, ending its relationship with Star TV, the Asian satellite
television company controlled by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
MTV, a subsidiary of entertainment group Viacom, began broadcasting in Asia
in 1991 over the Star TV network with a freely available pan-regional
English-language service.
Its advertiser-supported independent service will be launched on the Apstar
One satellite, giving access to 18 countries, and will move to the more
powerful Apstar Two, to be launched next year, which will expand its access
to 30 countries.
One of the networks will be an English language one directed at young people
in south Asia, the Philippines and other countries. The second will be
Mandarin language service, encrypted so viewers will require a decoder to
receive programmes, aimed at countries such as China, Taiwan and Singapore.
MTV's decision to tackle the Asian market independently brings the region
into line with Europe, the US and Latin America, where the group has also
adopted a go-it-alone policy.
Mr Tom Freston, chairman of MTV Network, said: 'The Asian marketplace has
enormous potential and is still in the early stages of its development.'
Star, which is retaining several of MTV's screen celebrities, will continue
to broadcast music with a new service of its own. Programming will split
into two versions, one in Mandarin serving China, Taiwan and Hong Kong and
the other in English covering India, the Middle East and south-east Asia.
It says its changes 'herald a revolution in music television'. But analysts,
who are taking an increasingly dim view of Mr Murdoch's Dollars 525m
acquisition of 63.6 per cent of the broadcaster last summer, regard it as
further evidence that Star is still groping for direction.
Star is reckoned to be losing around Dollars 60m - Dollars 80m a year. Last
month it axed the BBC in what was seen as a sweetener gesture to China, a
market Star is keen to develop.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HANOVER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Continental, the German tyre maker, lifted first-quarter profits slightly
but Mr Hubertus von Grunberg, chief executive, said further cost-cutting was
needed to pull the company out of 'the deep hole' it fell into in 1993. He
said full-year profits were expected to match the DM65.1m (Dollars 38m) of
1993.
Turnover rose 8 per cent in the first quarter, due to the incorporation of
Barum, the Czech producer, and Benecke-Kaliko, a Hanover-based tyre maker.
Despite a 50.1 per cent fall in 1993 profits, the company will pay a DM4
dividend. Mr Wilhelm Winterstein, finance director, said he could not rule
out a rights issue this year.
High costs in Germany meant 25 per cent of all tyre production would be
moved abroad, mainly to Barum and Mabor, the Portuguese unit, the company
said.
Contitech, the non-tyre division, would also increase its activities at
Vegum, the Slovak company in which it holds a stake.
Worldwide tyre sales fell by 4.5 per cent to DM4.9bn in 1993 but recession
in the auto industry saw European car tyre sales drop by 17 per cent and
commercial vehicle tyres by 34 per cent.
Contitech saw 1993 turnover fall by 7.6 per cent to DM2.1bn but said that
sales had improved slightly in the first quarter.
Turnover at General Tire, the US subsidiary, rose 2.2 per cent last year to
DM2.2bn.

FT  03 MAY 94 / International Company News: Ferfin and Montedison show
operating profits
</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The clean-up costs of the June 1992 collapse of the Ferruzzi family's
business empire have reached over L2,400bn (Dollars 1.5bn) - the biggest
write-down of a private group's assets in recent Italian history.
But the industrial interests formerly controlled by the Ferruzzi family and
now in the hands of banks, which last year agreed to swap debt for equity,
have begun to show healthy operating results.
This emerged from the 1993 results of Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the
listed holding company of the group now 55 per cent controlled by foreign
and Italian creditor banks, which were announced on Friday and those of
Montedison, the chief industrial subsidiary, which were released yesterday.
The losses are bigger than originally expected but essentially reflect the
need by Mr Guido Rossi, the special administrator brought in last year, to
write down inflated assets that massaged Ferfin and Montedison accounts.
Ferfin's consolidated losses totalled L2,419bn, against a 1992 deficit of
L1,519bn. These two losses in effect represent the cost so far of the
mismanagement of the Raul Gardini era at Ferruzzi which was perpetuated
after his divorce from the family business in 1991.
Of the losses at Ferfin, L2,079bn was attributable to a thorough revision of
the value of the holding company's assets - both fixed assets and share
portfolios. At Montedison, extraordinary 1993 losses were L1,300bn while
total net losses reached L1,611bn.
Ferfin debt stock was reduced by L1,382bn to L21,951bn, largely as a result
of asset sales. Debt restructuring and recapitalisation helped reduce
financial charges. Since the collapse last year, L5,400bn of fresh capital
has been pumped into Ferfin and Montedison.
The holding company's consolidated net turnover was up 15 per cent to
L22,804bn, generating an operating profit of L1,373bn up 28 per cent. In the
case of Montedison consolidated net turnover was up 20 per cent from
L16,969bn to L20,415bn with an operating profit of L1,485bn.
The improving trend in operating performance has continued this year and in
the first two months the gross operating margin was up 26 per cent at
L431bn.

FT  03 MAY 94 / International Company News: Star Mining Dollars 250m Russian
gold investment to go ahead
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Star Mining, the small Australian exploration company, has signed a protocol
in Angarsk, Siberia, which it believed protects its interest in the large
Sukhoi Log gold project, and paves the way for its USDollars 250m Russian
investment plan to go ahead.
Star said that 'in the light of these very positive developments', it
expected to release the first USDollars 5m tranche of capital to Lenzoloto,
the state-controlled Siberian goldminer in which it holds a minority
interest, this week. In Sydney, Mr Graeme Ellis, a director of Star,
expected the payment to go ahead tomorrow.
Star, which holds a one-third interest in Lenzoloto (sometimes translated as
Lena Gold), has pledged to provide USDollars 20m of 'charter capital' to the
Russian joint-stock company.
However, the money has been in an escrow account in Moscow while political
uncertainties hanging over the Siberian project were negotiated, and the
release of technical information related to Lenzoloto was authorised.
Last year Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, head of Russia's precious metals and stones
committee, said foreign companies would be excluded from developing the
Sukhoi Log deposit, reckoned to be one of the world's biggest gold deposits.
However, Star said it believed the protocol 'will resolve all outstanding
disputes concerning the development of the . . . deposit and the
re-registration of mining and exploration licences'.
It said it was 'expressly agreed' that, while the regional Irkutsk
administration and the ministry of atomic energy would participate in the
Sukhoi Log development, 'this would be done in such a way that Star retains
its present shareholding'. This amounts to a one-third interest via the
Lenzoloto investment.
Although Lenzoloto has operations which produce around 350,000 ounces of
gold a year as well as other development projects, these are dwarfed by the
Sukhoi Log potential. With the injection of Star's USDollars 250m, the aim
is to raise Lenzoloto's annual production to 2m ounces in six years. About
three-quarters would come from Sukhoi Log.
Mr Ellis said yesterday Star was likely to seek a secondary listing on the
London Stock Exchange in 'the near future'.

<TEXT>
Arcon, the Irish exploration company in which Mr Tony O'Reilly, the chief
executive of the Heinz food group, holds a 23 per cent stake, has received
final planning permission to develop its 6.2m tonne zinc/lead ore deposit at
Galmoy in Ireland.
Once brought into production at an estimated development cost of some
IPounds 65m (Pounds 63m), the mine is anticipated to be one of the
lowest-cost zinc mines in the world due to the proximity of the ore to the
surface, and will rank alongside Europe's largest.
The reserves have an average grade of 11.31 per cent zinc and 1.12 per cent
lead, and will be extracted over a 10-year period.
The directors expect construction work to begin this August or September,
and for the mine to come into production in early 1996. Debt financing was
being put in place but a rights issue was not ruled out to finance part of
the development cost.

FT  03 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Chesterton Intl flotation shows valuation
of Pounds 50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chesterton International, one of the UK's leading property consultancies, is
to be floated on the stock market in early summer with a value of more than
Pounds 50m.
It is expected to become the UK's largest listed property agency.
The company will issue a small number of new shares, but the majority of the
expected Pounds 25m placing will come from outside shareholders - primarily
former employees - who own 33 per cent of the company; assuming they are
prepared to sell.
Chesterton made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.9m in the year to June 1993, but
brokers suggest that profits will comfortably exceed Pounds 5m in the
current year.
Mr William Wells, chairman, said the flotation was a logical move for a
company which has encouraged employee ownership of its shares, and which had
also funded the bulk of its acquisitions through scrip.
Chesterton has acquired 23 property consultancies in the UK since 1985 and
around 50 per cent of its UK earnings came from outside London last year.
The company was founded in 1805, but its current shape stems primarily from
1986, when it sold its substantial residential estate agency business to the
Prudential for 'a very nice price'.
Mr Wells said the company had 'taken the view that you either had to be a
small niche business, or a large international player'. It opted for the
latter.
Last year, around 70 per cent of its turnover came from a broad range of
professional advisory fees. The remainder came from brokerage fees, an area
which should pick up sharply with the increasing activity in the commercial
property market.
Mr Wells said Chesterton had invested Pounds 7m in building up its
international network in the past few years, and this should also be a
source of growth.
The company has a broad client list ranging from Marks and Spencer to the
Crown and Church. The latter has diminished in importance since the Pounds
800m decline in the Church's income producing assets to Pounds 2.16bn,
mainly because of speculative property losses. Chesterton has been cleared
of responsibility.
The timing of the flotation should be good. The only other large listed
property consultancy, Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, trades on a p/e ratio of
25, reflecting anticipated earnings growth as the property market recovers.
However, with only Pounds 6m of shareholders' funds, Chesterton's assets, as
the cliche has it, are its employees. The company needs to show that these
assets will not sell their shares and leave.
The flotation is sponsored by Robert Fleming, and Societe Generale Strauss
Turnbull Securities are brokers.

This follows a vote earlier this month by shareholders in the South

Bundaberg holds a 2.7 per cent stake in South Johnstone - the smaller of the

with Pounds 24m price tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chicago Pizza Pie Factory and Henry J Beans are coming to the City,
through the flotation of the restaurant owner and operator My Kinda Town,
which will have an initial market capitalisation of Pounds 24.25m.
Around 90 per of the company is to be sold off through a placing, and
subsequent rights issue, and the directors will retain 10 per cent.
The initial venture capitalists have been bought out.
MKT was formed in 1977 with the opening of The Chicago Pizza Pie Factory by
the colourful American entrepreneur Mr Bob Payton.
It was followed by the Chicago Rib Shack, Henry J Beans, Chicago
Meatpackers, Tacos and Salsa]
MKT made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.59m in the year to June 1993, and is
forecast to make adjusted pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 1.9m this year.
The company will have to make a deferred payment of Pounds 100,000 to
management shareholders if profits exceed Pounds 3m in 1995.
MKT has expanded aggressively into Europe, and only 39 per cent of last
year's sales were derived from the UK.
It has also built up a substantial network of franchisees, which should
account for 20 per cent of profits this year.
It plans to open five new restaurants this year, three in Germany, one in
Paris and one in the UK. It currently owns 29 restaurants.
The shares are being issued at 10p and trading will commence on May 9.
The issue is sponsored by Hill Samuel and Credit Lyonnais with Laing acting
as broker.

FT  03 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Retail investors shun biotech trust launch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail investors have largely spurned the opportunity to acquire shares in
International Biotechnology Trust, recently launched by Rothschild Asset
Management.
They have applied for 2.67m shares (with warrants) out of about 25m on offer
in the public offer for subscriptions, which closed on April 29.
The disappointing level of applications reflects, and follows hard on the
heels of, the applications by institutional and other investors. Here, some
Pounds 35.1m was raised - less than half the targeted amount.
The public element represented about one quarter of the Pounds 100m that RAM
and Robert Fleming, the sponsor, had originally hoped to raise from the
trust's launch. In total only Pounds 37.7m was raised.
However, Mr Jeremy Curnock Cook, a RAM director and leader of the advisory
team, remained bullish, saying: 'Against a background of difficult market
conditions, the total sum raised . . . is satisfactory for a specialist fund
. . . and I am confident our timing is excellent.'
The trust is to focus on the flurry of recently floated biotech companies,
most of which are trading at a discount to their issue price.

FT  03 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Rowntree shuffles pension fund team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nestle Rowntree, the UK arm of the international food group, has dropped the
three external fund managers of its pension fund and consolidated management
of the Pounds 1.3bn scheme with its in-house investment team.
The external managers were Mercury Asset Management, which had the single
largest portion, PDFM and Barings Investment Management. The fund, one of
the 50th largest in the UK, will be looking, however, for an external
manager for its investments on the Pacific Rim and Japan.
Mr Gordon Thomson, Nestle Rowntree investment manager, said that following a
review the company found that the in-house team had outperformed the
combined external managers over the past six years.
He added that the company also wanted to have greater control over asset
allocation, deciding what proportion of the scheme should be invested in
which assets.
New minimum solvency requirements were likely to require schemes with large
numbers of current or deferred pensioners to invest a greater proportion of
their assets in fixed-interest securities. Mr Thomson said Nestle Rowntree
had not yet decided whether it needed to restructure its asset mix but would
be meeting its actuaries this week to consider the matter.
Mr Thomson said the review followed a consolidation of the Nestle and
Rowntree pension schemes, which had been run separately since Nestle's
takeover of Rowntree with the latter retaining its own internal fund
management team.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Sizeable mortgage operation should
boost revival - Bank of Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week should see the restoration of the Bank of Scotland, whose good
reputation slipped slightly last year when it announced an 11 per cent fall
in pre-tax profits.
The results for the year to February 28 released on Thursday are expected to
reflect both a fall in provisions for bad and doubtful debts, and an
increase in pre-provision profits. Most analysts expect pre-tax profits to
rise to Pounds 250m-Pounds 270m, and forecasts extend up to Pounds 285m. In
any event, they are sharply up on the equivalent for the previous year of
Pounds 125.3m.
Last year's figures included a 45 per cent rise in provisions for bad debts
which, the bank said, reflected the downturn moving north into Scotland,
coupled with a further fall in asset values in the south.
Apart from the drop in provisions, as a result of a fragile recovery in the
housing market, the bank has also had an opportunity to reap a full year's
benefits from being able to widen its margins in its sizeable mortgage
lending operation.
That widening of margins was an element in raising the bank's interim
pre-tax profits announced last October by 58 per cent to Pounds 117.6m.
In general, the bank has won the reputation of being less accident-prone
than others, and of running operations efficiently. The cost-income ratio it
reported in the interim results fell to just below 50 per cent, and could
fall slightly further, if it is able to expand its mortgage business.
At the interim results, Mr Bruce Pattullo, chief executive, made it clear
that he expected a further improvement in fee and income commission through
bank branches.
The bank has been one of those identified as considering buying a building
society: this would be one way of accelerating its growth, but the bank will
not want an acquisition that would threaten its efficiency.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Worry over Asian securities markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank has warned of the risk of financial accidents in Asian
securities markets because the pace of investment and innovation in them may
be too fast for their stage of development.
Mr Gautam S. Kaji, vice president for East Asia and the Pacific, said the
region's economic growth was taking place from a low income level and that
financial markets lacked basic infrastructure and regulatory structures.
They could only absorb limited amounts of money for the time being.
'Private markets in developing countries are by no means perfect,' he told a
Financial Times conference in London on Asian capital markets.
'Information is imperfectly and unevenly available, and a market failure in
this regard can have the most serious consequences, as the debt crisis
taught us all.'
He expressed particular concern about the use of structured financing and
derivatives in Asia's volatile financial markets, in advance of development
of national prudential and legal frameworks.
'It frankly worries me to see people pushing high-tech derivatives in
markets that lack even well-developed Treasury bill trading.'
The World Bank supported the privatisation programmes of Asian countries,
including stock market placements. But Mr Kaji noted that 'in a number of
these countries, the capital markets are not deep enough to absorb many new
placements.'
'These markets still lack instruments and experience, not to mention basic
accounting conventions and disclosure rules'.
Mr Kaji acknowledged however that privatisation issues also helped to deepen
and develop stock markets. He urged governments to hasten the development of
capital markets especially because they will be needed to help fund massive
investment in physical infrastructure to keep pace with rapid economic
growth.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines is to change the senior management of its
Dollars 11bn (Pounds 7.5bn) personal computer business which is facing
intense competition.
The changes come at a critical time for IBM's PC business, where sales rose
40 per cent last year to achieve a 12 per cent share of the worldwide
market, according to market analysts. However, IBM is believed to have lost
ground to Compaq Computer in the first quarter.
Mr Robert Corrigan, president of IBM PC, who led a restructuring of the PC
business that has led to a strong resurgence in sales, will retire.
His responsibilities for running IBM Personal Computer go to Mr Richard
Thoman, a former Nabisco International and American Express marketing
executive who joined IBM last year. Mr Thoman's career moves have followed
those of Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM's new chairman and chief executive, who also
formerly worked at RJR Nabisco and American Express.
Mr Thoman will now be responsible for the IBM PC company; the Power Personal
Systems division, which is developing a generation of PCs based on IBM's
microprocessor technology; and IBM's printer divisions.
In other management changes, IBM assigned worldwide responsibilities to
senior executives for marketing, product development and finance.
Previously, these duties had been divided along geographic lines.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): BAT rides out US war on smoking -
Other Companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries' first-quarter figures tomorrow are expected to show a
healthy rise from Pounds 354m pre-tax to about Pounds 385m.
Despite the much-publicised war on smoking in the US - which BAT defied last
week by buying American Tobacco for Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) - its tobacco
profits may be around the same as last year.
The real profits increase will come from insurance, through further recovery
by Eagle Star from its upsets in mortgage indemnity and through real
progress at Allied Dunbar in the UK and Farmers in the US.
Electrolux: Europe's leading white goods manufacturer will show the benefits
of a strong US sales performance and a bottoming out in Europe when it
presents its first-quarter figures on Thursday. Analysts believe profits
could exceed SKr600m (Pounds 51m) for the period, compared with SKr202m last
year.
Tate &amp; Lyle: The sugar and sweeteners group is expected to report a Pounds
10m-Pounds 20m rise in interim profits tomorrow from Pounds 107.6m to Pounds
120m-plus. Most of the rise will come from US and Australian operations.
Improving markets for Staley, its US corn starch business, will have helped
profits, as will recovery in its US sugar businesses, hit last year by
teething troubles at a new desugarisation plant at its cane sugar operation,
and difficult trading conditions for its beet sugar business. Exchange rates
will also aid profits. A rise in the interim dividend is expected in line
with Tate's progressive policy. Tate will also be asked about the lapsing
yesterday of its bid for two sugar mills in Australia.
Body Shop: Overseas growth, especially in the US, is expected to boost Body
Shop International's year-end results when they are revealed on Thursday.
Pre-tax profits are likely to rise from Pounds 21.5m to between Pounds 25m
and Pounds 27m, with UK operating profits a little ahead of last time's
Pounds 11.2m. The US should pitch in about Pounds 4.5m (up from Pounds 2m,
though this was affected by the move of the headquarters to North Carolina).
The dividend should rise from 1.7p to at least 1.85p.
BP: The UK-based international oil company reports its first-quarter results
on Thursday. Oil prices lower than a year ago will reduce the benefits from
cost-savings, strong downstream margins in the US, lower interest charges
and a swing back to profits in chemicals. Replacement cost pre-tax profits
will be about Pounds 250m, against Pounds 231m last time and Pounds 315m in
the fourth quarter.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Lazard Bros reveals its inner reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lazard Brothers has been forced to tell one of the last great City of London
secrets, which is precisely how much capital this most discreet merchant
bank has in its hidden reserves and how much profit it makes.
Buried in a footnote to accounts filed at Companies House is the disclosure
that it has Pounds 34.75m in hidden reserves and total shareholders' funds
of Pounds 163m. Profits in 1993 were Pounds 40m before tax.
It has lifted the veil, with the greatest reluctance, because an amendment
to the UK Companies Act this year required all British banks to end the
practice of making undisclosed transfers to secret inner reserves to
disguise true profits and capital.
Most banks dispensed with the practice years ago, but Lazard's coyness in
revealing all was probably prompted by a concern that outsiders might be
disappointed by what they would see. Its assets are far smaller than British
rivals SG Warburg and Schroders and tiny compared with Goldman Sachs of the
US.
Warburg had shareholder funds of Pounds 889.4m at the year end of March,
1993, and reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 148.2m. Schroders had
shareholder funds of Pounds 674.5m at the end of 1993 and reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 195.8m.
However the Lazard philosophy is that what matters is not the size of your
capital resources, but what you do with them. Its return on assets has
normally been above average and last year 24 directors and executives earned
more than Pounds 230,000 each. The chairman, Mr David Verey, received Pounds
812,000 in remuneration.
It is also slightly misleading to view it in isolation since it is part of
an international partnership consisting of the more profitable Lazard Freres
in New York together with the original Parisian bank, neither of which
disclose their figures. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has an
interest in all three siblings.
The UK government enacted the bank accounting reform in anticipation of a
change in European Community law. However, to Lazard's great irritation,
this EC reform has not materialised. As a result, its continental peers,
including Lazard in Paris, can still disguise their profits.
Whether Lazard's irritation was a factor in its decision last year to
withold its regular contribution to the Conservative Party - which had been
Pounds 20,000 in 1992 - it would not say. In keeping with tradition, it
would not discuss the accounts at all.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Upward trend dependson local
markets - Philips
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Signs of hesitant recovery in Europe should allow Philips, the Dutch
electronics group, to report a rise in first-quarter net profit when it
publishes its figures for early 1994 tomorrow.
Philips' strong performance in 1993, achieved despite continued economic
weakness in Europe, was due mainly to higher operating results in North
America and Asia. But the company's ability to extend the upward trend in
earnings still depends on the recovery of markets close to home.
The first-quarter improvement is expected to rest on a combination of
increased demand in some businesses and continued successes in bringing down
financing charges through further reductions in group debt.
The rise will also be aided by the fact that the 1993 first quarter had been
relatively weak, with net profit declining to Fl 103m (Pounds 37m) from Fl
162m in 1992. Some analysts say an increase to Fl 200m or more should be
possible for the 1994 first quarter, though much will depend on the
company's performance in Germany.
The financial markets' confidence in Philips has been boosted by the
company's decision to pay a small dividend for the first time since 1990.
This should make it easier for Mr Jan Timmer, president, to face
shareholders at the annual general meeting in Eindhoven on Thursday.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Keeping Sweden in the family / Analysis of the power of the
Wallenberg empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If anyone thought the Wallenberg family's grip on corporate Sweden might
have been weakened by the country's deepest recession since the 1930s, last
week they learned otherwise. The country's most famous industrial dynasty
signalled it was back on the offensive when Incentive, one of its key
companies, launched a Pounds 600m (SKr8.4bn) bid for the investment group
Cardo. A successful strike would give it control of Gambro, a medical
equipment specialist and one of Sweden's fastest growing companies.
The impact of this spectacular Wallenberg foray, after several quiet years,
has been accentuated by the refocusing strategy just unveiled at Volvo,
Sweden's leading industrial group. Volvo has abandoned the empire-building
strategy of its former chairman Pehr Gyllenhammar. It no longer makes any
pretence to being a counterweight to Wallenberg influence, as it was in the
1980s when the two titans were at each other's throats in their drive for
corporate dominance.
'The Wallenbergs are relatively speaking in a much more dominant position
today than they have ever been,' says one close observer of the family's
activities.
No doubt it will have given Peter Wallenberg, dynasty patriarch,
considerable satisfaction that the Cardo bid came after Incentive had first
snapped up a 44 per cent stake in the group from Volvo. Volvo used to be one
of the few Swedish multinationals from which Wallenberg influence was
excluded. Even that changed earlier this year with the appointment of two
Wallenberg men to the Volvo board - including its chairman - following Mr
Gyllenhammar's resignation last December.
Today the only grouping that provides any sort of counterweight to the
Wallenbergs is Svenska Handelsbanken, which through Industrivarden has big
stakes in telecommunications giant Ericsson, forestry concern SCA and Aga,
the industrial gas group. However, Handelsbanken's influence is modest by
comparison.
The scale of the Wallenberg empire is clear from the large number of Swedish
blue-chips either directly controlled or influenced. One estimate suggests
the family controls as much as 40 per cent of the Stockholm stockmarket or
companies with total annual sales of SKr450bn.
This strength is entrenched in a two-class share system which gives one
class much bigger voting powers than the other. Hence Wallenberg companies
can control 94.1 per cent of Electrolux, Europe's leading maker of white
goods, with only 6.4 per cent of the capital. By contrast, foreigners, who
have been huge buyers of Swedish shares in the last two years, gain only 2
per cent of the votes in Electrolux with 32.4 per cent of the capital.
The Wallenbergs have shrugged off the Swedish recession and financial sector
crisis much more quickly than anybody expected a year ago. In early 1993
Investor, the flagship holding company, was saddled with huge debts and
losses within Saab-Scania, its wholly-owned automotive and aerospace unit.
Many analysts felt a big sale would be needed - possibly the company's stake
in high-flying pharmaceutical group Astra - to restore its battered balance
sheet.
The big sale never materialised. Debts were driven down sharply, but through
a series of smaller disposals, which did very little to erode the group's
overall voting power. At the year-end Investor's net debt had fallen to
SKr4.85bn from SKr8.7bn. Further strengthening of the balance sheet came in
March when the group launched a SKr3.45bn bid for its stablemate
Export-Invest in what was essentially a giant share issue.
Incentive's strike for Gambro emphasises a new Wallenberg strategy. It aims
to shift the family's basic industry bias, through investments in forestry,
engineering and so on, towards high-growth areas. Investor's purchase of a
25 per cent stake in TV4, Sweden's only commercial terrestrial television
channel, is another example of this trend.
More acquisitive moves will follow, but they will be accompanied by further
streamlining as the Wallenbergs respond to intensified competitive pressures
across their empire. The sheer range of their businesses, and the need to
supply capital to them, will almost certainly force them to be more
selective. They are, however, in much better shape to meet the challenge
with many of their companies benefiting from restructuring and the weaker
krona and with dividends flowing into Investor again on the back of
corporate profitability.
The question remains, can it be healthy for Sweden to have one family so
dominating the corporate landscape? One commentator has suggested 'pluralism
in Swedish industry is disappearing and that will influence corporate
culture and leadership style'.
Surprisingly, perhaps, Wallenberg influence does not stir much controversy
because the family is widely admired for taking a long-term investment
perspective. It is also respected for having avoided the speculative
financial investments that characterised Sweden's bubble economy in the late
1980s. More recently, perhaps, a third factor has come into play. With
foreigners owning 25 per cent of Swedish shares - more than double the level
of two years ago - the Wallenbergs are seen as a stronghold against a
foreign takeover of corporate Sweden.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Markets expect renewed support for dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets were braced last night for further intervention by the US
Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan to support the dollar as the US
currency drifted weakly against the yen and the D-Mark.
The Bank of Japan was reported to have bought dollars for yen to boost the
US currency, after Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's new prime minister, sought to
calm markets by warning that the yen's recent rise against the dollar was
'undesirable'.
Finance ministry officials in Tokyo said the Bank of Japan was ready to
intervene in world currency markets through-out this week to support the
dollar.
The BOJ's move, after an emergency cabinet meeting in Tokyo over the
weekend, followed the Fed's rare intervention on Friday to buy dollars for
both yen and D-Marks.
The dollar yesterday came under pressure against the German currency, as
dealers appeared to be testing US resolve to stem the dollar's decline.
There were no signs of Fed intervention, and trading was muted, mainly
because of the May Day holiday in London and the start of a holiday week in
Tokyo. In Japan, markets will close from today until Friday.
However, the perception in markets was that the Fed's operations at the end
of last week may have to be repeated to arrest the dollar's decline. The
dollar has been weak recently against both the yen and the D-Mark because
markets believe a lower dollar fits in with the US administration's plans to
curb Japan's large trade surplus with North America.
The Japanese government is concerned that a further rise in the yen could
choke Japan's fragile hopes of economic recovery. Mr Hata said the
yen-dollar exchange rate should reflect economic fundamentals.
After closing at Y101.2 to the dollar on Friday night in Tokyo, the yen was
quoted at the finish of trading in Japan yesterday at Y101.8. In late
trading in New York last night, the Japanese currency was at 101.635, down
from last week's close of Y101.6.
The US currency was trading weakly against the D-Mark at DM1.64735, down
from a close of DM1.654 the previous session. The Fed's move to support the
dollar against the German currency on Friday came when it touched DM1.645.
Concern that the yen's rise might squeeze Japanese export earnings
undermined shares in Tokyo, pushing the Nikkei index down 0.8 per cent to
19,570.21.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Women turn away from careers in management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Women are opting out of management careers in increasing numbers, according
to a report published today which shows that the trend towards their greater
representation in management has been reversed in the past year.
The findings of the Institute of Management report, based on research among
Britain's leading employers, shows that the percentage of women at almost
all levels of management has fallen.
Mr Roger Young, the Institute's general manager, said he was disappointed
with the findings.
He said: 'For years we have been delighted to record women's increasing
progress at all levels of management, but now they have suffered a setback.'
One reason suggested is that more women are turning their backs on corporate
careers because of some of the tougher and more stressful demands of modern
management regimes.
Mr Young said: 'Some women could be reacting against the non-family-friendly
policies of larger companies and opting to leave the stresses of corporate
life for the buzz of being in control of their own companies.
'In 1993, women were twice as likely to resign as men.'
The institute's National Management Salary Survey shows that women managers
and directors in the UK's largest organisations has fallen from last year's
peak of 10.2 per cent to 9.5 per cent. It is the first time for 21 years
that the proportion of women managers has fallen.
The percentage of women managers had grown steadily from just 1.8 per cent
in 1974, to 3.3 per cent in 1983, 8.6 per cent in 1992 and 10.2 per cent
last year.
The report also shows that although women managers had higher salary
increases than their male colleagues, women executives continue to be paid
less than men.
The average woman manager now earns Pounds 27,862 a year, while the average
male manager earns Pounds 32,303. At director level the average female earns
Pounds 56,040, while her male colleague earns Pounds 74,987.
Women also get poorer deals in other respects. The survey found they are
less likely than men to get company cars, and when aged over 50 are more
likely than their male counterparts to be made redundant.
The most popular jobs for women, said the report, were personnel and
marketing and the least popular were research, development, manufacturing
and production.
The survey is the largest of its kind, covering more than 20,000 individuals
in 339 organisations.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Tory dismay as backbencher calls for cabinet sackings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh divisions hit the Conservative party yesterday, just four days before
this year's first crucial electoral test, when a senior MP called for nearly
a third of the cabinet and the party chairman to be replaced.
The extraordinary public outburst by Mr David Evans, a member of the
powerful 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, undermined efforts to mount a
show of party unity ahead of the local elections.
His remarks came after Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, implied
that two out of 10 Tory MPs did not fully support Mr John Major and that
teams of supporters were already canvassing on behalf of two potential
leadership candidates.
The local elections this week, followed by the European elections in June,
are expected to have a decisive bearing on whether Mr Major remains prime
minister.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, accused the Conservatives of never having
been as demoralised, disorganised and dispirited as they were today. He
called on voters to use the approaching elections to punish the government
for recent tax increases.
As senior cabinet ministers lined up to mark the 15th anniversary of
unbroken Tory rule by attacking Labour, Mr Evans, Conservative MP for Welwyn
Hatfield, stole their thunder by calling for six cabinet ministers and Sir
Norman Fowler, the party chairman, to go. He named only three: Mr John
Gummer, cabinet minister with responsibility for local government, Mr
William Waldegrave, public services minister, and Mr John Patten, education
secretary.
Speaking of 'unease' in the party that Mr Major's closest advisers were
'incompetent', Mr Evans called for a new 'kitchen cabinet' to be installed
at Downing St. He admitted there were some 50 Conservative MPs who would not
accept the prime minister 'at any price'.
Mrs Shephard yesterday tried to play down the significance of her remarks,
saying there was 'a tiny handful' of people who were determined to cause
problems.
In Blackpool, Mr Smith demanded an immediate general election if Mr Major
was replaced.
Tory fault-lines over Europe were also exposed when Mr Stephen Dorrell,
financial secretary to the Treasury - who is widely expected to enter the
cabinet in a summer reshuffle - insisted that most Conservative supporters
recognised that Britain's economic interests were best served within Europe.
His comments came after Mr Michael Portillo, one of his Treasury colleagues,
said the imposition of a single European currency would mean giving up the
government of the UK.

Ever since it announced the closure of the Unlisted Securities Market, the
Stock Exchange has been in a bind. On the one hand it remains unconvinced
that there is sufficient demand to support a separate market for smaller
company shares. Yet it is also afraid of fragmentation. Threats by outsiders
to set up a market of their own have been enough to spur Mr Michael
Lawrence, the exchange's new chief executive, to action.
The plan to build on the success of rule 535.2 - under which the shares of
236 companies are now traded - is sensible enough. But tighter regulations
will be required to satisfy European law and attract institutional
investors, on whom the liquidity of the new market will depend. It is far
from clear that the exchange will be able to find a formula tough enough to
satisfy institutions without re-inventing the USM. Since it is keen to avoid
that trap, a lightly-regulated market of only limited interest to
institutional investors is the likely outcome.
The proponents of a separate market may thus be tempted to press ahead with
their own plans, on the grounds that a more heavily-regulated market
tailored for smaller companies could be made to work under vigorous
independent management. But institutional interest is highly cyclical.
NASDAQ, the successful US smaller companies exchange, can draw on a far
deeper pool of retail investors. The eventual solution may be a pan-European
market on the NASDAQ model. For the time being, all sides are trying to make
the best of a bad job.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This Friday the sun will shine, the bands will play and the Queen and
President Mitterrand will open the Channel tunnel. Eurotunnel's shareholders
will be mightily relieved, although they will soon be tapped for yet more
funds to stave off bankruptcy. The jaundiced would say that proves it never
pays to use equity finance to fund massive infrastructure projects. Most UK
institutional investors baled out long ago.
But investors will increasingly have to bend their minds to the discounted
cash flow investment models employed by Eurotunnel. Debt-laden governments
around the world are considering how to entice private sector finance into
infrastructure projects. Corporate financiers are already chattering about
the second wave of privatisation as public projects are transferred to the
private sector.
In the UK, the private finance working party, chaired by Sir Alastair
Morton, should play an important role in leading the debate. The fundamental
challenge is to change the Treasury's culture to permit a more attractive
balance of risk and reward for commercial investors. The government may have
an important part to play in minimising risks and injecting seed corn funds
before a project blossoms. Then such projects could develop into ideal
investments for fund managers providing a buy-and-forget utility-style
asset. It may not be long before they are comparing the investment merits of
Thai roads with an investment trust launched to build hospitals in
Staffordshire.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The choice of European telecoms stocks has traditionally been so restricted
that last week's enthusiasm for the Tele Danmark flotation is hardly
surprising. Not only was the Dollars 3bn international offering four times
oversubscribed but the shares immediately went to a 7 per cent premium.
Investors, who have in the past had limited chance to buy telecoms stocks
because most are still state-owned, understandably wanted to pile into the
Tele Danmark issue.
But with a flood of other European telecoms offerings due over the next few
years, repeat performances cannot be guaranteed. Holland's KPN is next in
line, with its marketing campaign due to begin this week. Italy's STET,
Greece's OTE and Germany's Deutsche Telekom are expected to follow in quick
succession. The Portuguese and Belgian phone companies may not be far
behind.
With such an abundance of stocks to choose from, investors are bound to
become more discriminating. But how are they to decide which offer the best
value? Yield comparisons are too crude: Tele Danmark's yield is lower than
both BT's and the average of the US Baby Bells, but it has much greater
scope to rationalise its operations and so increase dividends. European
investors are new to the art of making valuation comparisons between telecom
stocks. Their US counterparts are more familiar with the techniques which
involve looking at a wide range of yardsticks. US shareholders snapped up a
high 41 per cent of the Tele Danmark issue. That looks like smart money
spotting a good opportunity.

South Africa's capital markets are driven by politics and international
investors are busy applauding the country's momentous changes. The stock
market has surged in recent weeks and the currency has appreciated strongly
against the US dollar. Further waves of euphoria seem likely to push both
markets to new heights. But when politics is the dominant investment
consideration, unpredictability is certain. Several factors are now critical
for the future outlook.
If the ANC ends up with more than 66 per cent of the votes, then many will
fear they will override the checks and balances of the constitution. If
Inkatha were to criticise the elections for not being free and fair, that
too would unsettle sentiment. The financial rand's discount to the
commercial rand, which provides a yardstick of international investors'
confidence, widened to 38 per cent earlier this month when Inkatha
threatened not to take part in the elections. It has since narrowed to 23
per cent but similar instability might ensue if any of the leading economic
figures were moved aside.
When misty eyes clear, South African markets will at least be partly
underpinned by economic fundamentals. The economy seems poised to enjoy a
virtuous circle of increased domestic and international investment combined
with an upswing in the commodity cycle. Economic growth may reach 3 per cent
this year, doubling in the following year. But the chief worry concerns
capacity constraints. South Africa's productive asset base has been worn
down by years of autarky. That could produce an upsurge in inflation if
demand proves too strong.

Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging hardly trips off even a South African

meaning 'place of gold', and the name given to Jo-burg by black mineworkers,
was an early suggestion. But then, what would non-white residents of Egoli
be called? Quite. The search continues.

Persuading Yassir Arafat to break from the last detailed negotiations of the
peace talks with Israel was no mean feat on the part of Daimler-Benz, which
yesterday wooed the PLO leader to Stuttgart.
The idea was to signal the support of Germany's biggest industrial empire
for the peace process - though just how far there is still to go was obvious
from the cavalcade of 17 heavily-armoured four-tonne Mercedes limousines
accompanying the visitor.
Seeing that Arafat is not quite a head of state yet, he misses out on the
traditional Daimler gift of a Merc. Instead, he came away with the promise
of funding for a kindergarten - for 'the future of Palestine' - as well as
cash for a study on establishing the transport infrastructure of the future
state.
Gleaming new roads to carry all those future trucks and buses, no doubt.
Even for Edzard Reuter, the socially-conscious boss of Daimler, the profit
motive is never entirely absent.

As European members of parliament prepare to vote on the ticklish subject of
EU enlargement tomorrow, spare a thought for the whips feverishly trying to
ensure a respectable turnout.
Unlike their domestic counterparts, the bully boys of Strasbourg suffer an
embarrassing paucity of sticks and carrots. With a houseful of backbenchers
and no cabinet, how can you reward the dutiful - and more pertinently,
punish the wayward?
Conservative chief whip Lord Inglewood has learned one or two tricks since
he took up his birch at the beginning of the year.
The division of committee spoils in the next parliament is one focus of
considerable interest, for instance.
Apparently the real bogey for Conservatives is - un-PC thought coming up -
being assigned to the women's rights committee.
For the Labour party, it's legal affairs. 'I'm on that,' Inglewood reveals.
An equally effective tool, he goes on, is the lure of a place on one of the
'interparliamentary delegations' - the most popular junkets being to the US
or China.
Yep, MEPs are uncomplicated beasts, really.

Whatever can have cropped up in Lord Parkinson's diary last week that
prompted the Thatcherite, profoundly Euro-sceptical Conservative Way
Forward, of which he is chairman, to postpone the launch of its new
manifesto?
Fielding Parkinson as its excuse for the sudden scheduling problem, the
group says it is now postponing publication until mid-June.
By then, of course, the local and European elections will be comfortably -
or uncomfortably - behind John Major and his
party.
Even if CWF had a less than totally free hand in the rearrangement, it may
still have the last laugh, though. The worse the Conservatives fare in the
polling, the more plausible becomes the new manifesto as a recipe for
averting disaster in the next general election.

Volkswagen supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen must be heartily sick of
the Lopez affair. Dragged back early from his Majorcan holiday last summer
when the industrial espionage case first blew up, he has been grumbling that
the investigation may dish plans to freshen the tan this year too.
That particular grim prospect dawned during last Thursday's interview with
US justice department officials in London - a meeting which Liesen decided
to attend, the alternative being an invite to America under subpoena.
While German investigators are still ploughing through the data seized from
VW last August, fleeter-footed Washington sleuths have arrived on their back
doorstep.
Following an exchange with his questioners about the hiring of Basque
production genius Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua from General Motors last
spring, Liesen agreed willingly to further interviews - on similar, any
time, anywhere, terms.
Holiday or none, the grizzled Prussian lawyer wants to be helpful, you see.
With retirement looming from his main job as chairman of Ruhrgas, it's in
his interests to try and look as upright and effective a non-executive as
possible.
But he far from relishes the thought of having to remain on base for many a
week to come. Making himself available at Ruhrgas's head office, on the
other hand, might speed up proceedings. One visit to Essen is normally
enough for almost any visitor.

FT  03 MAY 94 / A cry for freedom: Central banks in ex-Soviet states remain
under the shadow of politicians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A struggle for independence is being waged by central banks in almost all of
the states of the former Soviet Union - a battle possibly as momentous as
the countries themselves underwent to achieve statehood.
For Mr Michael Bruno, chief economist at the World Bank, a central bank is
'the way in which society protects itself against itself'.
He made his remarks last week, to a conference mounted by Chicago
University's Law School which succeeded in getting most of the central bank
governors of the post-communist states together to talk about their problems
and listen to western bankers tell them how to protect their banks against
their politicians.
The legacy with which they have to cope is that of a Soviet state bank -
Gosbank - which monopolised the banking field and was subservient to the
Communist party, the government and the ministries. Money allocated to
projects and enterprises merely passed though the bank, requiring it to
develop no analytical skills; its foreign currency operations, though
prudent, were relatively rudimentary; its supervisory functions perfunctory.
The legacy is doubly malign in the non-Russian republics. Gosbank's
headquarters in Moscow possessed a tiny corps of highly skilled bankers; its
branches in the republican capitals, now independent states, had almost
none. 'It's very bad when politicians don't understand the basics of the
market economy. But when the central bankers don't, then it can be a
disaster,' says Mr Grigory Marchenko, deputy governor-designate of the Bank
of Kazakhstan.
But the largest complaint from the central bank bosses is the political
chaos in which they work. Mr Victor Yushchenko, Ukraine's central bank
governor, works with a parliament still in the process of elections but
tending against reform, a president lacking in authority, legislation to set
out the the central bank's remit endlessly delayed, a plunging economy and
tiny reserves. 'The central bank and the new commercial banks are in a very
tough position,' he says. 'They have to act as champions of change in an
environment where most of the government and the large state sector are
resisting or slowing such change.'
The central bankers' situations are diverse but they agree with great
feeling on one thing - that their political masters should not have any
right to interfere, either directly or indirectly, through over-politicised
appointments.
'The government is always looking for easy money,' says Ilman Rimshevichs,
the deputy governor of the central bank of Latvia, one of the most
successful of the ex-Soviet economies. 'In these conditions it's hard to
enforce independence and to sell off the state commercial banks which used
to supply cheap credit to the enterprises.'
At the other end of the scale from Latvia are republics such as Georgia and
Armenia, whose economies are ruined and where to talk of existence is more
germane than to talk of independence. In Georgia, for example, the currency
is close to losing all meaning: from trading at 35,000 to the dollar last
November, it fell to 180,000 by Christmas, and to 650,000 at the end of last
month.
At still another extreme is Belarus, where an agreement with Russia, signed
in April, appears to open the way for the merger of the two Slav states'
economies. However, Mr Stanislav Bogdankevich, the governor of the country's
central bank, is opposed to the deal, saying that Russian and Belorussian
interests diverge too much to make union possible and calling for a
strengthening of the national currency before any long-term monetary union
is contemplated.
Yet, he says, the conditions for a separate, fully-fledged national currency
in Belarus are absent and likely to remain so. 'Now, 90 per cent of our
economy is still state owned. The dominant part of the economy is composed
of enterprises with 10,000 or more workers, which make mainly for the
Russian or Ukrainian markets. If we let these enterprises go we will get 50
per cent unemployment. Investment in the economy has practically
disappeared. We don't need monetary stabilisation: we need a programme which
covers the whole economy.'
The brightest star in the post-Soviet firmament is Estonia. Its prime
minister, Mr Mart Laar, and its central bank governor, Mr Siim Kallas, put
the success down to the strength of the bank's commitment to a stable
currency. Estonia has linked the Estonian kroon to the German D-Mark and
given the bank no discretion to lend to the government. At the same time,
the governor cannot be fired and future governors will nominate their own
successors. The result has been a hard currency, low inflation (though
rising now) and an economy set to grow as fast as any in Europe this year.
For Mr Kallas, the reform showed that 'money is seen not just as money, but
as a crucial national symbol'. Rather more cynically, he confesses that the
laws guaranteeing bank independence, linking the kroon to the D-Mark and
barring the government from raiding the bank's coffers were passed through
parliament 'before the deputies quite knew what it all meant'.
Russia is still at the centre of the web - though none of its central
bankers came to Chicago. Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the present governor, takes
the contrary view to the prevailing credo of most central bankers everywhere
else, that his duty is to keep enterprises going even at the cost of high
inflation, and has said that he does not believe inflation is directly
related to the supply of money in the economy (by contrast, the Estonians
believe this with a kind of mystical fervour).
As the 'owner' not so long ago of these now 'independent' banks, the Russian
bank still exercises influence - the more so as Russia seeks to extend its
economic union, drawing other states into the same relationship as that it
wishes to have with Belarus. Mr Thomas Wolf, deputy director of the
International Monetary Fund department concerned with east Europe and the
former Soviet Union, noted that after the Soviet collapse, the former states
tried to do two contradictory things  - to build up their national
currencies and to discuss with the Russian central bank how best to draw
their economies closer.
This tension remains. For the central bankers, the success of Estonia and
Latvia is less of a beacon than a train disappearing over the horizon -
which they have missed. Unlike Mr Kallas, they were unable - or unwilling -
to get change in place early while the industrial and other lobbies were
disoriented. Now they must seek change in the worst kind of circumstances
and many of their political leaders are tempted to lean on Russia. The
Chicago gathering showed the bankers want to pursue independence: but it
showed, too, how far they remain under the shadow of politics.

<TEXT>
European Union institutions often face justifiable criticism for lack of
transparency in decision-making. One of the bodies best placed to address
this problem is the European Parliament, but the public doubts its
effectiveness. That is one reason why, in most EU countries, the turnout in
the election for the Strasbourg assembly on June 9 and 12 will probably be
much lower than in national polls.
In fact, as a result of the Single European Act that came into force in 1987
and the Maastricht treaty, the power of the 518 (soon to be 567) MEPs in
many cases exceeds that of members of national parliaments. With the ability
to determine Europe-wide legislation, vet both the European Commission and
Council of Ministers and check the EU budget, Europe's transnational
assembly demands to be taken seriously. At the same time, the rules
governing the parliament's own operations need to be tightened. If it wants
public sympathy in its campaign for a more directly democratic EU, the
parliament will have to correct its own shortcomings.
At present, the parliament offers a case study in unwieldiness, due only in
part to the inevitable problems of linking 12 states' diverse political
cultures. Efficiency is constrained and costs increased by MEPs' need to
peregrinate between plenary sessions in Strasbourg and committee meetings in
Brussels.
Higher profile
The parliament's difficulties have often reflected national governments'
unwillingness to allow it to undermine national parliaments. However, during
the next five-year legislature period, it will have a much higher profile.
Already, around 2,000 MEPs' amendments relating to single market legislation
have passed into law. Under Maastricht, the parliament shares 'co-decision'
power with the Council of Ministers. It can veto most measures passed by
qualified majority voting, in fields ranging from consumer protection and
vocational training to health and research.
In a fresh sign of its importance, the parliament is due to decide tomorrow
whether to accept the formula for EU voting planned when Austria, Finland,
Norway and Sweden join.
It would be both unwise and regrettable if MEPs risked delaying an
enlargement timetable which commands widespread support within the EU, but
which is politically sensitive in the applicant countries. The parliament
is, however, on stronger ground in seeking confirmation hearings with
nominees for the new Commission due to take office next year and is playing
a welcome part in efforts launched by the Dutch to reduce secrecy in EU
ministerial discussions.
Credibility
In its supervisory or watchdog role, the parliament can have a beneficial
impact in promoting transparency, controlling EU bureaucracies and curbing
over-spending, including that linked to fraud. But these efforts will
command little credibility while evidence persists of parliament's own
mismanagement.
Responsibility for the wastefulness of the Brussels-Strasbourg Euroshuttle
lies largely with the French government, which has constantly opposed siting
the parliament in its logical home, the Belgian capital. Nonetheless, the
parliament is partly to blame for the cost over-runs on its new building in
Brussels and for the plan to create an expensive new chamber in Strasbourg.
Independent inquiries into both affairs are urgently required.
Among necessary procedural reforms, the parliament must widen timely
dissemination of its often valuable committee work. It must also try to
ensure a more cohesive framework for its debates and for the ensuing votes.
Possible moves to crack down on absenteeism might include suspension or
expulsion of MEPs. Equally, given its influence over EU legislation, the
parliament needs firmer rules for disclosure of members' links with outside
companies.
To reinforce the democratic legitimacy of EU decisions, it is healthy that
the parliament is acquiring and using extra muscle. But there is also a need
to scrutinise the scrutineer. Only if it respects the principles of probity
and openness in the conduct of EU affairs can the parliament hope to
safeguard them. Without a better reputation, the parliament will fail to
engage the interest and to win the trust of Europe's voters.

The acquisition of American Tobacco by BAT Industries is at first glance a
perverse step. For one thing, it appears contrary to BAT's strategy of
diversifying away from cigarette sales into financial services. For another,
BAT is investing in the US tobacco market at a time when sales are declining
and the anti-smoking climate is shifting from determined to downright
zealous.
Yet BAT has benefited from the adverse circumstances - as its share price
rise shows. Fears over the future of the US market mean that the price paid
for American Tobacco is cheap at under 10 times earnings. The acquisition
should allow BAT to strengthen its market position through efficiencies in
marketing and sales. In spite of falling sales and the price war launched
last year by Philip Morris, tobacco continues to produce strong cash flow.
This cash can be used to diversify out of tobacco. BAT continues to look for
opportunities in financial services. American Brands, former owner of
American Tobacco, has built up a strong portfolio of other consumer brands.
But the collapse of communism creates enormous opportunities for companies
that remain in the tobacco business. Markets such as China and the former
Soviet Union are now opening up with fast-growing sales.
The tobacco giants would be unwise to assume that they can indefinitely
expand the market for their products, however, even in less developed
countries. The health consequences of smoking on those who indulge in it are
now undisputed and clear. As life expectancy in such countries lengthens,
the cost in premature deaths and medical treatment will become evident.
Restrictions on sales and marketing will follow.
Anti-smoking activists
The rapid change in thinking in the US should be a warning of how fast the
climate for smoking can change, even in a country with a substantial tobacco
industry. The election of President Bill Clinton has ended a period in which
anti-smoking activists had minimal impact and US diplomats did their best to
open foreign markets for their tobacco companies. Far-reaching measures now
proposed could restrict smoking to the privacy of the home, the car or
special smoking rooms sealed off from the rest of the world.
Given the growing evidence on the health impact of smoking on non-smokers,
it is certainly sensible to ensure that the latter can avoid 'passive
smoking'. The threat of litigation will compel employers to protect their
non-smoking employees from tobacco smoke. The prevailing mood may also lead
businesses such as restaurants to segregate their smoking customers. Smokers
in public places will face increasing restrictions at the behest of the
non-smoking majority.
Draconian measures
Yet some of the more draconian measures now proposed are unlikely to be
effective. Punitive taxation, for example, is tempting because it bears
heavily on 'sinners'. It can also be shown to reduce consumption and deter
young people from the habit. Excessively high taxes, however, also increase
the sort of cross-border smuggling that recently forced Canada to cut its
tobacco tax.
Even more drastic attempts to treat tobacco like other dangerous drugs is
likely to make control more difficult. Banning other widely-consumed drugs
such as marijuana has not significantly reduced their consumption. It has,
however, removed them from controls over distribution, to the advantage of
those who sell more dangerous substances. As with alcohol prohibition in the
US, the main beneficiaries are criminals.
Nor is it clear that complete bans on advertising are efficacious (other
than in defending state tobacco monopolies against foreign competitors).
There is some evidence that smoking may increase in countries with bans
because of the disappearance of the anti-smoking messages that
advertisements are normally required to carry.
Reducing the number of smokers and the amount of smoking is a legitimate and
worthwhile aim of public policy. But pragmatism is needed in chosing the
means. And success is likely to be gradual, a fact that allows the tobacco
companies very many more profitable years before their market disappears
completely.

FT  03 MAY 94 / High-powered decisions ahead: After the death of two
drivers, the sport of grand prix motor racing faces difficult choices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world of grand prix motor racing, still mourning the death at the
weekend of three-times world champion Ayrton Senna and Austrian driver
Roland Ratzenberger, yesterday began the process of analysing the causes of
the fatalities at the San Marino Grand Prix - and their implications for the
sport's future.
A formal investigation is being launched by the Paris-based world governing
body of motor sport, the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile. Before
the lights turn green at the Monaco Grand Prix on May 15, the drivers will
have held their own meeting to discuss whether additional steps should be
taken to improve safety.
Ironically that meeting was initiated by Senna himself. In part it was a
consequence of his concern that changes made this year to the rules
governing grand prix cars, in particular a ban on 'active' (computer
controlled) suspension, traction control (to prevent wheel spin under
acceleration), and other driver aids, were making the cars more difficult to
control.
Senna lived for the satisfaction racing at the limit gave him. He brought to
grand prix not just natural driving talent but a self-discipline and
analytical rigour. Nevertheless, in spite of his renowned aggression on the
track, no one was more aware of motor racing's risks than the 34-year-old
Brazilian: 'I know you are always in danger of dying . . . and it can really
get to you. If you're not careful you can see how fragile you are; that you
can be gone in just a fraction of a second,' he said recently.
His death raises questions not just about the safety record of grand prix
racing and measures that might be taken to improve it but also the extent to
which it should regard itself as a entertainment spectacle, necessarily
involving risk.
The FIA's president, Mr Max Mosley, yesterday defended this year's rule
changes of which Senna was critical. The FIA introduced them, Mr Mosley
says, as a means of restoring a greater role for the driver. Had the trend
to greater electronic control of the cars gone unchecked, maintains Mr
Mosley, 'we would fairly quickly eliminate the driver. One skill after
another would go until, in the end, almost anybody would be able to drive
the car. It's all technically fascinating and very relevant to road cars -
but we felt it would destroy an essential element of grand prix racing.'
He perhaps did not realise it but Mr Mosley was in effect saying that
technology has given grand prix, the ability - and the responsibility - to
decide what level of risk should be involved.
The ramifications of the questions raised extend beyond the grand prix teams
to embrace all the participants in what has become a global industry, as
well as a sport.
With each race watched in more than 100 countries and by about 1bn
television viewers, Formula One Grand Prix has become a marketing tool for
carmakers and other multinationals ranging from clothing group Benetton to
the tobacco industry.
Yesterday the Ford motor company, which provides engines for several teams
including current championship leader, Benetton-Ford, withdrew a series of
newspaper advertisements to celebrate its weekend victory. And Renault,
whose engines powered the Williams car in which Senna died, itself called
for greater safety measures.
Such reactions are understandable, as is that of the German driver Michael
Schumacher, whose third win in a row in his Benetton-Ford at the weekend was
overshadowed by the tragedies. Schumacher has pledged to lead the Monaco
meeting himself in the quest to secure greater safety.
The immediate investigations will concentrate on discovering what caused
Ratzenberger to leave the track at such high speed - close to 200mph - on
Saturday and Senna, 24 hours later, to crash head-on into the concrete wall
lining Imola's notorious Tamburello curve at a similar speed.
Video and eye-witness evidence indicate that bodywork broke away on
Ratzenberger's car, causing it to lose stability. In Senna's case there are
few clues, except that on the evening before the race he was reported as
worried about his car being 'nervous' on the Imola circuit, one of the
world's fastest but criticised by several drivers for being bumpy. The
data-logging 'black box' from the wreckage of Senna's car may hold the
answers to the crash and will be flown to the UK for examination within the
next few days.
Another issue of immediate concern is the safety of racing circuits. The
Monaco drivers' meeting is expected to concentrate on this issue. More
gravel traps to slow the cars before they hit barriers and longer run-off
areas might well have reduced the catastrophic consequences of the weekend's
crashes. Honeycomb barriers, rather than rigid steel or concrete ones, might
also have slowed Senna's and Ratzenberger's deceleration rate enough for
them to survive.
But there are more fundamental decisions to be made. The FIA could chose to
retain the new rules, thus placing the onus on the drivers, not technology,
to control the cars. The rules also have the advantage of curbing costs,
allowing smaller teams to close the gap on the front-runners, thus making
racing more interesting for spectators.
But this concept of grand prix racing - as commercial spectacle first,
technology race second - has increased the risk to drivers. The number of
spins from driver error in grand prix races this year shows how big the
impact has been, although there is no evidence that this was a factor in the
weekend's crashes.
The alternative is for the FIA to relax the restrictions on driver aids.
This would give a fresh impetus to the technological side of racing: such is
the pace of technology, the cars would not even need drivers within the next
five years. Last year leading drivers had merely to press a button when the
lights turned to green. It was the on-board computer which operated the
accelerator and clutch, changed all the gears and stopped the wheels
spinning wastefully until the first corner had been passed. Such driver aids
are among those currently banned.
One problem, however, as the investigations into the weekend's accidents is
likely to show, is that while the cars' carbon-fibre driver 'survival' cells
are surviving impacts of great severity, the drivers they contain can simply
no longer cope with the impact of the gravitational forces in high-speed
collisions, even in the absence of other injury.
The blunt question grand prix must ask itself is whether audiences are
interested in racing as a risk-free giant Nintendo game, fought by computers
with little human input during the races themselves - or whether commercial
interests will drift away towards something more adventurous.
The advances in circuit design, car technology and materials have in fact
made grand prix motor racing safe beyond all reasoned expectation. Until
this weekend it had been 12 years since a driver was killed while competing
in a grand prix; a decade since one died in testing. That is almost 200
races, each of about 200 miles. When testing and practice undertaken
throughout each year is added in, nearly 1m grand prix miles have been
covered between fatalities.
It is no grounds for complacency. But neither is it necessarily a record to
be ashamed of, given this is a sport which has as its essence the human
control of half-tonne projectiles travelling at up to 100 yards per second -
and in which success is measured by how closely the limit of control can be
approached without being exceeded.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Pounds, pioneers and more pounds: The Channel tunnel opens
this week, late and over budget. Andrew Taylor says it is not unique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Alastair Morton and Mr Andre Benard, co-chairmen of Eurotunnel, will on
Friday join the ranks of engineering pioneers such as Thomas Telford,
Isambard Brunel and Ferdinand de Lesseps who have presided over grand
engineering projects completed late and over budget.
The official opening of the Channel tunnel by the Queen and President
Francois Mitterrand of France is a year later than originally planned. A
full service is unlikely to be available until the autumn.
The cost of the project, at more than Pounds 10bn including interest
payments, is more than double the Pounds 4.8bn forecast in 1987.
Shareholders, who have invested Pounds 1.6bn already, will be asked later
this summer to find another Pounds 500m-Pounds 750m as Eurotunnel seeks to
raise yet more cash to meet the spiralling costs. Similarly, banks will have
to lend more.
Their experience, and those of promoters of other large engineering
projects, raises the question of whether such pioneering schemes are
suitable for private investment when they are almost impossible to cost in
advance.
Potential promoters of the Pounds 2.7bn proposed high-speed rail link
between the Channel tunnel and London have succesfully argued that the
government should share the financial risk as it can take a broader view of
other social and economic benefits which the development may bring. The UK
government says it will bear part of the cost but the amount has not been
decided.
Developments which have substantially exceeded their original budgets in
recent years include the Thames Barrier which cost Pounds 46m (compared with
an original price of Pounds 23m), and the NatWest Tower in the City of
London, Pounds 115m (Pounds 15m). Outside the UK, the Seikan rail tunnel,
connecting the island of Hokkaido to mainland Japan was completed 14 years
late and billions of pounds over budget.
History is littered with grandiose schemes which have failed to satisfy the
original expectations of bankers, investors and politicians. Yet many have
come to be regarded as successes bringing great strategic advantages.
Mr Patrick de Pelet, head of project finance at Kleinwort Benson merchant
bank, says: 'The political, commercial and financial risks involved in large
infrastructure projects are such that the private sector will look to the
government to bridge the gap to bring the economics into balance in this
more demanding climate.'
Mr Roland Paxton, historian at the Institution of Civil Engineers, says
large projects have particular features which make it difficult to forecast
the cost and construction time. He says the scale of the work means that
construction, invariably, has to start before detailed designs are completed
and potential problems and bottlenecks can be identified. Engineers without
detailed plans tend to be over-optimistic in their projections, particularly
with nervous bankers and shareholders to convince.
For example, a cooling system in the Channel tunnel was not included in the
original plans. The need for one only became apparent when final designs
revealed that friction caused by the passage of some of the world's largest
trains, together with heat generated by signalling, communications and other
equipment, would increase the temperature inside the tunnels to 50'C.
As a result engineers had to install hundreds of kilometres of pipes to pump
220 litres of water a second, chilled to 3'C by cooling plants equivalent to
25,000 domestic refrigerators.
Designs on long-running projects also have a habit of changing. Mr Neville
Simms, chief executive of Tarmac, one of the five British and five French
construction companies which built the Channel tunnel says: 'The speed of
technological development has been such that even if we had spent two years
preparing detailed designs before starting work we would have had to change
them before construction was completed.'
Even if the technology is simple, the scale of large projects in itself
makes costings unreliable, if only because there is no previous experience
to draw on. Organisation and communication problems are different between,
say, a 5km and a 50km tunnel. More than 800,000 concrete segments, 22,000
tonnes of railway track, 15,000 supports to carry overhead power lines and
20,000 light fittings were just some of the components installed in the
Channel tunnel.
Mr Michel Barbier, responsible for installing mechanical and electrical
equipment from France, described the process of transporting much of that
equipment through the narrow tunnel mouth as like 'force feeding a goose in
a very short space of time to produce the best ever pate de foie gras'.
Such problems are hardly new. Thomas Telford, who built the Menai bridge
between the island of Anglesey and the Welsh mainland in 1826 - then the
world's largest suspension bridge - had expected the scheme to be completed
in three years at a cost of Pounds 70,000.
Instead he found the technology outpacing him. The bridge took eight years
to build and cost Pounds 170,000 after Telford was persuaded that it would
be stronger if he increased the height of its towers. The bridge improved an
important Anglo-Irish trade route and gave Britain a lead in bridge building
technology which it was able to exploit elsewhere.
The financing of the Suez Canal, completed in 1869, is a classic example of
engineers persuading investors that they would be able to meet
over-optimistic cost forecasts. The private-sector project, proposed by
Ferdinand de Lesseps, a French entrepreneur, was to be financed by the issue
of 400,000 shares at FFr500 each to meet the Pounds 8m construction cost.
But the project finished a year late and cost Pounds 18m.
Even then, shareholders' problems were not over. Revenue from the canal
failed to cover costs and the promised 5 per cent dividend on the shares.
Ishmail Pasha, the viceroy of Egypt, whose family had spent Pounds 6.8m on
the canal shares, sold his stake to the British government for Pounds 4m.
De Lesseps ran into still more serious trouble with plans to finance
privately the Panama Canal. The project was forecast in 1880 to cost Dollars
240m, including interest repayments. It was expected to take 12 years to
complete.
The venture was eventually finished in 1914 by the US government after the
French venture failed in 1889 having spent Dollars 287m and made little
progress in building the canal. The US spent a further Dollars 352m on the
project, making a total of Dollars 639m - more than two and a half times the
original budget.
Another private-sector project that had to be rescued by a government was
the first tunnel under the River Thames built 150 years ago by Marc Isambard
Brunel (father of Isambard Kingdom Brunel). Shareholders lost all of their
money but the project was an engineering triumph breaking new ground in
tunneling technology. The tunnel is still used as part of the London
Underground.
Telford, De Lesseps and Brunel may have failed to meet their original
financial targets - and many shareholders have had their fingers burnt. But
their projects have yielded strategic and economic benefits over many years.
With Eurotunnel shareholders facing yet another call on their cash, that
might bring them a little satisfaction.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN GREENE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As someone eagerly awaiting the arrival of the UK's fourth and last
mobile phone operator before deciding which system to use, I have been
disappointed with the launch of Orange. I can see where the Pounds 15m on
advertising is being spent, namely on TV and one word poster adverts that
tell you nothing about the product or how to get one. I have been into phone
shops and am aware that there are plenty of handsets in stock. The only
thing I don't know is how much it costs, as tariff sheets and contract
details are in short supply.
Whereas newspapers carried full tariff details on the launch of the Mercury
PCN in both adverts and in articles, the garbled reporting of Orange's
launch in last Thursday's FT - 'there are to be no monthly charges. Its plan
for occasional users costs Pounds 15 a month including. . .' - does not help
to clarify matters.
Whatever happened to benefit selling? I feel that Orange's concept approach
to marketing that overlooks its product's benefits is going to cost it dear.
Or maybe the tariffs are best not explained in case they cost the customer
dear.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Auditor liability must have limit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN BRINDLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants in its submission to
the Department of Trade and Industry on auditors' liability has missed the
point ('Accounting body warns over cap on audit liability', April 25).
To argue that allowing auditors the right to negotiate a limit on liability
would be anti-competitive, and therefore against the public interest, simply
misunderstands the seriousness of the position.
It is quite clear that, following some spectacular corporate collapses and
the ensuing epidemic of legislation, the major firms are now facing claims
of such size that one or more of them could be bankrupted. Insurance cover
is no longer available and, unless the Companies Act is amended to allow
auditors to negotiate an upper limit for lawsuits, some firms will go under.
Incorporation has been mentioned as one solution but, while it would offer
some protection to individuals, the company as an entity would still be at
risk in the event of an excessive lawsuit.
The consequences scarcely bear thinking about. Setting aside the mayhem it
would cause in the accountancy profession, business would be badly damaged
as companies would be unable to substantiate their accounts and so attract
investment. This dislocation would continue for some time and by no stretch
of the imagination could that be described as in the public interest.
Let us be very clear, the major firms are not trying to shirk
responsibility. We are very willing to accept our share of the blame, but
not everyone else's share. It cannot be right that auditors are exposed to
100 per cent of a loss, whatever their proportion of the blame. What is most
desirable - and equitable - is that the law on joint and several liability
should be changed so that auditors only bear the costs of what is directly
attributable to them. However, the Law Commission has made it clear that its
workload makes this change most unlikely in the short term.
In this event, all we are seeking is a modest change in the law to bring us
into line with other professionals who already have the right to negotiate a
limit on what they have to pay out.
Pursuing the goal of free competition is laudable and one to which we
subscribe. We do not believe limiting auditors' liability goes against this.
What we do believe is that failure to change the law will damage industry as
much, if not more than, the profession.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Incomplete picture conveyed of power
workers' attitudes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN LYONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Frank Ledger and Howard Sallis's article about the operations of the
Central Electricity Generating Board during the 1984-1985 miners' strike
('We kept the home fires burning', April 23) was a trailer both for their
forthcoming book on the subject and for the BBC2 documentary, 'The men who
kept the lights on', shown the same evening.
The producers of the documentary had the laudable aim of bringing that story
to a wider public; unfortunately, by their choice of interviewees they
conveyed the impression that the only members of the workforce who
co-operated with management in carrying out the industry's fundamental
public service commitment to keep the lights on were weak, unprincipled or
greedy, or all three. It was not so.
Among the industry's workforce there was much sympathy for the miners'
predicament. But, with comparatively few exceptions, it did not translate
into support for the strike itself - for obvious reasons. Arthur Scargill,
the miners' leader, with his own overtly political objectives, made a lot of
people wary, even when sympathetic. He not only endorsed picket-line
violence, but it was widely appreciated that, in the absence of a ballot, he
needed it. Scargill's slogan that no mine should be closed on economic
grounds rang no bells with a workforce which accepted that power stations
had to be closed when they were no longer economic. And then there was
always a strong sense of responsibility about electricity supply being a
public service.
Management was only able to pull the industry through the strike in the way
it did because the workforce as a whole was, at the very least, unpersuaded
about the legitimacy of the miners' strike under Scargill's leadership. No
one could know that from watching the documentary.
Of course, there were those in the industry who strongly supported the
strike. They also had honourable reasons, but they were in a minority. At
perhaps six or seven of (from memory) about 90 power stations support for
the strike was sufficiently strong to prevent management from getting in any
new coal supplies. But at the great majority of power stations these
problems did not arise or else were comparatively minor. No one could have
known that from watching the documentary.
I do not think the producers of the documentary set out to produce the
skewed picture with which they ended up. But they should have painted the
wider picture as well.

competence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BEN COLEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Philosophical discussions over subsidiarity in relation to the Cardiff
Bay barrage and the sudden introduction of EU import quotas on Chinese silk
shirts miss the point (Letters, April 25 and 28, and report, 'Clothes
retailers hit as Brussels imposes limits on silk imports', April 22). The
silk shirts affair throws up far more disturbing questions about the
competence of the Department of Trade and Industry and the Foreign Office.
Didn't the DTI and the FO have any idea in advance that the EU wanted to
impose quotas? If they did, why was there no warning to British importers,
which are left with overseas stock they have paid for but cannot bring in?
If they did not, why on earth not?
The important issue here is whether British industry is suffering yet again
from the failure of our politicians and civil servants to understand how to
monitor and influence developments in Brussels. Ben Coleman,

FT  03 MAY 94 / Understanding the libertarian mind
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The other evening I attended a meeting of the Vienna Coffee Club - that is
Vienna in the state of Virginia. The guest of honour, Mrs Bettina Greaves,
spoke about Ludwig von Mises, the late 'Austrian' economist whose work she
has lovingly catalogued. I thought how strange it was that Mises, an
economist almost unknown in his native Austria, remains a source of
inspiration for many US libertarians.
I suppose Americans, for historical reasons, are naturally more sympathetic
to free-market ideas than Europeans. The newly-formed Vienna Coffee Club is
typical of scores of discussion groups and think-tanks scattered across the
US. What they share is a dislike of government and a burning commitment to
economic and personal liberty. Some, such as the Cato Institute in
Washington DC, exert considerable influence.
Cynics tend to dismiss libertarians as either cranks or rightwing
reactionaries. They say the high-flown rhetoric about 'freedom' is a
smokescreen. Rich entrepreneurs support such groups, the argument runs, for
selfish reasons: to garner political support for lower taxes, a policy from
which they stand to benefit.
Perhaps some backers of libertarian groups do have dubious motives. But this
is not an argument against libertarianism: as Adam Smith noted, self-serving
behaviour often promotes public welfare more effectively than altruism.
Motives in any case have no bearing on the validity of political arguments.
While libertarians sometimes welcome support from traditional right-wingers,
the philosophy espoused by true believers would make most conservatives
cringe.
Libertarians believe in one fundamental principle: individuals should be
free to pursue their own goals unmolested provided they do not harm the
person or property of others. All consenting acts between adults that do not
damage third parties should be permitted. Libertarians are thus highly
critical of conservatives for disregarding civil and personal liberties and
for imposing their moral codes on the entire community.
They reject military conscription (even in wartime) as a wholly unacceptable
infringement of personal liberty; they oppose all forms of censorship,
including restrictions on pornography; and they strongly advocate equal
legal treatment of all citizens, regardless of sexual orientation, race or
gender. A libertarian could have no principled objection to homosexual
marriage, or to adult prostitution, which is a service in obvious demand.
In these respects libertarians are firmly 'left of centre'. But they part
company with social democrats on economics. They do not believe personal and
economic freedoms can be disentangled. As Mr Murray Rothbard, a prominent
American libertarian, has often argued, civil liberties are rooted in
economic freedoms. Why? Because we cannot do anything without control of
physical objects and, ultimately, we cannot control what we do not own.
Liberty is thus a myth unless individuals can own and transfer assets
without interference.
The axiom that interactions between people should not be interfered with
unless they damage third parties thus logically extends from free speech and
sexual conduct to the exchange of goods and services. Yet when government
imposes taxes or regulations, it forcibly interferes with these voluntary
economic exchanges. Taxation, for example, means that employees often
receive two thirds or less of the monetary value of their output. Extreme
libertarians, such as Rothbard, reject all taxation as 'theft'; moderate
libertarians accept the need for some taxation, but oppose progressive taxes
 -proportionately higher taxes on the wealthy.
Western-style democracy (one person one vote) is often regarded as an
automatic guarantee of personal freedom. Libertarians agree that the
alternatives are worse, but they regard government of any sort as
potentially despotic. The problem is that the right to vote once every few
years gives the individual little control over the actions of government. It
exerts no effective restraint on the capricious will of the majority, which
is often strongly influenced by special interest groups.
Libertarians fear individual rights are being crushed even in such
supposedly individualistic societies as the US. For a catalogue of recent
abuses, see Lost Rights: the Destruction of American Liberty (St Martin's
Press, New York), a new book by libertarian author James Bovard. He worries
about tax regulations that are forcing the self-employed into bankruptcy,
'asset forfeiture' laws that permit officials to seize property almost at
will, security forces which search homes and persons merely on suspicion of
drug abuse, and a mind-boggling array of arbitrary rules stemming from some
1,200 separate federal programmes.
Bovard complains that most Americans have a romantic view of government:
they judge politicians not by their record but, naively, by what they say
they will do for voters. He favours rolling back government to its 1910
boundaries - before income tax.
Since libertarians believe in low, flat taxes and a minimal government (for
such functions as defence and law and order), they are often perceived as
'uncaring'. This is somewhat unfair. People's ethics are best judged by
their private actions - not by their politics. The proportion of income that
individuals freely give to charity is surely a far better gauge of their
sympathy for their less fortunate fellows than the shrillness of their calls
for higher taxes on the rich and more public spending, much of which only
induces dependency in recipients thus further eroding their life chances.
The libertarian voice deserves to be heard.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Arts: Twenty years of Capricorn - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Capricorn ensemble has celebrated the end of its second decade with
three concerts in the Purcell Room and in St. Giles, Cripplegate, pardonably
recalling some of its most successful commissions. This excellent team has
been assiduous in seeking out new, seriously original music, placing fresh
commissions in promising hands, and meanwhile cultivating older styles well
enough to fill historical gaps in the CD repertoire with distinction and
profit. In short, it is a Good Thing with a solid track-record, though the
live audiences last week were keen but small.
The label 'Capricorn' names a fluid personnel. Some of the performers we
heard on Tuesday and Saturday were too young to have been in at the start.
For its adventurous repertoire, anyhow, Capricorn has to field such
variously constituted little bands that it has only a few 'core' members to
fix its identity. Perhaps the longest-serving souls, and certainly the
dominant musicians, are the clarinet, cello and piano (Anthony Lamb, Timothy
Mason, Catherine Edwards) - three-quarters of what Messiaen required for his
Quatuor pour la fin du temps, which prompted the formation of Capricorn in
the first place.
Among the Capricorn commissions here, going back to 1985, were Edison
Denisov's winds-and-strings Sextet, coolly and intricately contrapuntal in
strictly equal voices, none standing out; and James Ellis's quizzical,
picturesque Mountain Steps, of which we heard just three-fifths - it has
been 'fundamentally recomposed' but not finished yet. For The Nervous
Saurian, inspired by a Danish science-fiction novel about wise lizards,
Anders Nordentoft made imaginative use of the same trio - the 'core' players
 -as Nigel Osborne's new Sarajevo, a heartfelt letter of condolence which
sticks to time-honoured modes of registering grave feeling.
Neither of those had the kick of Gerald Barry's rumbustious Piano Quartet,
which Capricorn premiered in 1992. 'Wholly concerned with melody,' Barry
claims; in fact it is a furious confection of slightly out-of-synch folk
music echoes, presumably Irish, insistently lively, with a forceful surge.
By comparison, Birtwistle's Clarinet Quintet sounded scrupulously worked out
but staid. Magnus Lindberg's recent Quintet charged the same ensemble with
continuous palpable energy, brilliantly engineered and calculated as is his
wont. The unabashed star is the clarinet, manically fluent in generating
fresh ideas, leaving the strings to pick up the pieces and reassemble them
elegantly.
Each Capricorn concert set itself a high standard by starting with one of
Elliott Carter's recent hommages to friends and colleagues. I heard the 1984
Riconoscenza for violin (Rebecca Hirsch) and the 1990 Con leggerezza pensosa
for the 'core' trio here, and marvelled again at the lucid density Carter
achieves for every passing event. Within a few minutes we get a whole,
cogent epic, each laconic episode stamped with speaking character such as
only a past-master can contrive.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Arts: New plays of lesbian love / Review of the Humana
festival in Louisville
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The American obsession with 'otherness' was on prominent display at the
recent 18th annual Humana Festival of New American Plays. Nearly all the
festival's 10 plays, presented at the Actors' Theatre of Louisville, spun
off of some socio-political issue - lesbian and gay issues being the most
common concern. A tone of politically correct sanctimony was averted by the
high overall artistic standards. While the festival lacked an outstanding
success - Tony Kushner's Slavs], expected to fill that bill, proved a
disappointment - the general quality of the plays and the adventurousness of
the programming were an advance on previous festivals.
Slavs] (Thinking about the Longstanding Problems of Virtue and Happiness),
is Kushner's first play since the international success of his Pulitzer
Prize-winning epic Angels in America. The new play partly comprises scenes
cut from Perestroika, Angels' second half. While full of freshly comic
scenarios and his trademark dazzling flights of prose, Slavs] is more a
disjointed grab-bag of scenes than a fully realised play. Its first scenes,
schtick-laden sketches in which ageing apparatchiks literally politic
themselves to death, are funny but forgettable. The play's real interest
kicks in when we meet Katherina (Kate Goehring), an idealist cursing her way
through a functionary's job, and her lover Bonfila (Mary Schultz), a
paediatric oncologist. Exiled to Siberia, Bonfila encounters an outbreak of
radiation sickness and in the play's most effective, final scenes, we follow
a young victim to heaven.
Kushner's engagement in these last scenes is clear, but his earnestness
mingles uncertainly with the broadly comic tone of the play's first half.
Lisa Peterson directs with pace and a flair for the broadly theatrical
gesture, but the production is hindered by weak acting among the older male
performers. Schultz and Goehring, however, are first-rate.
Kushner's play was performed in a double bill with Trip's Cinch by Phyllis
Nagy, an American playwright living in London whose Butterfly Kiss recently
premiered at the Almeida. Trip's Cinch is similar in tone and theme to David
Mamet's Oleanna and inspired by the William Kennedy Smith and Mike Tyson
date rape cases. Plays such as this, and the issues they are meant to
inform, are fuelled by ambiguity, but Nagy's drama lays it on too thick.
With so few clues given to the audience about how to interpret the events on
stage, our reaction is less prurient fascination than indifference.
The festival's most effective production, Wendy Hammond's Julie Johnson, is
impressive less for any innovations in theatrical form than for the
freshness of Hammond's voice and a remarkable performance by Lily Knight as
the title character, a working-class wife and mother who decides she
'doesn't want to be stupid no more'.
She kicks out her husband, enrols in night classes, and discovers a passion
for computers and for her best friend, a coffee shop waitress. The dilemma
the women face in reconciling their new-found sexual identity with the
restrictive standards of their community is compelling and, eventually,
moving.
For all its emotional credibility, Julie Johnson never departs from the
formulaic structure of a television movie-of-the-week, a weakness which
director Jon Jory counteracts with an aggressively theatrical production -
black-garbed stagehands move pieces of scenery on and off stage; rock music
blares during set changes.
Humana's annual presentation of 10-minute plays, a disappointment at past
festivals, found life in the genre this year. Jane Anderson's The Last Time
We Saw Her is a little bombshell of precise naturalism. A young
businesswoman tells her boss that she is gay and that she wants her
co-workers to know about it. The ensuing conversation turns quietly ugly,
but just who is in the wrong?
Susan Miller's My Left Breast is a part-confessional, part-inspirational
autobiographical monologue covering Miller's breast cancer and a difficult
break-up with a female lover. While Miller's good humour and bravery are
remarkable - there are few women around, for better or worse, who would be
willing to expose a mastectomy scar to a roomful of strangers - her message,
that we must bear the good with the bad, is hardly new.
The festival's most stylistically adventurous offering was 1969, a
collaboration between director/writer Tina Landau and seven young
performers. A collage of songs, dialogue, speeches, and movement, 1969 is an
attempt to evoke both the universal pains and rewards of growing up, and to
capture the mood of the late 1960s in middle America. Landau directs and the
cast performs with precision and passion, but the plot is too predictable -
nerdy high school senior realises he's gay and runs off to an idealised New
York - and the writing seldom rises above the banal.
High production values are among the Humana Festival's traditional
pleasures; set designer Paul Owen, who has designed nearly every play in
festival history, is an unsung genius of American theatre. Another of the
Festival's delights is its community spirit - a relief for the jaded big
city theatregoer and a reminder of the values that inspired the regional
theatre movement and keep it alive.

Duke Ellington, a giant of jazz, is the giant of the evening's viewing. An
Emmy Award winning American documentary by Robert S. Levi starts tonight in
the Omnibus slot (BBC 1, 10.55) and ends next week. More than 40 of
Ellington's 1,500 compositions are on the soundtrack and the programme
includes rare footage of the pianist and band leader in action. Although
Ellington died 20 years ago, the film is too discreet. It is a pity that the
problems faced by a black band leader on the road in the States in the 1930s
and 1940s are not investigated.
Sir Donald Wolfit was the last of the great actor managers. His acting style
owed more to the 19th century greats than the method school and today he is
usually dismissed as the meatiest of ham. In Without Walls (Channel 4, 9pm),
Ned Sherrin attempts to rescue Sir Donald's reputation, and praises his
touring of the provinces with his company, bringing the classics to the
people.
In the second half of this always intriguing programme, Lesbians Unclothed,
Camille Paglia criticises lesbians who take themselves too seriously.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Arts: Paris goes Dutch - William Packer visits an exhibition
of 20th century art from the Low Countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
La beaute exacte is hardly an exact title for what is yet a fascinating
exhibition full of beautiful and exciting things. Its subtitle, from Van
Gogh to Mondrian, gives something rather more of its scope, but there again
the inference is misleading, partial, imprecise.
Van Gogh indeed is there, but only as a presiding and iconic figure,
represented solely in a self-portrait, in a grey hat, of 1887. And in a show
that is one of a pair specifically addressed to the art of the Low Countries
in the 20th century, Van Gogh's presence itself is somewhat equivocal.
Certainly there are formal connections to the other artists to be made, if
only in the general foreshadowing of expressionism - the clarity and
intensity of the colour, the staccato energy of the brushstrokes, with each
mark a distinct beat in the total statement. There too is the sheer symbolic
force of the image itself, personal and tragic as we know with hindsight its
implications to be. Yet Van Gogh spent the later and infinitely more
productive half of his short career abroad, and was dead by 1890. The
position he holds in relation to French painting of the 1880s is obvious and
unquestioned. Quite how well his work was known in Holland within the first
few years of his death is another question altogether.
The real starting point of the exhibition is the pointillist yet moodily
symbolic landscape of 1889 by the lesser-known painter, Jan Toorop, a view
across the canals and low fields of the Waterland at sunset, with shadowy
figures in a boat in the foreground. It is a work that embraces all that the
exhibition as a whole will offer: on the one hand, the formal simplicity and
rigour which Mondrian in particular will take to the limits of pure and
minimal abstraction; on the other, the symbolist and emotional content,
shades of the workers in the fields of Millet and Van Gogh, which will lead
to the heightened realism of the Dutch figurative painters of the early 20th
century whom we come to later. It is this duality, given the apparent
precise simplicity of the exhibition's title, that comes as the surprise.
That said, it is Mondrian who remains the central figure and hero of the
show. While Toorop veers sharply off at a tangent into bizarre fin-de-siecle
graphic symbolism, Mondrian stays with the landscape of sea and dune, tree
and church tower, that grows ever more simple and rarefied while losing
nothing of its mystical, symbolic charge. Such mystical significance
remained as the informing justification of all he did, no matter that by the
mid-1910s, under the obscure philosophisings of neo-plasticity, his painting
had moved away from anything even remotely representational in its reference
 -nothing more than lines and grids and squares of colour. The magnificent
sequence of paintings and drawings in the first main room, that takes us
from the trees and canals of around 1900 through the sea and dunescapes to
the fragmented, quasi-cubist trees and towers of around 1913, is alone worth
the visit. With the rational, abstract developments of his next 30 years to
follow in the later rooms, set into the context of the work of the de Stilj
group in general and such as Bart van der Leck and Theo van Doesburg in
particular, the show is irresistible.
But between de Stilj constructivism in its origins and later pomp comes a
quite separate body of work, and with it the show's greatest surprise. For
here, as complement and counter-point to Mondrian and his associates, are
those Dutch realists of the 1920s and 1930s, colleagues at a remove of the
Neue Sachlikeit in Germany in particular, and realist contemporaries
everywhere, with their peculiarly heightened and febrile, all but surreal,
clarity of image, and their uncompromising honesty. We are back at once to
Van Gogh in his self-image at the show's beginning, and it is hardly by
chance that each painter of this later group is represented by self-portrait
after self-portrait, rows of them.
All are remarkable artists, and their still comparative obscurity merely
confirms the rule that even in our supposedly international age, national
schools of art, not just in England but everywhere, remain too much the
province of a merely national, even parochial interest. Dick Ket, Pyke Koch
and Jan Mankes are fine painters by any measure, their work beautifully
made, intense in feeling and properly of its time. They are long overdue
their place on a wider critical stage. But most remarkable of them all is
Charley Toorop, daughter of Jan Toorop and an English mother, Annie Hall.
Her sequence of self-portraits, some of monumental scale and as strong and
simple in the statement as in the vision, surely mark her out as one of the
most important, albeit hardly rated, female artists of her time.
'La beaute exacte: de van Gogh a Mondrian'. Musee d'Art moderne de la Ville
de Paris, 11 avenue du President-Wilson, Paris 16, until July 17.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Arts: Native Czech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While Prague's two opera companies show waning enthusiasm for the native
repertoire, there is still plenty of Czech music to be heard in the city's
lovely concert halls, much of it little known in the West. Two recent
programmes found the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra tackling works by Vorisek
and Novak, and the Prague Symphony accompanying a mass by Ilja Hurnik
(b1922). Both were well attended and warmly received by local concert-goers,
suggesting that the tourist market does not yet have a monopoly on all
cultural life in the Czech capital.
The most rewarding discovery was Hurnik's Missa Vinea Crucis, premiered two
years ago with organ accompaniment. Hurnik's music is well established in
the Czech Republic and deserves a wider reputation. The Mass is a tonal
work, clean-textured and full of subtle harmonic modulations, drawing its
inspiration from Hurnik's north Moravian folk roots and the Janacek-Martinu
tradition, rather than the glum postwar school of Czech modernism.
The opening Kyrie, a pure pastoral air, sets an optimistic tone. The Gloria,
Credo and Sanctus include spiky interjections for chamber orchestra (no
brass), while the Agnus captures some of the otherworldly atmosphere of
Messiaen's L'Ascension. The final Deo gratias has a lively rhythmic pull.
The 80-strong Permonik Children's Chorus, which commissioned the work, sang
without blemish, but could have added more bite. This luxurious opener to
the Prague Symphony Orchestra's concert in the Smetana Hall was followed by
an inspired account of Shostakovich's First Cello Concerto by Frans
Helmerson and Debussy's La Mer. Martin Turnovsky conducted all three with
idiomatic flair.
Hurnik was one of the many composition pupils of Vitezslav Novak
(1870-1949), whose own music has been well represented in the Czech
Philharmonic's programmes this season. I heard the song cycle Valley of the
New Kingdom for baritone and orchestra (1903), based on a text by Antonin
Sova. It is infused with impressionist touches, late Romantic colours and
lyrical poetry, and it could have made a kind of Czech Sea Pictures, if the
four songs had not been so short - a mere 13 minutes. The music found a
heroic upper extension in Ivan Kusnjer's lusty voice. Oliver Dohnanyi,
making his Czech Philharmonic debut in the Dvorak Hall, conducted a robust
account of Vorisek's D major Symphony, and ended the programme with Dvorak's
Symphonic Variations, infused with all the tonal bloom and beauty for which
Czech orchestras are renowned.

FT  03 MAY 94 / The People Page: Gambling with the big prize - David White
examines the record of Banco Santander's Emilio Botn, the victor in the
contest for control of Banesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emilio Botn almost missed the boat. On the night the chairman of Banco
Santander won the bidding to take control of Banco Espanol de Credito
(Banesto) from Spain's 'bank hospital', the Deposit Guarantee Fund, he
forgot to sign the crucial bid document. The announcement of the verdict on
Spain's biggest takeover was held up by an agonising extra hour.
The runner-up in the auction, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, considered using the
omission to challenge the decision on technical grounds.
It had reason to be peeved.
Not only had it been thwarted in its long-time ambition to become the
dominant force in Spanish banking. It also faced the prospect of losing
high-flying executives, on temporary loan to Banesto during the rescue
operation, who would now be poached by the new owner.
Overnight the 59-year-old Botn has become Spain's top banker. The combined
group, according to its own calculations, ranks number 22 in Europe and 45
in the world in total assets.
But Banco Santander's Dollars 2bn investment in Banesto is a big bite. With
a branch network two and a half times as big as Banco Santander's, Banesto
was for many years the country's biggest financial institution, the
archetypal establishment bank of the Franco regime, remaining staid, stuffy
and impenetrable for years afterwards.
In its most recent phase, with a jaunty new logo and an aggressive lending
policy, it got itself into deep trouble. A Dollars 3.7bn rescue operation
was required to put the mammoth back on its feet. While Banco Santander has
already divested almost all its industrial shareholdings, Banesto still has
a mish-mash of interests to be got rid of before it becomes an orthodox
commercial bank.
For Botn, the acquisition marks a change of approach. At the end of the
1980s, while other leading Spanish banks sought mergers as the most obvious
means of bringing themselves more into line with the dimensions of big banks
in other European countries, Botn stood aloof, preferring to build up
Santander's own business.
Far from being a buyer, he sold off smaller 'second brand' banks belonging
to the group. But he is believed to have had eyes on Banesto for some time.
And he clearly saw the auction of the restructured bank as a chance he could
not refuse.
'We have spent years storing up capital to be able to take advantage of
opportunities, peseta by peseta, patiently, prudently' - which is how be
believe things should be done in banking.
In Spanish, there are two words for banker. A 'bancario' is someone who
works in banking. A 'banquero' is someone who runs a bank. Botn - full name
Emilio Botn-Sanz de Sautuola y Garcia de los Ros - was born a 'banquero'.
The family pedigree is unique in Spanish business. His grandfather Emilio
Botn was the first permanent chairman of the bank, which had been set up in
Santander in the 1850s to finance transatlantic trade flowing through the
northern Spanish port. His father, also Emilio Botn, who took over when it
was still very much a provincial bank, oversaw its expansion further afield
during a 36-year reign as chairman.
The statue to him in the bank's headquarters on the Santander waterfront was
erected by grateful shareholders long before he was ready to leave the job.
Until his death last year, the father was still referred to as Don Emilio.
The new chairman continued to be known as 'the son'.
After studying law and economics at Valladolid and the Jesuit Deusto
university in Bilbao, he joined the bank at 24, working at a local branch.
But two years later he was already a director. When his father finally made
way for him in 1986 he set about strengthening the bank's balance sheet,
bolstering its provisions against loan risks - especially in Latin America -
and widening its customer base.
A pioneer in offering interest-bearing 'super-accounts', Banco Santander
moved up from fifth or sixth place among the country's private commercial
banks to number three.
It became a shareholder of Royal Bank of Scotland and First Fidelity in the
US and built up an international reputation for innovation - in fields such
as telephone banking - and the dynamism of its merchant banking arm,
recently renamed Santander Investment.
So why this move? The way it was going, in Botn's view, the group would soon
have been predominantly geared to foreign business - already accounting for
more than 40 per cent of its profits - and investment banking. It needed to
redress the balance by increasing its weight in the Spanish market. Banesto,
in many backwoods areas of Spain the only bank in town, would do the trick.
Some people in Banco Santander harbour private qualms about the challenge
the group has taken on, and about the price it is paying. But Botn claims
the price is 'absolutely reasonable' and shrugs off the negative impact the
deal has had on Banco Santander's own shares.
In a bank otherwise noted for its transparency, the degree of family control
is a mystery. Little is known about the full extent of the family fortune.
According to its annual report, the combined shareholdings of the family
foundation, which is the largest institutional shareholder, and Botns on the
board - including brother Jaime, who heads the associated Bankinter - come
to less than 3.5 per cent. But nobody has any doubt about who runs the bank.
Two of Botn's six children are directors - Ana Patricia, 33, and the next
Emilio Botn, 30. Either could be in line for the succession.
The family's discretion is legendary. Botn's wife is a concert pianist,
Paloma O'Shea, but otherwise little is known about his private life except
that he travels a lot and plays golf when he finds time. According to one
person in the bank's inner circle, 'nobody gets close to Botn'.
In Santander neither the family nor the bank needs to advertise their
presence; it is pervasive. However, if one were to ask in the world at large
who was Santander's most famous living son, the answer might not be Botn but
the golfer Severiano Ballesteros. But then Botn is Ballesteros'
father-in-law.
When he was promoted to the chairmanship of the bank 7 1/2 years ago, with a
solid record as managing director but still very much in the shadow of Don
Emilio the father, other bankers in Madrid reserved their judgment on how he
would prove himself in the position. 'Now they know,' said a colleague at
the bank last week.

FT  03 MAY 94 / People: Bergougnoux to run a railway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Having helped restore financial health to Electricite de France, the state
energy utility, Jean Bergougnoux is to take up a similarly formidable
challenge at SNCF, the French national railway system, writes John Ridding.
Jacques Fournier, SNCF's current chairman, will step down after the opening
of the Channel Tunnel, at the age of 65. The government has picked
Bergougnoux, managing director of EDF since 1987, to step into his shoes.
Bergougnoux, 54, is an engineering graduate of the prestigious Ecole Poly-
technique. He has built his career in the public sector and in particular at
EDF, which he joined in 1970, earning a reputation as a skilful manager in
both labour relations and financial affairs.
Number two to Gilles Menage, chairman of EDF, Bergougnoux has for the past
seven years been responsible for the day-to-day running of the company. He
played a significant role in returning the group to profit at the end of the
1980s and reducing debt which, at FFr213bn in 1984, was equivalent to 27 per
cent of sales.
His new task is equally daunting. The principal challenge facing Bergougnoux
lies in the financial situation of the railway company; last year it
suffered losses of FFr7.71bn and a rise in its debts to more than FFr150bn.
The new SNCF head must also try to win back passengers disenchanted by a
series of marketing and technical blunders. Socrates, the computerised
reservation system, was afflicted by technical problems following its
introduction at the beginning of last year and contributed, along with
recession, to an 8 per cent fall in passenger traffic.
Labour relations at SNCF are also delicate. Fournier's attempts to increase
efficiency by establishing separate divisions and more decentralised
management have yielded positive results but have also drawn strikes and
stoppages by workers.

FT  03 MAY 94 / People: Pannonplast's Feher ahead of the pack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Europe's communist economies produced few great managers, writes
Nicholas Denton. Nor, despite official lip service to sexual equality, did
the former Soviet bloc allow many women to rise to the top in business. But
there are exceptions, and Erzsebet Feher, managing director of Hungarian
plastics group Pannonplast, is one.
Under her leadership, Pannonplast was an east bloc pioneer in the 1980s; it
took up World Bank credits and set up joint ventures with western
manufacturers. And this week the company completes its privatisation:
Ft1.83bn (Dollars 18m) worth of Pannonplast shares are on offer to foreign
institutional investors and the Hungarian public. 'She's always been ahead
of the pack,' says an investment banker who has worked closely with her.
While westerners often make a hobby of complaining about Hungarian managers,
they swoon before Feher. Advisers break off from moaning about the tedium
and uselessness of meetings in Hungary to marvel about the amount of ground
they can cover with Feher.
Feher finds the acclaim all rather embarrassing. A genuinely modest person,
she is far happier talking about her company than herself. Pressed to reveal
what makes her tick, Feher reluctantly ventures her sporting background. Now
58, she played ping-pong for Hungary's national youth team and says it may
have inculcated discipline and a fighting spirit.
She is less proud of her gender. Indeed, Feher seems to agree with Hungarian
male attitudes towards businesswomen; they can be petty, she says, and poor
at seeing the big picture. But it only takes a meeting or two, Feher says,
before male negotiating partners see that she is not like that.

FT  03 MAY 94 / People: Happy time for Keehn to step down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Silas Keehn, tall, and much more youthful looking than his 64 years, is
stepping down as President of Chicago's Federal Reserve Bank with the same
kind of statesmanship that characterises the 13 years he has spent
ministering to the financial health of America's heartland, writes Laurie
Morse. 'This seems a very good time for a transition,' Keehn says. 'Happily,
things are going right. Bank reserves are adequate (after a difficult period
in 1990 and 1991) and the economy is doing well, particularly in the
midwest.'
The Chicago Fed's voice in US monetary policy, in the form of a vote on the
Federal Open Market Committee, rotates every other year with the Cleveland
Reserve Bank. Thus, Keehn says, if his successor is appointed this summer,
the new appointee will have time to get to know the system before Chicago
gets the vote again in 1995.
With Keehn's departure, the Fed will lose a monetary policy moderate. While
circumspect in his public pronouncements, Keehn has a reputation for keeping
a balanced view of the trade-offs between inflation and economic growth.
Having spent 23 years at Pittsburgh's Mellon Bank before joining the Fed,
Keehn has a banker's view of policy.
The Chicago Reserve Bank, one of 12 nationwide, serves Illinois, Iowa,
Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin, an area that encompasses an unusual mix of
agriculture, manufacturing, and financial services.
Keehn's successor will be appointed by the board of directors of the Chicago
Federal Reserve Bank, which has organised a search committee. Although the
search is expected to take several months, James Annable, chief economist at
First National Bank of Chicago, is thought to top the list of potential
candidates.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Business Travel: Virgin still holding out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business travellers have been promised greater competition on the
London-Johannesburg route for almost three years. Mr Richard Branson's UK
carrier, Virgin Atlantic, applied to compete with the present carriers in
1991. Since then he has launched a service to Hong Kong and next month
starts flying to San Francisco, while Johannesburg remains just an
intention, writes Daniel Green.
The London-Johannesburg route is precisely the kind of business over which
Virgin likes to fight. As with Hong Kong and San Francisco, there have been
two main carriers, British Airways and South African Airways, each making a
lot of money. The unrestricted business class return fare can be Pounds
2,639.
Virgin blames its inability to get the suitable slots at Heathrow for the
delay in starting the services. It also acknowledges that uncertainty over
change in South Africa has made other routes a priority.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Business Travel: Shuttling into Kennedy - The increase of
JFK/Heathrow flights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From this summer, British Airways will no longer offer the most frequent
service between London's Heathrow and New York's John F Kennedy airports.
Within a month, American Airlines is to increase its daily flights on the
route from four to six, overtaking BA's five. Of those BA flights, only
three are by standard aircraft; the others are Pounds 5,000-a-seat Concorde
trips.
And within two weeks of American's move, its great rival, United Airlines,
will increase its daily Heathrow-JFK flights from three to four.
Other significant carriers on the route are Virgin Atlantic, with a
twice-daily service, and Kuwait Airways and Air India, with one each.
That makes 19 flights a day between the two airports. Moreover, BA and
Virgin have daily flights to Newark airport, closer to Manhattan than JFK
but in the neighbouring state of New Jersey.
The elevation of the Heathrow-New York route to the status of business
shuttle is a result mainly of the economic recovery, say American and
United.
Frequency of service appeals to business travellers more than to tourists.
Business executives are more likely to fly on an airline that has a lot of
flights: if the meeting goes on an extra half hour, the executive knows
there will be another flight home soon.
For United, the decision to emphasise frequency of service, rather than size
of aircraft, has led them to employ one of the smallest aircraft available
for such a journey. 'The route consists largely of point-to-point traffic
and we decided that the best method was to use the smaller Boeing 767-200s,
flying more frequently,' according to a United spokesman.
United's early flight from London - at 0755 the first of the day to JFK - is
especially popular among business travellers, and has tempted American to
introduce its own early flight at 0830. The business traveller is an
extraordinarily lucrative customer to secure. The normal business class
return fare between London and New York is about Pounds 2,200, almost 10
times the cheapest Apex economy fare.
Because of the congestion at Heathrow, an airline cannot easily secure
additional take-off slots. American Airlines is, therefore, sacrificing
services to tourist-type destinations, such as Los Angeles and Miami, to
increase its Heathrow-JFK frequency.
American is, however, not increasing its daily flights from other European
cities such as Paris, Brussels, Zurich - where economic recovery is yet to
make itself strongly felt.
BA says it is unworried by the increasing competition on flights to JFK. It
still considers the route 'blue chip'. But BA says that, since it took a
stake in USAir, it has been keen to link transatlantic passengers with
USAir's huge domestic network. That means it is adding flights to large
USAir hub cities, such as Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Charlotte, and
Baltimore.
BA can also take some comfort from the fact that the rise in frequencies
does not mean quite as sharp an increase in the number of available seats.
BA flies the route with 380-seat Boeing 747s. Most of the US-owned aircraft,
on the other hand, are the smaller Boeing 767s, which carry only between
between 164 and 214 passengers, or McDonnell Douglas MD-11s, carrying 271
people. Moreover, passengers in a hurry are also likely to factor into their
choice the fact that the 767s take about 20 minutes longer than the MD-11s
and 747s.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Business Travel (Update): French skies are opened up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission's ruling last Wednesday that France must allow
competition on several routes from Orly airport to the south of France
raises the prospect of more convenient, and cheaper, travel to French
destinations. The Commission said that France must immediately open a route
from London Heathrow to Orly and must allow TAT European airlines  - 49 per
cent owned by British Airways - to compete with Air Inter, Air France's
domestic subsidiary, on the Orly-Toulouse and Orly-Marseilles routes after a
six month grace period.
British Airways hopes to start services between Heathrow and Orly in June.
Since most domestic French flights operate from Orly, it would provide
access to a valuable hub for French holiday and business destinations.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Business Travel: A monopoly dismantled / A look at the
proliferation of carriers servicing routes to South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As South Africa prepares for its first freely elected government, and
memories of trade sanctions recede, growing numbers of business travellers
are boarding 11-hour flights from Europe to Johannesburg.
This is of great satisfaction to airlines flying the route. The
Johannesburg-London air corridor is one of the most lucrative in the world.
It is less pleasing to travellers; complaints about the cost of flying to
Johannesburg are common. But while the current R9,000 (Pounds 1,670) fare
for a business class return ticket from London to Johannesburg is not cheap,
in real terms it used to be lot more expensive.
Until a few years ago, air travel both to and in South Africa was a closed
shop. South African Airways ran a virtual monopoly on domestic flights and,
with a few selected international partners, an effective cartel on overseas
routes.
Three years ago, however, the government relaxed the rules on international
carriers, allowing for price competition and new entrants.
Most fares have dropped steeply, but not so precipitously as to threaten
route profitability. Yet it remains slightly more expensive than some
comparable longer routes, such as London to Sydney.
But shopping around for lower fares can pay off, as some discount centres
offer business fares as low as R5,428.
Better deals are also available through airlines such as Sabena and Air
France, which often offer slightly more reasonable fares with free transfers
to London. Cheapest of all are carriers such as Egyptair and Kenya Airways,
although with the inconveniences of stopovers in Cairo or Nairobi.
One future option will probably be Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Airways,
which has been trying for several years to get a foothold in the market.
Once in Johannesburg, it is possible to take direct flights to big cities
worldwide. The number of international airlines flying to and from South
Africa has risen to 58 since deregulation. The rapid increase in the number
of carriers is most striking in traffic with Asia, which is now serviced by
four airlines in addition to SAA.
Internally, the menu of flight choices is limited. A cosy SAA monopoly,
during which it routinely raised fares about 12 per cent a year, was broken
up with the arrival of competitor Flitestar in 1991. With some assistance
from the government, Flitestar eventually carved out a 30 per cent market
share, largely from business travellers.
To the dismay of the flying public, however, this experiment in competition
came to a sudden halt three weeks ago when Flitestar folded.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Blue blood and the
entrepreneur - Richard Gourlay tells the unlikely tale of how a pair of
business partners found each other
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Aird raised the cash to buy his first stake in a company by
investing his tuition fees for Harvard Business School in the Kansas City
wheat market. Ten years later his next investment had an equally improbable
beginning. Sir John, who was born to the son of the then Prince of Wales's
equerry in the grounds of Windsor Castle, backed Ivan Semenenko, a Ukrainian
who spent his first seven years behind barbed wire in a displaced persons
camp in Kiel.
The two met through the pages of the Henley-on-Thames-based Venture Capital
Report, an agency that brings together business angels like Sir John and
entrepreneurs like Semenenko.
A taciturn and true blue-blooded aristocrat, Sir John's background is
unlikely to be typical of the 600 angels on VCR's books. But then VCR says
there are few common characteristics other than a taste for risk and
building businesses.
In the case of Sir John, he had always wanted to work for himself and
inherited an interest in engineering from his great grandfather, a famous
19th-century contractor who built the Aswan Dam in Egypt. He applied to
Harvard while designing dams in the Sudan when he decided to move into
management from pure engineering. After Harvard he returned to the UK flush
with his gains from the commodity markets and briefly worked for John Laing,
the building company.
This was the springboard for his first investment in a small south London
builder - probably the only London repair and maintenance company run by a
Harvard MBA.
'I saw it as a safe but unspectacular business that would provide steady
cash flow,' Sir John says. 'I have always believed in trying to finance
growth out of cash profits.'
Sixteen years later in 1986, when Sir John sold the business, sales of
Pounds 100,000 had grown to Pounds 2.5m.
By that time Sir John had spread his wings, investing in Matcon, the company
Semenenko had started and was running out of a borrowed room in the
Cotswolds town of Chipping Norton.
Semenenko had founded the company in 1980 to develop a novel vibrating cone
valve that activated and controlled the discharge of powders and granules
from storage silos. The product was on the market but commercially unproven
with sales of about Pounds 30,000 when Sir John came on the scene in 1981.
He invested Pounds 30,000 - a third in equity, the rest as a loan - in
return for half the equity. 'I didn't realise I needed the cash, though in
hindsight I did,' says Semenenko. 'I did realise I needed some help with
business and financial skills.'
'He had recognised there needed to be a change of direction,' says Sir John.
'I enabled the original idea to become a reality.'
The investment also allowed Matcon to extend the application to process
industries that needed to handle powdered material in batch production.
Sir John says he was a very active investor in the early days, spending a
great deal of time installing management systems, setting up the production
facilities, establishing the marketing infrastructure, and advising on
financial and cash flow planning.
Many observers of informal venture capital investing say this kind of
management participation is as valuable to entrepreneurs as the cash,
although it irks some founders to have to accept outside advice.
As Matcon grew - it now has annual sales of more than Pounds 14m - Sir John
has cut the time he devotes to the business as part-time chairman to a few
days a week and is again seeking new investment opportunities.
Sir John has a number of self-imposed investment guidelines. He must be
impressed by the people he is backing, interested in their product and they
must be based close to his home. He tends to avoid pure start-ups.
In addition, he says he likes to leave the managing partner with as much of
the equity as he or she can afford to take. 'It makes the whole process more
worthwhile.'
What is most surprising, given the many stories told by indignant
entrepreneurs, is that he is not hung up on having a controlling stake. At
Matcon, Sir John has 50 per cent. 'He was the only one who did not want 51
per cent,' says Semenenko.
'I feel having control is irrelevant,' Sir John says. 'The entrepreneur
always effectively has control whatever percentage of the stock is his. An
investor can only really exert negative control - you can forbid or prevent
but it is difficult to be pro-active without the co-operation of the
entrepreneur'.
And irrespective of the percentage of shares held, the investor can exert
control by specifying that his consent must be sought before any changes in
company strategy, capital expenditure, gearing or executive compensation.
Having established his guidelines, Sir John promptly went against two of
them. His next investment after Matcon was in a nursing home company called
Dalecare. It was a start-up and he did not have an intrinsic interest in
running a business looking after elderly people. But he liked the founder
and invested Pounds 100,000 anyway, taking the deal to 3i, the UK's biggest
venture capital supplier.
Three years later and after three homes had been successfully developed, Sir
John sold to Associated Nursing Services, the then quoted group.
Since then he has invested, also via VCR, in a London and Shanghai-based
company called Chance China that represents western companies in China and
Chinese companies in the west. Some two thirds of the Pounds 200,000 he paid
for 50 per cent of the equity is in interest-bearing loan notes which have
first call on any profits.
And then there is the one that went wrong. 'The one bad one should have been
the best - it had everything going for it,' he says. The company, Mogul
Leisure Products, made ski-training machines which had been pre-sold to
Thomas Cook, the tour operator, which was offering its clients lessons if
they bought a holiday.
'I was interested in the product, the company was on my door-step, the sales
were assured,' says Sir John. He could even make them using spare capacity
at the Matcon factory. What neither he nor the entrepreneur had spotted was
that the business plan made no allowance for servicing and teaching Thomas
Cook staff how to use the product. All the profits were consumed by the cost
of supporting the customer and Sir John closed the company.
Whether typical of other angels - a term he dislikes because he is motivated
almost entirely by profit - Sir John sets clear investment targets. 'I need
a better return on capital than in the City,' he says. 'I am very depressed
by the performance of so-called professional investment managers and am
shocked by the way they regard matching the index as a standard of
acceptable investment performance,' he says.
While he has sold companies in which he successfully invested, Sir John does
not actively seek investments and at Matcon is happy to let the managing
partner develop the business. 'I certainly see a substantial regular
dividend as just as valid a return as a sale,' he says. Too many good deals
are not backed because the exit route is not clear.
For those deals that go right, the dividends can be substantial. If he
invests Pounds 150,000, one third as equity, he would expect to receive an
annual dividend equal to 100 per cent of that equity after three or four
years. There again, investing in a bad business plan or the wrong person and
the loans quickly become equity and can evaporate at an alarming rate. Just
as fast as his Harvard fees could have disappeared in the Kansas City wheat
market.

The May Day bank holiday came at a particularly sensitive time for the
economy. Large parts of the working population have just received their
April pay details, confirming the damage done to their disposable income by
the last two tax-raising Budgets.
For a deeply unpopular government pinning its hopes on economic recovery, it
is crucially important that these consumers should shrug off the bad news
and keep on spending. In coming weeks FT writers will keep close track of
emerging trends among retailers, leisure operators, the motor trade, finance
houses and the rest of the consumer economy.
Early indications are ambiguous. In some areas, there is worry that the
downturn may have happened already - that some consumers, alerted by media
publicity to the scale of the forthcoming tax rises, may have reined back
their spending in early spring.
Some will have been less provident, and their first shrunken pay slip will
come as a corresponding shock. But not everyone will have received the news
yet. Smaller companies tend to be slower at processing wages, especially in
April when details must also be compiled on the past tax year.
For the bulk of the population money is still tight. The less leeway there
is in the family budget, the more the sums have to be scrutinised.
When it comes to individual consumer industries, the trends reported must be
interpreted with care. The holiday operators, for instance, seem to be
experiencing a distinct upturn in bookings compared with last year. But the
effects of this can be perverse. The more people take their main holiday
abroad this year, the more spending is subtracted from the domestic economy.
Mr Charles Newbold, managing director of Thomson, the largest tour operator,
says that when his company's winter 1994-95 programme went on sale last
Thursday, 35,000 holidays were sold on the first day - double the number
sold on the equivalent day last year.
Retailers, while concerned about an impact on sales, say there has been
little evidence so far of a downturn.
Some retailers said spending fell in February and March as customers
anticipated the tax increases. Mr Barry Dale, chief executive of
Littlewoods, which operates more than 120 chain stores, as well as the Index
catalogue shop chain and the UK's second-largest mail-order business, said
sales had fallen significantly.
He believed this was partly due to customers transferring savings out of
building society accounts to pay fuel bills early and avoid value added tax.
Other retailers, such as clothing groups Sears and Next, which reported
results recently, said trading was still positive. Argos, the catalogue
retailer, said sales had not been damaged by tax increases, but it was
prepared for a downturn. 'If it doesn't (happen), that will be a bonus,' the
company said.
John Lewis Partnership, which operates 22 department stores and 107 Waitrose
supermarkets, said it had seen no evidence of a fall in sales.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Growth in sales of new cars slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growth in new-car sales has slowed during April from the strong pace set
in the first three months of the year.
The car industry is still unclear, however, whether the market is simply
drawing breath after the unexpectedly firm start to the year.
'We could not forecast what the tax increases would do to consumer demand,
and it is still too hard to read,' Mr Paddy Byrne, sales director for Ford
of Britain, said yesterday.
'My personal hunch is that there has perhaps been a short-term reaction, but
it may be a 45 to 60-day wonder as people reassess their income.'
Ford estimates new-car registrations have grown by about 5 per cent
year-on-year in April, which would be the slowest rate for several months.
In the first three months of the year new-car sales - at 529,436 - were 16.8
per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year, a rate of growth
well ahead of the industry's most optimistic forecasts for the year.
On the evidence of reports from key Ford dealers throughout Britain, Mr
Byrne said the pattern of demand remained patchy. 'It is like talking to
people in different countries. Some were saying that they had had an
interesting increase in retail demand, others said they were having a good
month for sales to fleets.'
Ford was persuaded by the strength of overall demand in the first quarter to
raise its forecast for new-car registrations in the full year to 1.95m, an
increase of nearly 10 per cent on 1993. Any hesitancy in April is not
forcing it to revise this figure downwards.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Shoppers show there is life after the Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Conroys Furniture Centre, set in a retail park by a dual-carriageway near
Sunderland, Securicor delivery man Mr Steven Mee and his wife Teresa are
admiring Shangrila.
The Mees look pleased; after months of searching they have found their
chosen three-piece suite at a price they can afford - Pounds 1,000, less 10
per cent, with three years' interest-free credit.
A new suite was a necessity; their old one had broken. But the long
repayment term - reducing the monthly cost to Pounds 27 - was vital. Mr
Mee's take-home wage - between Pounds 170 and Pounds 200 a week depending on
overtime - has to support the couple, both aged 37, and their two children,
aged six and 10, and bear the burden of Budget increases.
Mr Mee reckons the tax and National Insurance rises will make them Pounds 10
a week worse off but the couple are stoical. 'You still have to carry on
eating and buying the kids clothes,' says Mrs Mee, who is on invalidity
benefit. Her husband adds: 'We don't go to the limit on our spending.'
He was surprised the chancellor imposed so many increases. 'I don't think
people realised how much he changed everything.'
The Mees voted Conservative in the last general election and will next time,
too. 'When we first married Labour was in; inflation was 18 per cent,' says
Mrs Mee. 'It was just one big struggle,' says her husband.
Another big purchase looms. 'We've got to get a new car. We'll have to wait
six months and try to sort something out.'
Conroys, a family-owned business, has three north-east stores. Mr Dave
Darragh, manager of this branch, says business is good. 'I put it down to
aggressive advertising. It's all about deals.' Conroys' May Day special
offer is 10 per cent off everything.
Mr Darragh earns a basic salary plus commission and has a company car. He
knows the Budget will affect him but has not studied his pay slip. 'I can't
do anything about it. I just have to sell more furniture.'
Mr Peter Wallace, from Jarrow, a Pounds 22,000-a-year comprehensive school
science teacher, is waiting while his mother looks for new dining chairs. A
1.5 per cent pay rise this month masked the Budget's full effects, he says.
Mr Wallace is now awaiting his fuel bills. The total rises will determine
whether he and his wife have a touring holi-day in Denmark this summer.
Across the car park at Peter Barratt's Garden Centre, another locally owned
business with three north-east stores, social worker Mrs Kim Delaney, 36, is
looking at plants. She says the increases were partly hidden by an increment
on her salary in April, and the transfer of the married person's allowance
from her husband Kevin, 47, who is retired because of work injuries.
Mrs Delaney's monthly take-home pay rose Pounds 40 in April to Pounds 1,311
 -less than she expected. 'This is the first year for a number of years
we've said we need to save towards a holiday,' says Mr Delaney.
Mrs Delaney fears the effect of value added tax on fuel for poor families
she works with. 'It means people getting into more debt, borrowing off loan
sharks.'
For Pounds 15,000-a-year quantity surveyor Mr Lawrence Inkster, 27, the
Budget increases coincide with his wife's imminent departure from her Pounds
60-a-week part-time job as she is expecting their second child.
Mr Inkster's solution is more overtime. 'I'm lucky to have that chance.'
Mr Peter Bennett, garden centre duty manager, doubts the Budget increases
will prevent customers spending. 'They say 'to hell with it'.'
Conroys' managing director Mr Michael Conroy said it had been a very good
weekend, his stores achieving a turnover 17 per cent up on the same period
last year. Profit was up by a smaller percentage. Turnover at Conroys,
Pounds 8.5m in the year to the end of March, has risen 14 per cent since
January.
Mr Peter Barratt, the garden centres' founder and managing director, said
the weekend weather, a crucial factor, had been favourable - neither wet nor
hot. Turnover, he said, was 7 per cent to 8 per cent up on the same holiday
weekend last year. The increase in profits would be greater, due to tighter
controls on expenses.
Both men believe the recession is over, boosting customers' confidence and
willingness to shrug off tax increases.
Mr Conroy, though still apprehensive about the effects of VAT on fuel, says
'people are determined to make the most of today. The north-east is that
type of area; if they've got money, they'll spend it.'

FT  03 MAY 94 / Credit card use points to squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax and National Insurance increases may already have significantly
depressed spending, according to figures from Barclaycard, which has the
largest share of the UK credit card market.
While any impact since the increase in deductions has yet to show through in
discretionary spending, the amounts spent since the Budget on November 30
have fallen.
Figures for Barclaycard's weekly sales turnover last summer show that
spending using the credit card was running at about 12 per cent higher than
during the same months in 1992.
From December, however, the percentage increase in turnover for each month
against the comparable period the previous year dropped to 6 per cent to 8
per cent.
The amounts processed by Barclaycard on any given day - which reflect
spending in the day or so immediately before - suggest a slight drop when
last week is compared with its equivalent last year.
At the start of the week, spending was about 120 per cent of the 1993 value,
while by Thursday's figures it had slipped to 110 per cent of last year's
figure.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Industrial recovery gains pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic recovery is strengthening, say two reports out today. They
report that manufacturers are increasing output and investment, and the
outlook for new businesses is improving.
A sharp increase in orders and production is reported by the Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply, while the Confederation of British
Industry says employment and investment among small manufacturers should
rise strongly during the next few months.
In a third survey, venture capital group 3i is positive about recovery
prospects, though it says a majority of small companies believe interest
rates will rise during the next year because of the need to combat
inflation.
According to the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, which every
month asks purchasing managers how they see industrial trends, manufacturing
activity increased last month at its fastest rate since the survey began
three years ago.
Improved demand, helped by an increase in marketing activity, led to a large
rise in orders. Delivery times across industry increased significantly
because suppliers were busier.
Stocks of purchases and finished goods fell sharply in April compared with
March. That reflected the success by many manufacturers and suppliers in
shifting products more quickly from their warehouses to customers.
Manufacturing recruitment increased in April for the third successive month.
The report from the CBI, conducted jointly with Pannell Kerr Forster, a
consultancy, also points to brightening economic prospects. Mr John Parsons,
chairman of the CBI's smaller firms council, said it provided more evidence
that small businesses were 'leading the economic recovery'.
Total orders for small manufacturing groups rose sharply last month and are
expected to show a further rise during the summer. More small businesses
than at any time since July 1988 say they will step up spending on plant and
machinery over the next year.

FT  03 MAY 94 / BZW faces B&amp;C writs for Pounds 500m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ernst &amp; Young, administrators to financial services group British &amp;
Commonwealth Holdings which collapsed in 1990, is suing Barclays de Zoete
Wedd, the securities arm of Barclays Bank, for an amount expected to be well
in excess of Pounds 500m.
Writs have been issued against BZW for alleged negligence in advising B&amp;C on
the takeover of Atlantic Computers in August 1988.
The collapse of Atlantic in 1990 was instrumental in dragging down its
parent company. B&amp;C bought Atlantic for Pounds 407m but was subsequently
forced to write off Pounds 550m against the investment.
Although E&amp;Y is not prepared to specify the amount it is seeking to recover
 -a sum which, if it wins the case, will be awarded by the courts - standard
procedure is to recover the cost of acquisition of the company with
interest. The writs have yet to be served.
BZW said it intended 'vigorously to defend these proceedings'. Barclays
Bank, B&amp;C's largest creditor, wrote off Pounds 100m against expected losses
from its lending to B&amp;C in its 1990 accounts. At the time the bank said the
write-off took account of its exposure to the B&amp;C group as a whole,
including Atlantic Computers.
Barclays would not comment yesterday on further action.
It is understood that E&amp;Y is considering taking further legal action against
other parties involved in the takeover. These are understood to be against
NM Rothschild, the merchant bank which advised B&amp;C over the Atlantic
purchase, and against Atlantic Computers itself, understood to be for
mis-representing its financial position.
Two weeks ago Mr John Soden of Price Waterhouse, Atlantic's administrator,
took pre-emptive action against a possible legal claim when he halted plans
to pay creditors in June a first dividend of 16p in the pound.
Price Waterhouse has served writs to indemnify the Atlantic administrators
if the B&amp;C action is taken and succeeds.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Stock market tail wags vigorously: The achievements of
Liffe, 10 years old today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As dealers in the trading pits of Liffe celebrate the 10th anniversary of
the introduction of futures and options on the FT-SE 100 stock market index
today, they may find it hard to believe that these instruments, which now
dominate UK equities trading, were once considered mere curiosities.
When they were introduced they were the first stock index futures in Europe.
These days, such derivative instruments are found not only in Europe but
also in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America.
The value of shares traded every day through these contracts on Liffe,
London's futures exchange, now represents 250 per cent of turnover on the
London Stock Exchange.
Average daily volume in the first quarter of this year reached more than
43,000 contracts, representing a daily turnover of almost Pounds 3bn. Price
changes in the stock market are frequently led by the futures market.
For some observers, this is a clear sign that the tail is wagging the dog.
Indeed, regulators have become increasingly concerned that the growing use
of derivatives is contributing to market volatility.
However, there is little concrete evidence to show that derivatives
destabilise markets. Indeed a study in December by Mr Gary Robinson of the
Bank of England of the effect of derivatives on the London stock market
concluded that 'futures trading has been associated with a significant
reduction in volatility - around 17 per cent'.
Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe's chairman, argues that the fact that almost all
significant changes of direction in share prices are now signalled in stock
index futures is a reflection of the greater speed and efficiency of the
futures market.
Certainly, lower dealing - as much as 20 times lower than on the London
Stock Exchange - has helped to attract a broad range of market participants.
In addition, the past 10 years have brought a shift in the approach of fund
managers towards picking the right market, rather than the right stock.
They have found that the quickest and safest way to change the weightings of
their investment portfolios was by buying or selling stock index futures.
Mr John Millers, of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull's derivatives desk,
believes that the growth of the futures market is also a function of the
electronic revolution in the financial markets.
The FT-SE index has been closely followed by traders since it began to be
calculated electronically in 1986, and the advent of increasingly powerful
computers has given rise to more sophisticated trading techniques, using
complex models to value derivative instruments.
The strong growth in FT-SE futures volume may be far from over. There are
still many potential users - such as the funds run by UK charities  - that
are barred from the market by their trustees.
Moreover, the growth of FT-SE futures volume has actually trailed the
increases in volume recorded by Liffe's bond futures. In the US stock
market, futures turnover is now 10 times - rather than 2 1/2 times - the
size of the cash market.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Government urged to press for curb on Brussels' power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An influential think-tank today urges the government to press its case for a
more decentralised European Union by proposing a radical plan to curb the
powers of the European Commission.
The European Policy Forum says the present powers of the commission should
be divided between three new institutions: a commission for the single
market; a treasury board responsible for all spending and revenue decisions;
and a new external trade commission.
The forum argues that this 'unbundling' of the commission's powers could be
a central element in the reform of the union at the Intergovernmental
Conference due in 1996.
Alongside plans to transfer greater control over financial affairs and the
single market to the council of ministers it would reverse the momentum
towards the centralisation of decision-making in the EU.
The forum is an independent group with cross-party support. But its latest
paper, written by Mr Frank Vibert, the director, is likely to attract
widespread support on the Tory backbenches.
Its effect would be to repatriate to member governments much of the
influence over the political and economic direction of the union by casting
the commission in an essentially managerial role. Its involvement in the
union's foreign and security policy and in home affairs would be transferred
to the secretariat of the Council of Ministers.
Mr Vibert argues that at present the commission gives too little prominence
to the single market while its spending reflexes have always overwhelmed its
sense of responsibility for financial discipline.
A three-way division of its authority would restore the focus on ensuring
European competitiveness. At the same time the forum suggests that the
commission's quasi-judicial functions would be transferred to an independent
competition authority modelled on Germany's Bundeskartellemt.
The paper coincides with a call from the Institute of Community Studies, a
sociological research group, for co-ordinated Europe-wide cuts in VAT as
part of a package of policies to stop the EU 'imploding' under the weight of
mounting unemployment. The study argues that record unemployment will
permanently derail European integration without 'rigorous and co-ordinated
action' from member states.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Anxiety over job loss fades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anxiety among part-time workers about the prospect of losing their jobs fell
sharply in April, the latest MORI survey for the Financial Times says.
This compares with a levelling out among full-time workers about whether
they are very, or fairly, concerned about losing their jobs in the next 12
months.
The results will bring some small comfort to the government, coming together
with indications that people are slightly less pessimistic about the
economic out-look.
However, a fifth of working people remain very concerned about losing their
jobs, thereby hindering a consumer-led recovery.
Forty-four per cent of full-time and part-time workers questioned in April
by MORI were either very or fairly concerned about losing their jobs in the
next 12 months.
This compares with 46 per cent in March and 48 per cent in February.
The greatest boost in confidence came from part-time workers. The proportion
who were either very or fairly concerned fell to 35 per cent, compared with
46 per cent in March when part-time and full-time workers were equally
anxious.
The proportion of full-time workers expressing concern remained unchanged,
at 46 per cent.
The most pessimistic about their prospects remained male manual workers.
People in the north of England and Scotland were also negative about
prospects.
The monthly series began in April last year. Pessimism about job prospects
in-creased consistently until July, since when there has been much
volatility.
However, April is the second successive month in which there has been a
downward trend.
MORI had face-to-face interviews with 1,034 people aged 18 or over who
worked full or part-time.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Tory election leaflet sparks row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party yesterday accused the Tories of making false claims in the
Dudley, West Midlands, local election campaign, breaching the Representation
of the People Act, Paul Cheeseright writes.
The row, in a so far tepid campaign where Labour is seeking to hold on to a
two-seat majority, erupted in the Amblecote ward, where Labour won a seat by
a handful of votes in 1990.
A campaign leaflet sent out by Mr John Martin, the Tory candidate, and
published by Mr Colin Banks, his agent, reprinted an article from The Sun
newspaper which alleged that three Labour councillors had planned to visit
New Delhi and study the Indian Fire Brigade. A Labour official said last
night that 'never had any such trip been planned whatsoever'.
A letter to Mr Banks from Mr Fraser Kemp, Labour's west Midlands organiser,
demanded a retraction, a public apology and threatened to pass the whole

FT  03 MAY 94 / Profit-pay benefits on tax 'abused'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profit-related pay has become part of the tax avoidance industry and its tax
benefits have been abused, says a report by the Institute of Employment
Rights, Richard Donkin writes.
The study joins a growing chorus of disillusionment with PRP as a means of
rewarding employees. Its author Ms Hazel McLean, a Cambridge University law
lecturer, says that PRP has failed to motivate employees or make labour
costs more flexible by varying with levels of profitability as its
proponents had claimed.
Ms McLean says recent legislation on PRP and employee share option schemes
has done nothing to encourage economic or industrial democracy. She says she
has found little evidence that it has either encouraged identification of
employees with their companies or provided incentives for employees to
increase company profits - two of the main principles behind its origin.
Companies are becoming more open in their accounts about how they pay their
directors and what directors' share options are worth, says Company
Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monthly accounts monitor.
The May issue says that the growing mood among companies to be open about
links between directors' pay and future performance, shows that pressure
from institutional investors and the Cadbury committee, which last year made
recommendations for complete information on directors' remuneration, is
paying off.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Smaller companies show big reliance on overdrafts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smaller companies appear to rely heavily on high-cost, short-term finance,
says a Confederation of British Industry survey published today.
It says that more than 57 per cent of respondents were using overdrafts to
raise debt.
The survey of the way small companies in Cleveland raise finance was
produced in association with Cleveland County Council and Teesside
University.
It found that almost two-thirds of borrowing was for working capital,
suggesting finance was sought to survive and meet cashflow difficulties
rather than to achieve growth.
Most borrowers required 'quite modest' amounts - Pounds 100,000 or less in
more than three-quarters of cases. The most popular sources were clearing
banks (64 per cent) and finance and leasing companies (35.5 per cent).
The report concludes that banks should pay more attention to management
skills and business prospects and put less emphasis on security when lending
money.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Machine tools see Pounds 9m trade surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's machine tool industry notched up a trade surplus of Pounds 9m last
year - its first since 1983 - spurred by strong growth in exports to
countries outside the recession-torn European Union.
Figures this week from the Machine Tool Technologies Association said total
exports rose 4.4 per cent to Pounds 338.8m last year compared with 1992,
while imports fell 19.9 per cent to Pounds 329.7m.
The export performance is seen as particularly encouraging given the sharp
fall in demand for machine tools in continental Europe, which has
traditionally accounted for 55 per cent of UK exports.
Exports to the European Union fell by 23 per cent, with sales to Germany,
which is by far the largest market in Europe, recording a fall of 46 per
cent.
In contrast, exports to non-EU countries rose 25 per cent to Pounds 225m,
with the main growth coming from the US, the biggest market for UK machine
tools, to which exports rose 38 per cent to Pounds 70m.
Spain jumped to second place with an increase of just under 300 per cent to
Pounds 33m, while exports to China soared by 295 per cent to Pounds 25m.
Exports to Pacific rim countries also grew significantly.
The figures lend credence to claims by the industry, which is the
eighth-largest such industry in the world, that it is well placed to win
export business because of its productivity and competitiveness.
The fall in imports to the UK last year is due partly to the arrival in 1992
of a large quantity of foreign machine tools for Japanese car plants. This
contributed to a 1992 UK machine tool trade deficit of Pounds 82m.
The export figures come as machine tool builders are seeing a sudden surge
in inquiries and orders from UK manufacturing industry, which is regaining
the confidence to buy equipment after the recession.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Gas de-regulation plans expected
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is expected to publish next Monday the much delayed proposals
for de-regulation of the gas market from 1996.
The proposals are politically sensitive because many industry analysts
believe they will lead to price rises for some consumers. The document was
initially expected several months ago following government decisions in
December on de-regulation.
Last week Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of the industry's
regulatory body Ofgas, who has helped to write the document, threatened to
publish a version of it if the government delayed publication for much
longer.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Engineers last night flew to the Piper Bravo platform 120 miles north-east
of Aberdeen in the North Sea's Claymore field to investigate reports of
minor explosions.
No one on board the platform was injured, although 98 non-essential
personnel were evacuated by helicopter as a precaution.
Elf Enterprise Caledonia, operator of the platform which is the successor to
ill-fated Piper Alpha, said that there was no explosion in the sense of a
fire or blast but the engineers would be investigating unconfirmed reports
of 'noises within the pipework related to the flare system' which burns off
excess gas.
'Production from the Piper field and its satellite field was immediately
shut down,' Elf said.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Fund urged for closing reactors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An independently managed fund, paid for by the nuclear power industry,
should be set up to meet the cost of scrapping reactors, says a report
published today by a government-commissioned advisory committee, Bronwen
Maddox writes.
Taxpayers may still have to pay up to Pounds 2.9bn to enable Britain's
ageing Magnox reactors to be taken out of service, the 100-page report, by
the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex University, says.
The study was commissioned by the government's Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee, which advises it on the methods and costs of dealing
with civil nuclear waste.
The high and unpredictable costs of decommissioning nuclear sites have been
one of the nuclear industry's greatest headaches. The uncertainty was the
main reason for the withdrawal of the nuclear industry from the 1989
electricity privatisation.
The National Audit Office has estimated that future decommissioning could
eventually cost Pounds 18bn and that the taxpayer might have to foot the
bill as well as the nuclear industry.
The research unit report says that annual provisions of between Pounds 1m
and Pounds 5m for new plants could be sufficient to pay for their eventual
decommissioning. It points out that this is a small proportion of the income
of Pounds 200m a year which a typical plant generating 1100MW might earn.
Accurate estimates, however, are hard to make until 'real progress is made'
towards the construction of a store for nuclear waste.
The fund would not solve the problem of decommissioning the Magnox reactors,
the report says. 'Over a decade's worth of provisions were effectively
'lost' at privatisation of the electricity industry and expected
decommissioning costs have risen rapidly in real terms over the last
decade.'
In a separate report the advisory committee says: 'Government could be the
guardian of the fund but public confidence might be enhanced if the fund was
truly independent and retained for the sole purpose of decommissioning
plant.'

FT  03 MAY 94 / Labour vows to combat City 'short-termism'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Labour government would seek to reform companies law to counter the
culture of City 'short-termism' which the party believes is harming
industry.
A 17,000-word paper on competitiveness, to be published next week, will set
out a six-point plan for reviving industry, including tougher controls on
takeovers and a network of development agencies to promote economic activity
in the regions.
The timing of the launch is designed to steal some of the thunder from the
government's much-trumpeted competitiveness white paper, due for publication
on May 16.
It follows last week's report by the Tory-controlled Commons trade and
industry committee, which urged institutional investors to adopt a more
flexible approach to corporate dividend payments and singled out City
short-termism as a structural weakness damaging Britain's prospects.
The white paper - set to appear in the critical period between the
approaching local and European elections - is expected to act as a mid-term
manifesto, pulling together a range of policies on education, training and
manufacturing.
News of the Labour document emerged as Mr John Smith, party leader, promised
an audience of trade unionists a 'new deal for working people', enshrining
'proper' rights in the workplace and a statutory national minimum wage. Mr
Smith, addressing the annual conference in Blackpool of the shopworkers'
union Usdaw, did not give a precise figure at which the minimum would be
pitched. He said only that rates of less than Pounds 3 an hour were judged
to be too generous by the government.
Underlining Labour's commitment to the goal of full employment, Mr Smith
promised action to ensure that employers could not deny union representation
to workers who voted in favour of it in a secret ballot.
He also pledged that signing the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty
would be among the first acts of the next Labour government.
Next week's paper will back the imposition of statutory interest payments on
companies which settle their debts late - a move under consideration by
ministers - and urge that companies which attempt hostile takeovers should
have to prove the deal would be in the public interest.
Focusing on the need to encourage more long-term investment in
manufacturing, it will argue that the fear of a takeover is the single
largest reason why the dividends paid by UK companies are comparatively
high.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Lloyd's considers option on capital
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to allow Lloyd's syndicates to obtain all their capital from one
single corporate investor - in effect becoming insurance companies - are
being considered by the insurance market.
More details are likely to emerge today when Lloyd's unveils a report on
ways in which it can strengthen the market's capital base. It will say how
hard-pressed Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally
supported the market - can share in the capital value or goodwill attached
to Lloyd's business.
The report follows work by an advisory group of senior market professionals,
'the value group', led by Mr Robert Hiscox, Lloyd's deputy chairman.
The committee was established to consider further reforms to the market's
capital structure following the decision to allow limited corporate
investment in syndicates. The plans would make it easier for Names to opt
for limited-liability investment.
Institutional investors have already invested Pounds 800m in Lloyd's
syndicates and account for about 15 per cent of the market's total capacity
 -the amount of premium income that can be accepted by syndicates. At
present corporate investors can control no more than 50 per cent of a
syndicate's capacity, while no single corporate investor can control more
than 25 per cent.
The report is expected to outline a number of ways in which Names could
'assign' their participations in syndicates in exchange for shares or other
securities, which might make Names shareholders in the new corporate Names
and cap their liability.
Lloyd's is also expected to continue its work on setting up a market for
Names to buy and sell participations.
The report is also expected to make recommendations on how Lloyd's could
introduce pre-emption rights for Names. These would be similar to
pre-emption rights attached to shares in a company.
This would allow Names to maintain their existing participations in
syndicates or increase them in line with any rise in a syndicate's capacity.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Jury convicts Virani of BCCI fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nazmudin Virani, the former property entrepreneur, was convicted at the
Old Bailey yesterday of seven counts of fraud relating to his business
dealings with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
The jury found Mr Virani guilty on one count of false accounting and six of
furnishing false information to Price Waterhouse, the BCCI auditors, in
order to help artificially boost the bank's profits by about Pounds 11m.
Mr Virani will be sentenced on May 11. However, concern he might abscond led
the judge to refuse bail and order him to be remanded in custody.
Mr Justice Hutchison warned Mr Virani that the offences of which he had been
convicted were sufficiently serious that a prison sentence 'appears
inevitable'. The charges carry a maximum term of seven years' imprisonment.
The conviction marks the third successful prosecution for the Serious Fraud
Office over the BCCI scandal. Mr Syed Ali Akbar, a former head of BCCI's
treasury division, and Mr Mohammed Baqi, a former head of Attock Oil, a
company owned by BCCI, have already been convicted after the SFO's
investigation.
The jury acquitted Mr Virani on single charges of conspiracy to defraud,
theft and furnishing false information. It was unable to reach verdicts on a
further four counts of furnishing false information. These charges will not
now be proceeded with.
At the heart of the fraud committed by Mr Virani was what the prosecution
described as a 'you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours' relationship
with Mr Mohammed Haque, the head of BCCI's property division, who fled to
Pakistan.
As BCCI's financial troubles deepened in the late 1980s, Mr Virani signed a
series of bogus audit confirmations which misled the auditors and inflated
the bank's profits.
In return, BCCI gave Mr Virani cash payments totalling Pounds 1.6m and
played a substantial role in the expansion of Control Securities, the
property company Mr Virani headed from 1985 until his arrest.
Mr Virani's conviction ends a meteoric business career which began after he
was expelled from Uganda in 1972 by President Idi Amin. The growth of the
Virani Group property empire and his stewardship of Control Securities were
two successes that led to his being named Asian businessman of the year in
1990.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Anger at brand lookalikes worries DTI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brand manufacturers have warned that they will reconsider UK investment
plans unless curbs are put on supermarket 'lookalike' products.
The manufacturers are furious with a government decision not to amend the
trademarks bill to restrict the use of lookalikes.
The warning has been given by Coca-Cola, manufacturer of the world's
best-selling branded product, and by members of the British Producers and
Brand Owners Group.
Ministers and officials say that they have been given legal advice that it
is too late to amend the bill, which was recently given a second reading in
the Commons.
The Department of Trade and Industry said: 'The DTI takes Coca-Cola's threat
very seriously. But there is nothing ministers can do in the medium term'.
New legislation on brands in the next parliamentary session is almost
impossible for lack of time.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, the trade minister, has asked his department's
standing advisory committee on industrial property to investi-gate the
question of whether new legislation is needed to curb the use of lookalikes.
But this has failed to placate Coca-Cola and the brand owners group, which
includes Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever and Mars.
They have told Mr McLoughlin that they have no confidence in the advisory
committee, which they consider is biased towards the interests of
supermarkets. The advisory committee consists of industry and consumer lobby
groups.
Many brand manufacturers believe that supermarkets' own label instant
coffees and shampoos often look deceptively like their own branded products,
but not quite close enough to allow them to take legal action for 'passing
off'.
Coca-Cola, which is not a member of the brand owners group, is furious at
the supermarket chain J. Sainsbury for having recently launched a cola
called Classic, in a red livery containing the slogan 'original American
taste'.
The company insists that it is not opposed to own-label products, but argues
that it is unfair competition for supermarkets to package their products to
look like the market leaders. It argues that supermarkets are parasitically
benefitting from brand manufacturers' substantial investment in packaging
design and advertising.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Bids for Notts paper may top Pounds 80m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A tense auction is developing for T. Bailey Forman, publisher of the
Nottingham Evening Post, with a selling price that may exceed Pounds 80m.
The contest for the most significant regional newspaper group still in
family hands is developing into a three-way struggle between Northcliffe
Newspapers, the regional arm of Associated Newspapers; the recently floated
Midland Independent Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Evening Post;
and Emap, the magazine and regional news-paper group.
An auction for the group, which includes a number of free newspapers as well
as the main Nottingham title, is being organised by Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
the merchant bank. Final bids are due by May 16 but indicative bids based on
a sales memorandum have already been submitted.
One of the bids, possibly from Northcliffe, is believed to have been for
more than Pounds 80m. Midland in its indicative bid, which is in no way
binding, is understood to have put forward a figure of at least Pounds 70m.
A number of potential bidders who suggested figures around Pounds 40m have
been eliminated from the competition.
Apart from Northcliffe, Midland and Emap, two other groups - Reed
International and Thomson Regional Newspapers - are believed to be still in
the contest.
The apparently high price is a function of the rarity value of the privately
owned titles and the fact that profitability of the regional press has
gradually been improving in spite of generally declining circulations.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Dirty tricks alleged in soap war: The renewed battle for the
Pounds 6bn European detergents market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week sees the official outbreak of a detergent war in the UK. The
launch of Persil Power, Unilever's new super-concentrated washing powder, is
no ordinary marketing exercise. At stake is leadership in a Pounds 6bn
European detergents market, lost a few years ago to Unilever's arch-rival,
Procter &amp; Gamble of the US.
Some of the early skirmishes in the war have been distinctly odd. Procter
executives last week claimed in the Netherlands that the new detergent made
clothes disintegrate, or words to that effect. Unilever's Dutch subsidiary
promptly took Procter to court to stop the allegations.
Even odder is the way the row originated. As soon as the new powder appeared
on the shelves in test marketing, Procter bought some. It then went to
Unilever and expressed 'serious concerns' about the product's safety.
According to Unilever, Procter asked that the launch - the culmination of
Pounds 100m of capital investment - should be cancelled. Unsurprisingly,
Unilever refused. Its executives now mutter darkly that Procter, a
notoriously tough competitor, is using dirty tricks in an attempt to wreck
the launch.
The charge is one which Procter rebuts. In any other industry it would seem
the natural explanation. Suppose, for instance, one of the big brewers
launched a new lager which turned teeth green. The other brewers would sit
back and await the market's revenge. The last thing they would do is
helpfully point out their rival's mistake and suggest it withdraw the
product.
But detergents, Procter argues, are different. It told the FT: 'Our main
concern is that fabric damage occurs progressively and a significant
proportion of consumers regularly switch brands, with the result that P &amp; G
products could be blamed for damage which in reality may have been caused by
another product.'
If the implication is that the detergents industry is in the habit of
conferring in this way, Unilever denies it. 'This is a notoriously
dog-eat-dog industry,' a Unilever executive said yesterday. 'We don't talk
to each other before things happen. This is unprecedented.'
The two companies, the world's largest in detergents, have fought each other
around the globe for decades. Historically, Procter dominated in North
America and Unilever in Europe.
In the 1980s this was a fairly comfortable arrangement for Unilever.
Vigorous action stemmed earlier losses in the US, while its European lead
was maintained. But in the 1990s things have gone wrong on both sides of the
Atlantic. It lost ground in the US and earlier this year announced heavy
rationalisation there and the possible withdrawal from some market sectors.
In Europe, the unthinkable happened. Concentrated washing powders arrived
and Unilever fumbled their introduction, losing its market lead.
Definite figures are hard to come by, but Unilever concedes that Procter is
'several points' ahead. The sums involved are formidable: between them the
two companies have 60 per cent of the Pounds 6bn market.
In seeking to regain ground, Unilever has for the first time produced a
pan-European washing powder, one which is claimed to wash more gently at
lower temperatures and to be more environmentally friendly. As the scale of
the exercise is unprecedented, so too is the competitive threat. To judge by
last week's shenanigans, Procter might just conceivably be rattled.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Bank accused over Maxwell Pounds 55m switch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two writs have been filed alleging that Goldman Sachs, the US-based
investment bank, assisted in diverting Pounds 55m from two pension schemes
controlled by Robert Maxwell to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interests
would be repaid.
The writs were filed late last week in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan
by trustees for Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme and Maxwell
Communication Corpora-tion Works Pension Scheme. The trustees seek more than
Dollars 100m for the sale of shares plus interest, commission charges and
punitive damages from Goldman and Mr Eric Sheinberg, partner in charge of
international equities trading.
The writs centre on the purchase of Pounds 55m of MCC shares from the
pension schemes by two Swiss trusts, Servex and Yakosa, which were
transacted through Goldman and for which the schemes were never paid. The
writs allege Goldman was aware the trusts were controlled by Robert Maxwell.
The writs also allege that on May 28 1991 - the same date Mr Kevin Maxwell
arranged for the pension fund share transaction to be paid for - Goldman was
due to receive Dollars 58.2m for an unrelated transaction selling MCC stock
to an unnamed American lawyer 'with close connections to Robert Maxwell'.
The writs claim that Goldman was 'competing directly with its customer, the
pension fund trustee, for payment'. On April 26 1991, they say, Mr Kevin
Maxwell told Mr Sheinberg to sell the pension scheme shares to the Swiss
trusts. On May 23 he told Goldman to remit the proceeds of the sale not to
the pension schemes but to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, which Goldman knew
or should have known was controlled by the Maxwell family.
The writs allege that after the deal was struck Mr Trevor Cook, MGN pension
fund administrator, told Goldman that proceeds of the sale should be paid to
the pension scheme, but when Mr Kevin Maxwell ordered the proceeds to be
paid to BIT.
The writs say that Goldman and Sheinberg 'made no reasonable effort to
determine who had actual authority to direct for the pension fund that the
shares be sold and where the more than Dollars 47m in proceeds from the
transfer of the 12.5m shares should go'.
Goldman said it had 'received no money or other benefit from these
transactions other than its brokerage commissions of Pounds 110,000 which
were substantially less than the amount of the applicable stamp duties paid
to the Inland Revenue of Pounds 215,000'.

FT  03 MAY 94 / De Savary says reports of his collapse exaggerated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter de Savary, the flamboyant entrepreneur whose interests range from
property to the oil business, yesterday angrily denied reports that his
business empire was at risk of collapse.
It emerged over the weekend that some 10 days ago Standard Chartered Bank,
which has been associated with Mr de Savary for a number of years, has
appointed accountancy firm Robson Rhodes as administrative receiver to
Placeton, a property development company that three years ago represented 60
per cent of Mr de Savary's net assets.
Mr de Savary played enthusiastic host to thousands of visitors yesterday at
Littlecote Leisure theme park, set in the grounds of his historic Berkshire
home, while rejecting suggestions that the collapse of Placeton was the end
of the road.
'I greatly resent suggestions that de Savary is either wiped out, bankrupt,
personally in trouble or no longer able to take a positive role in
business.' he said. 'That would be very misguided.'
He said he had personally lost Pounds 50m in the collapse, adding that this
probably represented about 60 per cent of his net worth. He refused to put a
figure on his fortune, however. 'An amount that others dream of,' was all he
would say.
Mr de Savary, who prides himself on being a self-made man who left school at
16, is well-known for his ebullience and willingness to take risks. At one
time in the 1980s he was involved in attempts, ultimately unsuccessful, to
win the Americas Cup yacht race.
'The whole thing has been greatly exaggerated,' he said of the Placeton
receivership. 'The Placeton group was only established in 1989. My
businesses are all horizontally structured, not vertically, so it is only
one of the tentacles of my business operations.'
He made it clear he believed that his continuing operations were insulated
from the demise of the Placeton operations. 'Three years ago it became
obvious if the recession did not lift it was going to be a difficult
situation. I have disposed of many of the assets and restructured others.
What we are left with is the fag-end of a property portfolio.
'Putting in a receiver was the bank's decision. It is fair to say that its
idea of how to manage a portfolio is different from mine.'
Mr de Savary added that he believed Standard Chartered had lost rather more
than Pounds 50m. Yesterday the bank disputed his claim, pointing out that it
had seen the crash coming for some time and had made the necessary
provisions. As a result it did not believe there would be any material
effects on its results this year.
Mr de Savary said there had been no damage to creditors, all of whom had
been paid off long ago, and no jobs had been lost. The only shareholders
were himself and Standard Chartered. 'From my point of view, it is a painful
experience, but I have written it off. I would have been happy to continue
to manage the assets for the bank, but in a way I am relieved they have
taken this burden from me.'
Mr de Savary said he was still active in a broad range of business ventures.
He mentioned oil, property and financial investment.
He was bitter that institutions including banks were able to finance
problems of the kind undergone by Placeton through rights issues that were
not open to private individuals. He was also unhappy that the bank had been
unwilling to consider a debt-for-equity swap.

The Department of Trade and Industry is processing 4,000 import licence
applications from small traders for Chinese goods covered by European Union
import quotas.
The demand was caused by the imposition of quotas by the European Council on
selected imports from China covering leather gloves, footwear, some
tableware, household glassware, radio broadcast receivers and toys.
The rush was prompted by an EU decision to deal with applications on a
first-come, first-served basis.

About 100 staff of Barclays Bank in Birmingham are planning a 2 1/2 -hour
strike today.
The staff, members of the finance union Bifu, who work at Barclays
Centralised Securities Office in Summer Road, Birmingham, are protesting at
the withdrawal of protection for their salaries following a reorganisation
at Barclays. The union claims the reorganisation has left many staff working
in lower paid grades.
Mr Terry Bray, Bifu organiser in the west Midlands, said: 'Our members have
co-operated with endless changes in Barclays and they should not be
penalised in their pay packets. Yet some of our members stand to lose more
than Pounds 5,000 over the next few years.'

FT  03 MAY 94 / Brazilian Workers' party softens policy: Presidential
election hopes prompt moderation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's left-of-centre Workers' party (PT) has agreed a watered-down policy
on the country's foreign debt which should help the election chances of its
leader, Mr Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, front-runner in polls for October's
presidential elections.
At the party's annual conference at the weekend, Mr da Silva and other
moderates saw off calls for an immediate moratorium on Brazil's foreign debt
if the PT won the presidency. Instead, a future PT government will seek to
renegotiate existing accords and only suspend payment as a final measure in
the face of creditors' intransigence.
Brazil is the developing world's biggest debtor and last month closed a
Dollars 49bn (Pounds 33.5bn) debt rescheduling after four years of
negotiations. PT leaders insist the rescheduling was a bad deal for Brazil
and that their government would seek better terms. However, some analysts
believe an incoming PT government would have many other more urgent domestic
problems to confront.
At the annual conference, several delegates attacked the International
Monetary Fund and said debt payments should stop if they threatened Brazil's
foreign reserves, standing at more than Dollars 30bn.
Mr da Silva, who has moved from the left to the centre of the party since
his defeat in the last presidential election in 1989, also moderated other
policies in areas such as foreign investment and access to abortion.
The main problems a PT government would aim to tackle include social issues
such as education, health, agricultural reform and land.
In opinion polls Mr da Silva is comfortably ahead of his nearest rival, Mr
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, former finance minister. Full campaigning will
probably not get under way until after the football World Cup final in the
US in July.
Mr Cardoso was yesterday expected to announce a formal election alliance
between his party, the centrist Brazilian Social Democrats (PSDB), and the
right-of-centre Liberal Front (PFL), the second largest party in Congress.
The alliance will give Mr Cardoso support in north-east Brazil, where the
PFL is strong but Mr Cardoso weak.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Election threat to Ecuador reforms
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Opposition parties yesterday won a convincing victory in Ecuador's mid-term
congressional elections, threatening the future of President Sixto Duran
Ballen's economic reform programme.
The president's Republican Unity party lost six seats in Congress and
together with its ally, the Conservative party, now commands only nine of
the 77 congressional votes.
The overwhelming winner of the election is the opposition Social Christian
party, with 25 seats or one-third of the power in parl-iament.
President Duran insisted that 'a couple of representatives less in
parliament won't change the course of my government'.
The president added that even without a legislative majority during his
first two years, he had begun restructuring the country.
In order to continue and advance his state modernisation programme the
president must forge alliances with opposition parties, notably the Social
Christian party. Its leader and 1992 presidential candidate, Mr Jaime Nebot,
indicated that his party supported a reduced state sector but at the same
time would demand more social compensation for those affected by reform.
To move ahead with the privatisation of strategic sectors of the economy,
the government will require congressional approval of pending legislative
proposals.
According to opinion polls, the outgoing Congress was the most unpopular
since Ecuador returned to democracy in 1979. As a result, voter apathy was
considerable.
If Ecuadoreans approve the proposal to elect congressmen for four years, as
stipulated in the plebiscite to be held on July 31, these could be the last
mid-term congressional elections.
Critics argue that months of campaigning significantly impedes the
legislative process.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Casas pledges to defend foreign exchange system: New chief
at helm of Venezuelan Central Bank
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Antonio Casas Gonzalez, an economist with experience in domestic and
international finance, took over as president of Venezuela's central bank at
the weekend following three days of pressure on the nation's foreign
currency reserves and a sharp decline in the bolivar.
In Mr Casas' first public statement as head of the central bank he
underscored his commitment to defending the institution's autonomy and
pledged to maintain the system of supply and demand of foreign exchange in
effect before last week's crisis, when his predecessor resigned.
The Venezuelan central bank controls more than 90 per cent of the nation's
foreign exchange reserves and its presence on the exchange market, until
recently managed under a crawling peg system, is an important factor in
determining the value of the bolivar. Problems began last week when Mrs Ruth
de Krivoy resigned from the bank presidency; her departure precipitated a
rush to buy US dollars.
Mrs Krivoy resigned after two years in the post because she felt the
government of President Rafael Caldera was trying to compromise the bank's
independence.
The government quickly appointed Mr Casas as governor but at the same time
the central bank was trying to slow sales of dollars to commercial banks,
some bankers reported.
The initiative, which was started last Wednesday but which was not
encouraged by the Caldera government, succeeded only in raising fears of
exchange controls. On Friday the central bank set an informal limit on sales
to commercial banks and the bolivar suffered its worst decline against the
US dollar in the last 16 months, falling by 4.6 per cent to close at 124 to
the dollar.
At midday yesterday the bolivar continued to fall and demand for dollars was
so strong that some banks ran out of US notes. At one commercial bank in
Caracas, Banco Venezolano de Credito, the dollar opened yesterday morning at
126 bolivars to the dollar and closed just before noon at 132.
This amounted to a devaluation of 4.5 per cent in only a half day's trading.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Zedillo faces fallout from Mexican row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's opposition has demanded that a cabinet minister be investigated for
using public funds to support Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the governing party's
presidential candidate, in what may be the first test of the government's
willingness to abide by new electoral laws that outlaw such activity.
The opposition demand follows reports that Mr Carlos Hank Gonzalez, the
agriculture minister, arranged the publication of a newspaper advertisement
in which 57 current and former ministers expressed their support for Mr
Zedillo. The advertisement, which was published on April 12, has been much
criticised, in part because signatories included ambassadors and a
supposedly non-partisan electoral official.
The accusation - backed by a photocopy of a letter to the 57 signatories,
signed by Mr Hank Gonzalez's private secretary - is that the agricultural
minister used official telephones, faxes and secretarial time in rallying
support for Mr Zedillo. Mexico's new electoral law forbids such activities,
and punishment could include a prison sentence.
The opposition demand is particularly embarrassing for Mr Zedillo, as Mr
Hank Gonzalez is his most powerful ally among the party's old guard. If any
action was taken against Mr Hank Gonzalez the fragile coalition in the
Institutional Revolutionary party that supports Mr Zedillo would come under
strain.
In an interview Mr Zedillo was defensive. 'It is not proved. A photocopy of
something is not proof in either this country (or) yours,' he said.
The PRI has also been criticised for apparently backing down on its promise
to publish its spending in the election campaign. Mr Zedillo said last week
he would inform the public just once of the spending in his campaign before
August's election, and refused to disclose how much the governing party had
spent to date.

More than 2,500 guests and 40 foreign ministers have been invited to Cairo

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cambodian peace talks scheduled to begin yesterday between Khmer Rouge
guerrillas and the Phnom Penh government have been postponed indefinitely
amid some of the most serious fighting in the country for five years.
King Norodom Sihanouk offered to host the negotiations at his royal palace,
but the continuing warfare in northern and western Cambodia together with
complaints from Khmer Rouge leaders that their safety could not be
guaranteed in Phnom Penh meant the talks had to be called off.
'We must put an end to this war but no-one listens to me,' a downcast King
Sihanouk told Cambodian journalists. 'The round table cannot take place for
the time being because there is a very serious difference between Phnom Penh
and the Khmer Rouge.'
Khmer Rouge guerrillas recently recaptured their headquarters at the
gem-mining town of Pailin near the Thai border and their northern stronghold
at Anlong Veng, and are intensifying their attacks on government-held areas.
A Buddhist monk and a nun were killed in the north-west on Saturday by the
Khmer Rouge, while taking part in a 'peace march' in the company of
government soldiers; six men working for a Cambodian mine-clearing project
are believed to have been killed in an ambush; and fighting has closed the
main road linking to Thailand to Cambodia to all but military traffic and
forced the evacuation of UN staff from Sisophon.
In the south, four westerners are being held by the Khmer Rouge as part of
what seems to be a new tactic of hostage-taking, and embassies have urged
their nationals to take care while travelling.
Tens of thousands of Cambodians have fled the fighting, either to other
parts of the country or to Thailand. The Cambodian government is now
considering legislation to outlaw the Khmer Rouge.
A year ago this month, Cambodians went to the polls at the culmination of a
Dollars 2bn UN peacekeeping operation. The outcome of the election was a
coalition government bringing together the royalist Funcinpec party and the
previous communist administration, but the Khmer Rouge refused to take part
or to relinquish territory.
The guerrillas, although weakened by popular support for the UN-sponsored
peace process, bided their time until the departure of most of the
peacekeepers.
According to Prince Ranariddh, senior prime minister and Funcinpec leader,
the government's policy is to keep the door open for talks with the Khmer
Rouge while weakening the guerrillas militarily. At present, however, it is
the government army which is on the defensive.

FT  03 MAY 94 / US upbeat on Syrian peace initiative

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The comprehensive peace settlement eluding the Middle East appeared to edge
forward yesterday as a result of peace proposals brokered between Syria and
Israel over the weekend.
Israel said it was listening with 'great interest' to Syrian proposals
delivered to Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, by US Secretary
of State Warren Christopher. Israeli officials said the new Syrian proposals
appeared to mark a new recognition on the part of Damascus to discuss
Israel's security needs.
However, Israel's deputy defence minister poured scorn on Mr Christopher's
shuttle diplomacy saying the US secretary of state had failed to deliver
anything that would allow Israel to say they were entering a more serious
Syrian negotiations.
The usually cautious Mr Christopher said the two parties were now 'talking
on a comprehensive range of issues' and had entered a 'new, more substantive
phase'.
A breakthrough in negotiations with Syria remains the key to a comprehensive
regional peace accord between Israel and her Arab neighbours, including
Lebanon and Jordan.
The initiative emerged after Damascus rejected the idea of an Israeli
withdrawal from the strategic Golan Heights, occupied by Israel in 1967,
which Mr Christopher presented to President Hafez al-Assad in Damascus on
Saturday. Israel, hoping tomorrow's peace agreement with Palestinians will
unblock peace talks with Syria, had offered Syria a three-stage withdrawal
from the Heights.
Israeli media reported that under the Israeli package, Israel proposed a
pull-out in three stages over five to eight years. In the first stage,
Israel would hand over some territory, including Druze Arab villages, in
return for establishing diplomatic relations and security guarantees.
In the second phase Israel would dismantle Jewish settlements and
consolidate security arrangements including a large demilitarised zone.
The Israeli proposal, was the first time the Jewish state has offered such a
comprehensive withdrawal package.
Syria, however, rejected the Israeli proposals. Mr Farouq al-Shara, the
Syrian foreign minister, said the Israeli proposals 'did not cause any
change in the Syrian position. Full Israeli withdrawal is the basis for the
peace process.'
However, behind the rhetoric, Israeli and US officials said Damascus had
formulated an interesting alternative set of proposals in eight hours of
meetings with Mr Christopher on Saturday and Sunday. The Syrian proposals
will form a basis for talks with further US mediation.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Palestinians to have right to set up stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Palestinians preparing for self-government in the Gaza Strip and West Bank
enclave of Jericho will have the right to establish a stock market, issue
bonds, create an embryonic central bank and work towards a trade surplus
with Israel, Israeli officials said yesterday.
Although the economic accord signed between Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation last week makes no reference to a stock market or
Palestinian bonds, Israeli officials said they were implicit in the
agreement.
Mr Avi Ben-Basat, head of research at the Bank of Israel, said yesterday the
incoming Palestinian Interim Self-Governing Authority could establish a
stock exchange which would be governed by a securities authority similar to
Israel's. Palestinians, foreigners and Israeli citizens would be able to
invest.
Under the economic protocol, Palestinians will create a Palestinian Monetary
Authority(PMA) responsible for licensing, supervising and inspecting banks;
determining the liquidity requirements on all deposits held by banks
operating in the self-rule areas; managing foreign exchange reserves and
foreign currency transactions.
The agreement says the PMA will also have the power to regulate and
supervise capital activities in the self-rule areas including the licensing
of capital market institutions, finance companies and investment funds.
Mr Basat said these provisions implicitly allowed for a stock exchange
although he said he thought the Palestinians would first build up a money
market.
Mr Basat said the new trade policy of the accord, which allows Palestinians
to import directly and boost exports, could eliminate the current Dollars
300m trade deficit with Israel, possibly creating a trade surplus with
Israel leaving the self-rule areas with an excess of Israeli shekels which
would remain the legal tender.
Under the accord the PMA has the right to convert excess Israeli shekels
into foreign currency at the Bank of Israel according to a mutually agreed
annual estimate of the flow of goods and services between Israel and the
self-rule areas.
Mr Basat said this, combined with exports to the rest of the world, foreign
aid and loans, could lead the Palestinian self-government to accumulate
foreign currency reserves which could back significant bond issues.
Palestinian and other Arab nationals would be the most likely investors.
Mr Basat said the monetary authority was not a central bank because
Palestinians would not be allowed yet to issue their own currency.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Yemen clashes fuel war fears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Yemen's quarrelling political leaders yesterday exchanged heated
recriminations following last week's battle near Sana'a which, officials
say, left 79 dead and 119 wounded.
Reports of further clashes between rival northern and southern military
units throughout the country have added to the growing tension, fuelling
fears of a civil war.
President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the northern leader, yesterday accused his
southern rival, vice-president Ali Salem al-Biedh, of 'secessionism' and
vowed to use military force against him if necessary. 'This is a decisive
battle and we will have to fight it if we are forced to defend unity . . .
and confront secessionists,' General Saleh said, addressing southern
soldiers who surrendered after last week's battle.
Referring to the battle at Amran, about 50km north-west of Sana'a, Mr Biedh
said: 'This means the launching of an all-out civil war', and Gen Saleh was
'personally and fully responsible for all that happened and is happening'.
Mr Biedh repeated his charges over the weekend in telephone conversations
with key Arab leaders, including Egypt's president Hosni Mubarak, Saudi
Arabia's King Fahd and Libya's Colonel Qaddaffi.
Gen Saleh, who himself sent a personal envoy to King Fahd on Friday, has
frequently accused Saudi Arabia and other 'outside forces' of supporting Mr
Biedh and his Yemen Socialist party.
'Yemen's ruling presidential council echoed those charges on Friday, saying
that Mr Biedh and the socialists wanted the Arab League and other Arab
countries to interfere as an excuse to deploy more military forces along the
former border between north and south Yemen.
As the war of words escalates, observers fear further armed clashes,
especially along the old border where rival troops already stand on alert.
But flash points are more likely at southern military bases in the north and
northern ones in the south.
Mr Yaseen Said Noman, a YSP leader, said there had been attempts to
exterminate southern military units in the north which were aggravating the
situation. Gen Saleh returned the accusation on Sunday, claiming the YSP had
deployed troops against northern army units in the south. Gen Saleh warned
that if the northern units were attacked the YSP 'would pay dearly'.

<TEXT>
South Korean President Kim Young-sam yesterday ordered increased
surveillance of North Korean military movements in response to its threat to
disband the military armistice commission.
South Korean defence forces were placed on temporary alert on Saturday after
between 15 and 20 North Korean aircraft were detected flying close to the
demilitarised zone between the two Koreas. The aircraft manoeuvres indicated
increased military exercises by North Korea.
North Korea has threatened to pull out of the military armistice commission,
which supervises the truce that ended the Korean War of 1950-53, unless the
US holds negotiations with Pyongyang on a peace treaty to replace the
40-year old armistice agreement.
The US has refused the demand, explaining the dispute over North Korean
nuclear inspections must be resolved first.
Western diplomats in Seoul believe that North Korea is using the peace
treaty proposal as a new bargaining chip in the international negotiations
over nuclear inspections.

FT  03 MAY 94 / International Press Review: Japanese salarymen reach for the
tabloids
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In an effort to ease the boredom of a long and crowded commute, many
Japanese salarymen reach for the tabloid sports dailies, rolled up in high
pillars at the front of newstands, before boarding their trains to work.
And the tabloids seldom disappoint. While office workers get their
mainstream dailies delivered to the door, the sports tabloids, lacking the
extensive distribution systems of the large newspapers, try to lure readers
with their colourful front pages and lurid headlines.
The downmarket tabloid papers provide their readers with a mish-mash of
coverage - last night's baseball and soccer results, photos and comics of
scantily clad women, the latest in showbiz gossip and the recent goings on
in Nagatacho, Tokyo's political district.
The sensational, and often bizarre stories, together with unrestrained
assaults on the mainstream press and public figures, have continued to
attract more readers.
The top four sports tabloids - Sports Nippon, Nikkan Sports, Sankei Sports
and Hochi Shimbun - with a total circulation of 2m, have seen their sales
rise by 2 to 3 per cent a year, while circulation growth at the mainstream
dailies has been flat for the past few years.
The frustration among white collar salarymen as a result of the prolonged
recession has also helped the tabloids' sales. The mocking captions,
anti-establishment attitudes, and of course the smut, have even caught the
imagination of elite businessmen, who strictly limit the scanning of such
papers to the trains, away from office and home.
Political coverage, usually tucked alongside advertisements for sex
telephone lines and office workers' blue suits, has recently managed to find
its way onto the outside pages. Bypassing any attempt at high-handed
analysis, the tabloids have opted to provide their readers with frivolous
information about politicians and the squabbles in Nagatacho, subjects
usually untouched by the morning dailies.
When the new cabinet was announced last week, Sports Nippon and Nikkan
Sports carried tables which provided blood types, horoscopes, and heights
and weights of all the ministers. Nikkan wondered if Prime Minister Tsutomu
Hata, a Virgo with blood type O, could manage the helm.
With the political interests and coalition turmoil becoming too complicated
for the tabloids - and the ordinary Japanese - to follow, the downmarket
press have made things simpler by lambasting Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the
coalition's strategist.
Mr Ozawa's comparison of last week's creation of the parliamentary alliance
'Kaishin' or innovation, to an extra-marital affair was picked up by every
tabloid. 'It doesn't matter how many women one sleeps with. If the Socialist
Democrats feel jealous they have only to come and join us,' he said in
response to the outcry among the socialist members, who have been strongly
opposing any grand union among political parties.
In an article beside a photo of Tonya Harding, the Nikkan Gendai called Mr
Ozawa an 'immature and defective human being,' condemning his sexist slurs.
Meanwhile the television commentators over the weekend poked fun at Mr
Hata's questionable ability as a leader. One prime time programme offered
film clips of newly appointed ministers clad in their 1920s-style suits,
scrambling for photogenic positions at the ritual picture taking of the
cabinet. Mr Koji Kakizawa, foreign minister, and Mr Mutsuki Kato,
agriculture minister, seemingly unaware of the rolling camera, ignored Mr
Hata's protests to let the 'women in the front,' and shoved aside fellow
cabinet members to stand in the front row with the prime minister.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US has delayed for two months trade action against China for its failure
to enforce intellectual property rights and against Japan for discriminatory
government procurement practices, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. The
postponement keeps the focus on China's human rights policies a month before
President Clinton must decide whether to renew China's Most Favoured Nation
trade status. It also gives Japan's new government time to address US
complaints about barriers to US telecommunications and medical equipment
companies when bidding on government contracts. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, said some progress was made on Japan's procurement practices
in talks at Marrakesh with Mr Tsutomu Hata, now premier, and the US 'will
assess the seriousness of any official Japanese response'. On intellectual
property rights China as well as Argentina and India 'pose the most
significant problems in this area'.

<TEXT>
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday left for Europe on
his first official visit abroad after taking office last Monday.
Mr Hata will be visiting Italy, France, Germany and Belgium, and is
scheduled to meet the heads of government of those countries as well as Mr
Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission.
Discussions between the Japanese prime minister and his European
counterparts are likely to centre on furthering bilateral and regional ties.
During his meetings with European leaders, including French President
Francois Mitterrand and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Mr Hata is likely to
explain Japan's efforts to deregulate its markets in an effort to reduce its
massive trade surplus and help boost international economic activity.
The European Union has expressed concern about Japan's current account
surplus, although discussions on the issue have been overshadowed by recent
fraught exchanges regarding trade between the US and Japan.
The Japanese prime minister is also expected to confirm Japan's support for
UN-led peace efforts in the former Yugoslavia.
The trip, which was planned by his predecessor, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, will
provide the new Japanese prime minister with an opportunity to get to know
his counterparts in Europe before the Group of Seven summit meeting in
Naples in July. The Golden Week holiday period, when most of Japan shuts
down, has usually been a convenient time for the country's prime ministers
to travel abroad.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Miti angered by US view of trade practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has responded angrily
to a US report which criticised Japanese trade practices as ambiguous,
lacking in objectivity and in many ways based on faulty or questionable
analysis.
'We cannot understand clearly what is the standard of their judgment,' said
Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, the trade ministry's vice-minister for international
affairs, in response to the 1994 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign
Trade Barriers published at the end of March. Because Super 301 was revived
by the US, the 1994 report, unlike previous NTE reports, becomes part of the
process of invoking the Super 301 trade bill which allows the US to
unilaterally retaliate against countries it judges to be unfair trading
partners.
In a formal written response presented to the US embassy in Tokyo yesterday,
the trade ministry notes that Super 301 goes 'against the letter and spirit
of the Gatt and the Uruguay Round accords.'
Having said that, many assertions made in the NTE report lack theoretical or
factual basis, Miti says. For example, the report's assertion that Japan's
large and persistent (current account) surpluses indicate an imbalanced
approach to trade in Japan and have depressed production and employment in
many of Japan's trading partners cannot be supported by the facts, the trade
ministry points out.
Miti said that Japan's surpluses are not proof of closed markets, but
instead indicate an imbalance of savings and investment. Countries such as
Hong Kong and Singapore, which clearly have low trade barriers, also have
trade surpluses, it noted.
In addition, Japan's low average tariff rate on manufactured and mining
products - at 2.2 per cent, compared with 5.4 per cent for the US and 5.7
per cent for the EU - and its low number of items subject to import quotas,
belie the assertion in the USTR's report that Japan is significantly less
open to imports and foreign direct investment than other countries, Miti
said. To cut Japan's surpluses it is necessary to raise investment in Japan
and change the balance of savings and investment, Miti noted.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Tokyo tries to defend policy towards Iran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's foreign ministry yesterday defended its policy of ties with Iran
following allegations last week that Tehran has been supporting terrorist
groups including the Irish Republican Army and the Japanese Red Army.
The ministry was attempting to deflect criticism of Japan's independent
Iranian policy which is likely to be on the agenda at July's G7 summit.
Officials indicated that the policy could be reviewed if the UK provided
conclusive evidence of terrorist links. 'The allegations involving the IRA
are completely new and have come as a complete surprise to us. If Iran is
linked with the IRA, then we would have to be decisive,' said a ministry
official.
A change in Tokyo's policy towards Tehran would be a relief to the US and
UK. Both have been anxious to use Tehran's short-term debt crisis to to
force Iran to change its policies and Japan has been providing aid and
finance for Iran's beleaguered economy, including rescheduling Dollars 2.3bn
worth of short-term debt and supplying Y38.8bn in aid for a hydro-electric
power project.
Ministry officials yesterday said the aim of this strategy was to support
the 'pragmatists' in Tehran. These moderate elements, led, according to the
officials, by President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, are on the defensive
because of Iran's deteriorating economy. The danger was that President
Rafsanjani could fall, to be replaced by someone worse.
'Iranian politics is complicated and it is far from clear what would happen
if he (President Rafsanjani) was ousted. But it could lead to an extreme
form of government, and that would not be in the international community's
interest,' said one official.
The ministry pointed out that German, Austrian and Danish companies had
carried out similar rescheduling programmes. 'The rescheduling issue is over
because of the Europeans,' said an official. In any case, he explained, the
Japanese government, given its free-market policies, did not have the
authority to prevent private companies rescheduling. US trade with Iran was
expanding and was already greater than Japan's, he added.
'By having reasonable relations with Iran, we have some influence. The
Iranians, for example, are being very careful with the North Koreans (about
missile technology),' the officials concluded. 'President Rafsanjani is a
source of realism in the government. We can see that in the restraint Iran
has been showing in not exporting revolutionary Islamic ideology to
neighbours such as Afghanistan, Azerbaijan and Armenia.'
The ministry said its policy was not motivated by oil. Iran supplies between
7 per cent and 8 per cent of Japan's oil requirements, compared with more
than 30 per cent before the Iranian revolution. However, officials conceded
that Japan had an interest in achieving stability in the Gulf, since more
than 50 per cent of Japan's oil supplies come the United Arab Emirates and
Saudi Arabia.
Ministry officials said they were aware of incidents suggesting links
between the Iranian government and assassinations, noting that since the
beginning of 1991, at least 12 opponents of the regime in Tehran have been
killed. They include the former bodyguard of the Shah killed in Turkey two
years ago, the assassination of Mr Mohammad Hassan Arbab in Pakistan last
June; the machine-gunning of four members of the Kurdish Democratic Party in
Berlin in 1992, and the dramatic killing of the former Iranian prime
minister, Mr Shahpour Bakhtiar, in Paris in 1991.
The Japanese foreign ministry said it had no evidence directly linking the
assassinations with the Iranian government but cite investigations into the
murder of Mr Bakhtiar which led French prosecutors to conclude that Vevak,
Iran's secret service, was responsible for the murder.
Ministry officials said they were aware of reports suggesting members of the
Japanese Red Army had visited Tehran late last year together with elements
of the IRA, Abu Nidal and other groups. They had also heard suggestions that
the Japanese then travelled to the Beka'a Valley in Lebanon to be trained by
members of the Iranian Republican Guards with the intention they should
conduct joint assassination missions with other extremist groups in the US
and Europe.
If the UK was able to provide evidence about links between Iran and the IRA,
this could affect Japan's policy, the officials said. The moment for
decisive action has not yet arrived, however. 'Until we are provided with
proof, it would be premature for Japan to take sanctions against Iran,' they
said.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Capital inflow pushes yen ever higher / Focusing on the
reasons behind the recent rise in Japan's currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mechanics of the yen's recent jump against the dollar are not as
contrary as they look; a heavy net flow of capital into Japan is the main
technical factor at work; cash-starved Japanese financial institutions need
to raise yen and foreign investors are just as eager to supply yen to buy
the bonds, shares, golf courses and office buildings the Japanese are busily
unloading.
Japanese and US Federal Reserve intervention to support the dollar and drive
down the yen is probably due to fears that the dollar-yen at this level will
harm both their economies, throttling Japan's weak signs of recovery and
fuelling US inflation.
To many others, the yen's rise is plainly illogical. Why should a country
with a weak economy and powerless government have a stronger currency than
one with a recovering economy?
But such considerations do not overly concern the market. The French and
German central banks found this to their cost when they jointly intervened
last year in a fruitless attempt to defend what appeared to be an
economically justified fixed link between their currencies.
As the French and Germans also found last year, central bank intervention is
too small to control the giant forces of the foreign exchange markets. The
dollar-yen market turns over between Dollars 100bn and Dollars 150bn
worldwide daily, easily equivalent to the Bank of Japan's entire foreign
reserves, which amounted to Dollars 104.56bn at the end of April.
The biggest players in the current currency turmoil are the Japanese banks
and life insurance companies.
They have sold record volumes of Japanese shares over past few months, to
plump up their meagre earnings before closing the books at the end of March.
Foreign investors have been eager buyers, spending on average Y1,000bn per
month on Japanese shares in the first quarter of this year, according to the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. This has tailed off slightly since.
'Japanese institutions in general have a liquidity squeeze due to the
after-effects of the bubble economy,' said Mr Peter Tasker, chief strategist
at Kleinwort Benson, referring to the sharp inflation and then collapse of
Japanese asset prices at the turn of the decade.
'They can only generate cash by selling assets overseas and transferring
them into yen or selling yen assets to foreigners,' he added.
Japanese corporate holders of US property last year sold or partially
disposed of Dollars 17.59bn of US properties, nearly a quarter of the total
US property portfolio built up by Japanese institutions since the start of
their investment boom in 1985, according to Kenneth Leventhal, the US
accountancy firm.
At the same time, Japanese investors have sharply reduced their purchases of
dollars since the turn of the year thereby weakening the US currency - and
no doubt proving that they were right to do this.
In the final quarter of 1993, Japanese institutions bought Dollars 37.5bn of
US shares and bonds, a four-year record and more than Japan's current
account surplus in that period.
That dwindled to a mere Dollars 3.5bn at the latest count by the finance
ministry, for the first two months of this year.
This dramatic change reflects Japanese investors' loss of confidence in the
dollar, based on suspicion that the US administration is tempted by
competitive devaluation, according to Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at
Baring Securities in Tokyo.
'The intervention we have seen by the Fed and the Bank of Japan has not yet
restored confidence,' he said.
All this suggests that the International Monetary Fund is right to believe
that there will this year be little change in Japan's record Dollars 131bn
current account surplus last year.
Yet these forces were in place before the latest surge in the yen, inviting
the question why did the foreign exchange markets choose now to move.
One popular explanation is the emergence last week of a weak minority
Japanese government, unlikely to agree on tax cuts needed to stimulate
demand and so likely to frustrate the US, which will then be tempted to push
up the yen to put pressure on Japan to open its markets.
The flaw in that view is that the new government is not much weaker than the
last one; and a strong Japanese administration might in any case worsen the
US trade dispute.
But there is a real political risk that this and future governments will
lack a clear economic agenda, argues Mr Paul Summerville, director of Asian
research for Lehman Brothers Japan.
That implies little chance of enlarging the tentative recovery, so far
limited to areas like housing and public works, which do not consume large
amounts of dollars.
Renewed fears of inflation in the US, fuelled by recent data, is another new
factor.
Either way, the brute weight of money is what counts in the end.
Foreign exchange analysts in Tokyo expect a fresh attack on the dollar and
upward push on the yen as soon as the Golden Week holiday ends on Friday.
They predict that joint intervention by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank
of Japan will be tested to new limits.

FT  03 MAY 94 / South African Elections: 'If it was not so tragic, it would
be funny'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Our only comfort is that the television broadcasters are making a bigger
mess than we are,' admitted an election official in a candid moment.
But the authorities at the SABC, the national broadcaster, would have good
reason to contest that assertion.
Journalists who had planned to cover what should have been the inspiring
story of South Africa's historic first all-race elections have been forced
into writing about the continuing inefficiency of South Africa's Independent
Electoral Commission, charged with running the elections.
The list of problems is seemingly endless. The IEC, having botched much of
the four days of voting through a string of oversights, now seems hard
pressed to complete the counting process properly.
At Gallagher Estates, the plush conference centre just outside Johannesburg
that was presented to the world as the information nerve centre of the
election, nobody seems to know what is going on. Increasingly irritated
media representatives are frequently handed out-of-date election results
that have been taken off the wire services.
The laager mentality - once used to describe obdurate, apartheid-era
Afrikaner politicians - has become a better description of many commission
officials who have retreated into defensive mode.
'The IEC has taken note of your legitimate complaints and will seek to
remedy them at the soonest opportunity,' has become the stock phrase of the
mild-mannered Mr Humphrey Khosa, the IEC official given the thankless task
of dealing with the media.
Mind-boggling declarations such as the fact that 'formally unverifiable
votes will be specially counted' are routinely issued. Justice Johann
Kriegler, head of the commission, claimed that the assessment and
apportionment of all such technically invalid votes would be decided
according to 'a quantity thing, a distribution thing, a general pattern
thing'.
In an effort to speed up the flow of results the commission has jettisoned
nearly all the safety precautions installed to prevent voter fraud - first
by having to print millions of new ballot papers without the security
counterfoils and then, instead of counting ballots only from sealed ballot
boxes, declaring that votes delivered in cardboard boxes and even plastic
bags are valid.
Even more serious, instead of cross-checking each ballot box received at
counting stations with information from the respective polling station, all
votes received are being counted immediately.
After the count, far from being swiftly relayed, as promised, to the
hundreds of the journalists gathered at the conference centre, figures are
transmitted by modem to two outdated personal computers. Even this limited
operation has hit snags; when the wires went down early on Sunday morning,
attempts to rouse a sleeping technician to repair the damage were foiled
when his mother refused to wake him up.
One party official summed it up: 'If it wasn't so tragic, it would be
funny.'

FT  03 MAY 94 / South African Elections: 'South Africans are now free' - FW
de Klerk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The following are excerpts from the speech by President FW de Klerk
conceding defeat to Mr Nelson Mandela.
Four years and three months ago I said in parliament that the time had come
for us to break out of the cycle of conflict, tension and violent struggle
in which we had been embroiled for decades.
During the past week we have seen the realisation of that vision. After so
many centuries, we will finally have a government which represents all South
Africans. All South Africans are now free.
During the past four years Mr Mandela has played. . . a leading and an
honourable role. I thank him and congratulate him. He deserves the
congratulations, good wishes and prayers of all South Africans.
During the past four years we have proved we can work together. Despite our
differences, our relationship has become a symbol of the ability of South
Africans from widely different backgrounds to co-operate in the national
interest. This spirit will be essential to the success of the government of
national unity.
Mr Mandela has walked a long road and now stands at the top of the hill. A
traveller would sit down and admire the view. But a man of destiny knows
that beyond this hill lies another and another. The journey is never
complete. As he contemplates the next hill I hold out my hand in friendship
and in co-operation.
As far as my own position is concerned, I should like to make clear that I
believe that my political task is just beginning. Everything that we have
done so far - the four years of difficult and often frustrating
negotiations, the problems and the crises - have been simply a preparation
for the work that lies ahead.
The greatest challenge which we will face in the government of national
unity will be to defend and nurture our new constitution. Our greatest task
will be to ensure our young and vulnerable democracy will take root and
flourish.
I will be in a good position in the government of national unity. I will not
be there at the whim of any person or any party, but in my own right as the
representative of many millions of South Africans.
Just as we could not rule South Africa effectively without the support of
the ANC and its supporters, no government will be able to rule South Africa
effectively without the support of the people and the institutions that I
represent.
I enthusiastically pledge that support in the spirit of national
reconciliation.
The National party has. . . the recipe for the future and. . . one day we
shall be the largest party in the country. Our objective will be to prove
this at the polls in five years' time.
This is an important milestone in the history of our country - perhaps the
most important that we will ever see.
Next Tuesday I shall lay down my responsibilities as state president, secure
in the knowledge that we have achieved what we set out to achieve four years
and three months ago.
I shall be handing over the presidency to Mr Mandela, but I shall not be
leaving government. I shall be surrendering power, not to the majority of
the moment, but to the South African people.
A power greater than man has given South Africa the spirit, the chance to go
forward in peace. God almighty has been kind to us. Now it is up to the
political leaders to join together for the good of our people and complete
the task of healing and reconciliation. God bless South Africa. Nkosi
sikelel i'Afrika.

FT  03 MAY 94 / South African Elections: 'Joyous night for human spirit' -
Nelson Mandela
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The following are excerpts from Mr Nelson Mandela's victory speech.
This is indeed a joyous night. Within the last few hours I have received
telephone calls from State President de Klerk, General Constand Viljoen
(leader of the right-wing Freedom Front), Dr Zach de Beer (of the Democratic
party) and Mr Johnson Mlambo (the first deputy president of the Pan
Africanist Congress) who pledged their full co-operation and offered their
sincere congratulations.
I thank them all for their support and look forward to working together for
our beloved country. I would also like to congratulate President de Klerk
for the strong showing the National party has displayed in this election. I
also want to congratulate him for the. . .four years that we have worked
together, quarreled, addressed sensitive problems and at the end of our
heated exchanges were able to shake hands and to drink coffee.
To the people of South Africa and the world who are watching: This is indeed
a joyous night for the human spirit. This is your victory, too. You helped
end apartheid, you stood with us through the transition.
South Africa's heroes are legend across the generations. But it is you, the
people, who are our true heroes. This is one of the most important moments
in the life of our country. I stand before you filled with deep pride and
joy - pride in the ordinary, humble people of this country. You have shown
such a calm, patient determination to reclaim this country as your own. And
joy that we can loudly proclaim from the rooftops - free at last]
I am your servant. I don't come to you as a leader, as one above others. We
are a great team. I stand before you humbled by your courage, with a heart
full of love for all of you. I pledge to use all my strength and ability to
live up to your expectations of me as well as the ANC.
Tomorrow the entire ANC leadership and I will be back at our desks. We are
rolling up our sleeves to begin tackling the problems our country faces. We
ask you all to join us, go back to your jobs in the morning. Let's get South
Africa working. For we must together and without delay begin to build a
better life for all South Africans. This is going to be the acid test of the
government of national unity.
I appeal to all the leaders who are going to serve in this government to
honor that programme and to go there determined to contribute towards its
immediate implementation. If there are attempts on the part of anybody to
undermine that programme, there will be serious tensions in the government
of national unity.
But I must add we are not going to make the government of national unity an
empty shell. We want every political organisation that participates in that
government to feel they are part and parcel of a government machine which is
happy to accommodate their views within the context of the reconstruction
and development programme.
We also commend the security forces for the sterling work done. This has
laid a solid foundation for a truly professional security force, committed
to the service of the people and loyalty to the new constitution.
People have voted for the party of their choice and we respect that. This is
democracy. Now is the time for celebration, for South Africans to join
together to celebrate the birth of democracy. Let us build the future
together, and toast a better life for all South Africans.

FT  03 MAY 94 / South African Elections: Next chapter unclear after
fairy-tale start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa has emerged triumphant from the most perilous stage of a
revolution without precedent, and its citizens seem bemused by their
achievement.
After more than three hundred years of supremacy, the white minority last
week finally, irrevocably and peacefully surrendered power at the ballot box
to the country's black majority.
The full details of this astonishing - some say miraculous - event are not
yet known, for the election commission is still grappling with mountains of
ballot papers.
And one major obstacle which could jeopardise the prospects of a stable
South Africa may yet emerge: the outcome of voting in KwaZulu/Natal,
stronghold of the Zulu leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
Nor, at this stage, is it clear what may be the next step of the white
right, whose extremists could yet destabilise South Africa with an
assassin's bullet.
But, as an exuberant president in the waiting, Mr Nelson Mandela celebrated
the ANC's achievement at last night's victory party, taking satisfaction in
a fairy-tale start to the new South Africa.
And, as he pressed ahead with the critical process of reconciliation, South
Africa's remarkable political metamorphosis continued.
In the television studios and televised press conferences, on radio and on
newspaper front-pages, one leader began assuming the mantle of power, and
the other, incumbent President FW de Klerk, began shedding it. Before its
eyes, South Africa watched a process unfold which has neither precedent nor
parallel in Africa, and perhaps the world.
Mr Mandela, never less than a monumental personality, seemed to gain further
stature as the results trickled in; almost perceptibly, the aura that comes
with office seemed to desert Mr de Klerk. Nothing so became the two men, and
the country in their charge, than this transfer of power, which is due to to
be made formal at next week's inauguration in Pretoria.
'For the first time I envy South Africans, for the first time I wish I could
call myself South African,' said one hard-bitten observer of many years
standing last week. He had been moved almost to tears as he watched black
and white embrace at a moving ceremony that took place at midnight on
Tuesday.
Seldom, if ever, can the advent of democracy have been the instrument of
catharthis so profound, so liberating, for rulers and ruled alike, as South
Africa's unforgettable and moving experience last week.
Millions suffered under apartheid. But apartheid's victims extended beyond
its borders. Hundreds of thousands died in Angola, Zimbabwe and Mozambique,
the front-line states in the proxy battles to defend white rule.
But last week, for a precious few days, the pain of the past seems to have
been eased, even thrust briefly out of mind.
A truce, undeclared and unspoken, in the political fighting that has cost
more than 14,000 lives over the past 10 years was broken but not spoilt by
the bombs of the extreme right. In the 24 hours that ended yesterday
morning, police reported that there had not been a single death from
political violence.
Joyous as the election was for blacks, it also became liberating for whites.
As they cast their votes, many spoke of having the sense of casting off the
burden of apartheid, whether or not they had supported the policy. Many were
taken aback by the simple - though unprecedented  - experience of going to
the polling booths, black, coloured and white, as equals, to chose a
government that for the first time will reflect the will of the majority.
The orange, white and blue flag of the old South Africa was lowered at
centres across the land, and the new one raised while choirs sang the
region's hymn of liberation, now adopted as one of the official anthems of
post-apartheid South Africa: Nkosi sikelel i'Afrika (God bless Africa).
For black South Africans in particular it was a proud moment, but for many
Afrikaners it must have been a poignant, painful one.
As that flag entered the history books, the other official anthem carried
across the night air, sung in Afrikaans, and no doubt giving comfort to
those fearful of what the future holds: Die Stem von Suid-Afrika (At thy
call we shall not falter, firm and steadfast we shall stand. At thy will to
live or perish, O South Africa, dear land).
Over the past week at least, most white South Africans overcame their
apprehensions. And whatever may happen in the future, for a few days, South
Africa has basked in the glow of pride asserted, and pride recovered.

FT  03 MAY 94 / South African Elections: Mixed-race voters ensure Nats
triumph in the Cape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDAN BOYLE of REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's mixed-race (coloured) citizens, who straddled the apartheid
divide for almost 45 years, have voted to retain white domination at the
Cape, where their black and white ancestors met in 1652, writes Brendan
Boyle of Reuter in Cape Town.
Early results in South Africa's first all-race elections gave President FW
de Klerk's white-led National party a commanding 30 per cent lead over Mr
Nelson Mandela's largely black African National Congress in the Western Cape
region.
Political analysts said the lead was due to support from coloureds, who
fared better under apartheid than blacks but not as well as whites.
Mr Hernus Kriel, the white law and order minister, told reporters he
expected an outright win in the race for premier of the region, which has
Cape Town as its capital.
Mr Allan Boesak, coloured ANC premiership candidate, conceded that defeat
was imminent: 'The ANC will accept the outcome of the democratic process. As
a people and as an ANC organisation in the Western Cape, we are ready to do
whatever the situation demands of us.'
Earlier, radical ANC activist Tony Yengeni, a member of the party's regional
executive, broke ranks to talk of his sense of betrayal at the apparent NP
lead. 'Already the man in the street in the (black) township is feeling
betrayed,' he said. 'We have been tortured and oppressed by the white man in
this country for so long. . . and now a section of the population votes for
the party that oppressed us to return to power.'
The region's coloured community descends from early unions the Dutch
settlers and the later British arrivals had with the indigenous black
population they found at the Cape.
Mr Yengeni said ANC leaders would have to act decisively to prevent a black
backlash against the mainly Afrikaans-speaking coloureds, who comprise
almost 60 per cent of the 2.3m Western Cape electorate.
Emotional ANC and NP supporters gathered and traded insults late on Sunday
on Cape Town's Grand Parade, where Mr Mandela made his first public
appearance after his release from 27 years in jail in February 1990.
Ms Miriam Ebrahim wept as she watched NP members celebrating their likely
victory with shouts of 'Viva FW de Klerk.' She said: 'It was our own people
that stabbed us in the back.'
But Mr Andre Hofmeister, a coloured whose name underlines his half-European
ancestry, pointed to a crowd of ANC supporters dancing with posters of
Mandela and said: 'These people are too stupid to realise that, if a black
man rules this country, it will be run into the ground.'
In a squalid shantytown there was no echo of the animosity evident on the
Grand Parade. Standing next to a wooden fruit and vegetable stand, an ANC
supporter, Mr Emanuel Makunga, said that most blacks would accept the
results peacefully as part of the democratic process.
'This was a liberation election,' he said. 'People are more happy that they
could vote for the first time than they will be upset that the ANC didn't
win here. People respect the election process. But they won't be happy to be
ruled by the same NP again.'

FT  03 MAY 94 / South African Elections: Mandela's cabinet choices will
signpost way to future - The toughest appointment will be that of first
deputy president, with the winner becoming Mandela's heir-apparent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Everyone has known for months who will be South Africa's next president: Mr
Nelson Mandela. So the betting classes have had to focus their wagers on the
post of first deputy president, effectively the prime minister.
Mr Mandela has so far given away no secrets on his intentions for this post,
or for any other in the 27-minister cabinet.
Before making these appointments he is required to consult the leaders of
other parties represented in the planned government of national unity: all
parties with more than 5 per cent of the vote are entitled to representation
in proportion to their share of the national vote, and others may be invited
in at his discretion.
But the final decisions are his, and it seems unlikely he has made them yet.
Indeed, ministerial horse-trading probably cannot begin until after the
final electoral results are known and it would take a clairvoyant to know
when that will be.
Under the constitution, the National party (as the second largest) is
guaranteed the post of second deputy president. This post will be filled by
Mr FW de Klerk, the incumbent president. Beyond that the NP wants ministers
in three broad categories: security, economy, and social affairs. And Mr
Mandela seems inclined to cede powerful posts in each category.
However, the odds are that these will not include the important post of
minister of finance.
Businessmen and international investors, who have pinned their hopes on the
incumbent minister Mr Derek Keys continuing in office, will probably be
disappointed.
Mr Mandela's African National Congress sees the upliftment of black South
Africans as the central mission of its 80-year liberation struggle; it is
unlikely to put the main economic portfolio in the hands of a member of the
outgoing government. While Mr Chris Stals, the central bank governor, will
remain in office (Mr Mandela has guaranteed this), Mr Keys could be offered
the post of minister of trade and industry.
He previously indicated no interest in the job but may have reconsidered.
Indeed, the Finance Ministry could turn out to be the linchpin of the whole
cabinet structure.
Once this post is filled it will determine other appointments for there is
only one man in the ANC team who would make a remotely credible minister of
finance - Mr Thabo Mbeki, the ANC's shadow foreign minister.
Mr Mbeki is a class act, and the ANC has used him as a kind of unofficial
ambassador to white South Africa. Businessmen breathe an almost audible sigh
of relief when they know they have the urbane and charming Mr Mbeki to deal
with. He has a masters degree in economics from Sussex University, although
no background in finance. But he is well known internationally, and has the
confidence to handle international negotiations well.
Under the circumstances, Mr Mandela could probably make no better choice.
The decision could have a significant long-term impact on the future of
South Africa. For if Mr Mbeki was appointed finance minister he could not
become first deputy president. The leading contender for that post then
would be Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general. The winner will become
undisputed heir-apparent to Mr Mandela.
It is a difficult choice, for both men are well qualified for the job. Mr
Mbeki, 51, is older and more experienced. Mr Ramaphosa, 10 years his junior,
has a ruthless political instinct which he used to win a constitutional deal
which vastly favours the ANC. Few politicians can better him in battle. At
the moment he looks the more likely choice, although only Mr Mandela knows
for sure.
The ANC leader must also find cabinet space for one of his closest advisers,
Mr Joe Slovo, chairman of the South African Communist party, who could win a
security port-folio.
Mr Jay Naidoo, the union leader, could be made minister of reconstruction
and development, a special economic post.
National party ministers must also be catered for.
Mr Mandela has said he would look favourably on Mr Kobie Coetsee, the
incumbent justice minister and a hardliner whom the ANC leader came to know
while still in jail, Mr Roelf Meyer, the National party's chief
constitutional negotiator and a leading 'enlightened' nationalist, and Mr
Pik Botha, the long-serving foreign minister.
Far more difficult will be what to do with Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi,
leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, who could be made a third deputy
president in the interests of national unity, and Gen Constand Viljoen,
leader of the right-wing Freedom Front, whom Mr Mandela has said he would
like to accommodate even if the front wins less than 5 per cent of the
national vote.
Bets can still be placed, but time is running out. By the end of this week,
or early next, the die will be cast.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Fears increase for further Bosnian flashpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and DAVID BUCHAN

   BELGRADE, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday vowed that he would
block any moves to designate as a United Nations 'safe area' the town of
Brcko, on the eastern end of the Serb corridor in Bosnia.
The 'corridor is of vital interest to the Serbian nation', he said, ruling
out any possible change in the status of Brcko, which has 'always been in
Serb hands'.
Earlier, Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, had called on the UN to
make the Brcko corridor 'a security zone' with the same status as Sarajevo
or Gorazde, so that Nato aircraft could intervene 'at the first cannon shot
. . . by one side or the other'.
Speaking to the Anglo-American Press Association in Paris, Mr Juppe
described the Brcko corridor as 'very sensitive' to both Moslems, who wanted
it for access to the Sava river and thence to the Danube, and to Serbs, who
wanted it to link their territories in east and west Bosnia.
UN officials fear the town will be the next flashpoint and are considering
how a conflict can be avoided.
In Gorazde, the Moslem enclave in south-east Bosnia, UN reports cite
heightened tensions, including an incident on Saturday in which British
soldiers returned fire, killing two Serbs. In a similar incident near Tuzla,
another UN 'safe area', nine Serbs were killed after firing four anti-tank
missiles at soldiers from the Nordic battalion who used their tanks in the
exchange.
There were further reports yesterday that Serb forces are concentrating
their heavy weapons in the strategic north-eastern region.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian prime minister, who today is due to meet Mr
Yasushi Akashi, senior UN official for former Yugoslavia, in Sarajevo to
discuss resuming peace talks, yesterday warned that his government would not
rejoin negotiations until Serb forces complied fully with a Nato ultimatum
to withdraw from a 20 km zone around Gorazde.
UN officials said at the weekend that Serb soldiers had shed their army
fatigues only to return in blue uniforms in the guise of policemen
protecting Serb settlers. The immediate resettlement of Serbs is part of a
Serb plan to partition Gorazde.
In Sarajevo, Nato aircraft buzzed a weapons depot ending a four-hour
standoff between Serb forces trying to take back their heavy weapons from UN
soldiers.

FT  03 MAY 94 / White House pushes gun curbs: World News Digest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration has begun an all-out drive to win support for a
ban on assault weapons and large-magazine guns, but still faces possible
defeat when the measure comes to a vote in the House of Representatives
later this week, writes George Graham in Washington. White House officials
acknowledge they are still around 15 votes short in the House. The proposed
law closely resembles a measure included last year by the Senate in a much
broader crime bill, and would outlaw 19 specific weapons, as well as high
capacity magazines. It would also impose a more general ban on

The licence to operate France's first truly urban radiotelephone network
will be awarded by the end of this summer to one of three French bidders,
Alcatel, Bouygues and Lyonnaise des Eaux, the French telecommunications
ministry announced yesterday. In addition to local partners, Alcatel has
teamed up with Stet of Italy and Telefonica of Spain, Bouygues with Veba of
Germany and US West, and Lyonnaise with Thyssen of Germany, Belgacom of
Belgium and Bell South of the US, to bid for France's third radiotelephone
network. France Telecome and Generale des Eaux already operate two Global
System for Mobile Telephones networks in France. But they generally require
users to be outdoors or near a window. The ministry said yesterday the third
network was designed more for urban office use, requiring an investment of
FFr10bn-FFr15bn. France has around 150,000 radiotelephone users, but hopes
to have 3m by the end of the century.

Mr Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, the United Nations special envoy to Rwanda, was
yesterday scheduled to meet President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda as part of
international efforts to persuade Rwanda's warring parties to end nearly a
month of civil strife. However, the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front said it
would not take part in any UN efforts to resolve the crisis until Mr
Booh-Booh had been withdrawn from the country. The US said yesterday it was
sending two envoys to the region. Tanzania's President Ali Hassan Mwinyi
said on Sunday government and rebels had agreed to talks in the northern
town of Arusha today. Refugees from the Rwanda fighting have been flooding
across the border into Tanzania in their thousands.

Pepsi-Cola moved yesterday to win back ground in Poland recently lost to
Coca-Cola by signing a joint venture with Whitman, Pepsi's Chicago-based
bottler in the US. Under the agreement PepsiCo will bring Whitman into its
bottling plant in Pniewy near Warsaw to build a distribution and marketing
network in the west and the north of the country. This is the first time
that PepsiCo will have brought one of its bottlers into central and eastern
Europe, and Whitman, which will be investing Dollars 100m (Pounds 68.4m) in
the joint venture over the next eight years, plans to build a further three
plants in Poland.
In Poland Coca-Cola has brought in Ringnes, its Norwegian bottler, as well
as Brau from Austria, and built distribution operations from scratch
starting two years ago. Next week the company will be opening three new
bottling plants in Krakow, Lodz and near Wroclaw built at a total cost of
Dollars 120m.

A consortium led by Bouygues, the French construction group, has won eastern
Europe's largest toll motorway concession. The Hungarian government, which
has been advised by Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, yesterday awarded
Bouygues the Dollars 350m project to finance, upgrade, extend and operate
Hungary's M5 motorway. The Hungarian Motorway International Consortium,
which teams Bouygues and German bank Commerzbank, defeated a group led by
Transroute International and GTM International, two French toll-road
operators. Bau Holding, the Austrian construction company and another
partner in the winning consortium, said earlier that the consortium would
have to raise Ft7bn (Pounds 45.7m) in equity capital of which Bau would
provide about 40 per cent.
The M5 concession is the largest project yet in Hungary's Dollars 3bn
programme to bring in private investors and developers, extend four
motorways from the capital to the country's borders and build two bridges
across the Danube. The M5 leads toward Serbia and uncertainty over traffic
projections has complicated financing and delayed its extension to the
frontier.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Indian inflation at highest level for two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure is mounting on the Indian authorities to act to curb inflation
after the publication of figures at the weekend showing the annual rate of
price increases rising to 10.6 per cent, the highest in nearly two years.
The figures, measuring the rate of increase in wholesale prices for the week
ending April 9, show inflation has climbed steadily from just 6.9 per cent
12 months ago.
With foreign exchange reserves at record levels, finance ministry officials
see little risk of a repeat of the 1991 economic crisis when inflation,
government borrowing and the balance of payments veered out of control. But
they admit that rising prices could undermine efforts to achieve stable
growth and to carry out further economic liberalisation.
Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, and Dr C Rangarajan, the governor
of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, have both emphasised in
recent speeches the dangers posed by inflation.
The government last month acted to try to protect the poor from possible
further increases in food prices by lifting restrictions on sugar imports.
However, it is not clear how much these measures will limit the overall
inflation rate rise, which is being driven not by changes in food prices but
by financial pressures - notably persistent government deficits and a surge
in foreign investment.
The fiscal deficit in the year to March soared to 7.3 per cent of gross
domestic product, compared with a target of 4.6 per cent, according to
finance ministry figures, which may yet be revised upwards.
Meanwhile, foreign investment has soared to about Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.4bn)
in 1993-94, far exceeding government forecasts and flooding the financial
markets with excess cash. The central bank estimates the money supply grew
by 17.9 per cent in the year, up from 14.6 per cent in 1992-93.
Commenting on India in its recent report, The World Economic Outlook, the
International Monetary Fund listed as 'troubling features' the rekindling of
inflation and the weakening of fiscal management.
The Reserve Bank is expected to try to curb further money supply growth when
it decides its credit policy for the period April-September at a
much-delayed board meeting due on May 14. It might balk at raising interest
rates since industrial growth is sluggish, but it could raise the minimum
deposits commercial banks are required to make at the Reserve Bank.
India's exports in the year to March grew 20.4 per cent to Dollars 22.17bn,
according to figures announced yesterday by the commerce ministry. They
provided fresh evidence that the government's liberalisation of foreign
trade and investment is bearing fruit. Imports grew 6.8 per cent to Dollars
23.1bn, leaving a trade deficit of Dollars 1.0bn, compared to Dollars 3.3bn
in 1992-93.

Pierre Cardin, the French fashion designer and head of a diversified retail
marketing group, yesterday launched a chain of shops in India, writes Stefan
Wagstyl in New Delhi.
Mr Cardin is following Benetton of Italy, France's Lacoste and other fashion
companies which have entered the Indian market in the past year, following
the liberalisation of foreign trade and investment.
The French designer will take a 26 per cent stake in a joint venture with
Indian partners.
The initial investment is Rs16.5m (Pounds 354,000) which will pay for a
design studio, workshops and three shops in Delhi, Bombay and Calcutta. If
the venture goes well, the partners plan to open more stores and raise their
investment to Rs250m.
Mr Cardin also sees India as a potential supply source for his joint venture
and franchised outlets in other countries.
Speaking at a news conference, he said: 'I am sure India will be another
Paris of Asia since its textiles and jewellery are so good.'
Mr Cardin's executives said India would be a particularly good source for
cotton and silk clothing.
The first exports would go in small quantities to Russia, but retailers in
all the 120 countries in which Pierre Cardin goods are marketed would also
be free to come and place orders.
Mr Cardin, who is 72 years old and opened his fashion house in 1950, said he
had no plans to retire. After India he was intending to visit two other
countries still waiting for their first Pierre Cardin investments - Vietnam
and Cuba.

Use of unleaded petrol in the European Union has accelerated past leaded
fuel for the first time, the EU's statistics office, Eurostat, said
yesterday. Unleaded petrol accounted for 53.3 per cent of all petrol used in
the Union last year, up from 47.1 per cent in 1992 and 40.7 per cent in
1991. Eight years ago, unleaded petrol accounted for less than 1 per cent of
the total, Eurostat said.
The 'greenest' country in the Twelve - at least as far as petrol is
concerned - is Germany. It accounted for 48 per cent of EU use of unleaded
fuel which took 88.7 per cent of its domestic market. However, in domestic
terms, the second greenest country was Denmark where unleaded petrol took
75.6 per cent of the domestic market, followed by the Netherlands where it
accounted for 75.1 per cent.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Court backs Fininvest investigators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investigations by Milan magistrates into the affairs of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Fininvest empire have resurfaced just as the media magnate
begins the final stages of consultations to form a government.
Yesterday a civil liberties court approved a request by the Milan public
prosecutor for an arrest warrant to be issued against Mr Marcello Dell'Utri,
head of Fininvest's advertising arm Publitalia, and two other senior
officials in the group on charges of alleged falsifying accounts.
Mr Berlusconi immediately described the court's move as a 'huge mistake'. Mr
Dell'Utri's lawyers have challenged the decision and the matter now goes to
the appeals court.
But the incident has underlined that magistrates are still investigating
Fininvest, controlled directly by Mr Berlusconi at least until last autumn
and whose chairmanship he only relinquished in January. Mr Dell'Utri, a
long-time associate of Mr Berlusconi, was the principal figure behind the
organisation of the businessman's Forza Italia political movement which
relied heavily upon Publitalia's contacts and offices.
The charges emerged in March during the election campaign and relate to
alleged illicit payments made for transfers of football players to Mr
Berlusconi's AC Milan. A lower court rejected the validity of the arrest
warrant requests.
Yesterday, the civil liberties court claimed there was a risk of evidence
being tampered with. It also cited documents sequestered from Mr Salvatore
Sciascia, head of Fininvest's central tax department, which showed
compromising close links between the latter and a senior official in the
finance ministry dealing with tax breaks on pay-TV.
The civil liberties court's decision came two days after two Milan
magistrates publicly rejected overtures from Mr Berlusconi to join his new
government. In particular Mr Berlusconi had been trying to persuade Mr
Antonio Di Pietro, the best known of the anti-corruption investigators, to
accept the interior ministry, justice ministry or become head of the police.
Opinion polls consistently show Mr Di Pietro to be the most popular figure
in Italy. But equally Mr Di Pietro, along with his fellow magistrates,
possesses the most sensitive and exhaustive information on corruption in
Italy. In announcing the refusal to switch to politics, the anti-corruption
magistrates reiterated their commitment to pursue investigations.
They backed this up by issuing a request to send 37 politicians, businessmen
and intermediaries for trial for involvement in the 'mother of all bribes' -
the L150bn (Pounds 62m) paid out to permit the Ferruzzi-Montedison group run
by the late Raul Gardini to pull out from its Enimont chemicals joint
venture with Eni, the state oil concern. The politicians include former
Socialist leader Bettino Craxi and Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the former Christian
Democrat party secretary, as well as Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader of the
Northern League.
In a separate move last Friday, Milan magistrates requested that Mr
Berlusconi's younger brother be sent for trial for three alleged bribes
totalling almost L1bn paid to facilitate property deals with Cariplo, the
Milan-based savings bank. One of these payments was allegedly made in 1982,
before Mr Berlusconi formally transfered his construction and property
interests to his younger brother.
All this suggests that, if Mr Berlusconi gains a vote of confidence for his
government next week, he will continue to be dogged by investigative
problems related to Fininvest. The broader issue of conflict of interest
between Fininvest and his role as premier is also far from resolved. Mr
Berlusconi said last Thursday he had selected three jurists to act as
watchdogs to prevent a conflict of interest and draw up special legislation
if necessary. Since then his choice of jurists has been roundly criticised.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Economic Digest: GDP soars in South Korea
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South Korean gross domestic product is forecast to grow by at least 8.5 per
cent in the first quarter of 1994 compared to 3.9 per cent a year earlier,
according to Mr Kim Myung-ho, governor of the central bank. GNP grew by 5.6
per cent during the whole of 1993. The country's industrial output shot up
10.2 per cent in the first quarter from 1 per cent in the same period last
year, the national statistical office reported. The state-funded Korea
Development Institute recently revised its projection for gross national
product to a real 7.6 per cent growth in 1994 from an earlier forecast of 7
per cent. 'With exports steadily increasing and the recovery in fixed
capital investment accelerating, GNP is expected to grow more quickly than
earlier forecast,' it said. An even more optimistic view comes from
Schroders Securities which revised its GNP projection for the year to 8.2
per cent from an earlier 6.5 per cent.
Japan's domestic vehicle sales are on a recovery path despite the
year-on-year slippage in April for the 13th month in a row, industry
officiala said yesterday. April's 6.6 per cent fall to 372,755 vehicles
should not be seen as a sharp drop, said an official of the Japan Automobile
Dealers' Association. One reason for the April fall, ironically, was a tax
cut. Customers bought cars in March as dealers offered discounts to offset
the effect of an April cut in the consumption tax.
Portugal's overall trade deficit fell 11.3 per cent last year to
Esc1,430.8bn (Pounds 5.55bn), with imports falling 4.6 per cent to 3,900.6
billion, according to official figures. Employment fell in large Italian
companies by 0.4 per cent in January compared with December and was 5.1 per
cent lower year-on-year, the Istat statistics bureau reported. The statistic
covers companies with more than 500 employees but excludes the construction
sector. Swedish new car registrations rose by 44 per cent in April to a
preliminary 15,750 from 10,919 in April, 1993, according to the Swedish car
retailers' association. The figure for the first four months of the year
showed a 27 per cent rise, to 52,939 from 41,612 in January-April 1993.

FT  03 MAY 94 / SPD risks votes with tax plan: German opposition party
leadership agrees election manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's opposition Social Democrats yesterday committed themselves to a
controversial tax reform package as the cornerstone of their election
platform, in spite of evidence that it could lose votes.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, SPD leader and candidate for the post of federal
chancellor, faced down sharp criticism of his leadership style to force the
party programme through his national executive committee with only one
abstention.
The package includes a large tax reform to make energy more expensive, but
stops short of calling for a national motorway speed limit, apparently for
fear of losing votes from the car-crazy nation. Instead, the SPD will
campaign for a Europe-wide speed limit, although Germany is the only EU
member state without one.
Mr Scharping said the programme still included a plan to switch the
government's 7.5 per cent 'solidarity surcharge' on income tax, needed to
pay for the soaring costs of German unification, to a 10 per cent surcharge
payable only by higher earners.
When it was unveiled in March, it caused an immediate outcry amongst the
broad mass of middle-income earners, and a slump in SPD popularity in the
opinion polls.
According to Mr Friedrich Bohl, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's closest ministerial
aide, the surcharge will last for at least five years, and possible longer,
in order to pay the annual cost of transfers to east Germany running at
between DM140bn (Pounds 56bn) and DM150bn (Pounds 60bn). 'That is an
enormous sum and we have to finance it, which is why we have the solidarity
surcharge,' he said.
However the SPD plan, although on the face of it a considerable relief to
the majority of taxpayers, is in danger of targeting precisely those more
prosperous floating voters it needs to win next October's election.
The programme also includes an 'ecological tax reform' which would switch
the burden of taxation from labour-related costs to energy and raw
materials, intended simultaneously to promote employment and discourage
energy consumption.
The SPD leader said that there would be no increase in the overall tax
burden from the level to be reached next year, describing it as 'a programme
based on solid finances. . . . and social justice'.
There would be a 'step-by-step reduction' in taxes and deductions hitting
payroll costs, alongside a step-by-step introduction of the new energy
taxes.
The third main economic plank of the party programme is a commitment to
promotion of more research and investment in new technologies, including a
programme of public investment in development of solar energy.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Gaullist splits widen over unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's persistent unemployment is driving an ever-deeper wedge between the
ranks of the country's governing Gaullists. Mr Jacques Chirac, the party
leader, yesterday endorsed the idea of a referendum on the issue to
underline his difference with the gradualist jobs policy of his
fellow-Gaullist prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur.
The unity of the Socialist left is, however, being equally threatened by the
creation of a strong rival list in next month's European parliament
elections by Mr Bernard Tapie, amid evidence that the populist Marseilles
politician is being egged on by President Francois Mitterrand.
Despite facing multiple investigations for alleged financial irregularities
and football bribery, Mr Tapie has now attracted heavyweight candidates to
his Mouvement des Radicaux de Gauche (MRG) list. They include Mrs Catherine
Lalumiere, former secretary general of the Council of Europe and an
associate of Mr Mitterrand.
'With such a team, one would need to be an incredibly bad captain not to go
far in this European (parliament) championship,' said Mr Tapie. He has just
been disqualified for life from involvement in football after the French
soccer authorities decided - ahead of an investigating judge - that Mr
Tapie's Olympique-Marseille rigged a game last year.
Mr Tapie claimed over the weekend that his only goal was to outscore the
far-right National Front in the Euro-poll; both are around 9-10 per cent in
the opinion polls. But if competition from Mr Tapie also ensures a poor
showing for Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist party leader may see his
candidacy in next year's presidential elections fatally undermined.
The jobs referendum idea came at a weekend RPR Gaullist rally ironically
from Mr Philippe Seguin, whose presidency of the national assembly ought to
incline him towards representative democracy rather than rule-by-plebiscite.
But Mr Seguin has emerged as the sharpest thorn in the side of Mr Balladur,
whose government the assembly leader dismissed as merely 'one of
transition'.
Mr Seguin gave no idea of how the unemployment issue might be made
susceptible to a yes/no referendum verdict, but his call for 'a complete
reversal' of jobs policy won endorsement from Mr Chirac, who spoke to RPR
faithful chanting 'Chirac president'. Mr Balladur had earlier tried to
persuade the party rally there was no contradiction between his economic and
labour policies, and that the best hope for reducing France's dole queues
was the gradual economic recovery now under way.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Scandal forces Gonzalez to cancel trip
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime minister, yesterday cancelled an official
trip he was due to start today to Romania and Bulgaria because of the
growing political storm over corruption and illicit gains in the country.
Mr Antoni Asuncion, the interior minister, submitted his resignation at the
weekend in a move which reflected acute embarrassment in the socialist
government over the disappearance of Mr Luis Roldan, former head of the
paramilitary Civil Guard, wanted for questioning by an examining magistrate.
Mr Gonzalez postponed accepting Mr Asuncion's resignation, telling him to
step up the search for Mr Roldan. The Madrid daily newspaper El Mundo is
expected today to publish an interview with Mr Roldan at a secret location,
in which he threatens to make damaging revelations. Before he disappeared,
Mr Roldan said he would reveal information that would harm the Socialists.
The affair, along with allegations of tax evasion by Mr Mariano Rubio,
former Bank of Spain governor, increasingly risks jeopardising the future of
Mr Gonzalez's minority government.
Mr Jordi Pujol, leader of the Catalan nationalist party on which the
Socialists depend for a parliamentary majority, raised the possibility of a
snap election if Mr Gonzalez fails to bring the situation under control. The
conservative opposition Popular party has issued fresh calls for Mr Gonzalez
to resign.
Mr Asuncion, a former director of prisons, was appointed only five months
ago. His predecessor, Mr Jose Luis Corcuera, resigned when a law including
new search powers was ruled unconstitutional. The latter has also come under
attack because of the Roldan affair.
Hundreds of police and army personnel are engaged in the search for Mr
Roldan, who faces arrest over alleged tax and other offences. A
parliamentary committee has heard evidence that he received millions of
dollars in commissions for building works.

Voters in the Netherlands go to the polls today in national elections which
could well force the governing Christian Democrats (CDA) into opposition for
the first time since 1918. The party appears to have made slight gains
recently, according to an opinion poll yesterday, but is still behind its
Labour party partners. A Nipo poll for Dutch television gave the Christian
Democrats 32 seats in the 150-seat Lower House and Labour 35.
Last week, opinion polls were giving the CDA 29 seats and Labour 35. At the
last elections in 1989 the CDA won 54 seats and Labour 49.
The Labour party, led by Mr Wim Kok, the current finance minister, is likely
to emerge as the largest party overall. This would put Mr Kok in the running
to become prime minister once the tortuous negotiations on the next
government coalition are completed.
Much will depend whether Mr Elco Brinkman, hand-picked successor of Mr Ruud
Lubbers, the CDA leader who is stepping down, can rally the party
rank-and-file in the last few hours of the campaign.
Mr Ger Schild, director of the Nipo polling organisation, said yesterday a
larger number of people than ever before would be going into the voting
booth without knowing exactly how they will vote. 'A far larger proportion
of people who voted CDA the last time around are as yet undecided about whom
to give their vote than are people who supported other parties last time,'
he said.
The crumbling of support for the current coalition will benefit the
right-wing Liberals, forecast to pick up seven more seats for a total of 29,
and the left-of-centre D66, up 15 seats at 27.
If these predictions hold true, Labour, the Liberals and D66 could rule
without the help of the CDA. The CDA and its forerunner parties have
belonged to every government coalition since full universal suffrage was
introduced in 1918.

FT  03 MAY 94 / MEPs fail to block vote on enlargement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union took a further step yesterday towards expanding its
membership from 12 to 16 member states, when a series of filibusters to
frustrate tomorrow's mandatory ratification vote in the European parliament
was defeated.
Both the plenary of the Strasbourg assembly and its foreign affairs
committee beat back attempts to get the biggest ever increase in the
Euro-club postponed.
The parliament's struggle to win more power from the member states and the
European Commission has held EU enlargement hostage for the past two months.
Two weeks ago, leaders of the dominant Socialist and Christian Democrat
blocs in Strasbourg agreed to put through the accession treaty, in exchange
for pledges that parliament would be closely associated with the 1996 review
of the Maastricht treaty and power-sharing in the EU.
But party managers in Strasbourg are still nervous about whether enough
Euro-MPs will turn up to ratify the enlargement, intended to bring Sweden,
Austria, Finland and Norway into the Union next January. Failure by the
parliament to ratify could easily sabotage the four applicant countries'
difficult referendums on membership this autumn, and very possibly
complicate ratification by national parliaments of the Twelve.
A first attempt yesterday by the far-right to get enlargement taken off this
week's agenda was easily defeated by 287 votes to eight, with four
abstentions.
The unsurprising size of this quashing of the Euro-fascists is less relevant
than the size of Euro-MPs' presence in Strasbourg, given that a third of
MEPs rarely turn up at all, that next month's elections are set to eject up
to two-thirds of present members, and that many of those hoping to survive
are on the campaign trail.
In tomorrow's vote, 260 of the 518 MEPs must approve enlargement. The
Socialists, the largest bloc, reckon they can guarantee 130-140 votes, but
there are worries about the Christian Democrats' pledge of 100 votes, while
the small groups are less disciplined.
The two big blocs both sent their leaderships to lobby yesterday's foreign
affairs committee, and to stall the infinite variety of possible procedural
snags.
Even Mr Jean Louis Bourlanges, the French Christian Democrat who has led the
campaign to hold up enlargement, dismissed yesterday's skirmishes as
'procedural trickery', arguing for a straightforward battle on Wednesday.

Mr Brinkman was scheduled to go to a final election rally last night in
Lisse, the centre of the country's flower bulb-growing region and a
traditional Christian Democrat stronghold.
Mr Kok was to appear at a meeting with voters at the nearby university town
of Leiden.
Both men, plus the leaders of the other main parties, were due to appear in
a final debate last night on Dutch television.
Although results of the election should be available by late tonight, it
could be weeks or even months before the parties cobble together a new
coalition.

A delay in expanding the European Union to 16 members would hurt European
business and could create another crisis of confidence in the EU, the
industry group Unice warned yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels.
Referring to today's vote in the European parliament, the Union of
Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe said the EU would benefit
economically by admitting Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden.
'A successful conclusion to enlargement will boost confidence in the
European Union and strengthen the policies to achieve renewed
competitiveness, sustained growth and increased job generation,' it said in
a statement.
The parliament's assent is necessary for the four countries to join the EU
as planned on January 1. Officials have predicted a 'yes' vote, but many MPs
have been irked by an arrangement on voting procedures for a bigger Union -
made to win over Britain to the expansion plans - which they say would
undermine the powers of the parliament, the EU's only directly elected body.
Unice said it shared the parliament's wish for efficient, transparent and
democratic institutions. 'But the applicant states, with their strong
traditions of openness and democracy, will only add strength, not weakness,
to the pursuit of such reform,' it said.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Heinz swaps TV adverts for direct marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HJ Heinz, the food manufacturer that brought the British public such
memorable advertising campaigns as Beanz Meanz Heinz, is planning to create
a new slogan - Heinz Meanz Direct Marketing.
Mr Tony O'Reilly, the flamboyant chairman and chief executive of the
Pittsburg-based international food group, is planning to end UK commercial
television advertising for his products this year and instead concentrate on
direct marketing.
Mr O'Reilly, whose career in marketing took off after he created the
Kerrygold campaign for Irish butter in his early 20s, believes the era of
mass marketing is giving way to more targeted selling techniques.
The Heinz plan to give up television advertising would be one of the most
radical marketing moves in recent years by a food manufacturer. It comes as
manufacturers of branded food products are facing growing competition from
cheaper, own-label goods produced by supermarkets. The Heinz account is one
of the longest established in television advertising.
Heinz has already built up a database of 5.6m homes in the UK that are heavy
users of the company's products.
Mr O'Reilly plans to send special discount vouchers directly to those homes,
thereby bypassing conventional advertising media such as television and
newspapers.
The discount vouchers will be for individual Heinz products, such as baked
beans, but also for groups of Heinz lines.
Mr O'Reilly has decided that direct marketing is the most cost effective way
of maintaining loyalty to the brands.
He sees the plan as the start of a 'guerrilla' campaign against the
increasing power of the large supermarket groups, which he believes
sometimes treat branded products cavalierly.
If Heinz goes ahead with its plan and proves that direct marketing to its
best customers works, it could be a blow to ITV, which has depended heavily
for its income on the advertising of mass market products, particularly
fast-moving grocery goods.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Steely dedication as new leader struts his stuff

<TEXT>
The world's sprightliest septuagenarian strutted his stuff across the stage
and into history last night.
Mr Nelson Mandela, glowing with the energy that comes from victory, led the
joyous high-stepping celebration of black South Africa's emancipation from
apartheid.
It began in the ballroom of a Johannesburg city hotel bedecked with bunting
and balloons in the black, green and gold of the African National Congress.
By mid-evening it had spread through the exuberant black townships.
'Free at last, free at last, thank God free at last,' declared South
Africa's next president, in the immortal words of Martin Luther King.
The famous phrase rang across South Africa and around the world as the
75-year-old Mr Mandela reached the final, triumphal summit of a journey that
began when he was a young advocate, and has taken him via Robben Island's
cells to leadership of his country.
Mr Mandela's declaration of victory included graceful acceptance of
departing President F. W. de Klerk's declaration of defeat but had a steely
undertone of single-minded dedication to his goal.
'I stand before you humbled by your courage, with a heart full of love for
all of you,' he said.
'Tomorrow the entire ANC leadership and I will be back at our desks, rolling
up our sleeves to begin tackling the problems our country faces . . . let's
get South Africa working. This means creating jobs, building houses,
providing education and bringing peace and security for all.'
Behind Mr Mandela the ranks of the ANC choir broke into song, the packed
audience joined in and the dancing began. Mr Mandela's elbows sawed the air.
The former boxer, moving like a cross between Mohammed Ali and Michael
Jackson, led the dancing of a night to remember.
From the stage came the resonant baritone of ex-president Kenneth Kaunda of
Zambia, whose country paid such a high price for its role as ANC
headquarters and who was an honoured guest.
On the dance floor the audience contained almost as many whites, coloureds
and Indians as blacks.
Groups in the hall began the toyi-toyi, the universal dance of black South
Africa - knees raised high, a sort of dancing on the spot, once performed at
the barricades of Soweto and black townships around the land but last night
an exuberant celebration of the new South Africa.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Roche in Dollars 5.3bn agreed takeover bid for Syntex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Roche of Switzerland is making a Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.6bn) agreed cash
bid for Syntex, a struggling US drugs company, to create a group ranking
fourth in the world pharmaceuticals sales league.
The deal would mark the first big takeover in the international
pharmaceuticals industry since the merger wave of the late 1980s that
created Bristol-Myers Squibb and SmithKline Beecham.
The agreed bid, at Dollars 24 a share, is cash-rich Roche's third big
acquisition in the past four years. As well as catapulting the Basle-based
group from tenth position in world sales, it would also lift it from
fifteenth to sixth in the crucial US market.
The offer represents a premium of 59 per cent over Syntex's closing price on
Friday of Dollars 15 1/8 . It values the company at about 14 times its
forecast earnings of Dollars 386m in the year to July 1994, broadly
commensurate with other US drug companies.
The move by Roche, the world's most highly valued pharmaceuticals group in
terms of market capitalisation, reflects growing pressures on drug companies
to introduce greater economies of scale and wider product ranges. Syntex's
market value had plunged by more than Dollars 8bn since the beginning of
1992 as it faced the expiry of patents on its market-leading
anti-inflammatory drug Naprosyn and the lack of new blockbuster products to
replace it in the near term.
Last year, Syntex had net income of Dollars 287m after Dollars 320m in
pre-tax restructuring charges. In the three months to January 31 it reported
a 20 per cent decline in net earnings to Dollars 95.8m.
Falling sales have put pressure on cashflow at the US company, which has
struggled to maintain a high dividend while supporting a research and
development budget that last year ran at 19 per cent of sales - high by
industry standards. As a Panama-registered company, it has benefited in the
past from a low tax rate.
Mr Paul Freiman, Syntex chairman, said: 'Given the speed of changes in the
industry and a radically different competitive situation, we ultimately felt
the need to align with a strong global partner.'
At their peak, annual sales of Naprosyn, used in treating rheumatoid
arthritis, reached Dollars 1bn.
Mr Fritz Gerber, chairman of Roche, said Syntex's substantial ethical
business and its leadership in drugs for treating pain and inflammation
'would ideally complement the portfolio of Roche and add a further centre of
excellence to the Roche group'.
Bucking the global trend of declining profit growth in the industry, Roche
last year boosted its net income 29 per cent to SFr2.48bn (Pounds 1.18bn) on
sales of SFr14.3bn, of which SFr7.8bn came from drugs.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Mandela claims victory for ANC: Jubilation in S Africa as
white rule ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
African National Congress leader Mr Nelson Mandela last night declared South
Africa 'free at last', as thousands of people of all races celebrated the
election victory of the ANC and the final demise of apartheid.
With joy and emotion, Mr Mandela proclaimed: 'Thank God almighty, we are
free at last.' Jubilation broke out in black townships around the country as
it became clear that the ANC was headed for control of the new parliament.
Even the vanquished entered into the spirit of the moment, with President F.
W. de Klerk conceding defeat with words of generosity and warmth for his new
boss in the government of national unity. Mr de Klerk ended a
nationally-televised address with the words 'God bless South Africa, Nkosi
Sikele', African nationalism's hymn of liberation, now adopted as one of
South Africa's two national anthems.
Mr Mandela said it was 'a joyous night for the human spirit' and recounted
the many phone calls of congratulation he had received from almost all of
South Africa's political leaders, including Mr de Klerk and right-wing
leader General Constand Viljoen.
Only Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party and Mr
Mandela's main black rival, failed to join in the national catharsis. Last
night he warned of possible trouble because not everyone would accept a
large national victory for the ANC.
Earlier, Mr de Klerk had pledged his support for an ANC-led government of
national unity. 'Mr Mandela has walked a long road and now stands at the top
of the hill. A man of destiny knows that beyond this hill lies another and
another. The journey is never complete. As he contemplates the next hill, I
hold out my hand to Mr Mandela in friendship and in co-operation,' he told
his party faithful.
As results continued to trickle in, it became clear that the two men would
be working together as the two largest parties in the new government. ANC
information director Pallo Jordan predicted that the ANC would not gain the
two-thirds majority needed to give it absolute power over the parliament in
the writing of a new constitution, but would score between 58 and 62 per
cent of the vote.
With 43.9 per cent of the estimated 23m votes counted, the ANC had a
commanding lead with 63.3 per cent of the national vote, with the National
Party running at 23.3 per cent. No other party came close to these totals:
the Inkatha Freedom Party scored 5.9 per cent of the vote, the rightwing
Freedom Front of Gen Constand Viljoen 2.8 per cent, the liberal Democratic
Party 1.8 per cent and the ultra-left Pan Africanist Congress 1.3 per cent.
However, it is impossible to extrapolate from these figures, because results
are being released without identifying the neighbourhoods from which they
come. With residential areas so sharply divided by race, and with party
support also following racial lines, a concentration of results from one
racial area can substantially falsify projections.
In the provincial elections, the ANC was the runaway leader in the Northern
Transvaal, Eastern Transvaal, North-West, Orange Free State and Eastern
Cape. It remains unclear whether it would win the Northern Cape, Natal and
the Pretoria Witwatersrand and Vereeniging area.
In one of the few clear outcomes, the ANC conceded it had lost the Western
Cape province - one of only two provinces which do not have a majority of
Africans - to the National party.
Many uncertainties remain. In the disputed Natal province, only a fraction
of votes have been counted, apparently from areas where Inkatha is strong.
No accurate projections can be made from these early results.

FT  03 MAY 94 / Heinz drops TV adverts in move to direct marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HJ HEINZ, the food manufacturer that brought the British public such
memorable advertising campaigns as Beanz Meanz Heinz, is planning to create
a new slogan - Heinz Meanz Direct Marketing.
Mr Tony O'Reilly, the flamboyant chairman and chief executive of the
Pittsburg-based international food group, is planning to end UK commercial
television advertising for his products this year and instead concentrate on
direct marketing.
Mr O'Reilly, whose career in marketing took off after he created the
Kerrygold campaign for Irish butter in his early 20s, believes the era of
mass marketing is giving way to more targeted selling techniques.
The Heinz plan to give up television advertising would be one of the most
radical marketing moves in recent years by a food manufacturer. It comes as
manufacturers of branded food products are facing growing competition from
cheaper, own-label goods produced by supermarkets. The Heinz account is one
of the longest established in television advertising.
Heinz has already built up a database of 5.6m homes in the UK that are heavy
users of the company's products. Mr O'Reilly plans to send special discount
vouchers directly to those homes, thereby bypassing conventional advertising
media such as television and newspapers. The discount vouchers will be for
individual Heinz products, such as baked beans, but also for groups of Heinz
lines.
Mr O'Reilly has decided that direct marketing is the most cost effective way
of maintaining loyalty to the brands.
The Heinz chief executive sees the plan as the start of a 'guerrilla'
campaign against theincreasing power of the large supermarket groups, which,
he believes, sometimes treat branded products cavalierly.
Mr O'Reilly wants to take control of discounting policy for his brands
rather than leaving it to the discretion of supermarkets. He is concerned
that Heinz products are often treated as mid-market products when they
should be priced and displayed as premium brands.
The Heinz chief executive is planning to send out his discount vouchers
unannounced and expects supermarkets to honour them. In particular, he hopes
stores will support Food Manufacturers' Federation rules against
'mis-redemption' - accepting vouchers in lieu of payment for any product as
opposed to those intended.
If Heinz goes ahead with its plan and proves that direct marketing to its
best customers works, it could be a blow to ITV.

FT  03 MAY 94 / (CORRECTED) Management (The Growing Business): Spotlight
falls on invisibles contribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY

<TEXT>
Correction (published 10th May 1994) appended to this article.
Raffo, a designer for the packaging industry, has just won its first
significant export order - a six-figure contract with Snapper of the US for
a new design of bottle cap.
The Chester-based group already spends half its marketing budget in
continental Europe and expects to have raised orders from outside the UK to
more than 50 per cent of sales in 1996.
Raffo is part of an army of small and medium-sized companies exporting a
huge variety of services from the UK - published and recorded music,
education, management consultancy, design - all contributing to job creation
and the invisible trade surplus.
Anecdote suggests these small exporters are increasingly successful. More
than 20 per cent of the companies receiving the Queen's Awards for Exports
last month were selling services abroad. Many were smaller companies. But
economists have only the vaguest idea of how important smaller exporters of
services are to the economy.
The UK's invisible export effort is dominated by the City of London which
earned a net Pounds 18bn at the last count in 1992 from fees, commissions,
interest, property returns and dividends.
'Clearly, the City is very important but it is by no means the whole story,'
says Jan Hall, chairman of the small firms committee of the British Overseas
Trade Board which is looking at how DTI export initiatives can be tailored
for service companies.
One attempt to identify the invisibles contribution of smaller companies has
been made by Robert Pringle, of consultants Graham Bannock &amp; Partners.
Pringle starts with official Central Statistical Office estimates which
suggest that 39 per cent of invisible earnings from consultancy (management,
engineering, surveying, architecture, advertising and property consultancy)
comes from companies with turnover of less than Pounds 2.5m.
Pringle then makes the somewhat heroic assumption that the same pattern is
repeated across all small business, education and leisure service companies.
He concludes that these small service companies probably produced invisible
earnings of about Pounds 5bn in 1992.
To put this in perspective, Pringle says the City's real service exports
were Pounds 4.3bn - a figure he arrives at after deducting interest,
property income and overseas dividends which he says are not derived from
true services. The analysis is crude, because of the lack of hard data, but
makes a valid point.
'In the past you have had a picture of invisible earnings dominated by the
City,' says Pringle. 'The techniques of trade promotion should take into
account this crucial sector.'
At the moment almost none of the Department of Trade and Industry's export
promotion activities specifically targets service companies. But there are
signs that it is considering such a focus to be worthwhile. The DTI is
trying to recruit executives with exporting experience from the
private-sector service industry to promote invisible exports.
Officials at the DTI are also responding. April 25 saw 21 DTI country desk
officers visiting a new grouping of design consultants, the British Design
Initiative, whose members demonstrated how they were trying to sell British
design abroad.
Maxine Horn, managing director of the BDI, says her company represents a
range of designers, in product, packaging, corporate identity and retail
interiors. The group was set up because no one else helped promote the
export of design.
Pringle says any further growth in the invisible trade surplus is unlikely
to be led by the City of London but by Britain's smaller companies. This is
debatable. But there is a strong case for the DTI and trade organisations to
improve their support for the many companies already exporting their
services.

FT  30 APR 94 / International Company News: LVMH lifts holding in Guerlain
in share deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods group, is expanding its perfume
interests by raising its stake in Guerlain, the French fragrance house, in a
FFr1.96bn (Dollars 330m) share deal.
The Guerlain deal is the first of a number of investments that LVMH is
expected to make following yesterday's conclusion of negotiations to unravel
a cross-shareholding agreement with Guinness, the UK drinks concern, which
will dramatically reduce its debt.
Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, has made no secret of his plans to
expand its luxury goods interests after the Guinness deal.
One of the likeliest areas of expansion is jewellery. LVMH has been mooted
as a prospective purchaser for Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, the French jeweller, or
Tiffany, the US group.
The Guerlain transaction is, typically for Mr Arnault, an intricate deal
that involves reshuffling his complex web of cross-shareholdings.
Christian Dior, the French fashion house that owns a stake in LVMH, will
cede 12 per cent of its shares to the Guerlain family in return for 2 per
cent of Guerlain and a 49.9 per cent stake in Djedi, the holding company
that owns 85.8 per cent of Guerlain.
Dior will then sell the Djedi shares to LVMH, which already owns 14.2 per
cent of Guerlain, for FFr1.96bn. The Guerlain family has also given Dior
pre-emptive rights over its remaining Djedi shares.
The acquisition of Guerlain, one of the oldest names in perfume, is an
important move for LVMH, which already owns the Dior and Givenchy
fragrances. Guerlain last year made net profits of FFr162m on sales of
FFr2bn.
The LVMH deal follows the announcement earlier this month that L'Oreal, the
French cosmetics and fragrance group, was acquiring full control of Cosmair,
its US distribution arm.

FT  30 APR 94 / International Company News: CS Holding wants to buy stake in
Austrian bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CS Holding, the Swiss financial group that owns Credit Suisse, confirmed
yesterday that it wanted to buy a substantial stake in
Creditanstalt-Bankverein, the second largest Austrian bank, from the
Austrian ministry of finance.
Mr Rainer Gut, chairman, said that CS Holding wanted to establish Austria as
one of its 'domestic bases' after Switzerland and the US, and had contacted
the Austrian finance ministry to express its interest.
Mr Gut said he believed the ministry would sell 28 per cent of
Creditanstalt's ordin-ary voting shares, or 20 per cent of total equity. The
ministry has undertaken to dispose of part of its 69.6 per cent voting
equity stake this year.
He said that if it was successful in buying a stake, CS Holding would
probably want to raise it in time.
Mr Gut added that CS Holding was particularly interested in Creditanstalt
because its traditional links with businesses in central and eastern Europe
would give the group a significant edge in building earnings there.
Mr Gut spoke at CS Holding's annual results presentation in London at which
the group announced a 20 per cent rise in its dividend to SFr18 per share,
plus the issue of a shareholder warrant with a theoretical value of SFr12.
CS Holding's interest is unlikely to please Creditanstalt's board of
management, which does not want a significant minority holder to emerge.
Both Credit Suisse and Union Bank of Switzerland reported earnings declines
in the first quarter of the year, as a result of volatility in bond and
equity markets in contrast to the extremely good trading conditions of 1993.
However, the two top Swiss banking groups both expressed confidence in the
outturn for the year as a whole, pointing to the recovery in the Swiss
economy and the declining trend in provisions for bad and doubtful loans.
Total group assets of Credit Suisse at the end of March were 1 per cent
higher than at the end of 1993, at SFr233.9bn (Dollars 162.4bn). Lendings
were flat at SFr123.4bn and customer deposits rose 2 per cent to SFr157.9bn.
UBS said total assets of the parent company, at SFr240.3bn, were 4.1 per
cent higher at the end of March than at the end of December. Lendings were
up 1.8 per cent to SFr148.6bn and customer deposits gained 2.6 per cent to
SFr130.6bn.
Following a surprisingly lifeless debate, the annual meeting of Union Bank
of Switzerland yesterday rejected a motion by BK Vision, its largest
shareholder, to reduce the maximum size of the board of directors from 25 to
nine.

<TEXT>
Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance (CNP), one of the French state-controlled
financial institutions scheduled for privatisation, saw net profits rise by
12.5 per cent to FFr1.26bn (Dollars 210m) in 1993 from FFr1.12bn in 1992,
despite the pressures on the financial sector.
Mr Pierre Darnis, chairman, said the group was on course for further growth
this year. He forecast an increase in net profits of between 10 per cent and
15 per cent for 1994, the same rate of growth that the group has maintained
for each of the past seven years.
CNP, which specialises in personal insurance, saw turnover rise by 51.6 per
cent last year to FFr64.3bn from FFr42.4bn. Pre-tax profits before
exceptional items rose by 9.2 per cent to FFr1.53bn from FFr1.4bn. The board
proposed raising the dividend to FFr10 from FFr9.

FT  30 APR 94 / International Company News: German tool maker files for
protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deckel Maho, the German machine tool group, yesterday filed for protection
from its creditors just 12 months after it was formed through the merger of
two rival companies.
It gave up the struggle after one of its backers refused to take part in a
bank-led rescue package.
PSV, an incorporated industry association which guarantees member-companies'
pension schemes, said it would not take over responsibility for Deckel
Maho's total DM45m (Dollars 26.3m) pension commitments. It offered only to
pay current retirement benefits for three years.
The association, which represents more than 30,000 companies, said earlier
this week it had to consider possible future demands on its resources.
A life-saving package costing several hundred million D-Marks in written-off
debt and new capital, agreed between a banking consortium and Bavarian state
financial institutions, was conditional on PSV's full participa-tion.
Deutsche Bank, which together with the Bayerische Vereinsbank last year led
the supposed rescue-merger project, said yesterday it was trying to find a
constructive solution.
If Deckel Maho is allowed to collapse, this could bring problems for
Gildemeister which has a foreign distribution joint venture with the
troubled concern and which in the past has been named as a possible white
knight.
The group, which is reducing capacity and slimming its workforce from 1,800
to 1,200, made a net loss in the year to mid-1993 of DM45m on sales of
DM310m.
This week's crisis coincides with the first signs of recovery in the machine
tool business. Orders rose in the first quarter of this year for the first
time since 1991.

FT  30 APR 94 / UN says 250,000 flee Rwanda slaughter
</HEADLINE>

   THE UN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali yesterday urged the
Security Council to consider authorising the dispatch of a large military
force to halt the slaughter in Rwanda, where he said 200,000 people may have
been butchered in the past three weeks, Reuter reports from the UN.
The killings have resulted in a huge flow of refugees, with the UN refugee
agency reporting that more than 250,000 Rwandans had flooded into Tanzania
in the previous 24 hours in the largest and fastest exodus it had ever
witnessed.
The UN chief made the recommendation in a letter to the council only eight
days after it voted unanimously to reduce a 2,500-strong UN force sent to
that central African country last year to only about 270.
Citing evidence that new massacres were being planned, Mr Boutros-Ghali
said: 'I urge the Security Council re-examine the decisions which it took
 . and to consider again what action, including forceful action, it could
take, or could authorise member states to take, in order to restore law and
order and end the massacres.'
Mr Boutros-Ghali did not say how many troops might be needed to end the
slaughter, which erupted after Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and
President Cyprien Ntaryamira of neighbouring Burundi were killed April 6
when their plane was shot down as it was landing at Kigali, the capital.
The US yesterday circulated a resolution within the Security Council that
would impose a total trade embargo against Haiti and punish its military
rulers. US diplomats said they were sending copies of the draft to the other
14 members of the council.
They hoped the resolution will be adopted next week. The council has already
imposed an oil and arms embargo against Haiti.
The new sanctions would ban all trade, except food and medicine. The
resolution would also give key military and police figures 15 days to leave
office or the country.

Trustees for two Maxwell Communications pension schemes last night filed
lawsuits in New York against Goldman Sachs, charging that the US investment
bank was negligent in allowing Mr Kevin Maxwell in 1991 to transfer millions
of pounds from the pension funds to companies controlled by the Maxwell
family.
The lawsuits, filed by MCP Pension Trustees and MGN Pension Trustees, seek
punitive damages against Goldman and compensation of Dollars 47m (Pounds
31m), the amount the trustees claim Mr Maxwell appropriated from the funds
with Goldman's aid.
Goldman said the claims against it were 'without merit' and represented an
'expensive and time-consuming distraction.'

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A week of lobbying over China's Most Favoured Nation status in Washington
ended with a blast from Beijing at the Dalai Lama for refusing to abandon
hope of independence for his Tibetan homeland.
The lengthy statement issued by Beijing may have been an attempt to defend
China's record in Tibet in the run-up to the US decision on renewing China's
low-tariff trade status.
Respect for Tibet's religious and cultural heritage is one of the factors
President Bill Clinton has said he will consider in making a decision on MFN
by early June. He has pressed China to open talks with the Dalai Lama. The
statement followed a meeting between Mr Clinton and his vice-president Al
Gore with the Dalai Lama on Thursday.
Yesterday Mrs Anson Chan, Hong Kong's chief secretary, was set for talks
with Mr Gore, in the last and most important meeting of a week spent
lobbying in Washington against withdrawal of MFN on human rights grounds.
She spent the week trying to persuade opponents of MFN renewal that human
rights advances could better be achieved through trade than by isolating
China.
'I don't think anybody else on this earth is more concerned about human
rights than Hong Kong,' she said. The city-state is to revert from British
to Chinese rule in 1997.
With just five weeks left before Mr Clinton must decide on MFN, other
Tibetan interests were lobbying this week. The Tibet Fund, a non-profit
group which helps support Tibetan refugees, this week sent each member of
the US Congress a tie of Tibetan design, bearing tags with pictures and
names of individual Tibetan children.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US and Russian-led delegation yesterday met Bosnian Serb officials in
their mountain headquarters for 'tentative and exploratory' talks aimed at
salvaging the peace process.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, told the nine-man delegation,
which also includes United Nations and European envoys, that UN sanctions on
Belgrade must be lifted to make any progress towards an overall settlement,
said his spokesman, Mr John Zametica.
'The international community has to decide if it is more important to
maintain sanctions or achieve peace,' he said in Pale, the makeshift Serb
capital near Sarajevo.
The contact group, headed by Mr Charles Redman, the US special envoy, and,
Mr Aleksei Nikiforov, the Russian representative, held the first
face-to-face meeting with Bosnian Serb leaders since their forces complied
with a Nato ultimatum on Wednesday to withdraw from a 20km exclusion zone
round Gorazde, the embattled Moslem enclave which is designated a UN safe
area.
The group was due to return to Sarajevo for more talks with the Moslem-led
Bosnian government. On Thursday, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian
president, said he would consider a two to three month ceasefire to allow
the peace talks to take place.
Bosnian Serb leaders were likely to reject the offer. They claim the Bosnian
army is preparing to launch an offensive on the northern Serb corridor
linking Belgrade with Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Croatia.
A senior US official yesterday said Bosnian Serb forces had moved their
weapons from Gorazde northwards to the corridor. This heightens fears that
Serbs will soon try to widen the corridor.
Bosnian and Serbian media yesterday reported fighting around Brcko, at the
eastern end of the corridor.
Serb leaders have called for a complete cessation of hostilities in a bid to
cement their military gains. Their forces control about 70 per cent of the
war-ravaged republic.
The attempt to revive the peace process also included talks in Norway
between Lord Owen, the EU mediator, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN mediator
and Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian special envoy.
'The crisis has created new possibilities,' Mr Stoltenberg said. 'We have a
stability and calm in Bosnia for the moment which we have not had for a long
time.'
Mr Stoltenberg said the only chance for a formal end of the fighting and a
peace accord soon was agreement between the US, Russia, France, Germany and
Britain and the United Nations,
The mediators discussed preparations for a meeting of foreign ministers from
the five nations along with the United Nations.
Meanwhile, Croatia yesterday accused Serb forces of violating the
international agreement to withdraw from a 20km zone along the 1,600km
confrontation line in Croatia.

FT  30 APR 94 / Rules to trap the unwary: Despatches
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Being away from Europe for a couple of weeks certainly helps put the old
world in perspective. One of the pleasures of visiting the United States is
the enjoyment of the marvellously deregulated world of work the
International Monetary Fund commended so vigorously last week to west
Europeans.
And yet the experience of the realities of American life is one of incessant
and constantly increasing regulation. Only Germany and Switzerland get near
it in European terms, but then the US has often seemed to owe more to its
German heritage than to the British. Look at the food, the picnics, the
houses and the taste for short trousers.
But maybe I am alone in finding myself in a sometimes Kafkaesque world, the
world of a bombardment of instructions. I recall the shock I felt, nearly a
quarter of a century ago, on boarding a Greyhound bus in California and
seeing a sign which read: 'Smoking permitted unless prohibited.'
Today, of course, there is no such latitude: 'If you smoke you will be shot'
would be a more likely warning. Shooting is one of those areas which remains
highly deregulated, requiring no licence, certificate of proficiency or
permit to do it.
This is probably because it involves no communication, in any real sense,
between human beings. Once you enter that sphere, life consists of hazards
of enormous complexity. Ordering food is merely one, the multifarious ways
in which an egg can be prepared and the varieties of bread in which the
contents of a sandwich might be incarcerated provide unexpected pitfalls for
the stranger.
Those who choose to visit 'the nation's capital', as Washington quaintly
calls itself, should realise it is no use asking a taxi driver to take you
to the White House. Every destination has to be noted by its address. Well,
not quite its address, but the street it is on and the nearest street that
crosses it. So the White House becomes 'Sixteenth and Pennsylvania'.
Arrivals at Dulles international airport give an insight into the New World
of communication, the need to state the obvious. As you pass from your
aeroplane to the immigration hall by a curious car on stilts known as a
mobile lounge and cross the runways en route, small signs say, 'Aircraft
have priority'. Similarly, if you travel the wrong way down freeways, signs
will shout 'Wrong way'.
I imagine the purpose of such deliberate redundancy is to avoid the
attentions of that caste of superior American beings who play a role that
approximates to that of the communist party in the old Soviet Union: the
lawyers.
Their control over national life is astonishing, their contribution to
national well-being minimal. A friend of mine who, as an act of charity,
masterminded the sale of a medical group practice last year, received visits
nearly once a week from officials proffering writs to the value of Dollars
5m. That, apparently, was normal. The purpose was to ensure any legal suits
could be underway before the transfer of ownership took place.
Aspects of the old Soviet Union have appeared in the state of Maryland
today: homeowners have to sort their garbage into five bags. They are then
flung into the same truck. (Glass, it is argued, will not break because bags
that contain it land on newspapers.)
The bags are then sorted by teams of poorly-paid individuals. In Newark,
garbage inspectors have the right to open bags in the street to see if the
garbage has been correctly sorted and to take Polaroid photographs of
offending materials to provide evidence for legal action.
Another Soviet-style trick is the existence of conflicting regulations to
trap the unwary.
A fine was highlighted last week in Dr Gridlock, a regular column providing
a banquet of information in the Washington Post on local traffic problems.
June Bashkin complained that she parked her car at a meter, got back within
the appointed time and found Dollars 50 ticket. The meter was placed in a no
parking area and subsequent inspections have shown other cars regularly
plastered with tickets. Another profitable little job for the state sector.
Once you rid yourself of these problems and drive on the open road, the
difficulties multiply. There are, according to American friends, about 10
times as many signs on the highways as one might find in Europe. They are
contradictory and of little help when seeking a small town or unusual
destination. In Miami such systems have had lethal results for tourists.
But then one of the paradoxes of the free and flexible market is that it can
work only with a high degree of regulation. And that is how free markets can
create jobs.

FT  30 APR 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: For the want of a nail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I arrived home on Thursday evening, grey with exhaustion, to find Miss Lee,
my executive assistant, serving Vera Lynns (lime, tonic, gin) to a trio of
young lawyers encamped in my sitting room. I could tell they were lawyers -
not from their suits and briefcases or red, buttony eyes but from the stench
of money that swirled about them like the smell of rotting mangrove in a
moon-less swamp.
I did not interrupt. From what I could see they were in awe of Miss Lee, who
was certainly looking a picture and who spoke to them throatily while
dispensing the Vera Lynns. Miss Lee, a Thatcherite, is at present
celebrating the return of the glam-rock influence to London haut couture,
and was wearing something sequinny, in a new, miracle tulle - saffron, I
suppose you'd say it was.
I retreated to the lower floor of our Notting Hill duplex. Cooked dinner.
Cleaned the kitchen floor. Spent some quality time with the cat. Watered the
camellias on the patio. Laid the table with the laughing-kookaburra
placemats that we use in mid-week. And waited for Miss Lee to finish her
business with the mangrove-heads and join me for dinner.
Which she did, eventually, with a magical rustle of tulle. We started our
meal. Miss Lee poured herself a glass of house red, from a winery near
Quillabamba, but could not touch her food. She was obviously excited.
She said: 'I expect you are wondering, Michael, why my lawyers were here
this evening, non?' It turned out that Miss Lee had been entranced by the
news that a High Court judge in London had ruled that a man, Martyn Ginder,
was two-thirds to blame for an accident in which his wife, most
unfortunately, had broken her back while trying to rescue their young son
from a car-port roof.
The husband had been asked at least 10 times in three months to mend the
window through which the child had climbed out. As a result, the wife, now
wheelchair-bound, had claimed an estimated Pounds 500,000 against her
husband's household insurance policy. Damages will be assessed at a later
date.
'All deeply upsetting,' said Miss Lee, stroking her glass. 'But also
educational. Hence the attendance here this evening of my lawyers, who are
insisting, Michael, that your household insurance policy be raised to Pounds
2m tout de suite, plus half a million for various extensions.'
'Extensions?'
'I shall come to those. But let us deal first with basic household
liability. As you know, Pounds 2m, these days, is neither here nor there. It
is a very small sum, though large enough, just, to cover against damage to
my person occasioned by your limpness on the DIY front.'
'DIY?'
'Do-it-yourself. Household maintenance. Running repairs. Toolbox. Men's
work. I have asked you 20 times since Christmas to re-hang the John Bellany
in the sitting room. It is a major work of art, no one can deny, but also
immensely heavy. My lawyers dread to think what damage it might cause should
it fall and strike me - and all for the want of a nail.
'There are other things about the flat that fill me with alarm. That
ill-fitting drain-cover which allows all the rats hereabouts, bombed as they
are on high-class dope, to cavort across our patio morning, noon and night.
That bracket-thing over the cooker. The carpet by the stairs. You are the
man around here, Michael. The place should be ship-shape. That is your
role.'
I said: 'You know I'll have no truck with this role-playing crap.'
'Exactly,' said Miss Lee. 'Which is why my lawyers are adamant that the time
has come to raise your household policy to a nice Pounds 2m, so that my
person is protected.'
'What are these extensions?'
'I was about to come to those. My lawyers maintain that your household
policy should be extended so as to insure me against stress or psychological
damage caused, or likely to be caused, by matters or situations other than
mere maintenance.'
'Example?'
'Well . . . riding around in the Rover. My lawyers agree that a woman of my
sensitivity is highly vulnerable to stress if she is obliged to travel
around in a six-year-old Rover car driven by a person as eccentric as you.
There are various other matters - bedroomy, nocturnal - to be covered by the
extensions. Half a million should do it, just about.'

FT  30 APR 94 / Private View: The billionaire without a penny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Run your finger down the form guide to British billionaires and you will
find, tucked in behind the Duke of Westminster at number eight and valued at
around Pounds 1.35bn, the name Hinduja.
Who?
The Hindujas, four brothers, belong to that mysterious caste of
international middlemen who spin the wheels of the world economy. Originally
from Sind in the Indus valley, a cradle of civilisation and now part of
Pakistan, the family made its first fortune as traders in Iran before moving
headquarters to London when they saw the Shah was about to fall.
Srichand P. Hinduja ('Mr SP') is the eldest brother and chairman of the
group. As one would expect of the head of a private empire whose
secretiveness has encouraged whispers of financial scandal, or of a father
who has lost his only son in tragic circumstances, he very rarely succumbs
to interviews.
He sat, a diminutive figure, at the head of a big polished table high up in
New Zealand House in London's Haymarket. A secretary placed a tape recorder
at his elbow and Mr SP opened the interview: Had I been to India? Had I
interviewed other Indians, other Asians? What did I know about the group?
He was as suspicious as a mussel exposed by the tide, slow and circuitous in
his replies, warily parrying each question as if expecting to be
disbelieved. But when he talked about his 22-year-old son Dharam (Hinduja
does not accept the coroner's verdict of suicide) the shell began to open
and soon he was calling me 'my dear friend'.
Apart from commodity trading and finance, the brothers have asset management
and investment banking in Switzerland, motor manufacture (Ashok Leyland) and
chemicals (IDL Chemicals) in India, oil deals (Gulf Oil Trading) and
infrastructure projects almost everywhere. They have just set up one of the
first private banks in India in 40 years. They have a staff of 20,000 and a
turnover of 'several billions'.
What they own, they own collectively. 'All the houses belong to everybody,
all the cars belong to everybody,' Hinduja senior said. 'There is no 'this
is mine, this is yours'. All the children belong to everyone. We have kept
one kitty. Everyone works as a duty. There are no wills.'
So you, Mr SP, don't have . . . ?
'Not a single penny]'
Gopichand ('Mr GP'), the second brother and group president also based in
London, is rounder and jollier. He and SP jostle each other verbally like
competing schoolboys. The third brother, Prakash, runs the financial arm,
AMAS, in Geneva and the fourth brother, Ashok, the Indian businesses.
They are vegetarian, teetotal and non-smoking. Hinduja senior does not even
drink tea, coffee or fruit juice. 'I don't want to depend on things which if
tomorrow I don't get I feel sorry about,' he explained.
'My parents used to live this way. They thought it was religious. We are not
living like this because of religion but because we have made research on
what is good for the human body.'
From their father Parmanand ('the late father') they inherited not only the
first Dollars 1m but also a sense of philanthropic duty. Their Hinduja
Foundation supports a hospital and colleges in India, scholarships to
Cambridge University, research at Harvard and various youth adventure,
artistic and sporting concerns. This was to honour the Vedic tradition of
altruism, where self-promotion is rewarded with disgrace.
The brothers refuse to deal in meat, because that offends a scriptural
injunction against killing animals, or in alcohol, gambling or racecourses.
What about weapons? I asked, recalling newspaper allegations, later
retracted, that they had traded arms in Iran.
'We don't deal in weapons. We were supplying the defence industry with
non-ferrous metals, batteries, lead, antimony, chemicals. But where there is
a financial package to be organised, or counter-trade to be organised we
will do it. Let's make it very clear. We do not promote arms sales. But if
someone asks us to arrange the raw material end of a counter-trade, we will
gladly assist.'
Gopichand was one of those named in a prosecution report following the
Bofors scandal of 1987 when bribes were alleged to have been paid by the
Swedish company to secure a howitzer order from the Indian Government. The
allegations were dropped after a Delhi high court ruling. Srichand said he
had never denied having counter-trade relations with Bofors' parent group,
but was not involved in arms promotion. The accusation was the work of
political enemies.
Politically-motivated 'character assassination' was also to blame for the
fact that AMAS had been involved in a Swiss investigation into drug-money
laundering this year. It was not a bank, said Hinduja, and could not accept
deposits.
'Because we don't speak, we don't blow our trumpet, people think 'Oh, there
must be something going on.' If I were to publish the prosecutor's letter
people will be astonished to see how they are being taken for a ride.'
So the accusation against AMAS . . . ?
' . . . is bullshit.'
If secrecy leads to these false suspicions, why not open up?
'A private group, being a trader and banker, doesn't have an obligation to
the public or media to say why and how I have made my money. But if they are
interested to know what business I am doing, that is very open.' Once the
deals were complete the media could easily find out about them, he added.
There was nothing wrong in paying or receiving commissions. Every banker or
professional did it. Even those who offered access - 'the door-openers' -
were entitled to charge.
'I only see a problem where the system, like in the developing countries, is
not of the free market, where it is more protected. This leads to a lot of
corruption. I am against the corruption. I have been lobbying in every
country that they should leave business to the business people.'
Often described as friends of Baroness Thatcher, the brothers have been
entertained in Downing Street and named in the press as donors to the
Conservative Party. Was that true?
Hinduja embarked on a rambling answer about how the brothers never courted
publicity, how much they were misunderstood, but how their consciences were
clear. 'Let anybody say anything. It doesn't matter to us.'
He went to Downing Street and other such functions, he said, to promote
understanding between his host country and his mother country, just as he
does between Iran and India.
Mr Hinduja, I said, do you give money, have you given money, to the
Conservative Party?
'OK. Let me tell you. We have never given money to any political party for
the party funds. We have been attending the balls, Conservative balls,
Labour balls, where we take our friends to observe what is happening, how
they are having these functions, how they collect funds . . . with
auctions.'
Have they asked you for money?
'Well, they do keep on inviting us so that we would contribute for the
funds. They know that we are rich men, but most of our contributions have
been for dinners, like contributing for good causes where we know that it is
directly concerning mankind. But what you have read in the newspapers we
don't like to contradict. We don't like to get into that controversy.'
Later he said: 'I am not saying that I don't like to make money. But my
first objective is how I can offer my services to mankind, which can bring
in better understanding and lesser miseries and sufferings in the human
race.
'It is obvious in a free market each will get a slice of cake according to
his capability. If I am one of them, there is nothing wrong in it. But I
haven't started with the objective of how big the slice of the cake will be
for me.
'I have not told any head of state 'You have to do this for me.' On the
contrary, I keep on telling them that there should not be any favour given
to any businessman, so that later on people can finger you and finger me. I
am against protection. I say there should be a competition, open and fair.
Then let us see who wins the race.'
If his business philosophy is free market and secular, Hinduja's private
philosophy is increasingly mystical. His chief memorial to his dead son is a
research institute set up last October with the help of Columbia University
in New York to study religious texts for the pre-scientific knowledge they
contain. 'This knowledge can benefit the entire world with proven scientific
applications,' he said.
Dharam died of severe burns in London two years ago after he and the girl he
had secretly married were traced to a hotel in Mauritius. Press reports
described his death as a suicide pact and blamed it on the family's
rejection of the girl as a suitable daughter-in-law.
But Hinduja senior - who was at his son's bedside but refused to attend the
inquest - does not accept either assumption. 'It is a mystery to the family.
This is all I can tell you. That is why we are still very much confused.'
Did you try to stop the marriage?
'My dear friend, people are free to write what they like. But this is not
the truth. This is all I can tell you. I cannot say that it was a suicide. I
cannot say that in our family one is not allowed to live and operate the way
he or she wants.'
Do you blame yourself at all?
'No, because if there was any blame I would not have revived. I would have
gone crazy. On the contrary I am going in such directions and getting such
enlightenment that I feel more strength, more and more confidence.'
His next project is to make a Hollywood film, 'the biggest production ever
made', to convey his message to the world.
What is it about?
'What is everyone in this world interested in?'
Security?
'Not security.'
Contentment?
'Can you name in one word something everyone wants?'
Self-respect?
'No. Success. Success is the bottom line of everything. There is no human
being in this world who says he doesn't want success.'

FT  30 APR 94 / A modern woman's place . . .: Dominic Lawson considers a
controversy over the role of middle-class mothers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week The Spectator published an article called: 'The Misery of Women'.
It argued, in essence, that the British middle class woman was never
satisfied. If she did not have a job, she was envious of those women who
did: men were not so bored by them. If she did have a job, she was envious
of those women who did not: they did not have to put up with the unpleasant
and uncouth manners of men in the workplace.
And, argued the author of the piece, James Buchan, both categories of modern
middle class women envied their mothers, who were never expected to work,
and were not ashamed to spend a life of leisure or pure domesticity.
While I thought Buchan's article both poignant and telling, it had not
occurred to me that it went beyond the painfully obvious. However, it was
denounced, the very next day, by the Daily Express as 'spectacularly
controversial', and was abused for its alleged foolishness and insensitivity
by columnists in such diverse publications as the Evening Standard and the
Independent on Sunday.
Do I need to tell you that every piece of such criticism was written by a
woman, all immediately identifiable as members of the second category of
Buchan's miserable middle class? Buchan's analysis was, at heart, Marxist:
the humanity of our woman was being destroyed by the insatiable hunger of
capitalism for cheaper sources of labour. That is why, he argued 'housework
has been mechanised and the fridge is stocked with Marks and Spencer recipe
dishes and the birth-rate is so low.' Buchan argued that women would be much
better off spending their time learning to cook and looking after the
children they love.
It amused me to see analysis so influenced by the left's greatest political
philosopher being denounced by the legions of the politically correct, whose
own philosophy usually amounts to no more than half-digested Marxism. This
modern form of political correctness decrees that only women may justly
pronounce on the misery of women, just as communist rulers used to insist
that only members of the working class could truly pronounce on the
wickedness of capitalist exploitation.
One might think that the reaction to Buchan's article, and the problem he
identifies, is peculiarly of our time. One would be wrong. Half a century
ago C E M Joad was Britain's most famous popular philosopher and the
resident leftie on the panel on the leading radio question and answer
programme.
In his autobiography Joad has a section 'Women in the Home'. He remarks:
'There is a controversy perpetually revived in the cheaper press on the
question of whether women should go back to the home. What is not usually
realised by the participators in this controversy is that for the
middle-class woman - and it is over the middle-class woman that the
controversy rages - there is no home to go back to . . . growth of transport
facilities, increase in mechanical and electrical appliances . . . have left
of (the home's) varied duties only an automatic routine. The middle-class
woman neither brews nor bakes; she does not wash; she has no skill in the
making of conserves and regards cooking as on the whole a nuisance. To
mitigate this nuisance she does not cook so much as warm up food that others
have cooked for her . . .'
This was written in 1932, and by a man who described himself as 'a
socialist' and a 'feminist'. Today Joad would be regarded as a reactionary
old misogynist.
The chief difference between Joad's analysis of the middle class woman's lot
and that expounded by Buchan, is that the former believed that modern
industrialism had made the housewife redundant - gadgets did her work for
her - while the latter believes that gadgets have been designed to allow
women into the male world of employment, and therefore to make their
husbands redundant.
Meanwhile, since I published Buchan's strictures, the atmosphere in the
Lawson household has become a little frosty. These are dangerous waters,
Watson, as that incorrigible bachelor, Sherlock Holmes, said.

FT  30 APR 94 / Arts: April is the cruellest month - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beginnings are trickiest. I know because I have been staring at a blank
computer screen for five minutes before tapping out 'Beginnings are
trickiest.' And this is just a video column.
What of a book? A symphony? A feature film? How do you make that first
scratch on the page/scoresheet/script? The
poet who wrote that April is the cruellest month must
have had a premonition
of this month's video releases. So many of them use that popular opening
plot
device: death or violent accident.
Krzystof Kieslowski's Three Colours Blue (Artificial Eye) starts with a car
crash which bereaves its heroine (Juliette Binoche) of her husband and
child, awakening her to a new and frightening 'liberty.' Made in France,
this is part one of the Polish director's tricouleur trilogy, soon to be
followed by Equality and Fraternity.
Hollywood's Forever Young (Warner), putting the cry into cryogenics, has its
hero (Mel Gibson) volunteer for 50 years' deep-freeze after the death of his
girlfriend in a street accident (c. 1940). Will he
meet her again in the
Future?
Then there John Sayles's Passion Fish (Curzon), all about a writer (Mary
McDonnell) finding herself after a disabling accident; Andrew Birkin's
domestic black comedy The Cement Garden (Tartan), in which Dad's demise and
Mum's interment in the cellar
help four children to grow up in peculiar ways; and, going further back,
Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now (Warner),
with a child's death catapulting a couple into a mystical pilgrimage, and
Neil Jordan's Angel (Channel 4), in which a young man's quest for revenge
and self-discovery is sparked by his witnessing of a girl's murder.
Death in reel one is a triple-effect device. It is an aesthetic surprise:
you do not expect a story to begin with an ending. It is an emotional shock:
telling you that your feelings are to be knocked about by this story,
starting now. And it leaves the surviving character(s) vulnerable and
perversely renewed: so it is a kind of birth.
Kieslowski's film is all about hope clambering forth from the womb of
despair. It is shot like a luminous mosaic: memories and fragments from the
heroine's life are assembled - a thought, a snapshot, a family chandelier,
some lost chords from her composer husband's last work - in a dazzling
kinetic
collage. And Juliette Binoche's blank face, seeming to hold no emotions
itself, becomes a kaleidoscopic reflecting surface for the life
animating itself all
around her.
Hollywood may not go in for high art, but it knows a heart-tugging device
when it trips over one. In films like Forever Young the thinking is this:
'If we start by giving the hero and the audience something they think they
can't recover from - and then help them recover from it - they'll be mush in
our hands by the time the final violins sing.'
So we are. We grab our handkerchiefs and blow into them, drowning out the
string section as Mel swoops into the arms of his 'new'
beloved, finding love and
hope growing from the depths of despair.
But there is one big difference between High Art and Mush Art. In the first,
bereavement precipitates a new life, with its terrors as well as
fulfilments. In the second it just cues a quest to re-find the old life.
Where a formula product like Forever Young goes round in a giant sentimental
circle, filmmakers like Roeg in Don't Look Now or Neil Jordan in Angel truly
shoot their main characters out into a void. (Roeg's 1973 Venice mystery
trip is still a dazzler). And in-betweeners like John Sayles, a sort of
Hollywood drop-out (City Of Hope) who sometimes likes to drop back in
(Alligator), find a mood somewhere between cosiness and catalysis for their
tales of emotional rebound.
Of course there are some films in which no one dies
and everyone has a good time. Since this is spring and the sun is shining,
let me end by commending The Wedding Banquet, Dennis and Bambi. A gay comedy
of errors; a straight comedy of teenage mischief (with Walter Matthau
receiving the custard pies); and a comedy-romance-cartoon about beautiful
Nature.
Oh no, wait. Someone does die in Bambi. Ma Deer, and very memorably. Sorry.
Handkerchiefs out again.

FT  30 APR 94 / Arts: Camus cult hits France - An unfinished novel has
prompted a reappraisal of this author's work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

<TEXT>
When the police trawled around the wreckage of the sports car in which
Albert Camus met his death in 1960, they found his diary, a copy of Othello,
a book by Nietzsche and the first draft of an autobiographical novel about
his boyhood.
The manuscript was littered with crossed-out words, missing phrases and
spelling mistakes and Camus's widow, fearful that it would damage the
already diminished reputation of her husband, refused to release it. Last
month this unfinished work was finally published, 34 years after the death
of its author, and it has become an instant best-seller.
In the first fortnight alone, 125,000 copies of Le Premier Homme were sold
and the publisher, Gallimard, is now rushing out a second edition. The
forlorn face of Camus, with his Montgomery Clift looks and method actor
poses, stares soulfully from the pages of the French press and from posters
plastered across the bookshops.
'There's something of a Camus cult in France at the moment,' says Antoine de
Gaudemar, arts editor of Liberation, the liberal-left daily. 'He's always
been popular with young readers. But it's only relatively recently that his
work has been reassessed by the critics. The success of Le Premier is
incredible. We've never seen anything quite like it.'
The excitement over the book is in stark contrast to the status accorded
Albert Camus's work at the time of his death. By then, his literary fortunes
were at their nadir. He had been lionised by the Paris intelligentsia when
his first novel, L'Etranger, was published in the mid-1940s, but he soon
fell foul of fellow existentialists Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir,
then the titans of the intellectual scene.
Their backgrounds were very different from that of Camus, the son of a
working class family brought up in the slums of Algiers. The acid entries in
de Beauvoir's biographies suggest that he was a little too arriviste for her
taste.
'I think Camus was going through a crisis caused by the feeling that his
golden age was drawing to a close,' she said, when describing him flouncing
out of a party after a row with Sartre. 'His good luck had gone to his head.
He thought there were no limits to what he could do.' The final straw came
when Camus refused to join their opposition to French colonial rule in North
Africa, the critical issue for the fashionable French left in the late
1950s. He also drew unwelcome attention to the fascism that had followed in
the wake of the French and Russian revolutions: the 'Prometheanism' that
degenerated into 'Caesarism'.
By then, Camus's work had also fallen from favour on the wider literary
scene. His stark, moralistic approach was at odds with the more stylised,
newly fashionable nouveau roman of Nathalie Sarraute and Alain
Robbe-Grillet: even winning the 1957 Nobel Prize for literature was not
enough to rehabilitate him.
'At the time of his death Camus was a real bete noire for the French left,'
says Florence Noiville, a journalist with Le Monde. 'His work was also
regarded poorly in academic circles. It looked as though he was finished.'
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Camus's literary stock remained low.
It was not until the 1980s that the tide began turning back in his favour
when a number of French academics started to reappraise his work. Florence
Noiville suspects that Camus's star rose again because of the political
changes in the post-Cold War era. 'The issues, like the Algerian War, that
turned people against him in his lifetime, now seem a long way off,' she
says. 'And his old critics on the left have lost credibility.'
Now it is his old foes, Sartre and de Beauvoir, who have fallen from grace.
Antoine de Gaudemar is convinced that Camus's ascent is connected to their
fading fortunes. 'Whenever their currency goes down, Camus's comes back up,'
he says. 'It can't be entirely coincidental.' He also believes that Camus's
ascetic style and unrelentingly pessimistic plots strike a chord with
contemporary readers. 'There's an ethical aspect to his writing that's very
appealing,' he says. 'It's a style that's difficult to find elsewhere as so
many modern French novelists are still locked in the nouveau roman mould.'
The publication of Le Premier Homme has set the seal on Camus's newfound
success. The book, which only runs to 144 pages and retains all the errors
and omissions of the original manuscript, paints a poignant picture of his
poverty-stricken childhood in Algiers. 'It's a beautiful piece of writing,'
says Noiville. 'It shows us a vivid, more humane side of Camus that we
haven't seen before.'
Will foreign readers be as tolerant of the flaws and failings of Le Premier
Homme as the author's new-found fans in France? The publishing industry
seems to think so. Gallimard has received offers for the 16 different
translations of Albert Camus's last, albeit incomplete work.

FT  30 APR 94 / Arts: The samba philosophers - As the Festival of Bahia
opens in London, Antony Thorncroft finds Brazilian culture is the antithesis
of the Road-to-Rio image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mangueira is the Manchester United of the fiercely competitive Rio de
Janeiro samba schools. It has won most first prizes in the annual carnival
parades. When its colours of green and pink were seen sashaying down the
streets of Rio at February's carnival the crowds went from mad to delirious.
On four extravagantly decorated floats Mangueira was honouring 'Os Doces
Barbaros'. There stood singers Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, Gal Costa and
Maria Bethania, the 'sweet barbarians', or more accurately the 'Four Great
Bahians'.
Bahia is that province of Brazil which points out towards Africa. Its great
city Salvador, the country's first capital, was the bittersweet landfall for
millions of black slaves. It has remained black Brazil. It is also the place
which spawned the four singers who have revolutionised not only Brazilian
music, but also Brazilian culture and politics over the past generation.
On June 1 the Four Great Bahians, along with 50 dancers and drummers from
the Mangueira School, will perform at the Royal Albert Hall, a climacteric
ending for the first Festival of Bahia in London which opens tomorrow with
an art exhibition at the Barbican.
Foreign festivals in the UK are ten a penny. The Bahian onslaught is
different because it unleashes on London not just the artists but also the
philosophers of a culture almost completely unknown in Europe. What links
the four singers with Brazil's most distinguished artist Carybe, its leading
writer Jorge Amado and the veteran photographer, Pierre Verger, both of whom
will be speaking at the ICA from May 16-18, is that they are wrapped up in
candomble, the ancient religion of west Africa which the slaves tenaciously
clung to and which survives in its purest form in Bahia. Also appearing at
the ICA is Mae Stella, one of the most prominent Ialorixas (priestesses) in
Salvador, who preserves the ancient mysteries and acts as sage and magician.
The Portuguese took the easy way out with candomble: they just linked the
African deities with Christian saints and fuzzed the issue. But in recent
years ethnicity has hit Bahia hard. Mae Stella rejects syncretism, the
fusion of Christianity and candomble, and the young blacks look to African
rituals, African rhythms and African religion as an expression of their
massive contribution to a Brazilian society which still largely marginalises
them.
But it is not only black Bahians who seek an alternative history and
society. Military rulers exiled Gil and Caetano to London around 1970. When
they returned they remained revolutionaries. They were fierce opponents of
the Carmen Miranda, Road to Rio, exotic-cabaret image of Brazilian culture.
They took the true Bahian-African contribution to world music - the samba -
and shook the nation up with the rock rhythms and electric guitars that they
absorbed from watching the Rolling Stones at the London Lyceum.
They lit the fuse. The isolated Brazilian culture was opened up. The
movement was dubbed Tropicalism, and aimed to make the people of Bahia feel
happier with their origins. It soon conquered the whole of Brazil. The next
wave of musicians added contemporary African rhythms to samba and rock, with
axe (meaning energy) music. Also coming to London is Araketu, which began as
a carnival band in Salvador but now pushes the new wave of Tropicalism,
using the Yoruba language and African drumming in their songs of racism and
everyday life.
They are much more than militant morris dancers, and in their black pride
there is strong commitment to candomble. But for Araketu, which began in a
poor suburb, the black political strain is stronger. Their appearance at
Club Bahia in Vauxhall on May 7 is the chance for the devotees of Latin
music with an edge, a fast growing clique, to get the real thing. It is the
older generation that is more engrossed with candomble. Caetano wears round
his neck the symbol of his personal orixa, or god, who is determined by the
fall of the shells from the hands of the priestess.
You see a similar necklace on Amado, and on Verger, the 92 year old
ethnographer turned photographer, who gives the intellectual justification
for why these successful artists from the white middle-class should find
their spiritual home in the rituals of black Africa. In his simple home in a
poor area of Salvador, surrounded by his American disciples, Verger talks of
a life-long search for philosophical peace. He rejected Buddhism because the
pact between the rich man giving to the poor monk pandered to the egotism of
both. He believes that candomble, where there is no hell nor retribution,
where the gods are manifestations of natural forces like fire, water and
hunting, and death is followed by re-incarnation through your descendants,
has the basic answers. He has spent 40 years researching the links between
Africa and Brazil and finds that the believers in candomble are more at ease
with life.
Carybe may be more of a sceptic but he has portrayed the gods in paintings
and sculptures, on display at the Barbican, while Amado, who looks to
Shango, the god of fire, lightning and justice for protection, has used the
legends in his picaresque novels of Salvador life.
The African gods are very much of this world so hardly interfere with the
pleasures of life. There will be plenty of exuberance in London next month.
But the commitment is real. Gal Costa is a popular singer, the Shirley
Bassey of Brazil. During her latest, controversial show she advances to the
front of the stage and bears her breast. It is not a provocative gesture. It
says 'do not run away from the basic political issues, the black question.
Confront the truth, your origins'. The Bahia Festival is fun - with an edge.
Festival of Bahia. May 1-June 1, sponsored by West Merchant Bank, Petrobras,
Tenenge Holdings, Varihert g, Government of Bahia.

with a Freudian slant

<TEXT>
THE CULTIVATION OF HATRED: THE BOURGEOIS EXPERIENCE VICTORIA TO FREUD by
Peter Gay HarperCollins Pounds 25, 684 pages
Peter Gay is an historian on the grand scale. His natural form of expression
is the magisterial multi-volume survey of the culture of an age, as in his
prize-winning two-volume history of the Enlightenment, and his four-volume
account of 19-century middle-class culture, The Bourgeois Experience,
Victoria to Freud.
Gay has of course written single-volume books, but he prefers a larger
canvas. The reason is simple. All writers accumulate masses of material in
the course of research. Most then select, as judiciously as they can; but
some, loth to waste, invent a reason for including everything. Gay is a
leader in this latter school. The result is fascinating but - because of the
implausible unifying framework into which the great miscellany is crammed -
tendentious.
This volume is the third of Gay's Bourgeois Experience series; the fourth is
yet to come. Gay describes his project as an exploration of 19th-century
middle-class culture based on the Freudian categories of sex and aggression,
and in the first two volumes he discusses Victorian sexual attitudes and
practices. In this volume he employs the notion of aggression as the key to
explaining almost everything else.
The fact that the whole enterprise is based on the implausibilities of
Freudian doctrine immediately puts one on guard. 'My aim,' Gay writes, 'is
to integrate psychoanalysis with history.' The psychoanalytic scheme of
human nature is, at bottom, simple: it is premissed on the thesis that an
infant sexually desires its parent of the opposite sex, and is therefore
hostile towards, because jealous of, its parent of the same sex; and that
because neither the desire nor the hostility is acceptable, internal
conflicts arise. Thus the wellspring of human nature in the gospel according
to Freud; and thus - in Gay's hands - the key to Victorian bourgeois
culture.
In this volume, The Cultivation of Hatred, Gay invokes Freudian views on
aggression to justify bringing together a wide range of subjects: social
Darwinism; racism; concepts of manliness; debates about crime and
punishment; developments in politics; views of women; the nature and use of
humour; the growth of interest in sport; and progress in education and
science. When Gay tells us straightforwardly about these aspects of
19th-century culture he is spellbinding; there are few historians working
today who write so knowledgeably and elegantly. But when he theorises; when
he psychoanalyses not a particular Victorian, but the whole of Victorian
culture; when he borrows from Freud a single explanation to tie together all
this diversity of material - he fails to persuade.
The reason is simply stated. To adhere to his Freudian schema Gay has to
believe that not only are fighting and quarrelling expressions of human
aggression, but so also are debate, dialectic, disagreement, competition,
and negotiation; more, that progress - for example in science and education
 -is also generated by aggression, although this time 'constructive
aggression', since it flows from attempts to gain mastery over the world. So
practically everything comes down to aggression as source and motive.
The problem with Gay's thesis is displayed by a characteristic claim. 'It
was a striking feature of 19th-century culture,' he writes, 'that
influential justifications for aggression relied on what their partisans
advertised as scientific proof. The alibi that conflict is necessary and
desirable greatly benefited from such claims. Its apologists proudly
asserted that the case for untrammelled competition, whether in the
economic, the social, or the military domain, was susceptible of
demonstration' (my italics). Here we slide from aggression to conflict to
competition, as if they are the same thing; and we have 'social competition'
and 'military competition' lumped together, as if the two kinds of
competition are indistinguishable.
It is not merely that these generalisations are wildly too sweeping; it is
that they embody a conceptual confusion: for not all conflict is aggressive,
and not all competition involves conflict. If, however, one ignores the
scaffolding of implausible theory, what remains is a marvellously enjoyable
and informative history of 19th-century ideas. One discards the shell to eat
a nut: follow this course here, for in all other respects this is a volume -
a series - to have on one's bookshelves.

FT  30 APR 94 / Books: Into the vortex of this perilous abyss - As Lloyd's
Names count their losses, Richard Lapper considers the historical roots of
the recent crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ULTIMATE RISK Adam Raphael Bantam Press Pounds 16.99, 336 pages
The difficulty in writing now about Lloyd's of London is that the final
chapters of the insurance market current crisis, the worst in its 300 year
history, have still to be played out. Yet Ultimate Risk by Adam Raphael is a
clear and entertaining history which helps explain the depth of the market's
problems.
Raphael, a loss-making Name himself, is properly critical of the past
incompetence and inefficiency of many of the market's underwriters and
agents, and of the regulatory weakness of Lloyd's council itself. But this
is a balanced account, mercifully free of the conspiracy theories which have
bedevilled some recent analyses. Indeed, Raphael writes: 'What is remarkable
in a market driven by money, where opportunity for dishonesty is rampant, is
not the surfacing of the odd fraud and the odd failure, but how infrequent
they were.'
Historical detail also helps puts the current crisis into perspective.
Certainly shattering losses are nothing new for Lloyd's. For example, after
a British merchant convoy was sunk off St Vincent in August 1780, half the
market's underwriters went into bankruptcy. A commentary by John Weskett, a
market veteran of the time, could serve equally well to describe the
situation two centuries later: 'We see not a few instances even of
tradesmen, shopkeepers, etc, lured by the golden, but delusive bait of
Premiums, especially in time of War, drawn like Gudgeons into the Vortex of
this perilous Abyss, Insurance.'
Early losses paved the way for the consolidation and modernisation of the
market. In the same way the Lloyd's scandals of the 1970s and early 1980s,
the Savonita, Sasse and PCW affairs, underlined the inadequacy of the
market's regulatory framework and provided the impulse for the reforms of
1982 and 1987.
This modification of self-regulation proved inadequate. Lloyd's was impotent
to control the mistakes and failures which led to the rapid growth of highly
speculative reinsurance business during the 1980s, to which thousands of
Names 'mostly of middling wealth' were attracted. Syndicates managed by
agencies such as Gooda Walker and Feltrim were swamped when the market was
hit by catastrophes like Piper Alpha - the North Sea oil rig explosion - in
1988 and hurricane Hugo - in the Caribbean - in 1989. Nor were the reforms
sufficient to help Lloyd's cope with the unexpected and rapid increase in
insurance claims from pollution and asbestos-related diseases.
The scale and severity of these recent losses has prompted a new period of
reform. Raphael says of the arrival in 1992 of an interventionist chairman,
David Rowland, and an unconventional chief executive, Peter Middleton, - a
motor cycle riding former monk and diplomat - 'signalled a new era'.
Inevitably the latter chapters of the book - in which the record of the new
regime is assessed - suffers from the fact that the events described are
still unfolding. Already the market's loss for 1991, which Lloyd's will
report next month, is now expected to exceed Pounds 2bn, for example.
Later this year Lloyd's should know whether it will be possible to set up
NewCo, an ambitious new reinsurance company into which it will transfer
billions of pounds in asbestosis and pollution liabilities. Decisive
developments could also take place in the US as the Clinton administration
grapples with the possible changes of superfund laws, which was at the root
of the market's exposure to pollution claims.
Raphael acknowledges the importance of the new source of funds, but amid the
clutter of day to day detail, these developments receive less reflective
consideration than is warranted. For if the new regime is eventually
successful in its efforts, the introduction last year of some Pounds 800m in
corporate capital will be seen as a significant achievement, marking a
decisive break with past traditions and habits.
Raphael's account is inevitably sympathetic to the plight of the hundreds of
investors whose lives have been ruined by their losses. Readers may quibble
with the assertion that the fate of Names has evoked little sympathy in the
press and that much recent comment has been motivated by schadenfreude - the
joy that comes from watching other people's misfortunes. But fewer will
argue with the claim that a settlement with the loss-makers is a necessary
pre-condition for future recovery.
At the end, though, Raphael hedges his bets. 'Lloyd's will probably survive,
albeit in a very different form,' he says. 'The biggest financial smash this
century is a possibility that cannot be ruled out. Yet the market has
professional skills, a world famous brand name and an institutional
resilience which should not be underestimated. The charge sheet is long, the
obstacles ahead daunting, the recent history shaming, but the last act has
still to be played . . . The show ain't over until the fat lady sings.'

THE FIST OF GOD by Frederick Forsyth Bantam Pounds 15.99, 494 pages
TO THE WHITE SEA by James Dickey Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 14.99, 275 pages
KOLYMSKY HEIGHTS by Lionel Davidson Heinemann Pounds 14.99, 448 pages
The 'Adventure Novel' has been a breed of its own for a century, and should
never be underestimated: even today it keeps to its own territory and must
not be confused with the 'thriller' or the crime story. Rider Haggard and
Erskine Childers did not write thrillers, as their successors will insist.
At best, adventure novelists can achieve the peaks of literature; most of
them, of course, produce rubbish.
Frederick Forsyth made his name for all time with The Day of the Jackal.
Before that he had been a struggling journalist. Here he produced a tale of
high drama which hinged on the utterly unsuspenseful issue of whether or not
General de Gaulle would be assassinated. We all know that De Gaulle
survived; astonishingly, Forsyth made us read through the night to discover
that we were right. That takes high skill.
Since then, Forsyth has produced bestselling 'faction'. He has a formula. He
takes a contemporary drama (The Odessa File, The Dogs of War, The Fourth
Protocol) and he spins a tale to which he attempts to give credence with a
semi-journalistic, authenticating detail. We buy him because we begin to be
persuaded that he is telling us the truth behind the headlines.
One of these days the ploy will falter. His new one, The Fist of God, takes
us closer to that moment. This is the Gulf War; the arms dealer Gerry Bull
is murdered; the SAS is launched behind Iraqi lines.
Freddie Forsyth's trick is to confuse fact with fiction. Thus, he starts
with a ten-page biography of Bull which might have come out of the FT; he
paints a professional picture of Operation Storm. And then he cheats - he
slips into his account a fictional element (in this case to do with the
Supergun): that gives him his novelist's 'plot'.
It has become ever clearer over the years that Forsyth has no interest or
skill in the essential talent of the novelist - that is, the drama of human
relationships - and I rather hope that he, and Len Deighton, will soon feel
able to return to straight journalism. And I wonder what Paul Henderson will
make of this latest distortion of the Matrix-Churchill story.
James Dickey is everything that Forsyth is not. He is a good American poet.
He is not at all prolific. He writes a wonderful, taut, elegant prose and
talks about physical action with a detail and sympathy that make it, yes,
poetry.
His 1970 novel Deliverance, which spawned a good film, told of a bunch of
buddies whose up-state wilderness trip went badly wrong. To The White Sea,
so many years later, is a brilliant and beautiful account of the fate of an
American rear-gunner whose plane is brought down over Tokyo in the closing
days of the Japanese war and who flees for the far north, to the world of
snow and mountain which are his natural homescape from his upbringing in
Alaska.
It has both the assets and the weaknesses of the 'man-alone' genre. Muldrow
is the only figure in the book; everything happens through his narration,
which inevitably becomes a limitation for Dickey because he allows himself
no interrelationships, no other character, no wider context, in contrast
with the achievement of Deliverance. Nevertheless, Dickey's new novel
deserves comparison with Geoffrey Household's Rogue Male, and that is,
obviously, my great compliment.
Lionel Davidson is also gifted and unprolific. Many years ago he wrote
brilliant adventure novels like A Long Way to Shiloh and The Night of
Wenceslas. Then he slowed down. After a 12-year silence, Kolymsky Heights is
just about worth the wait.
The scene is Siberia - in enormous detail - and a secret research station
where all sorts of dastardly things are being attempted with the genetic
breeding of apes. The Canadian-Indian hero, Johnny Porter, who is
fortunately a linguist sans pareil, has to be infiltrated into the
permafrost.
The blurb foolishly quotes Forsyth in comparison. There is no need. Davidson
has always been the superior. But, like so many of these adventure novels
these days, Kolymsky Heights goes on too long. I cannot be alone in asking
these writers to cut short their shuddering, extended climaxes. Go back to
Haggard and Stevenson to see how it can be done, with a brief, brisk and
very satisfying bang.

A VALLEY IN ITALY by Lisa St Aubin de Teran Hamish Hamilton Pounds 15.99,
224 pages
There are people, I am told, who cast themselves off cruise-ships or harm
themselves with knives if they hear the name Lisa St Aubin de Teran. For
these folk, Lisa St Aubin de Teran is a literary tutti-frutti whose works,
including seven novels, are a confection of unsurpassed exoticism,
pseudiousness and feyness.
Not me. I like exoticism. And I admire her work because it reminds me of
high-quality chain-mail: vulnerable, seemingly, to the mace of brute
criticism yet beautifully crafted when examined close up.
A Valley In Italy is the story of one of her romantic obsessions: to
discover, and rehabilitate, a castle or grand villa in which she could live.
She had a mental picture of her ideal property which she had carried with
her since schoolhood: a house so huge that that she could move from empty
room to empty room without disturbing anyone. The only constant features in
her dream image were 'a pillared loggia, a stone arch, a terracotta
balustrade and a line of sentinel cypresses.' So far so mimsy.
The business with the Villa Orsola - its Herculean reconstruction and the
money it devours - will please anyone with a liking for homes and gardens on
the grand scale; or anyone who loves Italy. When she got to grips with it,
she discovered it was a ruin: no electricity, no water, no windows, no doors
and a serious gap in the roof.
But the charm of A Valley In Italy - its subtlety and sensuousness; the
skill with which the author evokes the quality of Umbrian village life -
ought to win it a far wider readership than the mimsy or ex-pat sets.
She is extremely good on characters, not just important ones (the workmen,
her children) but the walk-ons, such as Regina, the friendly yet
powerfully-bicep'd proprietor of a village bar, who emerges, on being
called, from a wine cellar, muttering something to a chicken she is holding
by its feet.
'When we asked for cappuccino, she looked momentarily nonplussed. After a
few seconds of deliberation, she casually knocked the chicken against a
petrol pump beside us, tucked it under her arm to still its shuddering death
throes and made her way up some stone steps to the first floor. Ten minutes
later, she re-emerged with . . . two cups of cappuccino'.
The villagers all help her, even though the author had been warned that
Umbrians were bandits and peasants who never salted their food, couldn't
cook, suffered from goitres, lived in huts and were prey to poverty, bears
and wolves.
Would-be travel writers could study, with great profit, the coiled energy
with which she communicates, in just a few sentences, the way that the
nearby city of Gubbio impressed itself upon her.
For hours, until nightfall, she ran up and down Gubbio's hundreds of steps,
growing heady with the wealth of sights, pictures, churches, frescoes.
Finally, she leans against the cold stone of a balustrade and finds herself
memorising the floor of the Piazza della Signoria 'lying in herring-boned
obeisance' at the feet of the view across the plains to the mountains
beyond.
There should be more people in the world like Lisa St Aubin de Teran and
fewer like - oh - Douglas Hurd (imagine him without shoes on, stooping to
pick lilies). More exoticism. Greater oddness. Feyness now and then. This is
a quietly splendid book.

EATING PAVLOVA by DM Thomas Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 231 pages
UNDER THE VULCANIA by Maureen Freely Bloomsbury Paperback Pounds 4.99, 139
pages
FISHING THE SLOE-BLACK RIVER by Colum McCann Phoenix House Pounds 13.99, 184
pages
Sigmund Freud died of cancer of the jaw in Hampstead in 1939. DM Thomas's
novel is in the form of a memoir supposedly written and dreamed by Freud in
his last morphine clouded days. He was nursed by his daughter Anna, the
renowned child psychoanalyst, then in her forties, and much of the book's
focus is on Anna, whose life was consumed by her father. This is not the
first time Thomas has used Freud in a novel; the 'father of psychoanalysis'
checked into the notorious White Hotel.
Eating Pavlova will annoy Freudians and confirm others in their prejudices
as Thomas, acting the ventriloquist, sits on his knee an old goat dummy
whose bleatings put a mediocre gloss on his life and work, and who exhibits
a mild fixation on corsets and suspenders. On page one the baby
Sigmund/Oedipus watches his parents making love and offers this beatitude:
'Happy is the infant whose father fills him with a passion for forests by
coupling with his bride in full view.'
Then there is a long section devoted to Freud re-falling in love with his
wife Martha in middle age, a period which provides the novelist with a
forestful of sexual fantasies, embellishment and lies. Historic figures,
including Jung, HD Bryher and Helene Deutsch troop through the narrative and
Pavlova dances past in a memory inspired by a dream of her pudding, that
confection of meringue and fruit which can so easily collapse into
sogginess.
The text is interspersed with fictional hindsight and genuine case histories
and a story 'written' by Anna, in which she is married to her father. The
final scene is touching as Freud, now a guilty ghost, foresees Anna old and
alone in the house where she lived on until 1982, and which is now the Freud
Museum, but it is tempting to paraphrase another author's title into 'Eating
Pavlova is Wrong'.
'What do women want?' asks the ersatz Freud in the course of his adventures.
The women in Maureen Freely's Under the Vulcania want diversion from
unsatisfactory lives and marriages. The Vulcania is a pleasure dome devoted
to fulfilling their wildest fantasies. The Hard-On Cafe and the Merry-Go-
Vibrator might promise paradise at first, but Freely introduces subtly the
nightmarish potential of her palace of varieties staffed by Californian
Chippendales. Much of Freely's work, as novelist and journalist, is
concerned with balancing motherhood and sexual fulfilment, and here she
juggles desire and danger in a tight, astute, depressing and sometimes very
funny narrative.
Colum McCann is a young writer who has been hailed as part of the talented
new wave coming out of Ireland. Fishing the Sloe-Black River, his first
collection of stories, shows a poetic and angry observer taking the
well-worn path from Ireland to America. As with some of his compatriots, the
cadences of Irish speech and expressions add natural poetry to the prose and
these stories of exile and loss may possibly have been influenced by the
work of Desmond Hogan.
McCann's dispossessed characters, working in mental hospitals, dying of
Aids, seeking long lost sisters, are informed by a literariness and myth.
The souls of the dead of both sides of the conflict in Ireland turn into
swans in Cathal's lake, one of the less successful stories, where an old
farmer's rage and pity are patently the author's rather than his own. When
McCann eschews magic realism a credible compassion illuminates the squalor,
nastiness, brutality and beauty of modern life.

FT  30 APR 94 / Arts: Drama from bestsellers - Andrew St George has mixed
feelings about two current adaptations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First Dickens and George Eliot, now John Steinbeck and Fyodor Dostoyevsky
are rushing to the stage. All are strong writers with a definite view and a
fixed viewpoint; this makes them easy to film but hard to stage. Now in
London there are two examples of adaptation: The Grapes of Wrath at the Shaw
Theatre and Crime &amp; Punishment at the Battersea Arts Centre.
John Steinbeck (1902-68) was not above a little punishment. He once dangled
a recalcitrant girlfriend by her ankles out of a top floor window. The
writing, like the life, was direct and uncompromising. His best, The Grapes
of Wrath (1939) scooped the Pulitzer Prize and the John Ford film treatment.
Given that Steinbeck's American epic splashes the primary colours of
American literature over a canvas 2,000 miles long, the 7:84 Theatre
Company's production at the Shaw Theatre does well to render the story
without losing its sprawling quality. This is the ultimate road book,
following the Joad family west on Route 66 from the prairies of Oklahoma to
the fruit valleys of California. En route, the family faces death, hunger,
unemployment and humiliation. Some travellers break off, others stick with
it; there are funerals, floods and famine. The large Shaw stage is
throughout filled with the hopeful family, but clears for the closing scene
of a childless woman breast-feeding a starving man.
The adaptation scores with the set, like the inside of an orange crate, the
light seeping through from the back, and an understage stream (for the
excellent flood scene); the Joads' car is a sensible trolley with headlights
and a radiator, and all the other scenery is light and shadow. The acting -
particularly Paul R. Meade as Tom Joad and Tom McGovern as the ex-Reverend
Casy - keeps the action tense; there is a fine performance from Anne Kidd as
the matriarch of the Joad family, the strong reliant woman found everywhere
in Steinbeck's fiction.
For all its qualities, this staged Grapes of Wrath has little of the book's
power or the film's scope. The production misses Steinbeck's unremitting
outrage at the careless economic forces pushing the Joad family further from
itself; and it misses the beauties of Steinbeck's visceral prose. There is a
narrator and a group of musicians who speed the action along, but they
rarely step over the divide between literature and theatre.
Iain Reekie's direction finds Steinbeck's strengths: the moral shoot-out,
the loss of self-belief, the search for friendship; but they are too loudly
treated. The play lacks quiet, powerful moments. 'Most people', wrote
Steinbeck in his unpublished 1933 Journal, 'do not like themselves at all,
do not even know themselves well enough to form a true liking.'
Enter Dostoyevsky (1821-81) and his self-tormenting hero Raskolnikov at the
Battersea Arts Centre. This production, by Red Shift, amounts to the
hi-volume cartoon version of the 1856 Russian classic. It works by selecting
rather than including, so swathes of the novel are rightly unrepresented,
but at the expense of Dostoyevsky's impact. This is the play of the
detective novel inside Crime &amp; Punishment.
Jonathan Holloway's adaptation is subtitled The Killer's Story; it lasts 135
minutes and keeps the action to four characters: Raskolnikov, Razumikhin his
friend, Sonya his lover and Porfiry his nemesis. Gone are the Marmeladovs,
but purists will be happy to know the scene where Marmeladov is crushed to
death finds a place. Other parts are played in latex masks, and the action
concentrates on the duel between Porfiry and Raskolnikov: 'a murder is
incomplete without detection, a murderer incomplete without punishment.'
The finest scene is a dream sequence of Raskolnikov murdering the old woman
and her sister, darting into the flat, stealing her pearls, avoiding
detection. The scene plays backwards and then forwards to nervy and nagging
music. The cast (particularly Tristan Sharps as Porfiry and Philip Brook as
Raskolnikov) deliver with point and verve, and Holloway's direction keeps
the action scooting around with walls and doors on plinths.
But this touring show has none of the quiet, daily horror of Crime &amp;
Punishment; it lacks the calm concentration essential to the story. Red
Shift has produced a good introduction to its fine brand of innovative
theatre, but not to Dostoyevsky.
The Grapes of Wrath: Shaw Theatre (071 388 1394) until 30 April; Crime &amp;
Punishment: Battersea Arts Centre (071 223 2223) until 14 May. Both then go
on tour.

FT  30 APR 94 / Arts: Museum for our time - As the Tate expands into
Bankside, William Packer applauds the principle but wonders where it will
all end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So Bankside it is. Last Thursday the rumour of recent weeks was confirmed,
that after months of agonising the Tate's Trustees had opted for Sir Giles
Gilbert Scott's monumental power house on the Southwark side of the river,
opposite Saint Paul's, and that London at last was to get its long-awaited,
much-needed Gallery of Modern Art. Long-awaited indeed, for the possibility
was mooted the moment the Tate immediately out-grew its extension of the
mid-1970s. But much-needed?
The answer has to be a resounding Yes - that is if we accept the need for
national museums of any kind. And the reasons are of principle rather than
circumstance. There are, of course, countless justifications of opportunity
 -the inaugural press-conference rang with them - from the incidental
conservation of a great building; the creation of jobs within the local
community and the regeneration of the locality, to the encouragement of
investment in the City; the stimulation of international cultural tourism
and the great exhibitions that might at last come to London. As it is, the
Tate Gallery and its satellites at Liverpool and St Ives already attract
some 2.5 million visitors a year, and the new gallery would expect to
achieve nearly 2 million a year on its own account within five years of its
opening in the year 2000.
Such arguments are perhaps the more immediately persuasive, certainly to
ministers and councillors, sponsors and administrators. Enabling
practicalities, spin-offs and pay-offs are not to be sniffed at. But all
this is secondary: the first and only reason why we need a museum of modern
art at all is because art is always with us, and all true art is modern art
in its time.
We would betray ourselves if we had not the confidence to look critically at
the achievement of our own times and to hold it in trust for the future to
form its own judgment, just as we now value what is left to us of the past.
The problem is only that the field is so vast. Here is the opportunity to
address the job properly.
The Victorians never had difficulty in seeing themselves and their
achievement in the light of history, and the National Gallery had happily
been hanging contemporary British painting in the context of the older
European schools. But by the end of the century the British collections had
grown too large to hold at Trafalgar Square. Sir Henry Tate's Gallery was
opened in 1897 as our museum of British art, from the 16th century to the
present, and has gone on collecting British painting and drawing, prints and
sculpture ever since. In monitoring the currency of activity, however, it
has always been necessary to acquire far more than could ever be shown at
once.
If that created a problem just with British art in the 20th century, by how
much more was it increased as the collections were extended into
international fields. The process was slow at first, and piecemeal. The
first Degas came in 1916, Monet in 1926, Cezanne in 1927, Van Gogh, Picasso
and Matisse in 1933. Only since the war, with regular purchase grants
available from central funds, have both the British and international
collections been able to grow more by policy than by the happy chance of
gift or bequest.
Thus the Tate has been doing three things at once: maintaining the historic
collection of the British School; continuing to monitor its current
development within both British and international contexts; and establishing
a comprehensive collection of the international art of the 20th century.
Each of these duties is incremental: all are heavy in the demands they make
in money and space.
The colonisation of Bankside will allow scope for the comprehensive
presentation of 20th century art, with the British School taking its proper
place. The Tate at Millbank will be free once more to present the British
School in its historic development, from the earliest to the latest moment.
What actual policies will emerge, and whether they will be generously
catholic or conventionally avant-garde, remain to be seen, but such caveats
in no way moderate the splendid opportunities that now present themselves.
But time runs on, and art won't stop. The question remains hanging in the
air: will our descendants of the mid-2090s be looking at yet another
redundant edifice - Canary Wharf perhaps, or Terminal 4 - as a home for our
national collections of the art of the 21st century, with all their special
needs of jiggery and pokery and, above all, space? And will they be as
excited, as we are at the prospect of Bankside? We shall see.

FT  30 APR 94 / Arts: The bizarre appeal of 'Princess Babs' - Antony
Thorncroft asks the ultimate question, is Streisand worth it?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Everything is odd, different, alarming, slightly bizzare at a Barbra
Streisand concert. It is odd that the singer has the hair of an Afghan hound
and the face of a borzoi; it is different that the audience manages to move
its collective body slowly in time to music without a suspicion of rhythm;
it is alarming that the workmanlike bars of Wembley Arena are selling
champagne and smoked salmon while the merchandising stalls offer gold stamps
(whatever they might be) for Pounds 60 and crystal paperweights for Pounds
40; and it is bizarre that my seat cost Pounds 260.
That is the ultimate question: is she worth it? For much of the time you
feel that she should be paying you to listen to her life story. Streisand
has spent a fortune on shrinks who fulfill exactly the same role as an
audience. This enables her to say very puzzling things like 'it cost me
millions to be able to sing this song but it was worth it' before slipping
into 'On a clear day', not many people's idea of a spiritual challenge. Is
any song worth that, you wonder ? Aren't you glad you can take it or leave
it.
Shrinks are not just throw-away jokes. They are a major part of the act.
Streisand talks to them, and they ask pre-recorded questions on tape in that
bored, non-committal, petulant way that psychiatrists adopt. They are
important players in what is basically a two hour dissection of the
Streisand life, from Brooklyn baby to committed millionaire.
With this amount of investment in self-awareness you can choose your own
personality and Streisand seems to have settled for 'Jewish Princess'. In a
striking opening image to the show she steps on to a balcony (which leads
down to a vast drawing room, all white drapes and busts of Shakespeare, the
kind of set favoured by Liberace in his more louche phase), and stands
drowning in applause, like a Royal in the days of deference.
In her chat she refers to meeting Prince Charles (and, yes, there they are
sharing a cup of tea in one of the many film clips that flesh out the
evening) and she confesses that only committment to work prevented her from
charming him into courtship. 'Can you imagine it. Princess Babs, the first
Jewish princess'.
We don't have to imagine; it is there before us. Watching Barbra Streisand
excercises the same kind of morbid fascination as when you come across a
Royal going about their business. It is a mix of total confidence in her own
fascination, combined with an uncanny lack of confidence in her performance.
She cannot appear on stage without suspended idiot cards giving the words to
songs she has sung a thousand times; spelling out the jerky dialogue,
written with all the imagination of a diplomatic communique. She shares our
wonder, and admiration, that this ugly duckling has become the highest paid
entertainer in the world.
As for the actual show: on the credit side the Streisand voice is
surprisingly good, and she hits the top notes like a sledge hammer. But she
puts little feeling into some of the most beautiful ballads of all time
('Lover man', 'Can't help loving that man of mine') and for a Broadway
legend she is low on energy and there are few up-tempo smasheroos to raise
the joint. The lighting was unsubtle and the band not totally happy until
the cumbersome set disappeared in the second half.
Can it be worth Pounds 260? Oddly enough there is such a sense of occasion,
a feeling that you are part of an important ritual, that few will have been
disappointed. Perhaps it is because you feel that Streisand needs us more
than we need her. As she sings 'now I'm standing centre stage I've come home
at last' you agree that for all the money and time spent on therapy, on love
affairs, on political aspirations, Streisand only really believes in herself
when the audience claps itself into hysteria.

FT  30 APR 94 / Survey of Clocks, Watches and Jewellery (5): A token of
love, a sign of trouble - Lucia van der Post takes a close look at diamonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since time began, the point of jewellery has been swank and status. After
all, who really needs a bit of carbon, even if it is absolutely pure and
extraordinarily old?
I know . . . it is often quite exquisitely made and sometimes the skill and
craft is so dazzling that only a museum exhibition all its own will do it
justice. But the art is never the real point. It is almost never the chief
impulse behind the making and the buying.
Now you might have thought that during the recession, few would have had
much inclination, let alone the cash, to indulge in things so fundamentally
unnecessary. You would be wrong.
Over at de Beers they are quietly pleased. The last 18 months have been good
to diamonds. There have been a few awkward moments when supply vastly
outstripped demand and the dreaded quota system (which restricts the number
of diamonds that de Beers' Central Selling Organisation agrees to buy from
suppliers) had to be brought into play. But recently the performance of
diamonds at auction has outperformed all the financial indices (let alone
sales of Impressionists and Old Masters) by a wide margin.
At auction, prices in the flawless D stone category have moved from Pounds
28,500 per carat to about Pounds 42,900 a carat. Laurence Graff, who deals
almost exclusively in the largest, flawless, most rare, stones (which means
that his customers are almost exclusively foreign) has recently bought back
for Dollars 350,000 (Pounds 240,000) a five-carat blue diamond that he sold
15 years earlier for Dollars 60,000 a carat.
Last November, in a Sotheby's Geneva sale, a flawless rectangular cut
diamond of 100.36 carats earned the soubriquet of the most expensive jewel
ever sold, when an anonymous buyer parted with Pounds 8,028,603 to own it.
All this leads experienced watchers to conclude (as if we did not know it)
that we live in turbulent times. Sales of stones are far more closely linked
to the needs of the rich to have their wealth in a tiny, portable,
instantly-accessible form, than it is to the mysterious movements of the
romantic heart.
Buyers of these huge investment pieces are supplied mainly by three areas -
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan and Italy
 -all of which have problems of a sort and many of whose inhabitants would
like, if they could, to be able to move themselves and their wealth about at
the drop of an invasion or an unsympathetic bit of legislation. These are
the buyers who keep up the prices for the purest, finest, biggest gems. As
always the motto is that if it is investment and resale value you are want,
invest in the best you can afford.
We have only to think of the Romanoffs, the German jews, the Emir of Kuwait
(who packed much of his considerable wealth into a rucksack), to realise
that exile with millions in one's overnight case is an infinitely more
agreeable prospect than exile with all one's assets left behind.
But while these sort of purchases fuel the headlines and provide a
background of glamour and intrigue, it is the humbler buyers of more
day-to-day jewellery who keep the jewellers in lunches.
All through the recession the business of living has gone on - deals may
have been thin on the ground but troths have been pledged, anniversaries
celebrated, babies ushered into the world and important milestones reached.
Jewels to celebrate these events provide the bread and butter of the
jewellers' business. So even in 1992 (the last year for which figures are
available), when the recession had barely begun to recede, 55m different
diamond pieces, worth an average of just under Dollars 750, were bought
worldwide.
Take engagement rings - so strong is the custom that in the English-speaking
western world more than 70 brides in every 100 are given a diamond
engagement ring.
Standards of design have risen enormously - it is fashionable these days to
bash big corporations but it is hard to over-estimate the influence that de
Beers' annual international awards have had on diamond jewellery worldwide.
This year's collection of award-winners displays an astonishing range of
different techniques, styles and settings. For technique, take the flexible
bangle designed by Jennifer Bloy and made by Matthew Cambery which is the
winner of the UK section; for styles, compare the romantic, almost
old-fashioned diamond and platinum brooch designed by Yuko Nakajima of Japan
with the chunky necklace of white gold and apophylite crystal and diamonds
designed by Jul B Dizon of the Philippines. Nobody, after looking at the
dazzling collection (which they will be able to do at Christie's, 8 King
Street, London SW1 from May 5-13) could possibly think that the diamond
business is moribund.
But jewellers report that while buyers are still there (and indeed never
went away) these days they are infinitely more knowledgeable and twice as
cautious.
At Asprey of Bond Street, for instance, a boutique collection was launched
for the first time. A boutique collection is a fancy name for a lower-priced
range which its devisers hope will attract not just the eye of a love-lorn
suitor but also the hard-earned cash of the successful career girl who buys
for herself. The Sunflower collection has been a huge success - partly, it
seems, because there are pieces, such as a pair of ear-rings, that cost as
little as Pounds 350, and partly due to the interest generated by offering a
large new, accessibly-priced range of designs.
Jewellers everywhere report that although the business is there, they have
to work harder to get it, that people are more selective and have to be
persuaded that they are buying real value. However small the purchase,
customers like to know that it is a real carat or proper gold.
At Boodle &amp; Dunthorpe, a jewellery chain that started with shops in
Liverpool and Manchester and now has two London stores (one in Knightsbridge
and one in Bond Street) they generate interest with exhibitions, with
designer promotions and by taking care to offer pieces that, however
inexpensive, have something of quality about them.
Tastes have changed - there seems a greater fondness for the more discreet
look of platinum, for burnished rather than yellow gold, for simpler pieces
that can be worn through the day as well as by night. Stores such as
Tiffany, which always have wearable pieces that career girls can buy for
themselves and wear from the school-round in the morning, through the
boardroom meeting and on to the opera or to dinner, have done steady
business all through the recession.
A small, but important, sub-market has risen around the popularity of
body-piercing with the international young, and diamond studs continue to be
among the most popular of jewellery buys.
As always, whether it be restaurants or holidays, cosmetics or jewels, the
message seems to be - offer value for money, work hard and listen carefully
to the customer, and even in the direst of times, there is business to be
done.

FT  30 APR 94 / Survey of Clocks, Watches and Jewellery (6): Little pieces
of old magic - Vivienne Becker considers the continuing allure of antique
jewellery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIENNE BECKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to buying diamonds and gemstones, investment value and quality
are what buyers seem to look for. But when it comes to antique jewellery
different considerations come into play.
Jewellery as pure ornament, jewellery for art's sake, seems to be making a
comeback. Strong design that reeks of its era, of all periods and styles,
fine craftsmanship, inventive use of luxurious materials, and above all,
charm, are what canny connoisseurs of antique and period jewellery are
searching for; and they are prepared to pay handsomely for these ingredients
when they find them. The relentless hunt for quality is more than ever the
central theme of the antique and period jewellery market.
Last year was a turning point for fine jewellery at auction. Jewellery
appears to have been largely recession-proof, certainly at auction. The
problem in the trade has been one of acute shortage of the right goods to
appeal to an increasingly discerning clientele. Last year saw a growth
spurt, with an influx of fresh goods on the market, all culminating in the
well-publicised shattering of world records for diamonds and diamond jewels
at the Geneva sales last autumn.
This year looks set to be the year of the jewel rather than the gem, with
more emphasis than ever on design, provenance and romance. In fashion terms,
jewels of wit and whimsy are taking the place of flamboyant, flashy
adornments. Jewellery wearers want individual, meaningful, beautifully made
jewels that are reminiscent of their original, magical roles.
The forthcoming Geneva sales point in this direction. The chart-toppers this
spring are period pieces rather than rocks: Sotheby's is selling a ravishing
high-society collection of Duchess of Windsor look-alike jewels that
belonged to Helene Beaumont, the 1930s Riviera raver, masses of superb Van
Cleef &amp; Arpels rippling with ribbons of sapphires, emeralds, rubies and
diamonds; while Christie's concentrates on classical jewels from a European
Royal family; and Phillips parades a dramatic 1920s Egyptian revival Cartier
creation.
It is a trend that is permeating all levels of the market, from the top to
the middle range of collectable, wearable decorative accessories, where, for
example, 19th and 20th century jet and amber jewels, long rows of soft-toned
beads, antique crosses, all totally a la mode are being snapped up by
fashion followers.
In the realm of the true collector's item, selectivity rules. Only the best
and the rarest will do, and preferably with an impeccable background,
collectors would rather bide their time, saving their money for the big one.
At Bonhams at the end of last year, prices for jewels by Victorian
art-jeweller, Carlo Giuliano went through the roof, as hungry buyers,
chasing fresh goods with an unimpeachable lineage, paid more than twice the
generous estimates for purest Giuliano style: a star sapphire, enamel and
diamond parure reckoned at a generous Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 30,000 made a
staggering Pounds 46,200.
Although a name alone is not quite enough these days, a jewel has to stand
up for itself. Customers are still generally prepared to pay a premium for a
good signed piece. Cartier is still the magical name, synonymous with a lost
and longed-for era of gracious, glamorous living. Van Cleef &amp; Arpels packs a
pretty good punch too, each jewel a blissful package of superb gemstones and
haughty high-fashion.
Boucheron, Chaumet and the grand jewel houses are also seen as evocative
seals of quality and style, although slightly less well known names are
creeping up, particularly Lacloche and Ostertag of Paris, both known for
1920s and 1930s rich, orientalist opulence; Mauboussin, who epitomises the
1940s; and Sterle's energetic animals and wild birds with shaggy gold chain
manes, wings and tails which typify the look of the 1950s.
The baroque and rococo creations by high-society jewellers Verdura and
Schlumberger, the genuine originals from the 1940s to the 1960s, are rare
and prized by collectors as 20th century classics. The designer jeweller age
of the 1960s is slowly attracting a more appreciative audience; names to
conjure with include Grima, the British designer of prickly explosions of
gold and crystals, or David Webb, instigator of the chic Jackie Kennedy
image, all green enamel frogs and door knocker lion's heads bangles.
Fashion is influencing trends in the period jewellery market: crosses,
particularly Chanel-style Maltese crosses and Edwardian and Art Deco
cuff-links are selling well, and the Japanese have a penchant for pretty
bejewelled pocket watches. Tie pins with all sorts of interesting and
unusual motifs and gemstones, worn as lapel pins by women, or several at a
time on a waistcoat, provide a relatively inexpensive introduction to
antique and 20th century jewellery.
Sandra Cronan of Burlington Arcade, who sells decorative wearable jewellery,
medieval to mid-20th century, sees a trend towards rich gold Victorian
jewellery set with stones such as amethysts and carbuncle garnets.
'People are more positive and confident now,' she says, 'daring to wear
bigger and bolder antique jewellery in order to make a statement.'
Animals and insects are more popular than ever, from a delicate Regency
coloured-gold butterfly, symbol of the soul, to a little pair of Edwardian
owls on a crescent moon and a 1940s bird of paradise in shrieking colours.
Charm, apparently a rare commodity these days, with a generous dollop of
sentimental symbolism, sells every time. Perhaps it shows a new recognition
of the universal need to have small, personal, magical or amuletic objects
around us.

FT  30 APR 94 / Survey of Clocks, Watches and Jewellery (4): Clocks begin to
tick - Demand is rising and bargains getting fewer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT

<TEXT>
The past year or so has seen time hang heavily on the auction trade in
clocks; move more briskly for some watches; and positively buzz along for
jewels. But there are signs that the era of low, indeed bargain, prices for
higher quality antique clocks in the saleroom might be about to pass.
Demand has been brisker at recent auctions, and this should tempt on to the
market some of the good clocks which have been waiting for the higher prices
to return.
Many people like the idea of owning an antique clock, an impressive 18th
century longcase ticking away in their hall, but are deterred by their
ignorance and fears about the condition and conservation of such mature
specimens. They need not worry. At its last auction, Sotheby's offered 41
longcase clocks dating from the 1720s to 1900 and sold all but one at prices
ranging from Pounds 800 to Pounds 10,000.
A decent Georgian clock can be acquired in the saleroom for under Pounds
2,000. A restorer might charge Pounds 350 to put the mechanism in working
order and repairs might also be needed to the case. But, for less than
Pounds 3,500, you can have an attractive working antique.
Of course the big names - Tompions, Knibbs, Grahams and Delander - cost much
more. Any serious - and rich - collector of antiques should have a clock by
the father of British clockmaking, Thomas Tompion, on their buying list. His
appeal is international. Working in the late 17th and early 18th centuries
he commands a premium over all other makers.
In 1989, a rare blonde wood Tompion sold for Pounds 880,000. This was at the
peak of the antiques market but even in the doldrums of last June Christie's
offered some Tompions and they all made good prices, with a tiny, 6 1/3 in
high, silver mounted ebony bracket clock, probably made for King William
III, selling for Pounds 441,500, and a table clock for Pounds 298,500.
Since then, no important clock has appeared at auction, and the sluggish
demand of recent years has made a simple clock by Tompion (almost)
affordable.
No Tompions are on offer at the important June auctions in London, but a top
dealer such as R A Lee, (now part of Aspreys) could probably supply one for
less than Pounds 100,000 and a routine bracket clock by Tompion might be
acquired for as little as Pounds 40,000. Prices are low mainly because
dealers have run down their stocks and are unwilling to start buying again -
yet.
French clocks, with a wider range of collectors, are a slightly firmer
market, but a 19th century carriage clock can still be bought for Pounds
1,000. There is greater interest in the elaborate French Empire mantel
clocks, the more unusually decorative the better. Here prices have edged up
in the past year or so, but an excellent example should cost less than
Pounds 4,000.
There are many people who just cannot cope with the antique, with the
problems of maintenance. They want the finest craftsmanship, but they want
it to be contemporary.
There is at least one British clockmaker still working in the traditional
way, with virtually every component made in house. Sinclair Harding, of
Cheltenham, makes no more than 20 clocks a year and, at the Basle fair
introduced a new model, a skeleton sun and moon clock, plated in gold and
priced at around Pounds 8,000.
Watches have become the great fashion accessory, a palpable sign of wealth
and taste. They are now traded regularly in the salerooms, a service to
sellers who want to cash in expensive watches that might seem, to them,
dated: or they might have been given a newer model. You can acquire a recent
Breguet, Rolex, Cartier, Audemars Piguet or Patek Phillipe watch for perhaps
half its retail value. An older watch would be even cheaper.
A good solid pocket watch, a hunter, made in the late 19th century by the
celebrated Charles Frodsham, can still be bought for less than Pounds 4,000,
and will prove a reliable friend and an agreeable heirloom.
In the past year, jewels have become second only to Impressionist and modern
art as a money spinner for Sotheby's and Christie's. In 1993 Sotheby's
brought in Dollars 475m from jewels sales and Christie's Dollars 358m. In
1970 jewels were an insignificant sector.
The great majority of the trade is in stones, mainly diamonds, with a few
rich dealers, especially the Saudi Arabian Sheikh Ahmed Fitaihi, buying the
most expensive stones, including the Dollars 11.88m he paid for a 100-carat
diamond at Sotheby's in November.
Most of the buyers are Arabs, followed by Chinese and Latin Americans, and
there is an undoubted investment element behind the competition of the last
two years.
But high prices for stones has a knock-on effect on jewellery. Salerooms
have done their best to promote their involvement, stressing that as well as
glitzy events at Geneva and St Moritz they also hold auctions, such as the
evening 'Colonnade' events at Sotheby's, the sales at Christie's South
Kensington, Phillips and Bonhams, where lots usually sell for Pounds 2,000
or less.
More private buyers are daring to take on the dealers in the saleroom and
are acquiring jewellery, from 19th century to contemporary, at modest
expense.
Although the auction houses offer clocks, watches and jewels at wholesale
prices many people still prefer to collect with a dealer holding their hand.
Good dealers are keen to offer impartial advice; they guarantee the
authenticity and condition of the goods, which is so important with antique
clocks; and they will often agree to buy them back.
A specialist clock dealer, such as Anthony Woodburn, of Tunbridge Wells,
Kent, also often has its own sources of supply, and can offer a year-round
service.
While English furniture has generally ridden out the recession well, clocks
have remained in their specialist ghetto. Why people keen to acquire 18th
and 19th century tables and chairs, dressers and desks, should baulk at
buying an antique clock is not clear. Perhaps their sheer size counts
against substantial late 19th century longcase (grandfather) clocks, but
bracket clocks, carriage clocks, mantel clocks and lantern clocks and
chronometers provide charm and utility.
It is probably the mystery of the inner workings that deters potential
collectors. But there has never been a better time to acquire an antique
clock, either in the euphoria of the auction house, or after careful
consultation with a dealer.

FT  30 APR 94 / Survey of Clocks, Watches and Jewellery (2): The changing
faces of fashion / A look at the latest design trends in timely accessories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a time when watches existed independently of fashion. Men or women
customarily received an important watch to mark their 21st birthday and,
other than the addition of a dress watch, they continued to wear the same
timepiece.
However, the watch has become a fashion accessory. 'Today the norm is to
have many different watches for several different functions: a classical
watch for smarter events and evening, a fun watch that can be worn casually
at the weekend and sports watch to wear in the office which, although being
a diving watch or chronograph, will never go near the water and have nothing
more important to time than seconds on a parking meter,' says Matthew Cundy,
sales manager for Cartier.
But what of trends? Although flashy watches, bristling with precious stones,
remain popular in the middle and far east, the general movement, like
fashion itself, is far from the ostentation typical of the 1980s. 'It is no
longer important for your wrist to show everyone how successful you are. All
that matters is that you know,' says Cundy.
Frank Edwards, of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, agrees: 'Watch
makers have latched on to a need to get away from the avaricious 1980s and a
yearning towards a more romantic, stable and attractive past.'
To this end, Cartier has designed a charming Art Deco range, made from
materials such as black enamel and diamonds. Franck Muller, a newish, clever
Geneva watchmaker, has produced a range of wristwatches called Casablanca.
You must go to Switzerland to buy them.
Nostalgia manifests itself in two ways. First, the mechanical watch, which
only a few years ago was threatened with extinction by quartz, has fought
back. It accounts for 12 per cent of volume and 48 per cent of value of all
Swiss watches sold. Chris Parks, of Chronoswiss, a brand of watches with
customised movements that has enjoyed great success since its introduction
to Britain a year ago, says: 'Why buy something that has been stamped out on
a production line, when you can have a watch that has been made by
craftsmen?'
Secondly, there has been a renaissance of watches that were popular in the
inter-war years. 'Improved technology has meant that square watches are ripe
for a relaunch, because the glasses are now made of sapphire crystal, which
does not fall out and protects against dust and damp,' says Parks. All the
leading brands have them.
Patek Philippe, which makes some of the most beautiful watches, has a
chronograph in a tonneau case with a perpetual calendar and, for women, a
rectangular Gondolo watch with an elegant bezel paved with diamonds.
Cartier produces its famous 'tanks', including the new Tank Obus which
features Roman numerals and a crown set with a cabochon sapphire.
Jaegar-LeCoutre offers Reverso Duo, which has two back-to-back dials,
showing times in different zones.
Franck Muller has devised his own version of the tonneau, known as a curvex,
which houses intricate mechanisms. Grand old Breguet has a super tonneau and
Audemar Piquet delights with a 1940s-style square wristwatch in 18-carat
gold. More affordably, there are tanks from Gucci, Maurice Lacroix, which
offers designs for men and women in a curved shape that fits the wrist
perfectly, and Oris, which has created a handsome model in gold, steel, and
gold plate to mark its 90th birthday.
Metal colours are also changing. There has been an increase in the number of
watches made in white materials such as steel, white gold and, even the
expensive and notoriously difficult to work, platinum. Omega has a limited
edition of 50 beautiful platinum watches to mark the 25th anniversary of
man's first step on the moon. Baume &amp; Mercier offers the Hampton, which has
a curved, polished, stainless steel case and matching bracelet. Zenith sells
a range of steel chronographs which are modestly priced but good looking.
However, for all the purity of white metals, it would be a mistake to
believe there is no colour around. Coloured faces - particularly a certain
shade of Royal blue - abound and add an individuality to any watch.
Coloured straps are also in abundance - reflecting the trend for buying an
assortment of straps with a watch. Breitling, makers of pilot watches, is
offering colours that must have found their inspiration in a sweet shop.
The most colourful watches are, of course, the cheap, fun throwaway ones.
Swatch, which can be credited with persuading people to have a wardrobe of
watches, still dominates. The new collection includes pop-outs, scuba - for
underwater sports, stopwatches and an alarm to wake you up with a jolly
tune. A brand to watch is Mondaine, which offers many fun designs including
the award-winning Swiss Railway clock watch, the brightly-coloured M-Watch
and an interesting little number based on a yoghurt pot.
Sport continues to assert the same directional influence on watches as it
has on fashion.
'Cultural and social changes such as increased leisure time and emphasis on
looking sporty and dynamic have contributed to an explosion in sales,' says
Duckworth He introduced Tag Heuer to Britain a decade ago and can boast a
seven-fold increase in turnover. He says people are spending more on sports
watches and has introduced a new 18-carat gold addition to the 6000 range.
Also, more women, according to Duckworth, are buying sports watches and he
has a new automatic which manages to look both sporty and smart.
Adidas, known for its sports equipment, has launched a range of timepieces,
including functional and rugged models designed for tough sports, classical
chronographs, water-resistant to 200 metres, and a set of inexpensive sporty
leisure watches.
Sector, which specialises in watches that perform well in extreme weather
conditions, has the new Underlab STE, which boasts an extremely strong steel
/ fibre glass case and is available in four versions including two
chronographs. Ebel offers the handsome Sportwave Chronograph: robust and
functional, it times performances on three registers to a tenth of a second,
gives intermediary times, has a tachymeter and is available on either
bracelet or leather strap.
Even Dunhill, that most sedate of companies, known more for its period
watches, has shaped-up with the Londynium, which, although designed to be
worn at all times, has a particularly sporty appearance and is available in
four sizes in steel, steel combination and 18-carat gold.
Finally, if you are looking for something completely different, why not
invest in the latest trend - erotic watches. Hublot, better known for
discreet little timepieces is enamelling illustrations of the Karma Sutra on
to its watches, while Blancpain, that outwardly most understated of
watchmakers, has a range that features couples (all proclivities catered
for) copulating with all moving parts (literally). The designs are so
explicit that I am told the watches might soon be banned.

FT  30 APR 94 / Survey of Clocks, Watches and Jewellery (3): Collectors'
items - The rebound of the wristwatch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GARNIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last autumn Patek Philippe, a leading Swiss watch house, issued a
collectors' watch on classic lines. The watch was to celebrate the 150th
anniversary of the appointment of Garrard's, of London, as crown jewellers
and was available only through Garrard's.
It was limited to 150 pieces in rose gold with a rose gold dial and the
glazed back revealing the self-winding movement with engraved pivoted rotor
weight.
Priced at just under Pounds 8,000, it sold out in under two months,
providing confirmation, if any were needed, of the health of the retail
wristwatch market, especially for watches with collector appeal.
Serious collecting of wristwatches is still a comparatively new phenomenon.
A little history puts this in context. Having started out in the mid-1800s
as women's bangles, with a timepiece concealed behind a hinged cover,
wristwatches were originally considered effeminate. But during the first
world war, the prejudice was overcome by the convenience of wearing a watch
on the wrist, rather than carrying it in a pocket.
The spread of the car sealed the popularity of wristwatches for men and
there was even a model developed - the Driver's watch - that curved to fit
the wrist so that time could be read with both hands on the steering wheel.
Initially, most people owned just one watch, acquired at some significant
moment such as a 21st birthday, and it was the best that could be afforded.
Of course it had to be Swiss.
When the quartz watch arrived in 1975 it was dismissed by the Swiss watch
houses as beneath them.
Cheap quartz watches, made in vast quantities, especially in Hong Kong,
Taiwan and South Korea, soon grabbed a sizeable slice of the world market
and the Swiss watch industry was heading into crisis. It is said that 60 per
cent of the Swiss watch labour force was laid off for good.
But the very cheapness and impersonal, mass-produced nature of these early
quartz watches - mostly digital - bred a reaction in the buying public. By
1980, analogue dials with conventional faces and rotating hands were again
heavily in demand.
Although a ready source of traditional watches was found in the rapidly
expanding secondhand market, the Swiss watch houses responded by going
either down or upmarket.
Marques such as Accurist, Avia, Rotary, Tissot and Longines embraced quartz
in order to produce a reasonably cheap analogue watch. Others, such as the
big five - Patek Philippe, Rolex, Vacheron Constantin, Audemars Piguet,
Jaeger-LeCoultre and IWC - stayed upmarket. They also dug into their history
and put back into production some more complicated classic models that had
started to command high prices in the secondhand auction market.
There are still two markets and retail sales have remained remarkably
buoyant.
The focus is on highly complicated pieces with multifarious features such as
perpetual calendars allowing for leap years and minute repeating actions.
These are long in the making and cannot keep up with demand. At the Basle
fair this month there was great interest in new models from retailers
encouraged by sales increases.
At auction, comparisons can be made with the top of the market in 1990.
Prices fell by between 25 and 30 per cent across the board. Some fared even
worse: Tina Millar, of Sotheby's, quotes the example of a typical
chronograph (zeroing stopwatch) that would have made Pounds 18,000-Pounds
20,000 then but now commands only Pounds 8,000-Pounds 10,000, even though
the market bottomed out towards the end of 1992, around Black Monday. Again,
world time-indicating wristwatches, by Patek, now routinely make Pounds
25,000-Pounds 30,000 as opposed to Pounds 70,000-Pounds 80,000 in 1989/90.
Undoubtedly, in the late 1980s, speculators were active in the market. Since
then greater sense has prevailed.
Sellers are accepting more conservative pre-sale estimates, even at
Antiquorum's Geneva sales.
London auctioneers can now boast high success rates - only 7 per cent unsold
in Sotheby's March sale, while Christie's sale, also last month, was not too
far behind at 14 per cent unsold.
Discernment, rather than investment, is the by-word in the current market.
Thus Simon Bull, formerly of Antiquorum, talks of a buyer who spent
SFr400,000 on a split-action chronograph by Patek - rare because of its
steel case, whereas Millar cannot see the rare platinum (one of only three)
calendar, moon-phase watch making as much today as the Pounds 280,000 it
sold for in 1990 in London.
One section of the auction market that has dwindled to nothing is
collectable Swatches. While producers of low-production models such as the
Sun King, Swatch 1993 Christmas specials (only 1,300 were allocated to the
UK market) can see queues on launch day, none of the auction houses are
selling second-hand Swatches any longer. This was a speculative market and
has proved a flash in the pan.
Auctioneers trumpet sales statistics, but retailers are more discreet. While
far eastern buyers took up 14.28 per cent of the March watch sale at
Christie's, the east Pacific rim accounts for a significant slice of the
retail market, supplanting the Italian domination of the 1980s. Rolex is the
volume seller, Audemars and Patek and other complicated watches are widely
collected. Customers in the far east are highly brand-conscious, but taste
is by no means uniform.
Quartz watches are more popular than mechanical ones because resetting
complicated calendar watches is easier. Taiwan and Singapore collectors,
while appreciating complicated watches, concentrate just as much on their
decorative appeal, akin to the Arab taste of 10 years ago. There can be
resistance to 'used' property in Moslem communities.
The Japanese are famous for shopping around before buying. Their view is
long-term - and speculation in a 'watch market' seems a western
preoccupation.
The inclusion of one of the Garrard's / Patek watches in a London sale will
soon show whether there are still occasional quick profits to be made, now
that on-sale premiums for rarer Rolex models, such as Daytonas, have all but
gone. The pre-sale estimate of up to Pounds 6,000 may prove encouragingly
conservative, considering that the previous Patek special limited edition
watch, the Officier of 1989, repeatedly resells at way over its original
offer price, and more than 2,000 of them were issued.

FT  30 APR 94 / Survey of Clocks, Watches and Jewellery (1): Revived Swiss
masters glory in complication - Ian Rodger goes to the Basle fair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicolas Hayek, the flamboyant chairman of SMH, the leading Swiss watches
group, set last month's annual European Watch, Clock and Jewellery Fair in
Basle off with a bang.
Hayek brought in Neil Armstrong, the astronaut who landed on the moon in
1969, to help promote Omega, one of SMH's many watch brands. Armstrong wore
an Omega Speedmaster chronograph watch on his historic mission.
Together with two other astronauts, Hayek and Armstrong sat at the Omega
stand and tried to have what was billed as an intellectual discussion about
time and the cosmos for 1 1/2 hours.
With the jostling of photographers and some banal initial questioning by the
moderator, the so-called Omega Forum was unlikely to live up to its billing,
but amid tough competition it attracted attention.
Indeed, it was difficult, even without a media event, to maintain focus in
this Aladdin's cave that the Basle Fair has become. Although quaintly titled
'European', it has long been the most important trade fair for the world's
watch and clock makers.
This year, 562 exhibitors from 15 countries participated in the watch and
clock section. Officials claimed that about two thirds of world trade in
these products would be initiated there.
Products ranged from an 18-carat gold skeletonised chiming watch from
Vacheron Constantin, worth about Pounds 400,000, to arrays of plain kitchen
electric clocks.
The main message from the fair this year was the restored prosperity of many
Swiss watchmakers. Companies such as Breitling, Tag Heuer and Oris, on their
knees a decade ago, were confidently displaying new products on lavish
stands. Tag, for example, claims to have raised its turnover tenfold in the
past decade, Oris to have doubled its sales since 1989.
This recovery is closely linked with the resurgence of demand for mechanical
watches, both automatic and manual, following the onslaught of quartz models
in the 1970s and early 1980s.
The Swiss excel at making mechanical watches, and the recovery shows up most
dramatically in the Swiss statistics. Last year, the value of Swiss watch
exports reached SFr7.6bn (Pounds 3.6bn), double the level of a decade ago.
For mechanical watch devotees, the Basle fair offered a feast of new and
revived designs, with ever more impressive complications.
One of the more remarkable was a reversible model from Jaeger-LeCoultre with
a functioning watch on each side, the so called Reverso Duo. Each watch
operates independently but but both are powered by the same movement.
Other unusual collectors' items came from Chronoswiss, a 10-year-old company
which, in spite of its name, is based in Munich. It specialises in
reproductions of antique watches, many with regulator mechanisms, in which
the main face has only the minute hand while the hour hand appears on a
smaller superimposed face.
In the realm of eye-catching gimmicks, it would be difficult to beat
Blancpain's proposal to construct erotic action scenes on the backs of its
elegant watches. For its ladies' models, the company has also developed a
mechanism for easily changing armbands to match the wearer's clothes.
These and many other fantasies could be found mainly in hall 101 at Basle,
the so-called Prestige Hall reserved for the glitterati of the world watch
business.
But the renewed popularity of mechanical watches has gone down-market as
well. The determinedly middle-market Oris has brought out models with
complications in the less-than-Pounds 1,000 price range.
At the regular press conference of Japan's Citizen Watch, an official said
the complexity of many multi-function watches had gone too far, and
predicted that models would become more user-friendly. However, one of the
watches Citizen introduced at the fair, the Promaster Navihawk, may well
have set a record for the number of digits and letters that appear on a
single watch face.
The fair was again notable for its distinguished absentees, including Swatch
and some other companies in the SMH group, and the companies in the Cartier
luxury products group. SMH withdrew seven years ago after a row over space,
but Omega, an SMH company, returned last year and brought Longines with it
this year. The group's policy henceforth will be to have Omega and one other
brand represented at the fair each year.
Cartier, Piaget and Baume &amp; Mercier pulled out three years ago because the
event was not exclusive enough. As a Cartier executive put it at the time:
'Our clients do not like the smell of sausages.' They started their own more
exclusive annual show, the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie, in
Geneva, which runs concurrently with the Basle fair and which they claim has
already established itself.
Basle officials observed that the Cartier defection has not been followed by
others from the Prestige Hall. Also, a couple of the Cartier brands, Dunhill
and Gerald Genta, have kept their stands in Basle.
Philippe Levy, the chief executive of the Basle fair organisation, departed
in December after the city fathers vetoed a plan to build a regional
exhibition centre together with neighbouring French and German communities.
Fair officials insisted that the parochialism implied by the decision would
not extend to their exhibition policies. Indeed, the name of the Watch Fair
would finally be changed next year to the 'World Fair for Watches, Clocks
and Jewellery'.
But it was bad news for the 500 odd watch and jewellery companies still
waiting for space in the fair's existing cramped quarters.

FT  30 APR 94 / Gardening: Poetic justice for recalcitrant roses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We are now into the season when booklets try to tell you how to solve your
garden's problems. You need slug killer round the hostas, which are emerging
bravely this week, and my hellibors have required slug-killer already, an
invisible reason for their poor performance.
On both, I use Growing Success, the granules of which are consumed like
blue-rinse caviar and send the enemy to an organic death. Emergent ground
elder is clouted with Roundup and the purple slugs of young bindweed are
attacked with the higher fire-power of SDK Brushwood Killer.
But no leaflet tells you how to deal with my most maddening problem: roses
which go backwards, not forwards. This week, I have invented my own solution
and tried poetic justice instead.
This has been needed where the auspices, at first, seemed perfect. Three
years ago, the July sun was rising on the old-fashioned roses and us
reptiles of Fleet Street were being feted in one of our finest rose gardens;
there was even a lady in cream silk to welcome us by playing a harp.
Escaping her harping, I turned left at an arbour of Constance Spry roses and
encountered Graham Thomas, the UK's greatest living expert on this flower.
With reptilian skill, I worked round to my question of the moment: what rose
would he choose to train on wires for a low rose hedge? Kathleen Harrop, he
replied, without hesitation.
She had crossed my mind already because she is a rose with everything. Her
stems are formless; her flowers are silvery pink; her season is long; and
her elegant leaves have a slight purple flush. Emboldened, I ordered a dozen
from Peter Beales in Norfolk. They were end-of-season plants but, I
reasoned, surely Kathleen's stems would take off from the long roots which
he searched out for me?
The years passed and the wires are rusting: progress has been negative.
Every March, the leaf buds open and there is a slight attempt at growth, but
the stems are as thin as pencils.
In their first year, they caught me out by getting Black Spot as early as
April; since then, I have moved back my preventive measures to early spring
and I am spraying - as you should also spray your roses - with Nimrod Thomas
as early as late February. Thanks to Nimrod, Kathleen still goes black and
yellow - but not until late May.
So why is Kathleen in such a sulk? I have concluded that it is either me or
the soil. And since I am not moving out for a rose bush, the soil has had to
go.
None of the endless books on roses discusses the idea but, if roses want
heavy clay, why not give them loads of it? Why not bus in a lump of
unworkable Essex if Kathleen Harrop luxuriates in the old Thatcherite
heartland? There are precedents, although you have to look for them.
In my mind's eye, I see an old archbishop of Pisa who plainly thought on the
right lines in the high Middle Ages. The benefactor class there wanted
privileges in return for gifts. The Italian church could not give them
birthday honours but the archbishop offered them an extra-special death
instead.
Through the city's network of crusading contacts, he arranged for a shipment
of sanctified compost, dug on site near the holiest places of the Holy Land.
Wheelbarrows had not been invented in the 13th century, but the compost
arrived on carts and was scattered into his church's cloister, the
present-day Campo Santo.
What is the equivalent of sanctified compost for today's Oxford atheist? A
barrow-load from Basildon lacks political correctness - but where else do
roses luxuriate?
I have watched new gardeners steal up on me in the past five years of
post-youth enterprise, but none has stolen further than my long-standing
friend of the Muses, the poet James Fenton. On May 14, all well-meaning
Oxford MAs will be bussing themselves to the university to vote in the new
Professor of Lower Poetry: why not declare the campaign open by bussing a
load of earth from his rose garden in my direction first?
The Fenton roses do not merely flower and proliferate: they beam with the
blessings of the sister Muses. Admittedly, they grow on foolproof grey-green
clay within sight of Matthew Arnold's poetic landscape. Where Poetry
alights, honey sweats from oak trees, brickbats burst into garlands of iris,
and even the brambles are supposed to go mad with roses.
This week, I have completed my poetic transplant. There have been no
wheelbarrows, either, and loads of appalling clay have been shifted in the
car boot. Do roses really like this awful sludge? Is this grey horticultural
plasticine really the answer to Kathleen Harrop? And what if the problem is
the nurserymen, not the flower bed?
Just to be sure, I have changed the roses, too. A new batch from Scotts of
Somerset is sitting in the sludge which they are said to like best and I
cannot help noting that the new Harrops are putting out leaflets already.
Unless I am blind, though, they have little black spots on their tips . .  .

FT  30 APR 94 / Travel: FT Round the World Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They began the year in North America and are now
in Europe.
Arnie reports: At last - good weather. Early in the week, it was still
snowing quite heavily in Alpe d'Huez, allegedly one of the sunniest ski
resorts in France.
But later, in the spectacular resort of La Grave, we enjoyed a stunning day
of bright sunshine and oceans of fresh powder.
At Alpe d'Huez, Lucy and I accessed the skiing area from Vaujany - the only
people in the 160-person cable car on the way up - and down. With luck,
rather than judgment, we keep arriving in ski resorts the day before they
close. In Courchevel, Meribel, Les Menuires and Val Thorens we played 'hunt
the lift that is working'.
Almost a year to the day since the skiing accident which had left him in a
wheelchair, Mike Browne, boss of Snow + Rock, arrived in Meribel to ski with
us. 'This is the moment I have waited for for a year,' he said.
The thought of accompanying the FT's expedition had been one of the chief
driving forces in Mike learning to ski again, using a specially adapted
ski-bob. He was able to use the button lifts and chairs, and although
paralysed from the waist, skied incredibly well using 'outrider' skis with
his arms.
Mike also delivered, as he had promised to do before his accident,
replacements for some of our worn, damaged or lost equipment, including the
vital Avocet watch which records vertical feet, and heels for my ski boots,
which had been worn down by walking on so many snowless tracks after a day's
skiing.
Worn heels can become dangerous as they can allow boots to release
unexpectedly from bindings - the last thing we need with eight months of
skiing still ahead of us.
On our last afternoon in the Trois Vallees we were tempted to ski the three
couloirs on Courchevel's piste map. My daughter Samantha, who had joined us
for a week, had never skied a couloir before, let alone three in one
afternoon.

FT  30 APR 94 / Property: The islands where time slows down - Gerald Cadogan
goes offshore to find homes with the promise of an independent and peaceful
life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For an independent life, it is hard to beat the offshore islands of the
British Isles. The pace is slower and the need for self-sufficiency greater
 -in case storms stop the ferry and the aeroplanes.
On the Isle of Wight, the 'old fogey' retired locals at Bembridge go to
ground in the summer, to emerge in September for hunting and shooting.
'There is a splendid hunt which rarely catches a fox but gives a lot of
people a lot of pleasure,' I was told.
Out of season, Bembridge is a joy even if, in summer, it is a playground for
the champagne and sailing set. 'But all the same, it is fun to have them
around,' a local says.
Seaview and Cowes are the other main haunts for smart sailors. In the 1980s,
many of them stopped going to the island and went to France and the
Mediterranean instead. Now, they are staying closer to home. Why? School
fees and Lloyd's are thought to have some relevance.
The car ferries can be a problem and many people leave their vehicles on the
mainland, at Portsmouth Harbour station, and take the fast catamaran to Ryde
pier. There are also hovercraft on the crossing. A tunnel to the island,
much talked-about, might happen one day - but Eurotunnel will need to
succeed first.
For farmers needing to get animals to market and the slaughterhouse, a
tunnel would be a blessing. The local abattoir closed in 1992; now,
Salisbury is the closest. Since the trip is expensive, it is not surprising
that several farms are for sale.
Yet, it is a gentle life for the residents - 'rather like Ireland,' as one
described it. Indeed, the last really big event was D-Day and the
preparations for it. Some want more visitors, and to encourage pop concerts.
But many like it because it is quiet.
Dolphin House, a sailor's property at Wootton Bridge with its own mooring,
slipway and pontoon, has just been sold by Humberts (with Christopher
Scott); it had a guide price of Pounds 380,000. On offer from Fox in
Newport, however, are several attractive old cottages between Pounds 130,000
and Pounds 150,000. The old Ashey station - now a red brick house with six
bedrooms and an Aga - costs Pounds 135,000 and still has the Isle of Wight
Steam Railway running past.
In Ryde Coromandel (11 Bellevue Road) is a stuccoed Regency villa with a
semi-circular drawing room with verandah outside. It has a vaguely colonial
look: somewhere to drink gin in a wicker chair and tap the barometer. Did a
sea captain build it? The price from Fox is Pounds 135,000.
In Cowes, Mariners House - on offer from Scott for Pounds 380,000 - is on
the waterfront and has three 'crew rooms' in the attic (ideal for an ocean
racing team or a large family) and splendid views of the Solent.
For Pounds 235,000, Fox's Shanklin office is selling Sandford House,
substantial and Victorian, in Sandford village.
For Pounds 320,000, Scott and Hamptons offer jointly Horringford House, a
Queen Anne property with barns, a cottage and a lake. William Cromwell lived
here, grandson of Oliver and heir to Richard as Lord Protector. 'WMC 1718'
is on a stone over the front door.
The Isle of Man is famous for kippers (with no artificial dye) and fresh
fish. 'My parents can never eat English fish,' says a Manx friend. And it is
almost always raining which, as we all know, is good for the garden.
The landscape is a rich mixture of mountains, glens, waterfalls and beaches.
Only the noisy din of the Tourist Trophy motorcycle races interrupts the
quiet from time to time.
In this rural haven, crime is low.
There has been some resentment of settlers from Britain, known as
'come-overs'. Some are the super-rich attracted by income tax at 20 per cent
and no capital gains or inheritance tax; this has produced a two-tier
society, and smart restaurants.
The property market is cheerier than a year ago. The financial sector in
Douglas is now hiring locals as well as outsiders; this is helping the whole
island economy, according to estate agent Chrystals. Come-overs will often
be looking for a house costing upwards of Pounds 200,000. Among the
islanders, there are more first-time buyers.
There is some movement in the market for the most expensive houses. Dean
Wood recently sold Ballacriy Manor in Colby, a neo-Georgian stately home
with pediment and columns, for Pounds 850,000.
But The Nunnery, racehorse owner Robert Sangster's glorious Victorian Gothic
house - complete with a chapel where services are still held - remains on
the market. The price from Dean Wood and Aylesford is Pounds 3.5m, compared
with the original figure of more than Pounds 5m.
For Pounds 700,000, Chrystals offers Middle Garth at Marown. This solid,
large farmhouse comes with 22 acres and a guest/granny cottage. The rates
are an incredibly cheap Pounds 291.
Glen Truan at Bride, with 13 acres and views across the Ayres to a distant
Scotland at the north tip of the island, is on offer from Chrystals at
Pounds 295,000. The agent is also selling the white-painted Corris's Croft
at The Garey, near Ramsey, for Pounds 350,000; and the Spanish-style Villa
Carina, near Maughold, for Pounds 365,000.
The Scilly Isles, warmed by the Gulf Stream, are a gardener's delight and a
place of beauty and calm, with few houses. 'They are like Cornwall but
better,' says Tony Dingley of Island Properties.
Eighty people live on the small island of St Agnes, which is linked by boat
to St Mary's. In turn, that has mailboat and helicopter connections to
Penzance, and an aeroplane to St Just, at Land's End.
There is a pub on St Agnes but no hotel.
The beaches are marvellous and traffic hardly exists. Miller and Island
Properties jointly offer a 52-year lease (from the Duchy of Cornwall) on
Barnaby Cottage, with its own mooring, for Pounds 199,950.
On St Martin's, most north-easterly of the Scillies, Island Properties is
selling Bleak House - an old farmhouse with palm trees in the garden - for
Pounds 160,000, and the 1822 Rock House for Pounds 150,000. The rock is
granite.

FT  30 APR 94 / Travel: In the tracks of Quixote across a land of fantasy -
As Jimmy Burns crosses La Mancha in search of a hero, reality and fiction
begin to merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With a name of a conquistador and the bearing of a well-nourished Castilian
peasant, Jose Diaz Pintado Carreton struck me as just the person I was
looking for in my quest for Don Quixote.
He ran a small electronics shop in the central square of Argamasilla del
Alba, specialising in Japanese organs, but it was not because of his
dedication to new technology that I had been guided to him.
Don Jose, plump, moustachioed, and with a boisterous laugh that made his
organs rattle, was an Academico de Argamasilla, with a life-long hobby of
dedication to Spain's most universal literary hero.
We shared a bottle of wine and a large piece of chorizo. He erupted with
laughter when I asked him what university he taught at. 'I am not an
academic. I'm an eternal fan, an aficionado dedicated to supposition,
speculation, and pure faith.'
Don Quixote sets off on his travels from an unnamed 'place in La Mancha',
that region of Spain's central plain which lies between Madrid and
Andalucia. Consequently, each little town for 200 kilometres south of the
capital claims Don Quixote as its own.
But Jose was insistent that Argamasilla - today a dusty agricultural town
filled with olive pickers and vine diggers - was the place where it all
began and where it ended. Here was the library where his hero had studied
his books of chivalry. Here was the prison where he had languished. 'I've
spent my life trying to find out why. Was it because he didn't pay his taxes
or because he wolf-whistled a noble lady; either thesis is possible.'
No use arguing with Jose that Don Quixote never existed, and that the man
imprisoned in Argamasilla was Miguel Cervantes, his hero's inventor. I had
been travelling long enough in La Mancha to understand that this is the kind
of region in which one can easily believe in anything.
A few days earlier I had flown to Madrid, seeking out Europe's
self-proclaimed cultural capital. The Prado, as always, was a joy, but
before getting to the now-permanent Thyssen exhibition, I had already sought
escape from the frenetic traffic, the pollution and the sense of collective
malaise which my Spanish friends say is a symptom of recession.
I left armed with Cervantes' masterpiece in my bag, and the thoughts of the
Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset in my head: 'Castille, felt as visual
unreality,' wrote Ortega some 70 year ago, 'is one of the most beautiful
things in the Universe.'
After the office blocks and the traffic jams came the open plains of La
Mancha, not green, certainly, but not barren or uncompromising either:
Castille here is a kaleidoscope of changing shapes and colours. First comes
the reddish earth where the vines are lined one behind the other; then the
mountains of the south looming on the horizon like sea monsters washed on to
some hugely distant shore.
Along the way there is an extraordinary sense of space, broken occasionally
by a flock of sheep or a clump of olive trees where the vines leave off. Not
since motoring through Patagonia had I felt a similar sense of anguish mixed
with heightened expectation. I was hungry and thirsty, too.
Deliverance from the motorway came in the form of the first necessary port
of call on my literary journey: Puerto Lapice. It was into this village that
Don Quixote had ridden 'weary and dying of hunger . . . looking in all
directions to see if he could discover any castle or shepherd's hut' where
he could take shelter.
Having parked the car, we wandered on foot through the streets of brilliant
whitewash, where fruit was being pressed and horseshoes forged in inner
courtyards, but where otherwise nothing seemed to be happening under the
sun. My companion stopped to cash a traveller's cheque in the bank, and was
told by a young clerk that she had never handled such an instrument.
It was lunchtime, though, and it was not hard to find a local inhabitant
with a sense of priorities. 'The Venta de Don Quixote,' said a woman in
black, pointing down an avenue of white.
In the venta, or inn, a rusty set of armour lay abandoned next to a stone
trough, and a group of waiters in starched shirts stood by empty tables in
an open courtyard lined with blue tiles.
' . . . Now there chanced to be standing at the inn two young women of easy
virtue who were on their way to Seville with some water carriers . . . As
everything that our adventurer thought, saw or imagined seemed to follow the
fashion of his reading, . . . he convinced himself that it was a fortress
with its four towers and pinnacles of silver . . .'
The only female strangers I saw - one with a mass of black curls, the other
with stunning blue eyes - were cleaning the kitchen floor and seemed in a
hurry, not to move on to Seville but to get back to Madrid, from where they
had reluctantly emigrated.
I shadow boxed with the armour before allowing myself to be led to a table
in the spirit of Sancho Panza. We drank a litre of Valdepenas wine, and
guzzled beans, chorizo and bits of smoked ham served in an earthenware bowl.
The stew, or olla, has been La Mancha's peasant fare for many centuries, and
no amount of fast food chains - of increasing prominence in metropolitan
Spain - has managed to eradicate it.
Beyond the venta, up in the hills, above another glittering village of
whitewash and blue tiles - Campo Criptana - were the windmills. That
afternoon they stood defiantly as a wind gathered and whistled across the
prairie, picking up dust. A young Dutch couple sat leaning against their
rucksacks, staring at a red sun. When they saw me, the man asked: 'Do those
windmills make bread?'
I told him: 'Those you see there are giants with long arms; some of them
have them six miles long.'
The Dutchman smiled: 'Well it makes a change from looking at cathedrals.' He
had recently been in Toledo.
For a long time we stood there, saying nothing else, just listening to the
wind and watching our children dance between the 'giants'. With their black
hair and wild gestures and laughter, they seemed caught in a dream of
gypsies which my hero on occasions stumbled on.
Beyond us a madman, his trousers half-way down to his ankles, was
gesticulating at one of the giant's arms with a walking stick. His
expletives were almost incomprehensible, but I gathered he had been
abandoned by his wife.
Later that afternoon I stopped for the night at the next village on the
Quixote trail, El Toboso. Here the house of Dulcinea, the rough peasant cook
my hero took for a princess, has been preserved as a museum, next to a
convent where the nuns intersperse their prayer sessions with
biscuit-baking.
We took a room above an inn, where the largely male clientele seemed either
tall, bearded and very thin, or short and stocky - Quixotes or Sanchos
almost to a man. We were fed on gachas, a quite indigestible dish also of
long-standing tradition in Castilian peasant kitchens: bits of pork fat
fried with garlic and hot peppers.
I was conscious that Don Quixote had searched for his princess after
midnight, so, restored with a large brandy, I set off into the night. The
tall tower of El Toboso's 16th century parish church stood out above the
narrow streets, its pale stone illuminated and turned golden in the sea of
black. Except for those in the inn, the whole population appeared to have
retired. The only beings were a dog distantly barking and a ginger cat that
followed me for an hour, purring and sliding his back along the whitewash.
Near the local convent, Dulcinea's house was closed for the evening.
The next day, armed with a map provided by the parish priest, Don Nicolas -
another Quixote expert - I went looking for the Cave of Montesinos - scene
of Don Quixote's mostly demented dream - in the lake district of La Mancha.
The lakes are small lagoons which have gathered mirage-like and somewhat
miraculously in an area surrounded by arid lands.
The cave was well off the main road, across a countryside of petrified trees
and loose bramble. Luckily the crippled vegetation was not too overgrown so
I did not need to use a sword, as my hero had done, to cut my way through
the cave's mouth. But neither did I have a rope and Sancho to lower me in. I
stepped forward cautiously, using a torch.
For many centuries the wizard Montesinos had waited for Don Quixote deep in
this cave. Thanks to him, the mad knight discovered enchanted castles and
Dulcinea del Toboso, and re-emerged a better man, his courage proved, his
dream fulfilled.
I was frightened out of my wits by a large bat. It was the the only other
living creature I encountered before chasing my own shadow and running out,
back into the sunlight. All around me the plains of La Mancha were melting
to the sound of crickets.

FT  30 APR 94 / Travel: Boom-town Shanghai can learn from its dubious past -
Stanley Stewart explores a city at the forefront of China's rush to the
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STANLEY STEWART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At lunch, the Hong Kong businessman could hardly contain himself. He waved
his chopsticks, swallowed a snake, and conjured investors' dreams through
mouthfuls of clouds' ears. 'It's big. It's very big. It's almost too big.'
He choked on a duck's foot and leant across the table. 'One point one
billion people,' he whispered, as if China's population was a secret he felt
he could trust me with. 'It's the future.'
The future is a big player in Shanghai. From our window seats high above the
Bund, the city's gracious river-front boulevard, we could see the future
across the Huangpu river. It was busy pushing up concrete towers on the
skyline of the enterprise zone of Pudong. A financial district, a
manufacturing centre, a free trade area and a science park were being built,
part of developments that make London's Canary Wharf look like a suburban
estate.
China's rush to embrace market forces is turning Shanghai into a boom town,
full of feverish speculators. The statistics are staggering: more than 1,000
joint ventures, nearly Pounds 7bn investment in infrastructure, 10bn sq ft
of new office space. They say a new company is formed every 11 minutes.
Unlike the rest of China, however, Shanghai has seen it all before. Turning
your gaze from the skyscrapers of Pudong, you can look down on the classical
facades of the Bund, the great banks and trading houses erected in the first
half of this century. They are the monuments of old Shanghai, Asia's first
and greatest commercial giant.
Created by Europeans in the mid-19th century from a fishing village on a mud
bank, Shanghai was a concessionary port where foreign traders could operate
immune to Chinese customs and laws, a situation that continued until the
communist take-over in 1949. By the 1920s, Shanghai was a cosmopolitan city
with a huge expatriate population and a dubious reputation. 'One never asked
why someone came to Shanghai,' Lady Jellicoe warned. 'It was assumed that
everyone had something to hide.'
Old Shanghai was a bit of Europe grown grotesque in the hot-house climate of
the Orient. In a city caught between the South China Sea and 1,000 miles of
rice paddies, you could order a well-cut suit, a French dinner, a new car or
a set of monogrammed golf clubs.
You could attend horse races, baseball games or football matches. You could
gossip in five languages. A suburban colonial life-style offered the
reassuring rituals of afternoon tea and club membership but did little to
gloss over the baser temptations in which the metropolis had come to
specialise.
The missionaries who went hunting Chinese souls declared that if God allowed
Shanghai to survive, then he owed an apology to Sodom and Gomorrah.
Only the pursuit of pleasure rivalled the pursuit of money. Shanghai catered
to every taste. Gambling clubs, dance halls, opium dens, freak shows, music
halls and brothels vied with each other for trade. 'If you want girls, or
boys, you can have them, at all prices,' wrote Christopher Isherwood. 'If
you want opium, you can smoke it in the best company, served on a tray like
afternoon tea.'
Old Shanghai is remarkably intact. The great banks and trading houses, the
old hotels, the palatial villas and the clubs still stand. For the European,
strolling through Shanghai is like rooting through the effects of a great
aunt whose life has long been the scandal of the family.
In the grid of European avenues, l met a money changer. He was a retired
school teacher, a dishevelled, gloomy individual trying to augment his
pension. We went to lunch in what had once been a grand apartment building,
now broken into tenements and adorned with laundry. An old woman ran a lunch
counter in a hallway: three simmering pots and a couple of tables.
All around us was the architecture of half a world away: classical
pediments, fanlights, stained glass, French windows opening on to
wrought-iron balconies now crowded with bird cages and bamboo chairs. Men
shuffled past in bath robes and plastic slippers; from an upper floor, a
marital quarrel echoed down the stair wells.
I asked the money changer what he remembered of the arrival of the
communists. 'It was very quiet, really,' he said. 'Everyone who should have
left had left. A few nights before their arrival, Chiang Kai-shek cordoned
off the Bund and emptied the banks of their bullion. They carried the gold
bars across the road in the glare of headlights and loaded them on to ships
for Taiwan.'
Within weeks the brothels and bars were closed, the street names changed and
rickshaws abolished. The prostitutes were re-educated and sent to work in
factories; the White Russians set sail for Australia; the bankers, traders
and gangsters went to Hong Kong, Singapore or Sao Paolo, and the
international riff-raff went home.
After the public avenues of the European districts, the old Chinese city -
which lies to the south of the Bund - seems an intimate, domestic place. The
inhabitants lunch on their doorsteps and wash their hair at outside taps.
Pastry cooks stand in open windows conjuring dumplings from clouds of steam.
Tiny shops specialise in buttons, umbrellas, block prints, carving knives,
dressing gowns, pet birds and snuff.
Nearby, in Salty Melon Street, vendors hawk bucketfuls of crabs and turtles
and jellyfish. At the centre of the old city are the Yu Yuan gardens, said
to be the inspiration for willow pattern china.
Back in the Bund I found the Shanghai Club, a British establishment once so
exclusive that the doorman was said to have consulted members before
admitting passers-by trying to escape a gunfight in the street. The Long
Bar, once the preserve of taipans, is now patronised by Malay midshipmen,
broad as tree trunks, arguing over their diminutive Chinese girlfriends.
In the billiards room across the hall, nothing seems to have changed in 60
years except the height of the tables. During their occupation, the Japanese
cut down the legs to improve their cue action.
The centrepiece of the Bund is the Peace Hotel, known formerly as the
Cathay. Built in 1929 as the headquarters of the Sassoon empire, it was in
its day one of the finest hotels in the world. Noel Coward wrote Private
Lives there, sitting up in bed in an uncharacteristically hideous dressing
gown, listening to Sophie Tucker records.
Having survived spies, Americans and Madame Mao, the Peace has now regained
its former elegance. Every evening, a septuagenarian but sprightly jazz band
plays a rag-tag collection of tunes. In the restaurant upstairs, the
waitresses are once again wearing the cheongsam, the long, split skirt
banned by the communists.
At night, with the tugs hooting in the Huangpu below, you can gaze along the
floodlit buildings of the Bund, like a vast stage set.
As for the new stage set across the river, you sense that the script is not
written yet. Past and future face each other across the Huangpu, and the
former has much to say to the latter.
Shanghai's first commercial boom was brought to an end with the communist
take-over. With hindsight, the reasons for its demise seem fairly
predictable: rampant corruption, an excess of foreign ownership, and an
inability to include the widest spectrum of people in the benefits of its
boom. On the brink of its second boom, Shanghai would do well to remember
that lesson.

FT  30 APR 94 / Travel: Cold comfort in Iceland - Help is not at hand when
injury strikes on David Nissan's frozen adventure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID NISSAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was about 4am, at the end of the first day of the journey, that my mind
began to dwell on a throw-away remark by my host, Asgier Heidar, that
'Iceland is tough'. We were in a convoy of three off-road vehicles but two
of them, including mine, had gone through the ice at the edge of a frozen
river.
Attempts to tow them out failed because the bank was steep and, as the rear
wheels sank in the water, the snow underneath the vehicles compacted.
Digging caused the wheels to sink further. The temperature was -15'C as we
went to sleep in our seats aware that, if the third vehicle were to get
stuck, we would have to sit tight and wait for the rescue service to find
us.
Crossing Iceland's interior in winter has become popular, at least with
Icelanders. Heidar proposed this journey after we had met on a summer
fishing trip. An enigmatic character, he makes his living entirely from
hunting and related activities.
He lives and breathes the wilderness, spending the late autumn months
roaming snow-covered mountains as a guide or on his own, shooting birds and,
occasionally, reindeer. The winter treks are purely for pleasure. I could
scarcely resist his invitation - nor its implicit challenge.
There are no long journeys in Iceland: it is scarcely 300 miles across at
its widest. But almost no one lives inland where sweeping plains, strewn
with boulders of lava, are bordered by low granite mountains. When all is
covered with deep powder snow and ice, customised four-wheel drives are
needed.
Even then, you need luck with the weather. Two systems compete: the
temperate Gulf Stream and chilling winds from the Arctic. At its best,
winter brings cloudless blue skies and a sun that provides comfort even when
the shade temperature is well below freezing. But a fierce and unbearable
wind can whip up without warning.
We set off from Reykjavik on our own. The plan was to start along the coast
road before seeing the famous geyser and nearby waterfalls at Gullfoss, 40
miles inland. Then we would head for the weather station at Hveravellir,
close to Iceland's heart, meeting the other vehicles en route. Finally, we
would aim to cross the Langjokull glacier before turning north again to fish
for Arctic char through ice holes.
We aimed to be away for three or four nights and sit out any storms in the
wooden shelters that pepper the wilderness. But the road from Gullfoss was
marked on the map as crossable by 4WD vehicles only in summer, and we soon
faced virgin snow. Within minutes, my vehicle's wheels were spinning
helplessly.
After extricating ourselves, we inched towards the highlands. Snow had
buried the moss-covered lava boulders that are the main feature of the
summer landscape, turning the plain into a smooth, white desert and
softening the distant mountains.
There is next to no life: a few ponies and ravens near the coast, then just
occasional tracks from Arctic fox or ptarmigan - a snow-white bird somewhat
like a grouse - spotted by Heidar's sharp eyes. At one point we had to turn
back: the 4ft flags that marked the edge of the road had disappeared under
the snow and we became stuck repeatedly as we sought a new path.
Then we reached the first rendezvous point and stopped on top of a hill in
the dark to await the last of Heidar's friends. As we sat, a lace-like
ribbon of light wove through the sky, then another and a third. The Northern
Lights are still a mystery but at their best, I was told, energy
concentrates in a luminous sphere that explodes, sending colours streaming
in all directions. This night, showers of light cascaded like spirits over
our heads in shades of vivid pink and green.
From here on, we used a satellite navigation system to chart our course in
the darkness. This was how we arrived, mistakenly, on the frozen river
Jokulfall.
The morning brought luck. The third vehicle found a safe route on to the ice
and managed to haul us up. Thereafter, we coasted easily on hard snow,
reaching the weather station by mid-morning. A journey of around 90 miles
had taken 22 hours.
The weather station is built next to a geyser. Near-boiling sulphurous water
runs from open craters and collects in a pool just below the visitors' hut.
A pipe feeds an ice-cold spring into the pool and you pick your spot in it
for the temperature you want.
This climate is most dangerous when you relax. Heidar slipped on the ice
while running back to the hut and fractured his cheek and eye socket in four
places. The emergency services refused to send a helicopter; for that,
injuries need to be life-threatening.
He took the wheel for the drive back to Reykjavik the next day so that he
would have some control over the bumpiness of the ride. Other vehicles laid
tracks ahead to speed our journey. But the doctors who eventually operated
for three hours said his injuries had been worsened by the way he gritted
his teeth all the way back. Very much the Viking, he never once complained.
Yes, Iceland is tough. But for the two hours before Heidar fell, we had been
luxuriating in the hot pool watching the Northern Lights as ice crystals
made crowns in our hair.
Many Reykjavik hotels will arrange winter expeditions taking from six hours
to two days. Asgier Heidar: tel: 354-1-676 350.

FT  30 APR 94 / Travel: The gamble on hospitality - Hotel file
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Choice of hotel is arguably the most important element of a hotel holiday -
even more important, I often think, than choice of country. How can you know
that the hotel you choose will be precisely to your liking: well-located,
peaceful (or lively - requirements vary), comfortable, good value, and run
by people who can spell 'hospitality'?
You cannot. Staying in a hotel you do not know is nearly always a gamble.
Friends can help. Those familiar with your tastes and foibles can be
extremely useful. Ditto travel agents you can trust. Travel is their
business. They junket extensively, gathering up-to-date intelligence - so
make them swear, on the brochure they are waving, that the holiday they want
to sell you is one they would buy themselves if they hadn't enjoyed a
freebie.
Brochures can be tricky. Study them carefully, especially the pictures.
Ignore the puffery and try to imagine yourself staying in that hotel. Think
about its location and facilities, let alone the rate. If the only picture
of it in the brochure shows half a swimming pool or a chef waving a fork,
avoid it. The pictures should reveal as much as possible, especially the
bedrooms.
At Easter, I stayed in the Forte Village, south-east Sardinia, which was
built in 1971. From the four-page spread devoted to it in the Italian
Escapades brochure, you get the impression that the village is huge; that it
is proud of its food; that it caters especially to those interested in
sports and fitness; and that it is ideal for children.
All quite true. It is huge - 55 acres, three hotels, 438 bungalows, numerous
restaurants, extensive sports facilities (including 17 tennis courts) and a
health and beauty centre, the Terme del Parco. The food was good. The
village is ideal for children, although an expert on the subject told me she
was unimpressed with the facilities for very young ones; and the Hotel
Castello, in which I stayed, is well managed.
But the village wasn't me. I found it dull (it had just opened for the
season, so was barely into its stride); isolated (but not if I had had a
hire car - I forgot my licence); and far too big and rambly for its own
good. Nor is it really serious about its sport. If you want sport, go to
Club Med, or to a genuine sports ranch. At times, Forte Village hosts big
corporate conferences, so you would have to trust to luck that you were not
suddenly surrounded by jabbering conference-goers.
Nor is the village cheap. Italian Escapades says that its holidays at Forte
Village start from Pounds 649 per person per week (September 1994 price) for
a twin-bedded bungalow, breakfast, dinner, return direct flight to Cagliari,
and transfers between airport and village. Sports facilities are included
(not watersports, golf or horse riding, which are available at extra cost),
while entry to the health centre costs about Pounds 38 a day. The company
adds that the price for staying in the village's Hotel Pineta or Hotel
Castello starts at Pounds 698 per person per week.
Those prices are attractive. But you need to study the brochure to see that
they relate to two short periods: May 20 to June 3, and September 24 to
October 7. In between, prices lurch far higher.
In the peak period, July 23-August 19, a twin-bedded room with sea view in
the Hotel Castello costs Pounds 181 per person per night, plus flight
(charter: Pounds 199 return) and transfer from the airport (Pounds 40 return
a head). Pretty steamy. At Easter, England football star Paul Gascoigne
holidayed at Forte Village, which probably says it all.
On the other hand, the Italian Escapades brochure is a mightily useful
document: 168 pages covering a wide range of hotels. From studying it -
especially the pictures, and the clues they offer about locations and
bedrooms - I am 96 1/2 per cent confident that I would be more than happy in
quite a few of them. In each case, Italian Escapades quotes chartered and
scheduled air fares as separate items. You can book accommodation only. You
can also fly to one airport and return from another.
Italian Escapades: 227 Shepherds Bush Road, London W6 7AS. Tel:081-748-999.
Forte Hotels: 0345-404-040.
A famously agreeable hotel is Reid's Hotel, Madeira. It has almost
everything: cliff-top location just outside Funchal, excellent food, good
staff and marvellous gardens. Among other events, Reid's is organising its
first opera festival this year on July 26-27. Cost: Pounds 687 a person
including seven nights in the hotel, a reception, and two operas and
barbecues. Flights are extra. UK reservations: 0256-841 155.
In the same ownership as Reid's are two first-rate English country house
hotels: Charingworth Manor, near Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, and
Bishopstrow House, Warminster, Wiltshire. They are chips off the Reid block.
There is a type of English country house hotel - ultra-luxurious,
ultra-expensive - that specialises in frigidity: so posh and conceited that
guests feel obliged to whisper and tiptoe and dare not blow their noses, not
even in the shrubbery.
Charingworth Manor and Bishopstrow House are not like that. I found both
extremely comfortable, enjoyed the food greatly, and was impressed by their
facilities (each, for example, has a fine indoor swimming pool).
Above all, thanks to invisible but skilled management, I found the hotels
struck a perfect balance between quality of setting and lack of pomposity.
At one of them, a waiter had a screaming fit at breakfast time - something
to do with a sausage, or possibly several sausages - which added to the fun.
At Charingworth Manor, room rates per night for two, for dinner plus B &amp; B,
are Pounds 148-Pounds 207 on weekdays and Pounds 164-Pounds 235 at weekends
(suites extra). Tel: 038-678 555. Bishopstrow House: Pounds 81-Pounds 114
per person per night, dinner plus B &amp; B (suites extra). Tel. 0985-212 312.

FT  30 APR 94 / Motoring: Audi breaks the mould - The A8's conservative
styling disguises its many technological treats. Stuart Marshall takes it
for a drive on the autobahn and finds it quiet and nimble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Audi's new 4.2-litre V8 engined A8 luxury car breaks a number of moulds. Its
structure is entirely of light alloy, not the usual pressed steel. It is
neither front nor rear-wheel driven but a quattro - the 300 horsepower
4.2-litre V8 engine drives all four wheels.
The transmission is Tiptronic, like that fitted to the Porsche 911 Carrera I
enthused about two weeks ago. A driver may treat it as fully automatic or
use it as a four-speed manual gearbox on which clutchless changes are made
instantly, under full power if desired.
As if that were not enough, the A8 also has a traction control system.
Should the combination of an insensitive right foot and a low grip road
surface provoke any of the four driven wheels into losing grip - say when
restarting on an icy hill - electronic differential locking stifles
wheelspin. The side windows are double glazed; but there is nothing trendy
or new fangled about the interior. A typical Jaguar or, for that matter,
Bentley owner would feel perfectly at home, cosseted by the soft leather
seats and plentiful wood veneer.
From the outside, the A8 driver has little idea what a high-technological
treat is in store. There is nothing wrong with the A8's styling, though
there is nothing exceptional about it, either. I detected a lot of Audi 100
and overtones of Lexus LS400 - the car, incidentally, that Audi's
development engineers used as their benchmark for silence and refinement.
(Yes, I know the Lexus is Japanese but it was designed to look uncannily
like the result of a coupling between the last Mercedes S-Class and the
still current - but only just - BMW 7-Series).
When driving the A8 in Germany last week it was the silence that impressed
me first. Turn the key, and the only clue that the V8 engine is running is a
slight movement of the rev counter needle.
With the Tiptronic selector in automatic, I headed out of Stuttgart on a
mercifully uncrowded autobahn. Slight pressure on the accelerator and the A8
surged forward, the transmission shifting almost imperceptibly until moving
into top at around 70mph / 112kph. (Audi's claimed 0-62mph / 0-100kph in 7.3
seconds should be obtainable on wet or dry roads.) The rustle of wind around
the door mirrors at 100 mph / 161kph became more noticeable at 125mph /
201kph but only because engine and road-induced tyre noise was minimal. Top
speed is a governed 155mph / 250kph.
The all-aluminium alloy construction saves weight; the A8 is about 200kg
lighter than it would have been if made of steel. Clearly, this helps fuel
consumption. A British driver who stays within sight of motorway speed
limits and does not spend too much time in city centres or on very short
journeys should see around 21-22mpg (13.45-12.84 l / 100km).
It has to be said that most big cars feel fine on an autobahn. But the A8,
in spite of its size, was exceptionally nimble on country roads. It handled
more like a small and sporting car than a full five-seat luxury saloon with
a huge boot. One of the benefits of quattro transmission, which spreads
engine power among all four wheels, is that a car's balance is unaffected by
hard acceleration.
Heavy snow had fallen a few days earlier and was still heaped up by the side
of the schwarzswaldhochstrasse but, alas, the surface was mainly dry. It
would have been interesting to assess the A8's security in arctic
conditions. I doubt that any high-performance luxury saloon with only
two-wheel drive could match its driving security.
When the A8 V8 reaches Britain in September, it is likely to cost about
Pounds 46,000. But a 2.8-litre V6 version with front-wheel drive and a
choice of five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission will be
much cheaper. At about Pounds 34,000 it will be an ultra-roomy Jaguar
alternative, still extraordinarily quiet if not quite as sibilant as the
double-glazed V8.
An electronically controlled differential prevents unruliness by curbing
wheelspin if one front tyre is on a high grip surface, the other on lower
grip, when the driver accelerates. It is not quite so fast as the 4.2-litre
 -the maximum is 140mph / 225kph, a matter of academic interest to most of
us - and the automatic is three seconds slower from 0-62mph / 100kph than
the Tiptronic V8.
The manual gearbox 2.8-litre A8 I drove would be an improbable choice for
British business motorists, most of whom sensibly prefer automatics.
(Second-hand luxury cars with manual transmission are very hard to sell in
Britain). Its V6 engine was silky at high speeds, still smooth in top at low
revolutions. Although its 178 horsepower output might seem on the low side
for so big a car, the A8's relatively low weight compensates.
Although all Audi dealers in the UK can handle the A8, most of the 400 to
500 cars Audi expects to sell in a full year will be bought from 60
dealerships in metropolitan areas.
Although aluminium space-frame construction demands different repair
techniques, Audi says any of its approved bodyshops should be able to handle
90 per cent of accident damaged cars. Only those with severe structural
damage will have to go to one of three A8 specialist sites.

FT  30 APR 94 / Sport: Expensive horses for the big courses - Eventing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ginny Elliot (formerly Leng) was pessimistic about Badminton even before
minor injuries to her two entries, Welton Houdini and Romance, forced her to
pull out of next weekend's competition. Since the withdrawal of her sponsor,
Citibank, Elliot's chances of a fourth Badminton win were already tinged
with financial worries.
'I'm very close to having to sell one of my top horses,' she said. She has
always managed to avoid this crisis, but other top riders such as Mark Todd
and Ian Stark have already found it the only way to meet their competition
overheads.
Mary Thomson, winner of the 1992 Badminton horse trials on King William, is
another international eventer with money worries. Gill Robinson, her
personal patron is pulling out for business reasons. One of Thomson's seven
eventers, probably King Basil, may soon be on the market. 'There are very
few riders this season with major sponsors,' said Thomson. 'A couple of
years ago companies were willing to underwrite a string of horses.'
Recession, said Thomson, made them withdraw. However, since it may take four
or five years to bring on a top horse, the competitors are committed to the
quality animals they took on in better times.
Vicki Latta, the New Zealand lawyer who uses her legal work to fund herself
as an amateur at the top of the European tree, has also reached the end of
the financial road.
'Most of my assets, except the horses, have been sold,' said Latta. Her
magnificent gelding, Chief, won a record Pounds 13,000 in eventing prize
money during the 1992 season, which probably just about paid his running
costs. In contrast, the renowned showjumper Milton has several times won
more than Pounds 250,000 in a season.
Sentiment is not the principal barrier to a rider selling a top horse. Cross
country courses are dangerous places. Deaths (human and equine) at the big
fences have increased. Horse and rider need years to build the mutual
confidence needed to tackle tracks such as Burleigh and Badminton. One can
sell the horse but not that relationship. Hence the small market in
outstanding eventers. When they are sold for serious money it is usually to
countries such as Italy and Spain, where prestige is a considerable factor
in any purchase.
Yet horse trials have never been more popular with both competitors and the
public. A British stately home is hardly worth the label these days without
a three-day-event in the park. Upwards of 250,000 spectators are expected
for the four days of Badminton.
While the bulk of the audience will line the 4.25 miles and 29 fences of
Saturday's cross-country course, dressage is proving increasingly popular
and attracting large, enthusiastic crowds on Thursday and Friday. Although
the total prize fund of Pounds 20,000, put up by Mitsubishi, sponsors of
Badminton, is the biggest in the sport, it seems tiny in relation to the
size of the event and the cost of participation.
'People are more turned on by sport when there is really big prize money
involved,' said Elliot. 'It creates hype and media interest, which in turn
pulls in the backers we need to keep going.'
At one-day events, the grass roots of the sport, stars such as Thomson and
Elliot win their personal spurs and train their novice horses. Entry lists
which used to be a dozen or so are closer to a hundred. But much of the
commercial infrastructure remains in the past.
'I went to an event in Buckinghamshire last week,' said Thomson.
'I paid two entry fees of Pounds 27 and Pounds 5 and then won quite a big
section with a prize of Pounds 32.'
If Thomson had not had her massive horsebox sponsored, then just the trip to
the competition would have left her hugely out of pocket. These are not
isolated problems suffered by a few stars. In the bars and stable yards at
Badminton, this will be the main topic of conversation among the
competitors.
The final stage of any three-day event is the showjumping section. In
private, few event-riders have much time for the Hollywood world of indoor
jumping, yet financially it goes from strength to strength, bolstered by
interest in continental Europe. It may be that with its background of
cavalry training and foxhunting, the world of horse trials is too
idiosyncratic to fit into the modern corporate milieu.

FT  30 APR 94 / Sport: County boundaries - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a time when county meant as much as country to young cricketers.
Even such a patrician figure as the fourth Lord Harris, born to lead Oxford
University, Kent, England and MCC with equal ease, was always a formidable
Kentishman.
Besides financing the county's cricket for half a century, he played his
first game for them in 1875, when he was still at school, and his last
against All India in 1911, when he was 60, the oldest man who has ever
played first class cricket in England. He was captain of Kent from 1875-89
and chairman for 45 years, 1886-1931.
Those were the days of colossi in cricket. These are the days of committees
and I do not know whether I was surprised to hear so many officials assuring
me that their counties thought of themselves not just as teams full of team
spirit but also as counties full of county spirit.
Middlesex, which no longer exists as a county in public life and which had
always seemed to me in cricket life as no more than Greater London north of
the Thames, insisted that all their members had a strong sense of county
identity. Even John Emburey, born in Peckham, south of the river, has long
since naturalised as a cricketer north of it.
Middlesex's secretary, John Hardstaff, was sure that much of this feeling
came from their rivalry with Surrey. The squad does have a fair number of
players who come from Middlesex, including captain Mike Gatting,
vice-captain John Carr, Keith Brown, Phil Tufnell, Mark Feltham and Mark
Ramprakash. But outsiders too, such as West Indian bowler Neil Williams,
often stay a long time. With a cricket market-place trading keenly in
players, that is no mean achievement.
'We look after our players,' Hardstaff explained comfortably. Of the county
spokesmen I talked to, he was the only one who spoke honestly about the
problems of re-adjustment for county players returning from Test matches.
Everyone else was too positive to be true, only mentioning the chance that
Test calls give young and second XI players to play in top class games.
Hardstaff sighed with sympathy for Tufnell, Ramprakash and Angus Fraser,
just back from Test service in the West Indies. 'I don't know how they
motivate themselves when they get back. I often wonder how they do it.
Imagine playing in the heat and sun, photographed all the time, and then
coming back to a damp day at Uxbridge . . .'
Fame, glamour, travel, media and money combine to emphasise personal rather
than team achievement and attract players beyond the quiet limits of county
cricket. Alan Ealham, Kent's director of youth coaching, lamented the way
this had changed in the last 15 years or so. Lord Harris would have been
proud of his devotion to his county.
'As a kid I had always wanted to play for Kent. I never thought of playing
for England. Kent was the height of my ambition.'
Kent is a county with a rich sense of tradition and of a history studded
with grand old men, from Harris to Colin Cowdrey. Ealham described Cowdrey
as 'a father figure in the golden days of the 1970s. We all played round
him'.
Ealham was made captain of Kent in 1978 and, though summarily, and some
would say unfairly, removed from the job two years later, he has remained a
stalwart of Kent cricket. His son Mark is a county batsman and bowler.
Ealham enjoys his coaching job. He is pleased that a lot of Kent's squad is
home-grown, encouraging its programme of teaching and recruitment to 'keep
re-vamping and keep going'.
Yorkshire cricketers have spent the winter in schools, talking about
cricket, but they need more money to do it in a big way, director of cricket
Steve Oldham told me with an air of exhaustion.
Still, more counties are trying to 'fly the flag' more widely, to interest
people in the game. Lancashire are famous for their scouting and league
system and they organise training and festivals for all age groups from
under 13 upwards. 'We get our hands on our boys early,' I was told.
Lancashire's problem lies more in hanging on to talent than producing it in
the first place. The county is not alone. How can a county make itself
attractive in the long term? Everyone I spoke to was convinced that success
breeds success. If you win, people support you, rather than the other way
round.
Glamorgan can afford to laugh a bit at that, following a rise last year
above the mire of habitual failure: from 14th to third in the county
championship; winners of Sundays' AXA Equity and Law League; semi-finalists
in the NatWest Trophy, with passionate support in all events.
Leicestershire, in a grim patch at present, want to do something similar and
have followed Glamorgan's lead in reducing their membership fee, (down to
Pounds 15 at Glamorgan, Pounds 20 at Leicester), thereby sharply increasing
the number of members.
They are an odd lot in Leicestershire. Captain Nigel Briers is pretty well
the only team member from Leicestershire. Last year's overseas player,
Winston Benjamin, was thought to be playing only half-heartedly, like most
of the team. He has been replaced by Phil Simmons.
Tony Norman was appointed chief executive. Norman is a businessman, not a
cricketer, and believes that Leicestershire must build county spirit by
cashing in on Leicester's recent rugby success. Leicestershire staff I asked
about this enjoyed being iconoclastic. 'We haven't got any county spirit.
We're a collection of individuals. Always have been.'
'What about the idea of joining up with the rugby and football clubs to make
Leicester seem successful?'
'Yes. They're keen on that. They've organised a few quizes and games. But
not cricket games.'
'Is there much local rivalry with Northamptonshire?'
'A little bit. Not much. Not worth it.'
'What's the secret of being a successful county?'
'Winning.'
Leicestershire need to find a new, stable system of management, as do
several other counties, such as Yorkshire. The main thing to remember is
that the only point of county cricket management is to enable players to do
their best for a county they consider their home.

FT  30 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: It's the cask that counts

For the lucky few who penetrate the headquarters of Norway's hypersensitive
drinks' monopoly in Oslo, there is the chance to meet Halvor Heuch, the
ebullient production manager.
Heuch's job is to make excellent cask-aged aquavits. In his spare time he
conducts experiments with oak. One he showed me demonstrated how much
influence a second-hand cask can have over the spirit which takes it over.
He had aged two samples of plain ethyl alcohol, one in an old Limousin
cognac barrel and the other in an old Jerez brandy cask. In the former, the
spirit had picked up a light cognac character; in the Jeresano the alcohol
had developed a big, fruity, brandy taste which was all the more remarkable
given that the brewage has never been anywhere near a grape.
Across the North Sea, in Scotland, there is a similar interest in the
properties of casks. Modern whisky relies entirely on second-hand barrels:
chiefly old bourbon whisky casks and reused bourbon staves from the US, plus
a small amount of sherry oak from Spain. In the case of bourbon oak, quality
has declined over the past few years causing alarm in the whisky business;
in Jerez the sherry producers have modernised production and have less need
of the sort of casks sought by whisky makers.
On a visit to a cooperage in Kentucky I was astonished to see that reeds are
no longer used to bind the casks. The leakiness which I saw in local
distilleries must have been a direct result. The reeds have been eliminated
in the interests of cost-cutting; but that is a minor drawback when it comes
to the modern bourbon cask.
George Espie, of Scotland's Clyde Cooperage, says the casks he is getting
today are often made from wood which has been kiln-dried rather than
seasoned, or dried in the open air for a minimum of two years. American
coopers are also cutting fast-growing oaks rather than the slower sorts
preferred by distillers.
Instead of automatically accepting the consignments which come from America,
Scottish distillers are now examining other possibilities. At Glenmorangie
distillery, on the Dornoch Firth, they have been selecting casks at the
Kentucky cooperages and monitoring their development in bourbon warehouses.
They have also experimented with ageing bourbon in Scotland. For George
Espie the solution may be more drastic. He is interested in cutting out the
bourbon stage altogether and ageing whisky in new American white oak casks.
This would be a departure from post-war tradition, but Espie reminded me
that before the war there was no bourbon wood and, apart from the
second-hand sherry, port and wine casks so eagerly recycled by the thrifty
Scots, the industry used English oak casks which were raised in Scotland.
Since the war the coopering business in these islands has dwindled to little
more than rebuilding and repairing; so we can no longer hope for whiskies
with hearts of English oak.
Nor is it true that European oak - the oak used in old-fashioned sherry
casks - is unsuitable for whisky. The problem, says Espie, is porosity:
French coopers cleave and do not saw. They are also expensive. The sweet and
fruity taste of a typical Speyside whisky comes partly from old sherry
casks. At the Macallan distillery Frank Newlands has the difficult job of
selecting the casks for this 100 per cent sherry oak whisky. First Spanish
oak barrels must be bought and offered to smaller growers in the Jerez
region.
These casks must be used for one or two fermentations before ageing dry
oloroso sherry.
Now that the larger sherry houses have ceased to ferment their wine in oak
it has become harder and harder to ensure an adequate supply of these casks.
Espie reckons that every Spanish oak cask made in the past 10 years was paid
for by the Scotch whisky business.
Different houses have different solutions on how to maintain the right oak
treatment for whisky without paying the earth. United Distillers has
conducted successful experiments by treating American oak casks with
specially imported sherry-style wines: Pajarete and Montilla. Lang's, in
Glasgow, is the producer of Lang's Supreme blended whisky and Glengoyne, an
elegant and slightly sweet malt from the southern Highlands.
The company was able to show me a range of experiments with sherry casks
which would have struck an instant chord with those conducted by Halvor
Heuch in Oslo.
The experiments are designed to see to what extent Spanish-coopered American
oak casks can be used to replace the almost-extinct Spanish oak casks in
whisky maturation. The oldest whiskies treated this way are now seven years
old. Some had been housed in casks in which sherry had been fermented,
others simply in casks which had aged dry or sweet oloroso.
The whisky for the American casks was far paler and more buttery. From a
cask where no wine had fermented the whisky had a really toasty 'chardonnay
malt' character.
The Spanish oak whiskies were dark and markedly fruity. The wood seemed to
affect the whiskies far more than the fact that the cask had contained a
little sweet wine as well as dry oloroso.
American oak simply did not have the same effect. It is not a conclusion
that can bring much comfort to malt whisky producers who rely on the rich,
fruity flavours derived from Spanish sherry casks.
