FT  30 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Bargains for under Pounds 3 a bottle - Jancis
Robinson finds some pleasant surprises among a new crop of wines for
skinflints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON

<TEXT>
The difference in quality between the world's cheapest and most expensive
wines is narrowing as the wine world shrinks and winemaking techniques and
technology are no longer geographically segregated.
It is still impossible to find truly exciting wine for under Pounds 3 a
bottle, but relatively easy to find a bargain, particularly in today's
cut-throat high street wine market - and especially at this time of year
when last year's crop is tasting freshest. Independents cannot beat the
supermarkets and chains for snips such as these light, but fault-free wines.
Wines marked WF are available only in selected stores during Safeway's
five-week wine fair from Monday.
Readers close to a branch of Kwiksave supermarkets should also try to
benefit from the chain's conversion to wine quality.
APERITIF: Waitrose Pale Dry Montilla. Pounds 2.99. Beautifully labelled,
ludicrously-underpriced, soft, fresh, relation to Fino sherry.
DRY WHITES: Magyar Vineyards. 1993. Pounds 2.19. WF. All the fire of
Hungary's own grape varieties, stoked by the flying winemaking skills of the
Hugh Ryman brigade.
Vin de Pays du Jardin de la France 1993. Pounds 2.39. WF. Particularly
successful bottling of Loire Chenin Blanc given pizzazz by skin contact and
malolactic fermentation, bottled by an enterprising Muscadet merchant.
Vino de la Tierra Blanco. Pounds 2.59. Sainsbury's. Scented, lively Spanish
riposte to Vin de Pays made by Australian Peter Bright.
Sicilian Bianco. Pounds 2.69. Asda. Apple-fresh, (July-picked?)
quintessentially party wine from the well-equipped winery which used to
provide Seagram's Tonino brand.
Sainsbury's Argentine Torrontes. Pounds 2.85. Reduced from Pounds 3.49,
because the name, and possibly style, of this perfumed yet racy grape
variety is so unfamiliar.
Van Riebeeck Cape Dry White. 1993. Pounds 2.99. Waitrose. One feels this
should be a 1994 Nouveau in honour of the birth of the new South Africa, but
this blend is full-bodied, creditable, with a slightly hot finish.
Country Cellars Tuscan Dry White. 1993. Pounds 2.99. WF. Fizzy but much
fruitier than Trebbianos made by Italians rather than an antipodean like Kym
Milne.
Bulgarian Chardonnay. Pounds 2.99. Sainsbury's. Kym Milne again, fashioning
a thoroughly modern, crisp, if reasonably insubstantial wine for those who
must have Chardonnay.
Bordeaux Sauvignon. 1993. Pounds 2.99. Waitrose. Powerful, spritzy, not
aggressively aromatic. Good value from Calvet.
REDS: Valhondo. 1993. Pounds 1.99. Safeway. Lively, peppery, insubstantial
but impressively scented. Could easily be chilled. The white version is also
worthwhile, especially at this price.
Hungarian Cabernet Sauvignon. 1993. Pounds 2.69. Ripe, soft,
red-that-happens-to-be-called Cabernet.
Vino de la Tierra Tinto. Pounds 2.75. Sainsbury's. Lively, chewy, light,
chillable red version of the Blanco above.
Domaine de Beaufort Minervois. 1992. Pounds 2.99. Tesco. A year-old French
appellation controlee wine for under Pounds 3? Not one of the country's
greatest glories, but a respectable claret-like red.
Uvas del Sol Argentinian (sic) Red. Pounds 2.99. Tesco. Another Argentine
bargain, reduced to sell. Big, full-blown wine from an obviously hot
climate.
Asda Leon. 1986. Pounds 2.99. Ridiculous price for a mature wine aged in
small oak barrels. Spicy, full bodied and long. Not for the faint hearted.
SWEET WHITE: Glenloth Late Harvest Muscat. 1992. Pounds 2.99. Oddbins.
Unashamed of its heady sweetness, this Australian cries out to be chilled.
                          *      *      *
A High Court ruling last week signals a new and more secure era for fine
wine collectors. An action group of customers of the defunct wine merchant
Ellis, Son &amp; Vidler has managed to wrest its fine wine reserves from the
receivers, even though, contrary to the demands of a previous ruling
concerning the London Wine Company, individual cases of wine were not marked
with their owner's name. The key, according to solicitors acting on behalf
of the wine buyers, was that customers' reserves were stored (physically)
separately from the trading stock, and the reserves, and owner, were
correctly identified in the merchant's records. Oxbridge colleges were among
the more significant immediate beneficiaries of this ruling, affecting about
1,200 cases of fine wine, but I can think of hundreds of wine enthusiasts
who should sleep a little easier now.
                          *      *      *
Oddbins is offering some extremely fine burgundies from the lauded 1992
vintage for whites and the underrated 1991 reds. It is a sign of the times
that the likes of Louis Carillon, of Puligny-Montrachet, Domaine de l'Arlot,
of Nuits-St-Georges and Jean-Marc Boillot, of Pommard, are keen to sell to a
British high street chain (the first two also sell to the Thresher group).
Stars at a recent tasting included two Albert Morey 1992 premier cru
Chassagnes at Pounds 15.99 and Pounds 17.99; the entire 1992 Carillon range
at Pounds 14.99 to Pounds 19.99; Domaine de l'Arlot Nuits-St Georges 1991 at
Pounds 11.99; and Boillot's premier cru Volnay Carelle at Pounds 19.99 from
the great 1990 vintage.
                          *      *      *
At about the same time as Britain's wine merchants were reading spoof
information in the wine trade weekly about my latest book, the Dow's Port
Scratch 'n' Sniff Tasting Book (its best joke was to describe me as 'one of
the most respected names in the Port Wine Trade'), I was being taken in by
another April fool: Farr Vintners' offer of an entirely mythical white wine
made at Ch Latour, mentioned in last Weekend's FT. How could I be so
gullible?
My feeble defence is that just such a scheme was apparently given serious
consideration during the administrative reign of Allied's man, David Orr.
Since the British brewer sold this Bordeaux first-growth back into French
hands, Orr has moved on to Ch Rausan-Segla, originally considered finest of
the second-growths and recently acquired by independent couture house
Chanel, which was beaten to Latour only at the last minute by Francois
Pinault, owner of Printemps stores and much else.

FT  30 APR 94 / Fashion: Are you going to look pure and wicked? - You can
choose any colour this summer, so long as it's white
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
White is the universal symbol of purity, hope, new beginnings and, in some
cultures, denotes the spirituality of mourning. In spite of its innocent
appeal, white is wickedly difficult to wear, much harder, for example, than
black. Just a touch of it adds charm or drama - the collar of a white shirt,
for example, or Chanel's white camellia on a black velvet bow.
One of this summer's main colours is white, the most pure and extreme result
of fashion's swing from over-ornate power dressing and heavy black layers.
Shops are already awash with white clothes so we are going to have to make
the best of it.
Let us start with the bad points. White is a killer for any but the most
positive or tanned complexions, draining the face of life. This is fine for
wan catwalk waifs: not so good if you want to look normal.
White summer fabrics inevitably look flimsy, even unintentionally
transparent. The corollary of this is that, unless carefully styled, white
can look cheap - and white high-heeled shoes cheaper than anything, in spite
of Karl Lagerfeld's efforts to promote them. And, most important of all,
white is impractical because it is always in the laundry.
But white has good points which make it irresistible for summer, especially
in the airily-layered forms of fashion. The spirit which inspired pale
colonial linens and still, to some extent, governs sports clothes, makes
white the obvious choice on mirage-shimmering, bee-humming summer days.
It seemed natural in our photographic location, the South African vineyard
of Klein Constantia at harvest-time, where it complemented the white Cape
Dutch buildings and contrasted with the lush, dark green trees and vines.
But try to think further than the now-hackneyed long, white colonial dress.
Issey Miyake said it all when he put on the catwalk a bunch of
gently-whirling dancers, showing to best advantage the lightest of crushed
silk layers in loose, simple shapes.
The trick is to create the illusion of light passing through gauzy fabric
without attracting the ghastly description 'see-through'.
You do this by building layers of extremely fine material. Two layers of
even the flimsiest chiffon are a lot more opaque than one. The top layer -
be it a linen gauze shirt or a cobwebby knit - is left loose enough to play
the trick of the light but you need to build on an unobtrusive base.
Nothing cheapens white so much as the cut line of a bra or slip. Instead,
choose a plain, flat-strapped crop-top (white or flesh-coloured, by Jockey
or Knickerbox) or a plain sports bra - Berlei does one that looks like a
crop-top with built-in cups, which has matching high-cut briefs in white or
flesh. This shows through like a singlet rather than underwear.
Alternatively, Marks and Spencer's new Body Shapers range of flat-strapped
bras and briefs has four skin tones and is well-nigh invisible, as is
Gossard's Glossies bra.
Fabric is another area in which Miyake shows the way. Avoid tailored white.
Choose fabrics that go from washing to wearing in one easy movement. This
summer's crinkled finishes, inspired by Miyake's geometrically crushed silk
and man-made Pleats Please range are ideal for packing and ease of care.
Weighty, drapy viscose also hangs out well, especially as knit.
These fabrics are also soft enough to flow around the body, counteracting
white's weight-adding properties. And to beat its complexion-deadening
ability, choose its kinder sister, ivory. Either looks good with a light tan
and minimal make-up. Paler faces need colouring carefully to add life but
not overwhelm the fragility of near-white clothes.
Dior's Couleurs du Temps range gets it right with its Desert Landscape
five-colour palette of warm, earth-toned eyeshadows or the pearly rose,
slate and honey shades of Sands and Sandstone. These are warmed with a
slightly pink-toned blusher, Rose Atlas, and a pearly natural pink (Desert
Pearls) or pale pink-beige (Gobi Moon) lipstick. Nina Ricci Les Orchidees
two-tone blusher has a slightly tanned, sunkissed tone that ties in with
their Les Sepias number 13 lipstick.
The same subtlety should be applied to accessories. New white style needs
minimal jewellery, perhaps just a smidgeon of silver, though tiny pieces in
matt gold go better with warmer ivory. Metallic shoes give a lift to
all-over white, provided they are plain, flat sandals. Otherwise, choose
cream or beige suede or fabric shoes, or tan sandals for an informal look.
White had a bad name in the 1980s for being the natural partner to a
mahogany tan, bright red lips and jangly gilt jewellery. Think of a style
that is the diametric opposite and you will find white is also right for the
1990s.

FT  30 APR 94 / How to Spend it: Silver master goes public - Gerald Benney
is opening a shop to sell his exquisite wares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gerald Benney is one of the grand old men (if he will forgive the 'old') of
British silversmithing. With Robert Welch and David Mellor, he was part of a
particularly talented triumvirate that trained at the Royal College of Art
in the 1950s and that breathed life and interest into modern silverware when
British design was struggling to find an identity.
Benney has always been known as an innovative silversmith. Peta Levi, the
design consultant, points to his 'technique of texturing silver as well as
his painstaking development of a method of producing translucent enamels'.
She feels sure that Benney's work, 'rooted in 1950s style will stand the
test of time for its simplicity and sheer elegance'. Fiona McCarthy in her
book on British Design since 1880 places him in the tradition of
idiosyncratic British designers with a 'lavishness that often verges on the
jokey'.
Some of his early work, as befits a young designer, did indeed display an
exuberant delight in new techniques that was not always happily integrated
into the total design. But his later work is often of great refinement and
almost exquisite simplicity.
Almost all his work has been done to special commission so that these days
his grand ceremonial pieces, his silver goblets and cutlery, his vases and
candlesticks, reside in grand City offices, in privileged private homes and
in museums. The Goldsmiths Company has a large collection of his work as
does the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum.
Though many of his smaller pieces are eminently suited to a domestic setting
(look at the simplicity of the silver goblets, the desirability of the
exquisitely plain salt and pepper pots) too few people seem to think of
commissioning a work from as skilled and talented an artist as this.
Possibly they are daunted by the unfamiliarity of the process, by the
challenge of putting together a coherent brief and by fear of the cost. For
all these reasons Benney has decided to open a shop where ranges of more
accessible pieces, which people can look at, pick up, touch and feel, will
be available.
This venture will be largely overseen by his younger son Simon, who has in
turn become a silversmith (having won first prize at the Gemological
Institute of America in Santa Monica for his pieces) with a special interest
in jewellery. So there in the shop, from May 9 onwards, will be a collection
of sycamore and silver pieces (trays, coasters, wine-coolers), some
classically simple polished silver pieces (tea-sets, coffee-sets, trays and
goblets) and a collection of cuff-links, thimbles, ear-rings and other
jewellery.
A silver thimble will be Pounds 52, textured sterling silver cuff links
Pounds 100, gold ear-rings Pounds 168. Prices for the silver and sycamore
range will start at Pounds 460 for a wine coaster and go up to Pounds 870
for a champagne bucket. The collection of simple domestic pieces is
particularly desirable. Many of these pieces would make splendid wedding,
christening or anniversary presents. All are made in the Benney workshops,
none are mass-produced.
Anybody wanting a special piece, however, will still be able to order one.
Above the shop in Walton Street will be a special commissions room where
projects can be discussed. And above that will be a working design studio
where many of the pieces will be designed.
Benney opens on May 9 at 73 Walton Street, Knightsbridge, London SW3.
Anybody unfamiliar with the Benney range and wanting some idea of its scope
can telephone 071-589-7002 and ask for the well-illustrated booklets on the
silver and / or the jewellery collections.

FT  30 APR 94 / How to Spend it: Bags of fashion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What does it take for a handbag to move from the mundane world of the merely
useful to cult status? What is the mysterious ingredient that makes one bag
internationally desired while its near relation, which seems identical,
languishes on the arms of the unfashionable? We know that quality comes into
it, but so, too, does clever design.
But above all, there is a mysterious ingredient that nobody can explain,
that drives otherwise sane women to plunge into debt merely for a few scraps
of fashionable leather.
Cult handbags can come at all prices - from the Kelly bag (Pounds 1,850 for
small calf and three months waiting - after that as prices rise so does the
length of the waiting list) to the Herve Chapelier at under Pounds 50. They
can be French (Chanel, Hermes, Louis Vuitton); they can be true Brit (Bill
Amberg, Anya Hindmarch), they can be Italian (Gucci, Prada, Bottega Veneta)
or transatlantic (Judith Leiber).
Some cult handbags retain their status for many years - others move in and
out of fashion as tastes change. Here, for the summer, are just a few of the
most fashionable handbags around.
                       *      *      *
Do not worry if you do not yet own a Bottega Veneta handbag. Until recently
it has been very difficult to do so in the UK. A small, family-owned company
based in the Veneto, Bottega Veneta has some of the most delicious small
handbags around. Fashionable women who travel have been seeking them out in
Italy, France or America but it was not until last October that Harvey
Nichols of Knightsbridge began to stock a few in their ground floor handbag
department - so successful has it been that last week a big new concession
entirely given over to Bottega Veneta was opened.
The handbags' chief hallmarks are exquisitely fine leather, often woven (the
pillow bag is its all-time best-seller and a small version costs Pounds 255,
the large one Pounds 375), the almost obsessive lack of gilt, and delicious
touches such as beautifully braided handles and tassle-pulls. The evening
bags are especially desirable but for those who, like me, are congenitally
unable to organise their life without something as large as a carrier bag to
rummage in, there is the famous drawstring bucket at Pounds 525 which should
do nicely.
The black woven leather handbag photographed here is typical of the Bottega
Veneta look - coming in later in the summer it will sell for about Pounds
500.
For summer there is a hemp (hemp, you will have gathered, is about as smart
a colour as you can get this summer) version of the pillow bag that will
sell for Pounds 150.
                       *      *      *
Herve Chapelier is the big name among the young and hip. It has much of the
cachet of Prada and costs a fraction of the price. As a young colleague put
it: 'After all, what is Prada at the end of the day but a bit of nylon?'
Herve Chapelier, too, is just a bit of nylon but a very fashionable and a
very practical bit of nylon. The bags first became a vogue in France when
Herve Chapelier started importing a line of duffel bags from Los Angeles.
These were very successful but it is the tote bag collection (photographed
here) that really took Herve Chapelier to cult status - every hip young
French student needed them in every size, for school, for carrying togs to
the gym, bikinis to the beach, notebooks to work. Carried by people such as
Kylie Minogue, Ronit Zilkha (the dress designer), Edina in Absolutely
Fabulous, Zoe Wanamaker and Alain Prost - the bags are used by men and women
alike. For those who like something smarter there are version in suede and
leather but the classic, signature design is the tote bag. In six different
sizes and masses of different colour combinations, the price ranges from
Pounds 12 for a small purse to Pounds 40 for the larger 'cabas'. Rucksacks
(still very popular) are Pounds 55. For those who are addicted to relaxed
briefcases (the sort that do not send out loud messages about the importance
of the carrier) there is a handy nylon briefcase. The range is sold in
Harrods of Knightsbridge, Heals of Tottenham Court Road, London W1, Moon in
Glasgow, Troon in Cambridge, Sage in Old Amersham Bucks, and Graham &amp; Green
of 4-7 Elgin Crescent, London W11.
                       *      *      *
Cult carriers have, for a long time, been slicked-up, smartened-up versions
of the rucksack or carry-all. Almost every smart name from Gucci and Chanel
to Mulberry, Etienne, Aigner and Mulberry has done a version of the
ruck-sack. Every model seems to have one (which is worn on just one
shoulder, never two) and besides being modish they are very practical,
solving the career girl's problem of how to carry her life around with her
without ending up on the osteopath's couch. As the years go by, companies
take up the original design, dust it down and freshen it up - this year has
produced the hold-all in a slightly rougher, pale, back-to-nature,
eco-conscious look. Made by Desmo of Florence in cream suede, it has masses
of pockets and is Pounds 185 at Harrods.

If you have a perfectly up-to-date Filofax and never lose any of those
useful addresses that people thrust into your hand at parties, then no doubt
you can survive without The World of Interiors Decorating Directories.
For the rest of us I foresee that these directories will be a useful prop
through those times that register highly on the stress meter - moving house,
having the builders in, deciding what colour to paint the kitchen. Insider
information always appeals and these directories list the names, addresses
and telephone numbers of The World of Interiors' favourite companies: the
suppliers of recherche cornices, old-fashioned herbs, antiqued garden pots,
painted tole ware, wrought-iron curtain rails and everything else the
efficient householder might one day conceivably need to know.
The directories are free - the first part (A to F for fabrics) came out with
the April issue. To get a back copy you should get in touch with The World
of Interiors itself (tel: 071-351-5177). For the second part (F, for
Finishing Touches to Z) all you need to do is buy the May issue (Pounds
2.80, out last Thursday) for your free copy will come with it.
Fired Earth, largely known for its ceramic and terracotta flooring, is
offering a collection of alternative floor coverings. Homing in strongly on
the fashion for earthy natural looks, for a touch of ethnic and eco-chic, it
calls its range Grass Roots and declares it to be Easy on the Eye (which it
most certainly is) and Easy on the Planet (on which matter it is harder to
pronounce).
All its flooring coverings are woven from 100 per cent renewable plant fibre
which may sound awfully new and politically correct but which really means
it is offering our old friends sisal, hemp, jute and coir. They have, to my
mind, always been attractive and always will be, but it is reassuring to
learn that coir replaces itself in a mere 90 days.
All these natural fibres are hard-wearing, all are attractive to look at,
the irregularity of the colouring and the roughness of the weave only adding
to their charm.
Some of these floorings come from British sources - such as the handwoven
rush matting from Rousham - others, such as the jute, from far-flung
estates. They come in different weaves, colours and textures but all can be
fitted, or there are rugs which can be loose laid or come edged and braided.
An underlay is recommended both for comfort and to add to its life.
An installation service is offered and there is a splendid brochure (tel:
0295-812088 for a copy) with close-up pictures of the weaves and the
colours. For those who wonder what the finished product will look like in
situ, Fired Earth offers to send three samples, free of charge, so that
colour and textured can be compared.
You can either collect the floor covering from Fired Earth's Oxfordshire
warehouse or, for a small charge, it will be delivered to your door. Prices
range from Pounds 8.18 to Pounds 25.26 per square yard.
Still in ethnic mood, the Natural Floorcoverings brochure always offers a
selection of hand-woven tribal rugs and kelims, all of which (not, as the
brochure points out, entirely coincidentally) team up extremely well with
the other natural floor-coverings range and with the original terracotta and
unglazed floor tiles.

FT  30 APR 94 / A black and white issue: Alan Pike describes how the
politics of race and colour is stirring up east London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE

<TEXT>
The mayor hammers his gavel to call members to order. In the distance,
demonstrators chant. Police patrol outside the building. The last council
meeting before next week's municipal elections is in session at Tower
Hamlets, east London.
Derek Beackon, the only candidate of the far-right British National Party
ever elected to a local authority, sits silent and ignored by other
councillors. He is the reason for the police presence. Since he won a
by-election in Tower Hamlets' Isle of Dogs neighbourhood on a Rights for
Whites platform in September, demonstrators have pursued him relentlessly.
East London's history contains enough heroes of political and social reform
to fill Valhalla: a whole alphabet of them from Attlee to Zangwill. The
unprepossessing Beackon does not look a natural candidate for the B section
alongside Annie Besant, Thomas Barnardo and William Booth. Yet if the BNP
were to strengthen its position in next week's elections he might well leave
a powerful, if negative, mark on this racially diverse, deprived inner city
area.
East London is immensely attached to its history, particularly an
interpretation of it that projects the area as a melting pot of cultures and
the birthplace of compassionate and progressive causes.
Only this month Tower Hamlets council presented the freedom of the borough
to the Salvation Army, founded by Booth in Stepney; the council is also
appealing to residents' nostalgic affection for their past with a campaign
to downplay the name Tower Hamlets and focus instead on the warm, friendly
old alternative of East End. New road signs tell visitors they are entering
the East End, while town hall telephone operators greet callers with the
response: 'Tower Hamlets, East End.'
The sense of recollection to which such a campaign appeals is inevitably
partial. Memories of East Enders taking to the streets in the 1930s to
resist Sir Oswald Moseley's British Union of Fascists, for instance, fit
more comfortably than the outcome of the 1937 London County Council
elections in Bethnal Green, when the fascists came second to Labour and beat
the Liberals to third place.
Yet both are facts, just like the outlandish fact that since September the
local government ward containing Canary Wharf - the internationally famous
symbol of the new, 21st century East End of the future - has been
represented by a BNP councillor.
Isle of Dogs residents who admit having put him in office, and say they will
vote BNP again next week, often add: 'But I am not racist.' Some are liars.
London dockers, who for generations have populated the Isle of Dogs, were
never among the most progressive sections of the working class; the
entrenched attitudes that barred outsiders from dock work are now exhibited
by some whites against Asian families moving to this predominantly white
part of the borough.
This does not mean that BNP support is based only on innate racism. After
Beackon's victory in September, the national Liberal Democrat party set up a
committee of inquiry under Lord Lester, QC.
Its conclusion that leaflets produced by members of Tower Hamlets Liberal
Democrat party, which controls the council, had exploited racial prejudice
in a bid for the support of white voters remains a matter of controversy in
the local party. But few Tower Hamlets residents would argue with the
committee's analysis of the background:
'It is not surprising that Tower Hamlets should be a potential breeding
ground for racism given the extent of social and economic deprivation, the
high proportion of relatively recent immigrants from rural Bangladesh, the
lack of adequate housing stock, the onerous statutory duties placed upon the
council to house homeless persons, the government's failure to provide
adequate resources to meet the pressing needs of this greatly deprived part
of London's East End.'
Labour and Liberal Democrat councillors - there are no Conservatives on
Tower Hamlets council - certainly endorse the criticism that the government
has failed to provide adequate resources. The question of whether
councillors themselves have inadvertently contributed to the BNP's growing
confidence - whether in their administration of this racially complex
borough, they have fallen short of the proud, progressive traditions on
which their crusade to reinstate the old image of the East End is built - is
a less comfortable one for them.
But concerns about racial bias in Tower Hamlets' housing policies have a
long pedigree. They began before Labour lost control of the council to the
Liberal Democrats in 1986; the Commission for Racial Equality issued a
non-discrimination notice in 1987, and the council's housing activities have
been the subject of continued monitoring and court actions since then.
The Lester report concluded that, since 1990 at least, there was 'ample
evidence' that the Liberal Democrat party at federal, national and regional
levels had been 'aware of problems in Tower Hamlets'; 300 Bangladeshi
members of the Tower Hamlets party wrote to the Lester committee alleging
racism against three Liberal Democrat councillors.
Labour has been unable to witness these events with detached purity. Some of
its own leaflets are alleged to have also played on white voters' concerns
over the allocation of housing to Asians, while the local party has never
dealt satisfactorily with claims that false canvas returns exaggerating BNP
support were leaked during the by-election and became self-fulfilling.
Whatever the causes of the growth in BNP support, the potential consequences
are particularly serious in Tower Hamlets. The council is the most
decentralised in Britain, with services and decision-making devolved to
seven neighbourhoods. Election of only two more councillors alongside Derek
Beackon would give the BNP control of Isle of Dogs neighbourhood. A further
three would bring control of Globe Town. Winning both would put Pounds 40m
of discretionary spending in the BNP's hands.
Liberal Democrats - promoters of decentralisation - point to surveys
indicating the policy has popular support; critics say it has deprived
councillors of a collective, unifying sense of responsibility for the
borough as a whole, turning them instead into parish managers - and their
electorates into inward looking parishioners - and that the BNP has
capitalised on this.
Next week, the Liberal Democrat and Labour parties that dominate Tower
Hamlets politics must persuade one of Britain's most racially volatile areas
to step back from a further vote for extremism. Labour's Arthur Downes,
longest serving member of Tower Hamlets council, points to the dilemma they
face: 'There is a feeling among the people of the Isle of Dogs that the
Conservative government has let them down, the Liberal Democrat controlled
Tower Hamlets council has let them down and the Labour controlled Isle of
Dogs neighbourhood has let them down.
'In the past, they believed no one listened when they complained that they
felt let down. Now that they have elected a BNP councillor the political
parties, press, television and opinion pollsters are all listening. That is
a very difficult perception to deal with in an election campaign.'
Neither do the main parties go united into the fight - the aftermath of
Derek Beackon's win has worsened divisions in both Labour and the Liberal
Democrats and break-away factions are standing against the official parties.
The last council meeting before the election draws to a close. Councillors
leave the chamber for the most important campaign they have ever fought
carrying their agenda papers, covered with the borough coat of arms and
motto.
It is the old Stepney council motto, so familiar to those heroes of the East
End's political past, translated from Latin and retained when Tower Hamlets
was formed in 1965. A Magnis ad Maiora. From Great Things to Greater. Next
week will determine whether, in 1994, it should end with a question mark.

FT  30 APR 94 / Burnish your image, sir?: Lunch with the FT - Michael
Thompson-Noel meets David Abbott, advertising executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you knew even a little about advertising, you would mark David Abbott
down at once as a highly-paid 'creative' - possibly a copy-writer - rather
than an account-managing 'suit'. But he does wear suits - expensive ones,
sometimes striped ones - so you would conclude, again accurately, that he
was probably an agency head.
If you knew nothing about advertising, you would at least be certain that
Abbott was rich and successful - a deal-maker, say, in movies or fragrances,
or from the sharp end of fashion, supposing there is one.
Abbott is one of the best-regarded and most influential creatives in British
advertising. He is chairman and creative director of Abbott Mead Vickers
(AMV), which in 1994 hopes to handle billings - media expenditure placed on
clients' behalf - of Pounds 200m, enough to position it among the three or
four highest-billing London agencies.
A recent coup was the capture, three months ago, of an annual Pounds 50m
worth of BT (British Telecommunications) business, described by the agency
as the 'largest single new-business win in the history of British
advertising'.
I met David Abbott at Bibendum, an elegant restaurant on the first floor of
Michelin House in London's Fulham Road (Sir Terence Conran is a
co-proprietor) - and remembered that an FT columnist, not long ago, had
called BT 'Britain's most hated company'.
I mentioned this to the ace image-maker as we handled our menus. Abbott is
tall, rangy and Hollywood handsome, with Persil-white hair, and is
preternaturally charming: the brand of deep charm that reassures powerful
clients - Sainsbury's, Volvo, Leeds Permanent Building Society, Pepsi-Cola,
The Economist, etc - and costs a zillion per hour.
He smiled. 'I am not sure,' he said thoughtfully, 'that that is right,
except that BT suffer from being people who send you bills. I think they
have made real efforts to improve their service and lower their tariffs,
encouraged by the regulators. Our main job for them is call-encouragement -
to extend the length of calls. On average, an American spends 20 minutes on
the 'phone each day; in Britain it is four.'
Only an idiot would imagine that anything could be gained by heckling an
image-burnisher like Abbott with back-handed remarks about his clients, so I
switched to food.
'Do you like food? Is this your favourite restaurant? Do you like
Michelin-starred establishments?'
'I like food,' he said. 'But this' - Bibendum - 'is about as posh as I get.
This is such a pretty room, and we have been given almost the best table, I
am not sure why. I don't like cathedrals to food. I quite like bad
restaurants. Let me re-phrase that: unpretentious restaurants. If I've got a
free day I like to take a book and eat on my own. If you asked me to name my
three favourite restaurants - breakfast, lunch, dinner - I would answer with
three in Venice: the Cipriani for breakfast, that nice one by the opera
house for lunch, and Harry's Dolci for dinner.'
Abbott still copy-writes. He has won many awards for it. He is particularly
well-known for 20 years' work on the Volvo account, though I was surprised
when he said he still writes plenty of ads for different campaigns. He did
all of the creative writing, for example, that won the BT account.
'I have a love-hate relationship with copy-writing,' he says. 'Now I need a
deadline. I am 55, my eyesight's going and my knees ache, so there are some
older audiences that I'm just beginning to understand.'
He works 70 to 80 hours a week. Is he rich? 'I am rich by most people's
standards.'
He had a notion, early on, that he would like to 'do something creative',
and discovered there was a job called copy-writing after picking up a book
called Madison Avenue, by Martin Meyer. First, in 1961, he joined Kodak's
advertising department. Then he worked at agency Mather &amp; Crowther. 'I had
to take the copy test twice, but was offered a job because I was thought to
be the Mather's type.'
He had seven years at Doyle Dane Bernbach in London, including a year's
training in New York, where he came to admire the best qualities of US
advertising. Abbott Mead Vickers was started at the end of 1977, and has
just sort of grown.
Had British advertising improved in the last 10 to 15 years? 'I think it is
better. The general executional level of ads, particularly television ads,
is now of a very high standard. And technology has helped us do impossible
things. If you can think it, you can make it happen, really.
'I think also there's a recognition that the viewer - the consumer - is of a
visually literate generation. You can use shorthand: you can be quite clever
in your visual communication. There's less pounding on the door, more
subtlety, in advertising now. The danger is that that goes too far and you
just have entertainment and no persuasion.
'The real problem with advertising is that there's going to be so much of
it: that the proliferation of media is going to mean narrow-casting, rather
than broad-casting. The price of entry is going to go down and we will
become more like America than is perhaps desirable. I'm sure we're going to
have car dealers (on screen) doing their own advertising, more plumbers,
more back specialists and hair clinics.'
'I have read,' I said, 'that television is expected to last 10,000 years.
Will advertising always exist?'
'There'll always be a need,' he said, 'for some form of mass selling. As
long as we value mass employment, we have to have mass production.
Advertising is just an intrinsic part of western capitalist society.'
'Is it my imagination,' I asked, 'or has UK TV advertising become more and
more Americanised?'
'I'm not sure how real that is,' said the image-builder. 'There are two
things. One, there is the influx of the multi-nationals, and a desire to use
effective work from one market in another. One of my clients is Pepsi-Cola,
and they run Pepsi commercials made in the States for the American market
here in the UK - very effectively. And that will continue to grow. Second, I
think there's a vogue for things American, so that what may look like an
American commercial for Levi's is in fact created by an English agency.
'I think you're right, though. I think there will be not only more American
commercials on our screens but more Italian and more French ones that are
re-voiced. It's just the global economy. Certainly international business is
on the increase. In 1990, 1.5 per cent of our billing was international; in
1994 it will be something like 34 per cent. For the last couple of years,
nearly 60 per cent of our new-business inquiries have been from people
interested in our international capabilities.'
David Abbott is especially fascinating on the subject of redundancies. He
hates them, and has moved heaven and earth to avoid them at AMV, even -
especially - in a period when employment in London ad agencies has fallen by
a quarter.
'After a while,' he says, 'there are only so many costs you can cut before
hacking into live wood. It seems to me much more commendable for managements
to go out and try and make money rather than save it, so we went for a
really concentrated new-business drive, so as to hang on to jobs.
'It might have meant flat profits for a few years, but when the recession
was over we'd end up with a workforce intact, good morale, clients who had
not been short-changed during the lean years, and no diminishment of our
ability to win new business. You can't win new business and cut staff at the
same time, because you have to win new business while you're looking after
old business.'
When we left, the waiters, broadly smiling, sang their goodbyes to 'Mr
Abbott'. I was not at all surprised.

FT  30 APR 94 / Switched on for cyberchat: Christina Lamb has a host of new
contacts since her Internet article
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A month ago I wrote about my adventures in cyberspace through Internet, the
worldwide web of computer networks. Just to see what would happen we printed
my e-mail message address quite discreetly at the end for readers to send
comments.
The next morning I switched on my computer to find more than 100 messages -
comments on the article from places as diverse as Poland, Zambia and Los
Angeles.
The following morning I signed on with anticipation to find another 80
messages, many with suggestions for further articles or even series on the
same theme. Some people I had already replied to had written back again.
By the end of the week I had heard from more than 300 readers and one month
on I am still receiving e-mail messages about the piece. This is far more
than our letters editor receives for even the most controversial articles
and many of these are never seen by the reporters.
And while people are usually spurred by irritation to writeletters to a
newspaper, my e-mailers were friendly, positive and did not include a single
Mr Angry. The ease and informality of being able to sit down at the keyboard
and knock off a message directly to the writer seems to stimulate good
humour.
Many, I think, were inspired to correspond by the article's headline, 'Yes
it's true. I was a cybervirgin', dreamt up by an imaginative sub-editor.
Messages often began 'Dear cybervirgin'. Some even wanted to share their own
cyber-deflowering. Robert Dilworth, in Frankfurt, wrote: 'My first time was
six weeks ago and I'm 35 years old . . .' I kept expecting a threatening
message from the Internet postmaster, accusing me of providing a sex
service.
I began to look forward every morning to a new surge of mail and even
cancelling real-life dates in order to have time for new cybercontacts.
Unsurprisingly, given the net's roots in academia, a large number of
messages came from professors and researchers, ranging from the geography
department of Edinburgh University to the English department of Rhodes
College, Memphis; from Nairobi to the University of California (UCLA).
The second biggest group were businessmen, from owners of small companies
extolling the virtues of Internet in enabling them to develop a home-based
business into one with customers and suppliers all over world, to the
president of Citibank in Moscow who kept me updated on the city's snowfall.
The third most prolific message-senders work for organisations such as the
World Bank, a UK teachers' union, the UN and the European Union.
I heard from FT correspondents in remote places such as Kiev and with whom I
am now carrying on a lively correspondence; I received messages from an old
schoolfriend with whom I had lost touch; and from contacts in Brazil, my
last posting, telling me the latest gossip and inflation figure. A man in
Bombay even said the article had saved his skin by providing fodder for a
talk he was due to give.
Apart from being entertaining, many were useful. A professor in South Africa
is giving me a daily personal account of the elections, while a reporter on
the local Boston paper is providing a useful exchange of ideas. While the
length of some messages led me to speculate over the amount of time some
people had on their hands, one paediatrician impressed me by writing his
e-mail mid-air, ready to send as soon as the flight landed.
Most of the messages came from enthusiasts frustrated by the media's
tendency to focus on negative aspects of Internet.
Many described signing on initially just for messaging, only to find a new
world awaiting them. James Quirke, from Wolverhampton, who subscribed to
correspond with his daughter at Bradford university, says: 'Yes it is
addictive but I've never had so many friends.'
Some wanted to complain about cyberjunk; others had been inspired by the
article to try to access the mass of information available online. For some,
messaging me was their first attempt at e-mail overseas or outside their
company. There emerged a generalised frustration over the cost of access in
Europe, although I received many suggestions for the cheapest methods.
The experience showed that such interactivity will be the norm in the
future. In the US, more than 100 newspapers are online and subscribers can
message reporters directly for more information or to comment on articles.
Some newspapers, such as the Raleigh Observer in North Carolina, have their
computer systems connected to local schools enabling students to send in
sports reports or make comments.
And from the journalist's perspective, for the first time in seven years I
feel a real sense of who readers are and what they are interested in.
The only problem is that I am so busy reading and replying to e-mail that
there is no time left to write articles . . .

FT  30 APR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Herbal recipe for a healthy
company - Imports from China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Miller had been suffering from bronchitis for two months when he gave
up conventional medicine in favour of seeking a remedy in Boston's
Chinatown. He found a Chinese doctor who seemed to have the powers of a
fortune teller.
'He told me amazingly accurate things about my medical history, gave me a
revolting tasting herbal potion, and two days later my condition started
clearing up. After a week I was feeling 100 per cent,' said the healthy
six-footer from Ohio.
For Miller, it was the road to Damascus. With relief he sold the exhibition
organising business he had run since 1977 and which he blamed for the stress
at the root of his bronchitis. A few months after, in early 1980, he started
a herbal importing business.
In 1986 he moved to England, where he had spent time as a child, and started
East-West Herbs in a 400 sq ft converted stable block near the Oxfordshire
home of a friend.
Within a few months he had sold the US business and formed a partnership
with his friend, Michael McIntyre, a herbal practitioner whom he bought out
in 1990. Miller now holds the major interest but six of the 20 full and
part-time employees have a minor holding.
The growth of East West Herbs was at first unspectacular. Initial capital
was Pounds 20,000, shared between the partners. In the first year the
company turned over a mere Pounds 12,000. During the second year it acquired
a third member of staff and turned over Pounds 40,000.
The 1993 figures showed a net profit of just under Pounds 90,000, and the
business turned over Pounds 900,000.
The warehouse and laboratory now occupy 6,000 sq ft of former farm
buildings.
'Our progress has mirrored the increasing use of Traditional Chinese
Medicine (TCM) in this country,' said Miller, 43. 'But we have had to work
hard for our money and there have been reversals.'
The worst of these was the October 1992 exchange rate crisis, when Britain
left the ERM. 'I was slow to realise the effects of this. In February 1993 I
had to send out a letter to all customers adding a surcharge of 10 per cent
to wholesale prices and a surcharge on all prescriptions being mailed to
practitioners,' said Miller.
East-West Herbs weathered the storm. 'Life was hard last year. We had to ask
our suppliers for extended credit and our bankers, Coutts, were very helpful
with our overdraft facility, which I do not generally like to exceed Pounds
50,000,' Miller said.
The company nevertheless achieved nearly 30 per cent growth and expanded the
work of its research and authentication laboratory. In this department the
key figures are two Chinese TCM specialists. The core business remains
supplying more than 1,000 herbs, herbal preparations and herbal products to
about 1,000 customers in a dozen countries. In this, Dr Shouming Zhong and
Miss Hongwen Yu play a key role.
'In 1986, when we started, the oriental herb supply business was in the
cottage industry category,' Miller said. 'A lot of Hong Kong fraudsters were
able to pass off inferior preparations to unsuspecting non-Chinese speakers.
My aim has been to raise the whole standard of what this business is all
about in this country.'
Dr Zhong, a phyto-chemist, formerly a professor at the Chinese
Pharmaceuticals University in Nanjing, and Yu, who previously worked at the
London School of Pharmacy, concentrate on authentication.
'Many Chinese herbs traditionally undergo a long process of baking,
steaming, frying and mixing before they are ready for use,' Miller said. 'In
Hong Kong, unlike mainland China, there are no rules or regulations
governing the preparation of pharmaceutical products. Processing methods
there often contravene the guidelines of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. At
East-West Herbs we have installed a stringent quality control programme and
now import our herbs directly from mainland China.'
At the company headquarters in the village of Kingham near Chipping Norton
the smell of herbs and herbal preparations emanates from the dispensing
area, where staff prepare prescriptions for TCM products and 150 western
herbal tinctures.
As well as being available by mail order, many of the company's products can
be bought at the East-West Herb Shop and clinic in London's Covent Garden,
and the company recently signed a contract with a large pharmaceutical
company to carry out research into a remedy for what Miller describes as 'a
common ailment in this country'.
'Overall, our net profit is under 10 per cent, but this is not my prime
measure of success,' Miller said. 'My main aim has always been to exploit
the growth potential of TCM in this country. In the US there is a Dollars
400m market, but the Germans are the biggest per capita users of TCM outside
China. The market there is estimated at Dollars 1.5bn.
'TCM provides primary health care for a quarter to a half of the world's
population. It is now possible to study TCM in this country, and more and
more British people are going to China to learn about it. It is also being
practised in half a dozen NHS clinics, so there is tremendous growth
potential. For East-West Herbs the really profitable phase is yet to come.'

FT  30 APR 94 / Fishing: The challenge of a new river
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new age has dawned in my angling career. I do not expect it to be golden -
a tarnished, mottled silver will do. The first omens, I am relieved to
report, have been reasonably propitious. But I remain a trifle fearful, for
a change of river at my time of life is a momentous thing.
I have swapped Berkshire for Hampshire, and forsaken the broad waters of the
middle Kennet for the limpid Itchen. To give it an educational parallel, it
is as if I had left the familiar surroundings of school, and was peering in
to some college of higher learning. There is a fear of being found
deficient; and with it a sense of challenge.
This is not to denigrate the Kennet, where I have had several happy years -
and even the occasional triumph over a trout. But the Itchen is a different
kettle of fish. My new refuge is the Abbots Barton water on the outskirts of
Winchester - hallowed in fly fishing's traditions because it was here that
the immortal Skues studied trout, and refined to the point of revolution the
way we fish for them.
The idea that I or anyone else could follow in his footsteps is laughable.
But his shadow - as well as a sturdy commemorative seat - are there, along
with the memories of his encounters with trout. So I felt a touch daunted as
I made my debut.
The season on the Itchen opens at the start of April. Now I have always had
my doubts about April trout fishing. Forget about Chaucer and his 'shoures
soote' - the problem these days is winter hanging around to flay hopeful
spring-seekers with Arctic blasts, hailstorms, snow flurries and the like.
So it was for the first half of this April. I cowered indoors until the
forecaster assured me that a gentle breeze was blowing from the south-west.
The countryside was caught between seasons; the river appeared chill and
lifeless.
I wandered hither and thither for a couple of hours before lunch, searching
vainly for any sign of meaningful activity on the main river, or on the
network of feeder streams which cut through the meadows. As I ate my bread
and cheese, I pondered sceptically - and a little resentfully - on the
reports I had read about the infallible appearance on April days of an
insect called the Large Dark Olive, and the guarantee this offered of sport
with trout.
I was resigned to failure when, suddenly and miraculously, they did begin to
hatch. Down they floated, dark smudges against the sheen of the surface. And
up came the trout to snatch them.
I had two hours of utterly absorbing fishing. Being stocked fish, they were
none too faddy, and took a hackled Greenwell readily enough. By
mid-afternoon I had caught and returned three or four which did not quite
make the 14in size limit, and kept one handsome two-pounder.
By the fishing hut I met the keeper, a big, affable pipe-smoker named Mike.
We ex-changed pleasantries, and I moved upstream for a final flurry. The
hatch persisted, and I spotted two fish sucking away merrily on a bend. I
caught one, then the other, each heavily spotted with golden tummies, each
just over two pounds. I was shamingly pleased with myself.
The keeper took the pipe out of his mouth as I approached. That was very
efficiently done, he commented approvingly. Help, I thought. He thinks I'm a
proper fisherman. Wait until next time.

FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Revenue's own goal - David Cohen
explains how taxpayers can profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Crossing swords with the Inland Revenue can often feel like playing for your
local park team against Manchester United. But an admission last week from
its chairman, Sir Anthony Battishill, confirms that even the taxmen can
score an own goal. Alert taxpayers may be able to take advantage.
The chance to save money arises if your inspector of taxes fails to make
'proper and timely use' of financial information you have given him. If his
lethargy lingers for more than a tax year, and lulls you into believing you
owe no tax, when he finally does wake up you might be able to boot his tax
demand into touch when, finally, it shows up.
The proportion of the bill to be written off depends on the taxpayer's
income bracket; people earning no more than Pounds 15,500 a year per annum
pay nothing while anyone on more than Pounds 40,000 will get no relief at
all (for in-between incomes, see table).
Sir Anthony 's statement promised a let-off for people who had failed in
good faith to declare they were getting state pensions and now face
unexpected demands for arrears.
The Revenue was told about these pensions by the Department of Social
Security. On Tuesday this week, a press release announced that, from now on,
relief will extend to cases in which information is made available by the
DSS rather than by the taxpayer or his employer.
Whether or not a pensioner, a taxpayer will qualify for a rebate only if he
genuinely believes his position is up-to-date. But because the whole idea of
waiving tax arrears has no statutory basis and is merely a 'concession,' it
is the Revenue itself which must be persuaded of the individual's bona
fides.
So, there is little point in arguing if the decision goes against you - the
opposition is also the referee.
A taxpayer will be playing on firmer ground if, instead of paying too little
tax, he has paid too much. When the Revenue gets round to returning the
excess amount, it might be obliged to add a 'repayment supplement.'
Generally, the right to a supplement will not start until 12 months after
the end of the fiscal year in which the liability arose. It will then be
payable for the period from the starting date until the fifth day of the
month following the month in which the surplus tax is repaid.
Suppose, for example, that an overpayment of tax for the year to April 5
1992 was repaid in February 1994. The supplement period would have run from
April 5 1993 to March 5 1994.
With effect from 6 April 1996, however, the timing rules will change in
taxpayers' favour. As part of a drive general to simplify simplification of
personal taxation, the repayment period will run from the date on which the
tax becomes payable (or, if later, the date it is actually paid) until the
repayment date.
The supplement is calculated on the basis of a rate of interest fixed by the
Revenue and adjusted from time to time to keep it broadly in line with
market rates. The present current rate is 5.5 per cent, and it is tax-free.
Until last April, no supplement was payable unless at least Pounds 25 of tax
was repaid, but this threshold has now been abolished.
These rules apply both to income tax - whether paid by an individual
personally or by an employer through the Paye system on behalf of an
employee - and to capital gains tax.
Although CGT does not become payable until the December following the tax
year in which the gains are realised, the supplement period is linked to the
year for which the tax is charged, rather than the year in which it is
payable. Hence, CGT for 1992/93, overpaid in December 1993, will attract a
supplement if not repaid by April 5 1994.
If you are fortunate enough - or perhaps stupid enough - to get a repayment
supplement, you should check carefully that it is the correct amount.
Anyone who has been short-changed will know what to do but, equally, a
taxpayer who realises the repayment is excessive but keeps quiet could be
committing a crime.

FT  30 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A claim from abroad?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My bachelor son works in Luxembourg. His salary is paid in local currency
and is taxed locally. He also has investments in the UK. These include
building society interest, which is paid gross (he has signed form R85), and
shares from which dividends are received net. These amount to about Pounds
1,500 gross a year and tax of Pounds 300 is deducted.
Since he does not complete UK income tax returns, he is not claiming back
the Pounds 300. But is he entitled to the single person's allowance (in
which case it would be worth his while to claim back the tax)?
Although your son probably is entitled to UK building society interest
without deduction of tax (because he is not ordinarily resident in the UK),
he was not entitled to sign form R85 (which applies only to people resident
in the UK).
If he signed by mistake, he should write at once and explain his error to
the building society. All Commonwealth citizens are entitled to a personal
allowance, regardless of whether they are UK resident. Your son should write
for a claim form to: Inland Revenue Claims Branch (International), St John's
House, Merton Road, Bootle, Merseyside, L69 9BB, saying how far back he
wants to claim.

FT  30 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Warrants and CGT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I understand that warrants, if exercised, are not subject to CGT even if
they are bought for cash on the market. But what if warrants are bought and
sold on the market? Do I have to pay tax on any gain?
Listed warrants sold on the market are treated just like listed shares, for
CGT purposes. A cash profit is eligible for indexation relief; a cash loss
is allowable* without being increased by indexation unless the transitional
Pounds 10,000 relief applies.
Exercising a warrant does not produce any immediate CGT consequences, as you
say. When the shares are sold, they are deemed to have cost you the total of
(a) the cost of the warrant and (b) the amount paid on exercise; the cost of
the warrant (a) is indexed from the month of purchase to the month of
exercise, and then the total of that indexed figure and the amount paid on
exercise (b) is indexed from the month of exercise to the month of sale.
*If you buy warrants which eventually expire worthless, the cost is
allowable as a loss which is deemed to arise on the day of expiry.

FT  30 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Employee share scheme
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am confused over aspects of the employee share option scheme. 1. With
save-as-you-earn contracts, is indexation applied from the date of exercise
of the option or the original date of grant? The price used would be that at
the date of grant.
2. With executive share options, a nominal sum is paid on the grant of the
option but the exercise may be three to seven years after grant. Is
indexation applied from the date of exercise?
3. With profit-sharing schemes, shares granted are not the employee's
saleable property until the expiry of five years from the grant, when the
share certificate is provided. Is indexation applied from the date of the
grant rather than the date of issue of the share certificate?
1. The cost of the option (a nominal sum, generally) is indexed from the
grant of the option. The exercise price is indexed from the day of exercise.
2. Yes. The rules are the same as for Saye options.
3. Indexation runs from the day of the grant.

FT  30 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Indexation losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The table published on April 16 in the Weekend FT's series on capital gains
tax suggests that indexation losses relating to disposals made between
November 30 1993 and April 5 1994 may exceptionally be carried forward to
the 1994/95 tax year if they were not all needed to reduce the net gain for
1993/94 to the value of the annual allowance (Pounds 5,800). Is this
correct?
What is the position now regarding claims for 'negligible value' made in the
tax returns for 1993/94? The original Budget proposals, I understand,
provided that no indexation losses would be allowed on any such claims made
after November 30 1993, irrespective of the actual date when the assets in
question were deemed valueless.
Indexation losses, of course, will now be allowed; but is it correct that
such indexation losses must be considered to have been incurred after
November 30 and, thus, that they must in all circumstances come out of the
Pounds 10,000 limit?
The answer to the first question is yes. The answer to the second also is
yes as a result of the schedule added to the Finance Bill on the day you
wrote to us.

FT  30 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax relief for couples
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Your writer Andrew Radice says (Weekend FT, March 12-13) tax relief on the
married couple's allowance is not worth transferring from husband to wife
unless his income is below the threshold. What is this threshold: tax band
25 or 40 per cent? With regard to CGT, he says assets should be transferred
to take advantage of the Pounds 5,800 allowance of the spouse. I thought the
Pounds 5,800 allowance was for husband and wife.
When he wrote 'unless the husband's income is below the threshold,' Radice
meant simply 'unless the husband's income is so small that his income tax
bill would be less than Pounds 344 (viz, 20 per cent of Pounds 1,720) if he
had no married couple's allowance.'
As for your second question, husbands and wives have had separate CGT
exemptions since the introduction of independent taxation. In 1990-91, the
figure was Pounds 5,000 each. It rose to Pounds 5,500 in 1991-92 and to
Pounds 5,800 in 1992-93 and thereafter.

FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Commission? We just don't need it -
Brogan, 14th in a series on fee-based advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not easy for an independent financial adviser to move from commission
to fees. Pat Brogan knows that only too well. In 1991, Brogan - who founded
Pat Brogan Life &amp; Pensions in Perth, Scotland, 15 years ago - gave himself
three years to accomplish the task. He has discovered he was
over-optimistic.
'We have been working actively on moving the clients totally on to fees and
I thought we could do it within three years. But I have raised that to six
years now,' says Brogan.
'I found that people looked at me as if I had two heads when I said we were
going to put together a totally fee-based client base. But I hope the day
will come when we get away from commission altogether. Then we will be a
profession.
'Once you are charging a fee, you don't have to worry where you are putting
clients' money. You have complete freedom of investment choice, and you can
really try to build up clients' wealth. And I want to know what my income
will be. Every profession expects that.'
Brogan finds that younger clients are the most resistant to fees. He
believes this is largely because they have little experience of other
fee-based professionals such as accountants and solicitors. So, to encourage
them, he has introduced a Pounds 15 to Pounds 20 a month retainer service as
a sort of starter pack. 'It is too cheap,' he agrees, 'but young clients are
not difficult to look after and they are our future.'
Rather surprisingly, Brogan has also met some resistance to fees among his
corporate clients. The firm provides financial advice for several small
companies with annual turnovers ranging from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 15m.
Some continue to believe they will save money if they stick to
commission-based advice.
Brogan says: 'I tell them that if they retain me for Pounds 7,500 they will
be far better off, but they say they don't want to pay that way. Some
managing directors are very good at making money but they are not very
sophisticated in financial matters.'
Many of Brogan's clients come through his corporate connections; others have
been recommended by existing clients - he does not advertise. He also has a
client base in the Shetlands and he spends five days a month there. 'In the
past 18 months, many clients have come to us because of the drop in interest
rates,' says Brogan.
Most of his clients want investment advice. Typically, they will have around
Pounds 150,000 in investments, a property worth around Pounds 100,000, and
perhaps another property somewhere else.
'Most want income from their capital,' says Brogan. 'They are either getting
towards the end of their working life or they have just retired, so we have
to be cautious because they have no chance of making money again. We try to
point that out very early on. We say, if you want a risk investment, don't
come to us.'
This caution means Brogan will actively manage only a small proportion of a
client's investments. On a Pounds 100,000 portfolio, he would advise that
only Pounds 15,000 should go into more volatile holdings. The remainder is
likely to be in relatively stable investments, such as insurance bonds and
National Savings.
Brogan looks 'for investment houses that will provide us with the
information we need and will keep in touch with us.' He adds: 'I talk to a
lot of people. It is a question of constantly monitoring clients' affairs.'
Clients choose if they want a quarterly, half-yearly or annual meeting with
Brogan. All files are replicated, so that the same dossier is with the firm
and with the client. The firm does not handle client money and Brogan
requires a client signature before taking any investment action.
Brogan believes the financial planning pace is rather more measured in
Scotland than elsewhere. 'We may take less risk and we do things at a slower
pace sometimes. We never push clients.'
On average, Brogan takes two meetings to get the information he needs from
clients, and another 14 to 21 days to prepare a report. A further period
elapses. There is then a a third meeting to sign the agreement. 'That's the
fast track,' he says. 'On the slow track, it can take six months to two
years.
'We insist on seeing both the husband and the wife, and we will also look at
a couple's inheritance tax position and involve their solicitor in what we
are doing. As a profession, we should be working with a client's accountant
and solicitor. We should not be in competition with them.'
Involving other professional advisers is central to another job Brogan is
tackling as the Scottish branch chairman of the Institute of Financial
Planning, an association still in its infancy in Scotland.
'I am putting together a study group of financial advisers who have the same
goals as I do. The institute should grow from that basis. We want to involve
solicitors and accountants and to create a nucleus of fee-based advisers,'
he says.
But he warns: 'We must be seen to attract the right people. I would be
horrified to introduce my corporate lawyer to some of the people in this
industry. We must keep them out of the IFP by raising the standards to a
level that they can't achieve.'

FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Small saver hints - Saye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small savers are usually hard done by when it comes to interest rate levels,
with institutions paying the highest rates to those with the largest sums of
money, as the Moneyfacts table (right) shows.
However, small savers can earn up to 8.62 per cent annually and tax-free to
boot through the government's save-as-you-earn scheme.
This is a five-year tax-free scheme with a minimum monthly saving of Pounds
1 to a maximum of only Pounds 20 a month, or Pounds 1,200 maximum. The bonus
paid at the end of five years is equivalent to an annual return of 8.3 per
cent; if the money is left for another two years, it is 8.62 per cent.
These figures gross up to 13.8 per cent and 14.4 per cent for a higher-rate
taxpayer or 11.1 per cent and 11.5 per cent for a lower-rate taxpayer.
Early withdrawals are allowed but no interest is paid for withdrawals in the
first year; the rate is 6 per cent thereafter. You can only have one SAYE
contract at a time.
The only bank to operate the scheme is Abbey National. The building
societies are: Alliance &amp; Leicester, Bradford &amp; Bingley, Bristol &amp; West,
Britannia, Buckinghamshire, Cambridge, Chesham, Cheshire, Chorley &amp;
District, Derbyshire, Dudley, Earl Shilton, Furness, Halifax, Harpenden,
Leeds &amp; Holbeck, Leek United, Marsden, Mercantile, Newbury, Newcastle, North
of England, Principality (from Tuesday), Scottish, Vernon and Yorkshire.

FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: First steps for son of BES / A look
at the initial prospectus under its successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors who are wondering what happened to the 'son of BES', announced in
last November's Budget, need wonder no more. The first company to try to
raise money under the new Enterprise Investment Scheme has just put out its
prospectus.
Altnamara Shipping, a Scottish company, may be familiar to some business
expansion scheme investors, as it was launched through a Business Expansion
Scheme issue, sponsored by Neill Clerk Capital, late last year. However,
that pulled in less than Pounds 500,000. Now the company is trying again
with a share issue to raise up to Pounds 4.7m through the EIS, again
sponsored by Neill Clerk.
Altnamara is the latest in a long line of BES companies set up by its
chairman, Sir Ross Belch. His previous ventures include Ferguson Marine,
which bought Ferguson Shipbuilders from the Kvaerner Group, and Altnacraig
Shipping.
Altnamara has already agreed to buy a 6,000 tonne second-hand dry bulk
carrier, the Radnes, for Dollars 1.96m. The ship will be operated in a
European shipping pool run by Jebsen Wilson, following the example of
Altnacraig, which has three mini-bulk carriers in the same pool. After the
Radnes has been paid for, any extra money raised through the EIS issue will
be used, together with borrowings, to buy and operate further ships.
The reason why it has taken so long for the first EIS issue to emerge is
that although plans for the EIS were announced last November, the details
are not final until the Finance Bill, which is still going through
parliament, receives royal assent early next month.
Many of the elements of the BES which were being abused, such as guaranteed
exits, and low-risk residential property schemes, have been stamped out by
the new EIS rules. To qualify for the scheme, an issuer must be a genuine
trading company - so all the university accommodation or repossessed
property schemes which sprang up in the last stages of the BES are excluded.
Individuals can invest up to Pounds 100,000 a year in EIS issues, an
increase from the annual BES limit of Pounds 40,000. Companies are allowed
to raise up to Pounds 1m a year through the EIS, unless they are shipping
companies, in which case the limit is Pounds 5m a year.
BES offered investors up-front tax relief up to the higher rate tax band of
40 per cent; EIS is less generous, offering only 20 per cent up-front tax
relief. However, EIS losses can be offset against income or capital gains
tax, whereas BES made no allowance for losses. A further change is that
investors can become directors of EIS companies without losing their tax
relief.
The Budget also introduced a new tax break by which investors can delay
capital gains tax liability by rolling-over gains into unquoted trading
companies. Altnamara is also encouraging investors to use this opportunity.
But investors should probably be wary of rushing to throw their money into
the first few EIS issues with as much enthusiasm as they showed in the last
days of BES. David Harris, an independent financial adviser with Chantrey
Financial Services, says he is reserving judgment on EIS for the moment.
'We are reverting at this stage to where the BES came from, in that there is
a real industrial risk involved. The history of the early BESs, and also the
commercial BESs, can hardly be described as a good one,' Harris says. 'And
the likelihood is that with any new undertaking such as this, you are going
to have teething problems.
'It does strike me that for the level of commercial risk you are asking
people to take, 20 per cent tax relief is probably not going to be adequate
to encourage them.'
Harris believes that the Pounds 1m limit for EIS issues by most companies
will mean that most of the sponsors who were churning out BES issues during
1992-93 - firms such as Johnson Fry, Neill Clerk, and Close Brothers - will
not find it worthwhile getting involved to the same extent in the EIS.
This may mean that companies decide to go it alone, and there will be less
of a filtering process to exclude the ones with little chance of survival.
So investors will have to be even more cautious.

FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: How to take care of yourself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you become old and frail, whom do you expect to look after you? And whom
do you expect to pay for the care?
Recent research by PPP Lifetime, a provider of insurance to pay for
long-term care for the elderly, shows that there is a wide gap between
people's expectations of care in their old age, and what is likely to
happen.
PPP's survey found that only 18 per cent expected to pay for their own care,
whereas in fact more than 60 per cent of elderly people in residential care
contribute to its cost. There was a widespread feeling that as people had
paid taxes all their lives, the state would provide. The reality is that
state help is means tested, and anyone with savings and assets above Pounds
8,000 will not receive much state support.
In developed societies, people are surviving longer, but are often
incapacitated in their final months or years. Relatives are less likely to
be willing - or able - to look after them, as more women are working, more
marriages end in divorce, and families are scattered over wider areas.
The number of elderly people will rise sharply over the next few decades: in
20 years' time, there will be 50 per cent more people over the age of 85,
and fewer people of working age to care and pay for them.
The UK's response to impending need lags behind that of some countries. In
Germany, for example, the government recently introduced a 1 per cent extra
tax to pay for long-term care.
A paper in the Consumer Policy Review this month says: 'The general picture
is one of the state reducing its commitment to open-ended financing of
long-term care. As people become more aware of this, they may become more
receptive to the idea of pre-funding their own care.'
The paper says possible ways of funding care include: pensions - but the
government has banned the only pension scheme which made direct provision
for care needs; general savings - an inefficient method; raising funds from
housing assets - this has possibilities, but not all elderly people are home
owners; or insurance products.
Long-term care insurance has been available in the UK only for the past
three years or so; the number of policies sold represents a tiny proportion
of the potential market.
But it is already proving its worth: last month PPP started paying its first
claimant, a man in his mid-60s who took out a policy a few months ago. He
has since suffered a stroke, leaving him unable to carry out a number of the
'activities of daily living', such as bathing and eating unaided, on which
claims are assessed.
PPP says its main buyers are 65- to 75-year-olds, but there are signs of
interest from the sandwich generation - middle-aged people caring for
parents and children.
Commercial Union, another of the main care insurance providers, says
two-thirds of its policyholders are women, and two-thirds are over 60, many
single or widowed. According to CU, the peak buying times are between 60 and
65 - ie around retirement time, when many people will have lump sums to pay
for single premiums - and for women, in their 70s, often when they are
recently widowed.
But it is not just single people who should consider making provision for
their care needs. Married couples cannot afford to assume that they will be
able to look after each other - a frail 80-year-old is unlikely to be able
to lift a marginally frailer spouse of the same age into their bed or bath.
Usually it is not necessary to cover the entire amount of Pounds 20,000 a
year or so needed to pay for full-time nursing home care - just the
shortfall between available income and the cost of a nursing home.
Comprehensive policies pay a reduced amount if you become mildly
incapacitated and need part-time care at home. Most allow you to use up to
half the annual sum insured to pay for home alterations, such as
stair-lifts.
A woman wanting Pounds 10,000 a year of top-up cover for both mild and
severe disability, increasing by 5 per cent a year, would pay Pounds 55.80 a
month if she took out a Commercial Union policy at age 45, Pounds 73.80 at
age 55, or Pounds 110.90 at age 65. A man would pay Pounds 37.70, Pounds
53.30, or Pounds 76. A glance around the female-dominated sitting room of
any nursing home is enough to explain women's higher premiums.
Excluding mild disability, or not allowing for inflation, will reduce
premiums. You can also pay a single premium: a 65-year-old man would pay
Pounds 11,006.54 for the cover above, while a woman of the same age would
pay Pounds 20,685.58.
The earlier you take out a policy, the cheaper it is, as premiums do not
rise with age for existing policyholders. Obviously, you may pay more if
your medical history presents a higher risk. However, once you have a
policy, new medical problems will not affect it.

FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: A saga that goes on for life -
Alison Smith with a question and answer session on life insurance agents and
the disclosure of information to customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The saga of forcing life insurance sales agents to volunteer more
information to their customers has now been running for longer than some of
the life policies being sold when the Office of Fair Trading first urged
disclosure in 1987.
But progress is being made. In last Thursday's episode, the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, published the rules for how
and when sales agents must volunteer this information, along with examples
of what material they should provide to prospective customers.
Research which SIB published at the same time, estimated that the move to
commission disclosure would benefit customers by Pounds 1bn a year when the
full effects were felt - more than the extra costs faced by the industry.
What did the SIB actually do?
It published examples of the short, stand-alone paper which sales agents
will be obliged to give their customers, along with whatever other sales
material they hand out.
On the first page, this paper must state the aims and risks of the policy,
as well as the commitment the customer has to make.
It also tells customers what happens if they give up early on a long-term
policy, and what the sales agent is getting paid for advising the customer
to buy the policy.
What difference will this make to me, the customer?
At the moment, sales agents do not have to volunteer some of the information
set out in the paper. It should mean that you are better placed to decide
whether you really want the policy or whether you think it is too expensive
for how you might benefit.
But isn't life insurance too complicated for everyone except accountants and
actuaries?
Not in terms of the sort of information that would be helpful in deciding
whether you want to buy life cover. This new paper - the 'key features'
document that sales agents will have to provide - is pretty jargon-free, and
has no small print or footnotes. It has been devised after three rounds of
market research to see what is the best way of giving people this
information, and is relatively straightforward.
Most recent research showed that even people who classed themselves as not
good with numbers - or who admitted they found buying life insurance a bit
nerve-wracking - found they could understand most of the paper's main
points. And that is before the final revision to make it clearer still.
Will I be able to trust the figures in this paper about what the policy I
might buy would yield?
No. They simply give examples of what you would get back from your policy
after, say, 10 years assuming particular rates of growth. They are not a
guarantee. What you get back would depend on how your investments had grown.
Life companies will have to use the same rate of growth for these
illustrations, so you should be able to make a reasonable comparison, but
the performance of different life companies' investments can vary.
Sales agents will doubtless be only too happy to explain how well the
investments they are recommending have performed in the past, although they
should make the point that past performance is no guide to the future.
Do I have to do anything to get this key features document?
You do not have to do anything when you are talking to the sales agent - he
or she is meant to give you this information without you asking. But, if the
system is to work in terms of putting pressure on life companies to cut
their charges, then you should be prepared to shop around and compare
prices.
Many life companies have argued that their policies have to be sold and are
not just bought, because people are so reluctant to think about making
provision for what happens when they die or when they retire. Regulators
believe that people are sophisticated enough to make informed choices about
what policies they buy. If the new regime of disclosure is to have its
intended benefit the regulators will have to be right.
When will I get this information?
During the course of a sale, you should be given the key features paper as
soon as you are seriously considering taking out a policy. If, for example,
you have come as far as discussing a particular company's product with a
sales agent, then you should have been given this paper. It should not wait
until you are just about to sign a form agreeing to buy the product.
As for when the new regime itself will come in - well, there is still a bit
of a wait. Life companies have been given until the beginning of next year
before all of this becomes compulsory, and until the middle of next year
before they are obliged to give you detailed figures which are entirely
related to your own circumstances and the policy you are thinking of buying.
In theory, companies can adopt the new requirements from the beginning of
July, but do not hold your breath expecting that most will meet that
deadline.
Why has it taken so long?
Many in the life industry have vigorously resisted disclosure proposals,
saying that they would lead to 'underprovision' - a drop in sales - lower
charges, and asserting that customers did not want the information.
They also said it would be unfair to make only independent financial
advisers provide this information, and that it would be too difficult to do
the calculations for a fair comparison with, for example, banks and building
societies selling life products.
It was only when the Treasury started banging heads together last July, and
insisting that all sales agents should disclose commission, surrender values
and other information, that the proposals seemed inevitable and much of the
serious task of making them work started.
So what are the life companies going to do about it now?
On past form, they will carry on moaning about how unnecessary it is even
after the new regime has been introduced. They are also likely to re-design
at least some of the policies they sell, to make them more attractive in the
regime of glasnost.
For the most part, this will mean finding ways of spreading the commission
more evenly over the life of the policy, so the customer's initial payments
are not so taken up just with paying for the advice. It has the added
advantage of giving the sales agent more of an interest in selling policies
that are less likely to lapse early.
Will I get a better deal?
Perhaps. Products will not become any less risky just because the way of
paying for those who sell them has changed. But you should be able to get a
clearer idea of the extent of the risk you are running - and see how much
you lose if you give up early on a long-term policy, or give up in the
penultimate year, just before a bonus is paid.
According to research commissioned by SIB, the new regime's impact will make
competition fiercer. This should mean that commissions will come down -
although they could fall a long way and still be higher than when there was
an industry-wide agreement about the maximum commission that could be paid.
It should also mean that some of the less efficient companies find it too
difficult to survive in this new environment and close, leaving the market
to the organisations that are better-run.
If it is going to have such a good effect, why haven't the life companies
adopted this approach before?
Why not ask them?

FT  30 APR 94 / Diary of a Private Investor: Unanswered questions - Kevin
Goldstein-Jackson examines the Crest share settlement system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent Grand National reminded me of Crest, the proposed new share
settlement system which is expected to begin operations in 1996. The Bank of
England's Crest project team is galloping towards the finish. But is it like
a blinkered horse, focused mainly on the requirement to cross the finishing
line? Will it be brought down by any of the obstacles placed before it? Or
can it jump over everything, regardless?
According to the Treasury, charged with the task of creating legal fences,
the Crest specification is due to be published next month. By the end of
this year, draft legal rules should be ready for another consultation
exercise, after which the finished regulations will be presented to
parliament by the end of 1995 so that Crest can meet its planned 1996
operational target.
All sorts of documents have been produced. Very few private investors have
seen any of them, let alone had a chance to comment. True, both Pro-Share
and the UK Shareholders' Association have had a say - but their combined
membership is fewer than 15,000. In the UK, there are well over 10m private
investors. Does the average private investor know what is likely to happen?
What weight is being given to those who submit their views to the Bank and
the Treasury?
The introduction of 10-day rolling settlement on July 18 this year, with a
planned five-day settlement system starting early in 1995, means that many
private investors have received letters from their stockbrokers urging them
to make use of the broker's nominee services. Such letters have included
phrases such as: 'Most clients will find it impossible to maintain
certificates and transfers (if) they are to meet these new time scales for
settlement, particularly in the light of postal delays.'
Using a nominee service is put forward as the only way to meet the new
deadlines. But many brokers are also proposing to charge investors for using
nominee services. What happens if investors decide, instead, to keep their
share certificates in their own name and find some other way to settle share
deals within the new, short time scales?
According to the Bank, such investors 'and their brokers will, of course,
have to bear the costs of processing and transporting that paper through the
system. A dematerialised transaction through Crest will, therefore, be
cheaper to settle than a paper-based trade; but please note that we believe
certificated transactions in the Crest world need cost no more than they do
in the current environment.' Although such transactions need not cost more,
it seems likely that they will.
Perhaps private investors should deluge the Bank with copies of their
brokers' letters? Sorry - the Bank says it 'could not cope' with such a
large amount of correspondence.
So, as brokers are likely to continue to urge their clients towards Crest's
dematerialised trading system, using nominees and without having share
certificates, what happens if an investor wants to change from broker A to
broker B?
Under the present system, an investor with shares registered in his own name
simply takes his share certificate/s to Broker B and the shares are sold. It
is quick and easy. But in the dematerialised world with nominees, the
investor has to contact Broker A (in whose nominee name the shares are
registered) to get the shares out of that nominee name so that Broker B can
sell them. It might well be that Broker A charges the investor for doing
this.
What, then, happens to competition? If an investor wishes to switch from
Broker A to Broker B because Broker B's dealing charges are lower, such
reduced dealing costs may be cancelled out through the charges made by
Broker A's nominee to give up the shares.
Can the Crest system cope with the likely volume of transactions? According
to the Bank, the 'peak daily transaction volume level in Crest is estimated
at 150,000 transactions' - although this is being 'continuously reviewed'.
More than 1m people paid their fuel bills early to escape the new VAT
charges. Suppose those same people, induced to believe that using Crest and
nominees was likely to be cheaper than keeping share certificates in their
own name, decided to switch into those nominees within the first few months
of the Crest operation. Could the system, and the company registrars, cope?
What regulatory safeguards are being built into the system to insure that,
in the event of another 1987-size crash, brokers will not handle
institutional investors' instructions first and private investors last?
Surely there should be appropriate compensation schemes for investors using
Crest? Much more reliance is having to be placed on brokers inputting the
correct information into the system.
Should there not be automatic compensation for errors, in the same way as
the gas and electricity companies compensate their customers for such
shortcomings as delays in keeping appointments?
Apparently not. According to the Bank, clients are instead 'at liberty to
negotiate such compensation as part of the terms of business they agree with
the broker or nominee. If a broker acts in an inefficient manner and does
not compensate, his clients should consider moving to another broker . . .'
I can just imagine the response from some brokers to the average Sid seeking
to negotiate outside their normal terms.
The position of nominees still needs greater legal clarification. And
investors need greater protection from such events as LEV Investment
Management in 1988 and Diameter Stockbrokers in 1991, when brokers got into
some difficulties and it took considerable time to work out just who owned
what within a nominee name.
There are solutions to these (and many other) problems, just as there were
with Taurus. But will more attention be paid to the views of professionals
with vested interests to protect, rather than those of private investors?
If you want to promote and improve business in a shop, you do not rely
mainly on what other shopkeepers tell you - you have to ask the customers.
Surely private investors ought to count as customers?

FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: No Indian tonic - The bulls have
fled the Bombay market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEKHAR DAS and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A couple of months ago investors were bullish about investing in Indian
shares. Now the mood is subdued. The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index
has fallen by about 12 per cent to around 3,750 since the end of February.
It may lose another 200 points or so before the rally resumes.
The mood began to change when it became clear that Bombay's antiquated
settlement system could not cope with the sudden inflow of foreign funds.
Clients were told that their orders could not be processed; new clients were
turned away. The number of India funds has more than doubled over the past
year - European and US institutions bought what they could, usually global
depository receipts (dollar-denominated parcels of shares) of Indian
companies at inflated prices. After this frustrated enthusiasm, a drop in
the market was inevitable.
Another problem has been the breakdown in relations between brokers and the
regulatory body, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). In an
effort to curb excessive speculation, and make the market more transparent,
SEBI banned badla, a method used by brokers to carry shares forward.
Whatever its shortcomings, badla provided liquidity to a market in need.
The macro-economic environment has also deteriorated over the past couple of
months. The budget, at the end of February, revealed an alarming expansion
in the government's fiscal deficit - 7.3 per cent of GDP. Inflation has
risen to more than 10 per cent. The steady fall in interest rates, which
investors had been expecting, no longer looks likely. Worst, the government
seems to be slowing the process of reform in the run-up to elections in some
southern states, due this winter.
For the marketing men of the fund management industry, these developments
have taken some of the fizz out of India, which not so long ago was being
hailed as the emerging market of the decade. But investors should have
guarded against such hype - it is rarely sensible to invest during bull
runs. By the same token, it is often a good time to invest when markets are
depressed.
The main reason for expecting Indian shares to provide a good return remains
as cogent now as it was a few months ago: a huge market is opening in the
country for everything from television programmes to toothpaste, and the
companies that are well placed to meet its demands should prosper.
Moreover, the political risk is minimal for an emerging market. True, the
pace of reform has slowed, but it should pick up at the beginning of the
next electoral cycle. A fund manager with experience of the Indian market,
and not under pressure to invest, ought to do well over two to three years.
The latest India fund on offer to British investors is the first UK-listed
investment trust to specialise in India, writes Bethan Hutton.
The investment of the money raised by the Fleming India Investment Trust
will be handled by the Hong Kong team already responsible for the JF India
fund, a unit trust run by Jardine Fleming, part of the same group as the new
trust's managers, Fleming Investment Management. Jardine Fleming also has a
Bombay office, where 18 analysts carry out on-the-ground research.
Unlike some India funds, this one will not include Pakistan, Bangladesh or
Sri Lanka, partly to simplify the investment rationale, but also to avoid
offending investors of Indian origin who might not want their money to be
invested in other parts of the sub-continent. For investment details, see
page VIII.

FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Redrow upset - New issues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans by Redrow, Britain's biggest private housebuilder, to come to the
market have been upset by the recent stock market jitters which have seen
construction shares underperform the FT-SE-A All-Share Index by 8 per cent
since the end of February.
The company, which earlier this year had been expected to command a market
value of Pounds 350m, revealed on Thursday that it had scaled down its
plans.
Redrow is selling 87m shares at 135p to raise Pounds 117m - giving the group
a market capitalisation of Pounds 298m. Redrow is seeking to raise Pounds
55.4m from the sale of 41m shares while Steve Morgan, its founder and chief
executive, is raising Pounds 62m from the sale of 46m shares, reducing his
stake to 60 per cent.
Previously, Morgan had planned to raise Pounds 100m, reducing his stake to
about 50 per cent. But he decided to reduce the size of the sale following
the recent decline in building shares.
Up to 35 per cent of the shares will be sold to the public, the remainder
placed with institutions. It is the third housebuilder to come to the
market, behind Beazer Homes and Wainhomes both of which have recently been
trading below their issue prices.
Shares should open at a small premium unless the market collapses between
now and dealings starting on May 17.
Hamleys, founded in 1760, is coming to the market in an offer of shares at
185p valuing the self-styled 'finest toy shop in the world' at Pounds 42.3m.
Through the 1980s the company had a chequered history but new management led
by Howard Dyer, chairman, and Stephen Woodbridge, managing director, has
restored its purpose and profits over the past three years.
Operating margins have more than doubled to 17 per cent, boosting operating
profits for the year to January to Pounds 3.6m. That only matched, however,
the 1986 level.
Hamleys is heavily dependent on its flagship store in Regent Street, London.
It attracts 5m visitors a year, of whom 30 per cent buy something. The
company plans to grow the business by opening small outlets in airports and
tourist centres and to open concessions in other retailers.
At 185p, the shares were priced on a notional historic p/e of 17.8, a
discount to the retail sector's 19.
A notional dividend of 4.7p for the year ended January 29 would give a gross
yield of 3.2 per cent - higher than the sector average of approximately 2.8
per cent.

FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Invesco cuts unit charges -
Scheherazade Daneshkhu considers the reason for slicing initial costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors have almost become blase about unit trust discounts but, with the
traditional end-of-tax-year Pep rush over, they will be seeing far fewer of
them as most fund management groups have little reason to continue wooing
investors.
This makes Invesco's announcement that it is cutting the initial charge on
all its unit trusts and Peps to 3 per cent from 5.25 per cent from May 3 all
the more startling. The cut is not a special offer but is part of a new
pricing structure which is here to stay. The annual charge remains unchanged
at 1.5 per cent on most funds.
This is not the first time that a fund management group has cut its initial
charges but Invesco is by far the largest to do so. Lazard pioneered the
move in the UK in 1988 when it abolished the initial charge on all its unit
trusts.
Unfortunately, its initiative did not trigger an avalanche of competition
but instead a very slow trickle. In 1992, Murray Johnstone reduced the
initial charge across the board on its unit trusts to 1 per cent and
Gartmore announced that it was abolishing the charge on one of its unit
trusts - its UK index tracker.
The 'no-load' and 'low-load' fund, collective equity vehicles named with
reference to the size of their initial charge, are common in the US but
still rare in the UK, where the norm is an initial charge of 5 to 6 per
cent.
A low initial charge can make quite a difference to investors. The bid-offer
spread (the difference between buying and selling units) on Invesco's UK
income fund on Thursday was 6.3 per cent - the spread on Lazard's UK income
fund was 1.7 per cent.
That means an investor who put Pounds 100 into the Lazard trust had Pounds
98.30 of his money working for him but only Pounds 93.70 in Invesco's trust.
While the initial charge is important, the annual management fee can make a
larger dent in an investment. Fund management groups with reduced initial
charge make their money on the annual fee and on the increased volume of
business which they hope the move will engender. When Murray Johnstone
reduced its initial fee, it raised its annual management charge from 1 per
cent to 1.5 per cent.
In spite of the importance of charges, even the lowest of these will not
prove much solace to an investor unless the performance is there to deliver
the returns. A discounted initial charge can be a powerful marketing ploy,
so investors must still look at performance figures to see what how valuable
the reduction in charges is going to be.
Invesco is the first to admit that the performance of its funds is not as
good as it would have hoped. Its Japan Smaller companies fund has a very
good track record but most of its UK funds are to be found in the bottom
half rather than the top half of the performance tables.
The poor performance is linked with events in the past few years that the
company would like to put behind it. Last year, Invesco was fined Pounds
750,000 after a two-year investigation by Imro, the self-regulating body for
fund management organisations, for misconduct, including mismanagement of
the Mirror Group pension scheme.
However, earlier this month, Invesco reported sharply improved profits after
a year of worldwide restructuring. It is reducing its unit trusts from 32 to
21 funds, for which it is seeking unitholder approval. This should reduce
its costs.
Alan Wren, managing director of Invesco fund managers, says the company has
introduced a greater level of discipline to track risk and performance more
closely but it will take time before the effect of these is felt in the
performance tables.
These steps include creating an asset allocation group to work independently
of the fund managers; creating a risk control group to limit the volatility
of its funds and introducing tighter monitoring of stock selection.
Investors may prefer to wait to see the effect of these before rushing in
and to hope that Invesco's price move proves catching.

FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The slowdown in the number of directors' share transactions last week has
continued. A better balance now exists between buying and selling.
Largest buy for the week was in Bernard Matthews, the turkey products group.
Since December the share price has risen almost 24 per cent to 96.5p. The
most recent transaction was by Sir Bernard Matthews, who purchased 150,000
shares at 95p. This brings his holding to 5.1m shares  - almost 40 per cent
of total equity.
Castle Communications is involved in the entertainment industry, acquiring
rights for videos, films and music and marketing the product. The shares
have been performing well - rising almost 100 per cent over 12 months.
Terence Shand, the chairman, has just sold 138,589 shares and at the same
time, Jonathan Beecher, commercial director, exercised 57,153 options and
then sold all the ordinaries, also at 280p. Shand's holding is now 600,000.
British Vita, which manufactures and processes polymers, announced its final
results at the beginning of May. They reflect stable but quiet markets in
Europe. The company said that deals by three directors, including Robert
McGee, managing director, Lawrence Lawton, deputy chairman and Francis
Eaton, deputy chief executive, were for personal financial reasons. They
also appeared in the table in March.
Wakebourne used to be known as Maddox and is in computers where its support
side is doing well. The sale of 1m shares by Allen Timpany, the deputy
chairman, was made at 3p a share and leaves him with more than 4.7m shares.

FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: BAT profits cheer - The week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The first-quarter figures from BAT Industries on Wednesday are expected to
show a healthy rise from Pounds 354m pre-tax to about Pounds 385m. In spite
of the much-publicised war on smoking in the US - which BAT defied this week
by buying American Tobacco for Dollars 1bn - its tobacco profits may be
around the same as last year.
The real profits increase will come from insurance, through further recovery
by Eagle Star from its upsets in mortgage indemnity and through real
progress at Allied Dunbar in the UK and Farmers in the US.
Sugar and sweeteners group Tate &amp; Lyle is expected to report a Pounds
10m-Pounds 20m rise in interim profits on Wednesday from Pounds 107.6m to
Pounds 120m-plus. Most of the rise will come from US and Australian
operations.
Improving markets for Staley, its US corn starch business, will have helped
profits, as will recovery in its US sugar businesses, hit last year by
teething troubles at a new desugarisation plant at its cane sugar operation,
and difficult trading conditions for its beet sugar business.
Exchange rates will also aid profits. A rise in the interim dividend is
expected in line with Tate's progressive policy.
Overseas growth, especially in the US, is expected to boost Body Shop
International's final results when they are revealed on Thursday. Pre-tax
profits are likely to rise from Pounds 21.5m to between Pounds 25m and
Pounds 27m, with UK operating profits a little ahead of last time's Pounds
11.2m.
The US should pitch in about Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 2m last year), though this
was affected by the move of the HQ to North Carolina). The dividend should
rise from 1.7p to at least 1.85p.
BP reports its first-quarter results on Thursday. The weak oil price -
Dollars 4 a barrel lower - is likely to be counteracted by benefits from
cost-savings, strong downstream margins in the US, lower interest charges
and a swing back to profits in chemicals. Pre-tax profits will be about
Pounds 250m, against Pounds 231m last time and Pounds 315m in the fourth
quarter.
Thursday should see the revival of Bank of Scotland, whose good reputation
slipped last year when it announced an 11 per cent fall in pre-tax profits.
Pre-tax profits are expected to rise from Pounds 125.3m to Pounds
250m-Pounds 270m, or even as high as Pounds 285m.
Last year's figures included a 45 per cent rise in provisions for bad debts
which, the bank said, reflected the downturn moving north into Scotland,
coupled with a further fall in asset values in the south.
The majority of its business is now in England rather than Scotland.
Apart from the drop in provisions, as a result of a fragile recovery in the
housing market, the bank has also had an opportunity to reap a full year's
benefits from being able to widen its margins in its sizeable mortgage
lending operation.
That widening of margins was an element in raising the bank's interim
pre-tax profits announced last October by 58 per cent to Pounds 117.6m.
In general, the bank has won the reputation of being both less
accident-prone than others, and of running operations efficiently.
The cost-income ratio it reported in the interim results fell to just below
50 per cent, and could fall slightly further, if it is able to expand its
mortgage business.
At the interim results, Bruce Pattullo, chief executive, made it clear that
he expected a further improvement in fee and income commission through
clearing bank branches.
The bank has been one of those identified as considering buying a building
society: this would be one way of accelerating its growth, but the bank will
not want an acquisition that would threaten its efficiency.

FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: A fan of index funds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Bogle, chairman of the Dollars 125bn Vanguard group of funds in the US,
is a fan of index funds. In his book, Bogle on Mutual Funds, (Irwin
Professional Publishing, New York, Dollars 25) he argues that the fees
charged by many mutual funds are too high, particularly since they have
attracted inc- reasingly large sums of money in recent years. By investing
in an index fund you avoid these high charges. Bogle believes history shows
that index funds will consistently do better than individual managers with
comparable objectives.

FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: How to track the best performers -
Beating an index may seem an elementary challenge for a fund manager, but
there are alarmingly few who meet it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trackers aim to deliver the returns on an index through a variety of
methods. In the UK, most tracker funds aim to follow the FT-SE-A All-Share
but there are others which track FT-SE 100 companies, the mid-250 and
smaller companies indices. Most trackers are unit trusts but investment
trusts also offer ways of following an index.
Unit trusts
Compared with other unit trusts, tracker funds have done surprisingly well.
Table 2 shows that in the three years to April 1, the FT-A-All Share index
grew by more than 45 per cent while the average unit trust in the UK equity
general sector, the home of UK trackers, rose by 26.8 per cent. All the
trackers listed easily beat the average and the same holds true for the
trackers with a five-year record.
A tracker holds many advantages for the private investor, not least a
drastic reduction in their choice of 1,500 funds or so, and lower charges.
Table 1 lists the main trackers. With the exception of Gartmore, the initial
charge on most is at the lower end of the industry average of between 5.25
per cent and 6 per cent. Gartmore eliminated its initial charge altogether
in 1992.
More importantly, annual charges are well below the 1.5 per cent which most
unit trust investors expect. Many of the funds' annual charge is a fraction
of this, at 0.5 per cent or less, with some of the James Capel and John
Govett funds at 1 per cent and Norwich Union's international index tracker
at 1.25 per cent. While an initial charge can be made up over time, a high
annual charge is more detrimental to a fund's performance and to an
investor's returns.
But how well do the trackers deliver what they promise? None can match the
index because of their charges - this is clearly illustrated in the one year
performance figures in Table 2 which show the trackers falling further
behind the FT-SE-A All-Share than over three and five year.
Others are simply less good at tracking than others, although fund managers
will come up with various defensive arguments such as only aiming to track
the capital performance of the index.
Some unit trust trackers, notably John Govett, use derivatives such as
futures and options to track the indices. With the exception of its FT-SE
mid-250 fund, which uses shares, this makes its UK funds ineligible for a
personal equity plan holding. Govett also has a range of bull and bear funds
(not listed) which aim to do the opposite of an index and which are best
left to institutions or to experienced investors. Investment trusts
There are only a few investment trusts which track indices in a similar way
to unit trusts. These include Edinburgh Fund Managers' Malvern UK trust,
which tracks the FT-SE-A All Share index. Hoare Govett, has two smaller
companies trusts tracking its own smaller companies index, and Abtrust has a
New Europe investment trust to track the FT-A Europe index.
The costs of investing through an investment trust are those you would
usually pay when buying shares - stamp duty, stockbroker's commission and
the bid/offer spread - but there may also be a small annual management fee.
Malvern, for example, charges an annual fee of 0.25 per cent and the
administrative expenses of the trust, which come off the investment income,
are about 0.4 per cent per annum.
However, John Spiers, of Best Investment, is not an enthusiast: 'Someone who
wants a tracker wants predictability but with an investment trust, you have
the added problem of the discount or premium.' The price of shares in an
investment trust is set by supply and demand and so it does not necessarily
correspond with the asset value of the trust. When the supply of shares
exceeds demand, trust shares tend to trade at a discount to the asset value.
The investment trust sector does have an alternative. Some trusts have
issued loan stock (see Table 3)which has a prior charge on the trust's
assets.
The loan stock is dated but instead of being redeemed at par, it will be
redeemed at the level of the index. There is also a dividend, usually in
line with the All-Share. Nigel Sidebottom, of stockbroker Gerrard Vivian
Gray, says: 'They are a pure tracker because no replication is required -
what matters is that the trust has sufficient funds to repay the loan stock
at redemption.'
The only costs to the holder of the stock are dealing charges; there are no
management fees to dilute performance. The management costs of the trust
itself are borne by ordinary shareholders.
The main danger is poor performance leading to an inability on the part of
the trust to meet its liabilities at redemption. Since holders of loan stock
rank ahead of ordinary shareholders, the trust would have to perform very
poorly to be unable to meet these liabilities, according to Sidebottom.
John Korwin-Szymanowski, of SG Warburg Securities, says there are some
safeguards. Trustees of the loan stock, whose job it is to monitor
performance, can step in to take measures if they think the trust may be in
danger of not meeting its liabilities.
The table shows the main loan stocks which track the FT-SE-A All-Share. To
make comparisons with the index easier, the trusts set the asset value at a
price (in pounds) arrived at by dividing the level of the index by 1000.
Prices of the stock listed are all reassuringly close to that of the index.
Since loan stock can only be bought in a relatively small market, it may
trade at a discount or premium to the index. If you buy stock at a discount
and hold it to redemption, you can expect outperformance of the index
(assuming the loan stock is paid in full). However, a discount can be an
indication of greater risk.

FT  30 APR 94 / Markets: Enterprise bid fails to set stocks aflame - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first Pounds 1bn-plus hostile bid in London for three years, Enterprise
Oil's offer of Pounds 1.45bn for Lasmo on Thursday, has done little to shake
the market out of its fixation with US interest rates.
This obsession is growing tedious. As the chart shows, gilt-edged yields and
the yield on the Footsie have been slavishly following the yield on the US
long bond this year.
The point was emphasised this week when the Footsie managed to rise on
Wednesday, the day Wall Street was closed for former president Nixon's
funeral, and again on Thursday morning, but reversed that afternoon when
Wall Street reopened weaker.
The fear that has coupled the markets together is that the UK economy will
follow the pattern of that in the US. There economic recovery is expected to
lead to inflation and yet higher interest rates.
There are several arguments against this. First, the US is hardly suffering
rampant inflation or oppressive interest rates as yet. And the suggestion
from the US this week was that economic growth is settling down, while
interest rates have only returned to a 'normal' level having been
artificially low.
In the UK the economic recovery is lagging behind the US. And while there
are some signs of inflationary pressures beginning to build once more, they
are only faint. The CBI quarterly survey said this week that there were no
signs of overheating.
SG Warburg Securities, which changed its base rate assumptions this week, is
fairly typical in believing that UK interest rates still have another  1/4
point to fall, to 5 per cent, though probably not until the summer, and are
unlikely to begin rising until 1995.
These issues will, no doubt, be batted back and forth between the Chancellor
of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England when they meet on
Wednesday to discuss interest rate policy.
The local elections on Thursday may figure in the talks too, although even
the Chancellor cannot think that an interest rate cut on Wednesday
afternoon, say, would reverse the expected poor performance by the
Conservative party, nor that the markets would believe such a cut was
anything other than politically motivated.
Another topic for them will be the impact on pay packets and the economy of
this month's tax increases, which monthly-paid workers are beginning to
feel.
This bears on one market trend spotted by Richard Jeffrey, equity strategist
at Charterhouse Tilney. He points out that from 1965 until 1992 the consumer
sectors of the market substantially outperformed the manufacturing sectors,
as Britain's industrial base declined.
But over the last 15 months the position has reversed. Consumer stocks have
been out of favour while manufacturing shares have risen. He puts this down
to better prospects for industry as sterling's fall has made companies more
competitive abroad, and the prospect for margin growth higher than for
consumer sectors.
The latter, after years of expansion, face overcapacity in sectors such as
supermarkets and pubs. But Jeffrey says the switch might have gone too far
the other way, with the historic p / e on the manufacturers almost twice
that of the consumer sectors.
While the markets are focusing on US interest rates, the message from the
corporate sector this week has been that now is the time to buy. The list of
deals, aside from the spat in the oil sector, is remarkably long, and
follows the Lloyds Bank / Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester and Inchcape / Hogg deals
of the previous week.
Highlights of this week's list were BAT Industries' Dollars 1bn (Pounds
670m) purchase of American Tobacco from American Brands; Compass Group's
Pounds 308m acquisition of Canteen Corporation, also in the US; Williams
Holdings' Pounds 64m buy of a continental European business from Solvay;
Airtours' Pounds 74m purchase of Scandinavian Airline System's leisure
business and acquisition of a cruise ship; and Hobson's Pounds 111m takeover
of the Co-operative Wholesale Society's own label food manufacturing
business.
There are similarities between the deals. Most are UK companies buying a
business abroad. Most are purchases of subsidiaries, not aggressive bids for
whole companies. And most have been financed by share issues. Williams went
further, raising more than it needed through a Pounds 267m rights to give
itself the cash to do more deals.
The number of acquisitions suggests that there must be more to come, if only
because it would be a coincidence for all the deals being worked on to be
completed at once.
But while takeovers are generally a bull point for shares, what the equity
market needs is some big cash bids for UK companies. This would put some
money back into the market to fuel demand, rather than adding to investors'
liquidity problems through increasing the supply of new shares.
The trend of rights issues has another worrying aspect to it. It suggests
that issuers think their shares highly rated and want to take advantage of
an overpriced currency.
Flotations continue to suck money in too, with TeleWest, the cable
communications group, looking to raise Pounds 300m or so in its float.
However, Steve Morgan, founder and chief executive of Redrow, the
housebuilder, decided that the price he could get for his shares in a float
was not high enough and cut the number he aims to sell.
Meanwhile the trend in corporate profit news has been mixed. Associated
British Foods managed to increase operating profits by a creditable 13 per
cent in spite of the squeeze from its customers, and Imperial Chemical
Industries raised first quarter profits by 31 per cent, on a volume gain of
2 per cent and no price rises. But British Gas warned on Thursday of
declining profits as increasing competition and regulation bites.

FT  30 APR 94 / Markets: The hidden risks of life insurance - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The good news is that life insurance salesmen are finally being compelled to
tell the customer most of what he needs to know. The bad news is that
several popular types of life insurance policies are getting steadily less
rewarding. Saving through inflexible life insurance contracts has long lost
its outstanding tax advantage. And new user-friendly tax havens - notably
Personal Equity Plans - have been created. So the arguments in favour of
saving through life insurance are getting rather thin on the ground.
The disclosure requirements (discussed on page VII) look remarkably sensible
to the innocent eye. Life insurance salesmen will have to tell you in
English how a life policy, personal pension or endowment mortgage works;
they will have to give you an approximate estimate of what you might get out
of it - both if you cash it in early and in the long term, and they will
have to tell you how much of your investment is mopped up in commission and
other expenses. There is even an explicit warning that if you cash in your
policy early, you may get back less than you have paid over.
Nothing remotely controversial in any of this, you might think. But the
insurance establishment has been fighting the proposals every inch of the
way. Its argument is that, once consumers are told the costs, some companies
(notably insurers who are part of a bank) will look much better bets than
others, and that fewer people will buy life insurance. Fair enough - as far
as self-interest is concerned. But the insurers then make the amazing mental
leap of saying that what is bad for the insurance industry is bad for the
consumer.
Why? Because the consumer cannot be trusted to put his own financial affairs
in order. So even a humdrum investment in an insurance policy with high
costs is better than no investment. And high costs are inevitable because
the consumer is so blind to his own interests that he will not buy without
some fairly forceful arm-twisting from the salesman. How lucky he is that
the insurance industry is prepared to play Nanny.
Does the insurance industry's record support its claim that it can be
trusted to look after you?
Many customers have already been shocked to discover that insurance bonuses
 -like share prices - can go down as well as up. Cuts in with-profit life
insurance and pension payouts have damaged the retirement prospects of many
older people. And worries about low-cost endowment policies failing to cover
mortgage commitments dog the younger generation.
Now comes a discussion paper* suggesting both that there are more payout
cuts to come, and that the way the insurance companies have handed out money
in the past has been downright irresponsible.
Start with the payout record. In the high inflation 1970s and early 1980s,
the real return on with-profit policies (ones whose returns are indirectly
linked to the stockmarket) was negative. But by the end of the 1980s, real
returns on some policies reached 10 per cent - outstandingly good. The
reason the insurers could be so generous was simple. The companies had in
their paternal fashion been cooking the books. Throughout the 1980s payouts
rose strongly, but they still lagged well behind the rise in the value of
the underlying investments. In other words, people cashing in their policies
in the early 1980s were being short-changed, because some of their profits
were held back for the benefit of other policyholders.
You cannot perhaps fault the insurance companies for being cautious. But
they then went to the other extreme. The value of the underlying investments
had started falling well before the end of the 1980s in some cases. But
insurance payouts continued to rise, partly because of 'the need to
demonstrate that with-profits still offers value for money in the face of
unit-linked products'. And even when the first payout cuts came through in
the early 1990s, they were far smaller than they would have been if related
directly to the fall in underlying assets.
This is not quite as imprudent as it may sound. The companies have always
practised 'profit smoothing', and they used some of the profits not paid out
in the 1980s to bolster payments in the early 1990s.
Profit smoothing is in some ways comparable to an industrial company paying
a short-earned dividend out of reserves. But there are crucial differences.
First, the fact that a dividend is not covered by profits is obvious to any
reasonably numerate investor. Second, dividend smoothing can be defended as
being in the interests of longer-term investors. Smoothing insurance profits
out between different generations of policyholders is robbing Peter to pay
Paul.
The problem is not going to go away. Like all spendthrifts, the insurance
companies are running through what's left in their smoothing accounts. True,
another burst of abnormal stockmarket growth could come to the companies'
rescue, but this seems unlikely. So insurance payouts are likely to be cut
further.
And these are the companies who are saying 'Trust me, I'm an actuary.'
With Profits Maturity Payouts, Asset Shares and Smoothing, recently
presented to the Faculty of Actuaries.

FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Hostile bid for Lasmo - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil launched a Pounds 1.45bn hostile takeover bid for rival
explorer Lasmo yesterday. If successful, the offer would bring together the
UK's two largest independent oil and gas explorers into a single group
valued at more than Pounds 3bn.
The offer is the largest hostile bid in the UK since BTR's Pounds 1.47bn
offer for Hawker Siddeley in 1991. If the bid succeeds the enlarged company
would rank fourth among North Sea explorers, after British Petroleum, Shell
and Exxon.
Lasmo attacked the bid as a contrived paper offer which would dilute
significant growth potential for shareholders.

FT  30 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Unit trust sales reach new monthly
record - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unit trust sales reached a new record of Pounds 1.37bn in March, more than
Pounds 200m above the previous best month, September 1987, when net sales
were Pounds 1.16bn.
Strong sales of unit trust personal equity plans were an important factor in
the record sales. Peps, which shield investments from capital gains and
income tax, accounted for about three quarters of total net sales to private
investors in the first three months of the year.
Pep sales are normally strong in the closing weeks of the tax year (which
ended on April 5). And this year sales were also spurred by fresh price
competition among companies selling unit trust Peps. Price competition is
now spreading to other unit trusts as well as those wrapped in a Pep. (See
Invesco, Page V)

FT  30 APR 94 / Markets: Low-key, derivative approach - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gerrard &amp; National has a slight image problem.
In spite of the constant television appearances of Professor Tim Congdon and
Brian Reading, who head its Lombard Street Research subsidiary, the group's
public profile is very low key. More importantly, most people in the City
who think of it at all think of it as a discount house, one of the City's
more arcane and venerable institutions.
Yet last year almost half its profits came from its GNI Holdings subsidiary,
a leading light in the new and exciting world of derivatives. Probably
Europe's biggest broker in futures, options and other derivative products,
GNI must be one of the City's fastest growing businesses.
Since 1985 GNI has increased its profits by an average of 45 per cent a
year, jumping 75 per cent to Pounds 12.5m in the 12 months to January 31.
In contrast, profits from the discount house Gerrard &amp; National Limited,
were just Pounds 2.6m in the year to April 5, or barely 10 per cent of the
group total. Admittedly, it was a difficult year for discount houses which
are traders in short-term money market instruments and tend to do well when
interest rates are falling. The previous year, which included the aftermath
of the UK's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism, the discount house
made Pounds 8.2m.
Discount houses should be able to damp this volatility with the use of
derivatives but, in common with its rivals, Gerrard &amp; National's strategy
has been to reduce the discount house's importance within the group by
expanding into businesses driven by fees and commissions.
In 1982 it formed a joint venture with a private client commodity broker in
order to participate in the London International Financial Futures Exchange
which opened in September that year.
Both Liffe and GNI have been extremely successful. Much of GNI's growth has
matched the underlying growth in derivatives markets, but GNI has also
expanded into other fields and brokes products traded on the London oil,
commodities and metal exchanges and international commodity exchanges.
Since 1985 GNI's profits have increased from Pounds 600,000 to last year's
Pounds 12.5m and the group expects strong growth to continue, particularly
in fund management. Institutional investors are making increasing use of
derivatives and GNI now has more than Pounds 234m of funds under management,
up almost tenfold in three years.
Gerrard &amp; National has fund management activities elsewhere in the group,
notably in its stockbroking arm, Gerrard Vivian Gray, which manages about
Pounds 2bn, and the desire to create a more integrated approach to fund
management was one motive behind last week's acquisition of the 32.4 per
cent minority shareholding in GNI.
In sheer financial terms it also looked a good deal. The group offered
shares valued at Pounds 34.7m for the minority which represents only 13.5
times GNI's earnings last year. And GNI has continued to grow so fast that
the prospective multiple may be in single figures. Although Gerrard's own
shares are on a low earnings multiple, that means the deal will not dilute
its earnings this year and should enhance them thereafter.
The group also announced it was pulling out of gilt-edged market-making,
where it has lost money recently, though remaining in gilts trading, where
it has been profitable.
Last week's figures, showing profits of Pounds 25m (Pounds 25.2m),
represented a milestone for the group which for the first time paid for its
dividends from the profits of its broking division alone.
Having increased every year since 1969, dividends were edged up to 22p
(21.5p) paid out of group earnings of 34.7p (38p).
Because of the volatility of discount house earnings, the City has
traditionally valued their shares on the basis of their yield alone. But
given the transformation of the group in recent years, the yield of 6 per
cent on Gerrard &amp; National shares suggests its image is lagging well behind
events.

FT  30 APR 94 / Markets: Ask a weatherman how the wind blows - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a long, cruel winter, New York was more than ready for the baking hot
sunshine that arrived suddenly last Sunday. There was almost a carnival
atmosphere as the city basked in the parks, gardens and sidewalk cafes.
People were filled with such optimism that when they returned to their
offices on Monday morning, they ploughed their money into shares, sending
the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 57 points - one of its biggest
single-day increases this year.
Absurd? Of course. But how else to explain Wall Street's behaviour when it
flew in the face of everything that had gone before?
All last week, the message had seemed clear. The market was obsessed by the
fear of inflation - or more precisely, the fear that the Federal Reserve
would push up interest rates to prevent it. The week had begun with another
tightening of the monetary screw by the Fed, and investors believed the
higher cost of borrowing would increase businesses' debt costs and
eventually feed through into slower economic growth.
Company after company reported big increases in profits for the quarter to
March, only to be slapped in the face with heavy selling of its shares.
Corporate profitability apparently counted for nothing. Investors were more
concerned about the gloom-laden prognosis for further interest rate
increases.
Nothing of significance had changed over the weekend: so anyone who had been
around the week before would have been baffled by the explanation offered by
analysts for Monday's rise. It was down to strong corporate results, they
said, in particular from DuPont, the chemicals group, and Boeing, the
aircraft manufacturer.
Never mind that DuPont and Boeing are almost the epitome of cyclical stocks,
supposedly the least favoured in the current climate; nor that the main
reason for DuPont's earnings growth was cost-cutting, not rising demand; nor
that Boeing actually made a whopping loss, albeit not quite as whopping as
feared. Suddenly, company results were moving the market again.
The flow of good corporate news continued on Tuesday. Walt Disney increased
after-tax profits by 16 per cent; the Capital Cities/ABC entertainment group
virtually doubled net income; and tobacco stocks were given a boost when
Britain's BAT Industries made an agreed Dollars 1bn cash offer for American
Tobacco, a subsidiary of American Brands.
So the market soared again, right? Well, no, actually. Instead, it fell more
than 6 points during the day to close back below the 3700 level. 'Er . . .
ah] . . . profit-taking]' the analysts said, unconvincingly.
Clearly, what Wall Street needed was a sense of direction. Perhaps Wednesday
would have provided it. Unfortunately, we will never know, because US
financial markets closed for the funeral of former president Richard Nixon.
The grumbling could be heard from one end of the street to the other. Never
mind that Nixon was the only US president ever to have resigned in disgrace.
More important, he was only the third president since the Dow Jones
Industrial Average was invented in 1897 to have left office with the index
lower than when he came in. Moreover, when William Howard Taft and Herbert
Hoover (the other two) died, the stock market only closed for half a day.
Grumbling aside, Wednesday evening had been marked by a particularly violent
thunderstorm over New York, so the weather pointed towards a turbulent day's
trading on Thursday. And sure enough, that is just what Wall Street
delivered. Bond prices plummeted when figures for the first quarter's gross
domestic product came out, because although they showed a
lower-than-expected growth rate of 2.6 per cent, the inflation indicators in
the figures pointed towards acceleration.
Stocks followed bonds down, depressed once again by the bigger economic
picture. Interestingly their 31-point fall was not as great as the
plummeting bond market might have indicated. In early trading yesterday,
stock prices rose while bond prices fell. Could this week's events have
marked a de-coupling between stock and bond prices - the start of a period
in which the share index might be driven more by fundamentals than mood?
As to the answer, it is anybody's guess. If it is any help, the weather
forecast for New York next week is changeable.
Meanwhile, the quote of the week award goes to Christopher Madell of Chicago
Capital Markets, who told the New York Times: 'Part of the problem I have
with this market is that people always gather round at the end of the day
and say 'Now why did I do what I just did?''
So do we, Mr Madell; so do we.
Monday     3705.78  +  57.10
Tuesday    3699.54  -   6.24
Wednesday   Closed
Thursday   3668.31  -  31.23

FT  30 APR 94 / Long View: Expensive promises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bournemouth's renowned Golden Mile of deposit-taking building society
branches may need to prepare for leaner times. The country may become less
ready to support pensioners in the style to which they think they should be
accustomed.
Certainly, times are bad for the personal pensions industry, which staggers
under the impact of the misselling scandals, and faces yet another inquiry
by the Securities and Investments Board, this time into the advice given to
people who opted out of occupational schemes.
Yet the occupational schemes themselves are becoming nervous about their
long-term position. This week the National Association of Pension Funds
announced that it was sponsoring an independent 18-month inquiry into the
long-term adequacy of incomes in retirement, apparently in an attempt to
wrestle the troubled pensions agenda away from the bungling politicians.
For many years retirement incomes have been provided in the UK through a
compromise between the public and private sectors. But the government is
determined that state provision will dwindle: the basic state pension is
already worth only 21 per cent of the average wage, and being linked to
prices rather than earnings, it will steadily shrink further in importance.
 -perhaps to 10 per cent within 30 years. The state earnings-related scheme,
Serps, is meanwhile threatened by adverse demographic trends in the early
part of the 21st century.
However, the government's strategy to head off this future crisis by
diverting people into personal pension plans, which have in fact been bought
by some 6m people, has run into a whirlpool of misselling, excessive costs
and disappointed expectations.
The occupational schemes look comfortable and prosperous by comparison,
fattened up as they have been by three years of high investment returns. But
their membership coverage has never been much more than about half the
working population and they may be about to shrink quite significantly.
The whole concept of a paternalistic, lifelong savings plan run by the
employer is looking increasingly out of date in an insecure age of high
mobility and part-time working. Moreover the government is picking off the
technical dodges that made company schemes relatively cheap and attractive
to run.
For instance, the deferred pensions of leavers can no longer be frozen
regardless of inflation, a legislative change which has raised transfer
values sharply. The 'cap' on qualifying salaries, now Pounds 76,800, will
progressively reduce the ability of the highly-paid bosses to raid the
company funds when awarding themselves big, pensionable salary rises late in
their careers.
The company funds are agonising over the approach of a minimum solvency
standard. Until now companies have been able to adopt a high risk, high
return investment strategy, sharply reducing their contribution rates, but
posing the possibility that in a stock market crisis there might not be
enough in the pot to meet claims. A government white paper, due this summer,
is likely to argue that in the wake of the Maxwell scandals, and to permit a
compensation scheme to be introduced, companies must provide better backing
for worst case conditions.
In the circumstances, the dominant type of occupational scheme, in which
benefits are defined in terms of pay on leaving or at retirement, is coming
under threat. Such schemes effectively depend upon a promise by the
employer; this minimum solvency crisis is brewing because companies will at
last be required to back up that promise ultimately with hard cash rather
than with a pension fund invested in relatively speculative and volatile
assets.
An opinion survey published this week by the pensions actuaries R Watson has
suggested that half of the leading UK companies believe that they will be
offering much more flexible pensions packages in 10 years. The final
salary-linked element will be scaled down, and perhaps revised to a revalued
career average basis. More of the investment risks will be shifted to the
employees by scaling back the extent of the pensions promise and giving them
direct stakes in the funds. Old schemes will be closed to new members and
replacement plans introduced.
This is already happening in the US where direct investment plans,
originally designed to supplement the defined benefit plans, are beginning
to replace them. In the UK the future may lie in expanded mechanisms for
additional voluntary contributions, the add-on savings plans designed to
enable people to top up their pensions, rather than with basic schemes.
Why should employers be involved anyway? You would think that specialist
savings institutions should be able to provide pensions more efficiently,
but it is expensive for them to reach ordinary individuals. The traditional
paternalist argument, that people will not save for their old age unless
pressurised to do so, still holds good.
In this area, however, the drift of the government towards means-tested
benefits is worrying. This applies not just to the cut in the real value of
the basic state pension but also to the switch of long-term health care of
the elderly from the National Health Service (free) to the social security
budget (means-tested). Universal handouts may seem wasteful but, if this
switch goes too far, people earning around average incomes, and perhaps
above, may conclude that saving for their old age will leave them no better
off than those who live the life of Riley.
Bournemouth is under no immediate threat. It is probably unwise to worry
about possible future demographic imbalances which will generate their own
solutions: people will work a few years longer, and many will be perfectly
happy to do so. The recent government proposal to raise the women's state
pension retirement age to 65 has generated very little protest.
But the pensions industry is getting ready for changes.

FT  30 APR 94 / DRUGS: Nicholas Woodsworth stumbles into the world of
international trafficking in Bolivia and meets two people whose lives it has
wrecked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not often in the peregrinations of a travel writer that, independent
of his own will, events simply walk up and take over. If a bag of mine
containing documents and money had not been snatched within a day of my
arrival in Bolivia, I might have wandered blithely on my way and ended up
with a different tale to tell - a rural idyll, perhaps, of precarious and
bumpy Andean bus rides, Indian villages and irascible llamas.
As it was, events decided their own peculiar course, and I return with two
decidedly less idyllic stories from Bolivia's cocaine wars. One is intimate,
and concerns the private life of a young Bolivian woman drawn unwittingly
into the shady world of international drug trafficking and enforcement. The
other is public, and involves an increasingly violent contest between
American-trained para-military patrols and machete-swinging coca-growers in
the jungles of lowland Bolivia. Together, they have shown me more of the
bumps and precariousness of life in Bolivia than a dozen Andean bus rides.
Even to the casual wanderer, Bolivia is an odd kind of place. Flying into La
Paz is like falling into the bright, illustrated pages of a Tintin story -
suddenly everything becomes a gross Latin American caricature of itself.
At least so it seemed to me. In wrap-around sunglasses and Brilliantined
hair, the customs man at the airport could not have looked dodgier if he had
tried. On the way into town the taxi driver's short-change trick was more
blatant than taxi drivers' tricks elsewhere. The city's street kids looked
more ragged and snot-nosed than other street kids. Bolivian army officers
wore higher-peaked hats, broader pasteboard epaulettes and more yards of
gold braid than officers in other third-world armies.
And everywhere, under strange little bowler hats and ear-flapped toques,
were the dark, stolid faces of Bolivia's Indians, as impassive and
unchanging as the surrounding Andean peaks. The whole city, shimmering in
thin, clear air 12,000 feet above sea level, seemed to me slightly fevered
and unreal, a South America we dream.
What would you do, in such a place, if you suddenly found yourself bereft of
papers and money the day after you arrived? One moment I was contentedly
eating lunch in a crowded terrace restaurant. The next, my bag snatched from
the chair beside me, I was a man without an identity. With no more than a
dozen words of Spanish, I did what I imagine most people would. I panicked.
I threw myself on the mercies of the only English speaker I knew - the
newly-hired receptionist at the small pension where I was staying - and
pleaded for help.
There are better ways, perhaps, of meeting attractive young women in odd
corners of Latin America. But in retrospect it seems to me appropriate that
I should have met Maria del Carmen Lopez de Shaw in a moment of high emotion
and crisis - it is the stuff of which her own life appears principally to be
made.
Looking back, I have tried to make sense of Carmen's confusing world of
deception, intrigue and violence. I cannot. Her life seems as extravagant
and fanciful as her name. Was her smooth-talking husband, Peter Shaw,
telling me the truth about his dual life as narco-trafficker and undercover
agent for the British and US governments? Perhaps he was; what absorbs me in
the end is not individual facts but the disarray the drugs trade brings to
entire lives, and ultimately, to entire countries.
The wiring of emergency funds, the replacement of credit cards, the purchase
of traveller's cheques, the making of police reports - such tasks are
dreadful even in the west. In Bolivia, without Carmen's skilled
intercession, they would have been a nightmare.
In each office we visited she knew just who to brow-beat, who to sweet-talk,
who to hurry along with small - I shall not call them bribes - remunerative
incentives. She was not even daunted by the awful Criminalistica, a warren
of foul-smelling hallways where queues of La Paz's victimised poor inch
forward in the dim hope of attaining justice. Watching Carmen jockeying an
investigating officer into taking my statement, I was full of admiration for
this surprising and self-confident young woman.
But in the taxi on our way to place a newspaper reward for my passport,
Carmen suddenly grew serious.
'Would you mind if we made a detour?' she said. 'I decided this morning to
leave my husband - I am afraid of him - and your little problem has delayed
me. I must get my children before he comes home.'
La Paz is one of the few cities in the world where the normal preferences of
the rich are reversed: they live snugly in La Paz's valley bottom and have
abandoned the city's spectacular heights - and its bone-chilling Andean
winds - to the poor. High up the steep valleyside we wound to Vino Tinto, a
poor area of scavenging dogs and wandering drunks and jerry-built houses of
rough brick and adobe.
I was perplexed. Carmen's home did not match the image I had of the bright,
enterprising, go-ahead person who was helping to pull me out of a mess.
There was just one room with four iron-framed beds ranged along a wall.
Three small children, almost as dark-skinned as Carmen, played on the floor
at the feet of an elderly grey-haired woman. In one corner, under a naked
light bulb, were a small cooking ring and tub of dish-water. There was a
toilet down the stairs. The whole place was pinched and poor and hopeless.
Carmen saw my gaze. 'It's complicated,' she said with a tired shake of her
head. 'It's been like this for years. I've had enough. Perhaps tomorrow I
will explain.' We bundled Carmen's children and mother into the taxi. They
took a room at the pension.
That evening Carmen made a call from the lobby telephone. I could not help
listening. She was seeking advice on the possibility of having her husband,
Peter Shaw, arrested and deported from Bolivia on the grounds of illegal
entry. In the end she was persuaded not to call Interpol - it was Friday, a
day the police needed money for weekend entertainment, and Shaw might have
bought his way out of prison. I did not sleep well, but lay awake wondering
what it was all about, and what Carmen was afraid of.
                          *      *      *
The following day brought more Bolivian strangeness. There was a call from a
prisoner in La Paz's San Pedro jail; a friend on the outside, he said, had
brought my papers to him. We could meet him in the prison with the Dollars
100 reward announced in the paper.
Carmen did not like it - she suspected some sort of set-up. Instead she sent
a Bolivian friend, more street-wise than I, to investigate. No sooner had he
left than a second call - a genuine one this time, came in. My discarded bag
 -cash gone but all documents intact - had been found. Off we rushed to the
ghastly San Pedro to rescue Carmen's friend, and my money, from a certainly
unpleasant fate.
To celebrate, we went that evening to Juliano's, a smart Italian place
opposite the offices of an international agency I had never heard of before,
the United Nations Drug Control Programme. Again I was struck by the
contrast between Carmen's familiar ease in this sophisticated place and her
slum life in Vino Tinto.
Carmen's manner, though, grew less easy as dinner progressed and she tried
to explain her life. It came out tearfully, a ragged and disjointed series
of episodes revolving around the extraordinary career of the man she was now
hoping to see the last of.
Peter Shaw was over 50 when Carmen, not yet in her 20s, met him in a cafe in
the Bolivian lowland city of Santa Cruz. She had just returned from 10 years
in Brazil, where in the last few years she had done everything from
modelling to real estate management. But jobs in Bolivia were hard to find.
Shaw was a commercial pilot, personable, good-looking, with plenty of money.
He offered her security and a chance in life. They married.
But Shaw, it turned out, was no ordinary pilot. He had spent most of his
life ferrying illegal drug consignments around the world - hashish from
Afghanistan, heroin from Pakistan, cocaine from Latin America. At the same
time, though, in a deal worked out in 1982 while serving a sentence in a
British prison, he agreed to work covertly for the US Drug Enforcement
Agency. Later he undertook a similar agreement with British Customs' drugs
intelligence authorities. Their children notwithstanding, his marriage to
Carmen was part of an elaborate cover for a complex but profitable life of
dealing and double-dealing.
At first Carmen could only make guesses about his business during the year
they spent in five-star hotels in Rio de Janeiro; about Shaw's irregular
flights between Brazil and Bolivia; about the suitcases that disappeared
from their hotel rooms as mysteriously as they arrived; and about Shaw's
association with Ronnie Biggs, the great train robber she had never heard of
before but who, given her husband's growing antipathy and secretiveness,
became her confidant.
But by 1991 there was no hiding the fact that things had gone badly wrong.
Based back in Santa Cruz now, Shaw became increasingly paranoid. He
repeatedly accused Carmen of informing on him, and more than once threatened
her violently with weapons. Then came the day when he appeared, his ankle
broken after a rooftop chase across the city, saying men were trying to kill
him.
And the money stopped coming. Shaw, it seemed, had been dumped by both his
drug-dealing associates and his government employers. Without resources, in
early 1992 he asked the British embassy for repatriation for himself and his
family. It was granted, and then at the last minute refused by the Foreign
Office. Shaw, said Carmen, believes there is a deliberate attempt to maroon
him in Bolivia - for the last two years they have been living in penury,
dependent for their survival on church charity.
Carmen moved her family into my hotel. We took the children to amusement
parks, on day trips to Lake Titicaca. We dined out, went dancing, took
walks; the more Carmen talked the more I found myself engrossed by these
strange lives. Finally, I asked to meet Peter Shaw. It was not difficult -
he had been shadowing Carmen for days.
I liked Shaw: there was little of the arch-criminal about his intelligent,
sociable manner. But the story of his demise, even in the the bright sun of
the hotel courtyard where we sat, was chilling.
Things had gone wrong, he said, when he was contracted by the DEA to set up
a 'sting', luring two of America's most-wanted drugs smugglers into a deal
to purchase 300kg of Bolivian cocaine. Such entrapment operations are
illegal under both US and British law; nonetheless, Shaw claims, they are
often undertaken using criminals like himself as operatives. He says he
spent all the money he had setting the sting up, counting on reimbursement
later.
But he told me that, at the same time, he himself became the victim of a
50kg entrapment operation set up by one of his own contacts, also a drugs
trafficker, under pressure from British officials. Shaw believes they had
learned too much about his own private drugs dealings to want to continue
employing him.
How had they learned this, I asked. Shaw is convinced that former friend
Ronnie Biggs has become an important police informer, is in constant touch
with British drugs intelligence officers, and used his friendship with
Carmen to collect information on him.
Shaw suspected his contact of a double cross, and after having arranged the
transport of drugs from Bolivia to Sao Paulo, refused to pick it up for him.
The operation having turned sour, he says, British drugs intelligence agents
were afraid that he might go public on illegal British sting operations and
their valuable underworld information source, Ronnie Biggs. Not only did
British authorities persuade the Americans to break their contract with him
on the grounds he was using DEA cover for his own private operations, but,
he alleges, they also tried to kill him.
Peter Shaw says his life, and that of Carmen's, is still in danger from the
powerful drug dealers he set up under DEA direction. All he dreams of now is
getting enough money to travel to the US, where he wants financial
restitution for his broken DEA contract, and a new identity under the
Witness Protection Program. He wants Carmen in the witness box with him.
Carmen can think of nothing worse.
Such is the confusion and complexity of lives I stumbled across in Bolivia.
There are countless others in this country where the shady business of
cocaine is more profitable than all other export businesses combined.
But I remembered the UN Drug Control Programme Offices I had noticed from
Juliano's. I had seen part of the little picture. Now I wanted to see
something of the big one. Two days later, I was headed to the steamy lowland
jungles of Chapare, primary production centre of the Bolivian cocaine trade.

FT  30 APR 94 / Major urges Tories to sink their differences for EU poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday sought to cover the latest cracks in the
Conservative party over Europe by pledging to promote the cause of
'Euro-realism' in the run-up to the June elections for the Strasbourg
parliament.
His attempt to rebuild a facade of unity between the party's enthusiasts and
sceptics was accompanied by a renewed warning from Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, that the party could not go back on its historic
commitment to Europe.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, meanwhile accused
the party's sceptics of 'undermining the prime minister' and damaging the
Conservatives' chances in next week's local elections. He said party workers
would be appalled at the behaviour of some Tory MPs.
In a clear message to those on the Tory right at Westminster who have
suggested Britain could disengage from the European Union, Mr Hurd said that
talk of withdrawal was 'out of touch with reality'. He told a Conservative
meeting in Plymouth: 'Our party took Britain into the European Community in
the 1970s. Anybody seeking to reverse that decision now is out of touch with
reality, and with all the questions of politics and security which western
Europe will have to tackle in the years ahead.'
Mr Major offered the same message on a local election tour in Bury when he
underlined the economic and security interests tying Britain to the EU.
But refusing to be labelled either a Europhile or a Europhobe, Mr Major
stressed that a commitment to a leading role for Britain in the EU did not
mean accepting every suggestion or plan from Brussels. Instead Britain would
argue the case for Euro-realism.
As both men laid out a strategy designed to unite all but the most extreme
anti-Europeans, Mr Hurd stressed also that the Conservatives were the only
party opposed to a centralised federal Europe.
Mr Hurd, dismissing suggestions that Mr Major had sought to appease the Tory
right by giving the election manifesto a more sceptical tone, suggested that
90 per cent of the Tory party would offer whole-hearted support for the
government's platform.
Trailing the party's manifesto for the June campaign, Mr Hurd said its
belief in a free trading, decentralised, outward-looking Europe was
reflected increasingly in the mood in the rest of the EU.
He said the Liberal Democrats, the main threat to the Conservatives in
south-west England, were, like the Labour party, wedded to the Brussels
centralism which would lead to a European superstate.
But ministers acknowledged that the attempt by Tory Euro-sceptics to seize
the initiative threatened a constant series of potential upsets in a
campaign which could be critical to Mr Major's future as prime minister.

FT  30 APR 94 / Norwich Union fined Pounds 300,000: Regulator says insurer's
failures had risks for likely customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norwich Union, one of Britain's biggest insurers, yesterday became the
second company in three days to receive a Pounds 300,000 fine from Lautro,
the life insurance industry watchdog.
The fine was imposed for breakdowns in management control relating
particularly to the implementation of higher training and competence
standards.
The regulator was also concerned about recruitment procedures and 'fact
finds' - the checking of information gathered by sales agents about
customers. It said the failures 'had risks for potential customers'.
A month ago, Norwich Union said it was suspending 800 sales agents -
including its entire life and pensions direct sales force - so they could be
retrained.
The insurer said yesterday that 53 per cent of the sales representatives
taking the training programme had passed all three elements to the test and
had returned to selling from Monday of this week. Those who have failed but
pass at a later attempt will be back on the road by the end of next month.
While the fine equals the current record - a similar penalty was levied on
Premium Life on Wednesday - Lautro could well impose even higher amounts in
the coming weeks. It has warned for some time that companies that had failed
to correct inadequacies in meeting regulatory requirements by the time of a
second round of routine inspection visits could expect more severe
penalties, and these are now materialising.
Indeed, Lautro's recognition that Norwich Union responded 'swiftly and
effectively' in carrying out remedial action will have been taken into
account by the watchdog's disciplinary committee in setting the fine.
The insurer admitted the charge of misconduct, and will also have to pay
Lautro's costs of Pounds 25,000.
Mr Allen Bridgewater, group chief executive, insisted that in general
customers should not have been put at a disadvantage. 'Our business quality
control processes check that customers have received appropriate advice. For
that reason there should be few, if any, cases where unsuitable advice has
been given'. He added that NU would pay full compensation in any such case.
The misconduct was in NU's investment business carried on by its 600 direct
sales agents and some 200 appointed representatives between January 1992 and
November last year. The charge did not affect Norwich Union's business
through independent financial advisers and Leeds Permanent Building Society.

FT  30 APR 94 / S African parties hit at 'flaws' in election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa will wait anxiously most of this weekend for the results of the
general election, widely acknowledged to have been flawed, after thousands
of last-minute voters in the country's former tribal homelands cast their
votes to end the historic four-day exercise.
All the main parties have seized on mismanagement and irregularities in
procedures to prepare the ground for challenging the results, although their
officials acknowledge that rejecting the outcome could destabilise the
country.
Election officials yesterday said first results could be available by this
afternoon at the earliest, but a clear picture of the outcome is unlikely
before tomorrow.
Two areas in particular, both highly susceptible to party political
pressure, could be critical in determining both the result and the extent to
which it will be regarded as free and fair.
Millions of voters in the rural areas of northern Natal, a stronghold of
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party, and in the Transkei and
Ciskei, fiefdoms of Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, were due
to vote yesterday. But election observers privately expressed concern that
many more voting papers had been issued than there were voters. They were
also worried about the lack of security arrangements at polling stations.
ANC leaders yesterday repeated allegations that Inkatha had been involved in
fraud and said it had presented a list of complaints to the Independent
Electoral Commission. But Mr Justice Johann Kriegler, the head of the
commission, shrugged off accusations of incompetence and maladministration.

FT  30 APR 94 / The Lex Column: British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Giordano, the new British Gas chairman, certainly knows how to
put the skids under his own share price. A profits warning at the group's
annual general meeting knocked 5 per cent off Gas's shares on Thursday,
though they recovered 2 per cent yesterday. Mr Giordano's prediction that
profits this year will be lower than last year is real enough: the
continuing price cap on its domestic gas business and further loss of market
share in the contract market will see to that.
Mr Giordano also scared the market by saying he could not comment on
dividend prospects until the company's regulatory framework was more
settled. In particular, he made much of the danger that rivals might cherry
pick Gas's most attractive customers when its domestic monopoly is abolished
in 1996. Mr Giordano is certainly right to press his case so long as the
government continues to dither over when to publish its consultation
document on what the rules for the new competitive market should be.
Both Ofgas and the government believe competition should be introduced in an
even-handed fashion. Moreover, Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas's formidable
director-general, has threatened to publish the document herself if
ministers are still dithering after next Thursday's local elections. If
suggestions about what the document contains are accurate, Gas's shares
could be due for a bounce.

FT  30 APR 94 / The Lex Column: European chemicals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
First quarter figures this week from four of Europe's chemicals giants -
including ICI - reinforce the impression that the cycle has turned. That
will be comforting for the investors who chased the sector higher. Bayer,
BASF and Hoechst have outpaced the German market by 10 per cent this year,
matching the share price performance of ICI. But while all four companies
reported higher volume sales, bulk chemicals prices remain stubbornly low.
Until that changes the big gains in profitability will have to be postponed.
The current recession has been unusual in that chemicals prices collapsed -
often by more than half from the peak of the late 1980s - even though demand
remained respectable. Companies' eagerness to defend market share and the
generally low inflation environment may be to blame. The worry is that the
same factors could keep prices low. Chemicals prices have barely budged in
the US despite two years of rising volumes and capacity utilisation rates
which are in many cases over 90 per cent.
Since bulk chemicals are increasingly traded between continents, low prices
in Europe may be to blame. But without some pick-up soon, companies could be
squeezed. First quarter profits were helped by low oil prices, which kept
input prices down and widened margins. If the oil price turns before
petrochemicals markets are ready, companies may face a double-dip in profits
rather than a steady improvement.

FT  30 APR 94 / The Lex Column: UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Suddenly corporate finance business seems to be picking up. It is not just
the Enterprise bid for Lasmo. This week has seem a spate of rights issues to
finance acquisitions from Williams, Airtours and Compass, to name but three.
The prospect of more activity to offset slower trading income has perked up
the merchant banks: SG Warburg rose 3 per cent this week, Schroders 6 per
cent. Normally it might be expected to liven up the market as a whole. This
time, things look slightly different.
There is not much sign of bank-financed bids which bring cash into the
market. Enterprise's offer for Lasmo is an all paper deal with a warrant
element, which effectively means Lasmo's holders are themselves being
invited to put up cash for the privilege of a change in ownership. The
rights issues have usually been designed to fund trade purchases outside the
market.
Perhaps companies no longer regard such assets as expensive, which means
equity market valuations ought to be reasonable too. A more likely
explanation for the sudden burst of rights activity is that companies do not
believe capital will become much cheaper. That would make it largely
opportunistic. This downbeat view is reinforced by the latest Confederation
of British Industry survey, which showed business reluctant to invest in
increasing capacity and therefore volume. A predilection for bolt-on
acquisitions suggests companies prefer to seek growth instead by buying
market share. That does not bode well - either for the recovery or for the
equity market.

FT  30 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Fed up with the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the problem in the foreign exchange markets has been the dollar's
relationship to the yen, it is surprising that the Federal Reserve's initial
intervention yesterday involved the sale of D-marks. Part of the reason must
be the fear that a chaotic period of generalised weakness would ensue if the
dollar breached the Y100 level. That would deter overseas investors from
bidding in the Treasury's looming bond auctions. Part must be a politically
inspired reluctance to single Japan out for help at a time when bilateral
trade tensions remain unresolved. Congress would surely bridle to see the US
bargaining position on trade weakened in this way. The Fed has been discreet
about intervention carried out on behalf of the Bank of Japan earlier in the
week.
The trouble with such a subtle approach is that it can easily appear
half-hearted. At least Mr Lloyd Bentsen's remarks yesterday suggested that
the US Treasury has got the message. In the case of Japan he is right that
too much exchange market volatility would impair growth. A dollar in free
fall below Y100 would cripple its industry to the point where economic
recovery would be undermined.
The Clinton administration may have to be more explicit about its desire not
to allow trade tensions to spill over into the exchange market, though.
While negotiations are paralysed by Japan's political problems, some will
always expect the US to exert pressure via the exchange rate. Nor is it as
if the dollar has much fundamental strength behind it. Interest rates are
rising, but the currency is weighed down by a large current account deficit
and investment outflows. The Y100 mark may be tested again.

FT  30 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ignores bond market
weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks moved ahead yesterday as investors shrugged off further weakness
in the bond market and focused on a fresh batch of economic news, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.38 higher at 3,681.69 while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.89 better at 450.99 in brisk
activity.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite made scant progress, up
0.99 at 439.91, while the Nasdaq composite improved 2.15 to 733.84.
Cyclical stocks, which led the Dow industrials in retreat during the
previous session, enjoyed a modest rebound. Caterpillar was Dollars 1 ahead
at Dollars 109 7/8 , International Paper put on Dollars 1 to Dollars 65 1/4
, and Exxon gained Dollars 1 as well, to close at Dollars 62 7/8 .
The session brought plenty of evidence to indicate the economy remained on a
sound footing, allowing the market to quell the uneasiness triggered by
Thursday's ambiguous data on growth in the first quarter.
The Commerce Department said that personal income in March increased 0.6 per
cent, while personal spending was up 0.4 per cent. Both figures matched
expectations.
The data's suggestion of improving confidence was reinforced by the
University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment, which climbed to 92.6,
from March's reading of 91.5.
The bond market, meanwhile, continued to slide, with the day's data doing
nothing to shore up the market.
To add to its woes, the dollar was down sharply against other currencies,
making the US-denominated securities less attractive to overseas buyers.
Near midday, however, the Federal Reserve directly intervened in the foreign
exchange markets to prop up the value of the US currency. Bonds, in turn,
steadied, showing a moderate decline at the session's close.
The partial turnround provided extra support for an upturn in stocks, but
investors had to be satisfied with modest improvement. Few the Dow
industrials were showing substantial gains, or losses, going into the final
hours of trading.
But transport stocks surged for a second day running, following a tentative
agreement to end a national truckers' strike. Consolidated Freightways was
up Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 27 1/2 .
The flood of corporate earnings buffeting stocks this week slowed to a
trickle yesterday. Ford jumped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 58 3/8 . Investors
were encouraged by its earnings of Dollars 1.66 a share, against Dollars
1.02 a year earlier.
Elsewhere in the industry, General Motors was unchanged at Dollars 56 3/4
but Chrysler was marked down Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 47 7/8 .
Scientific-Atlanta also benefited from a strong first quarter. The
cable-television supplier surged Dollars 4 3/8 , or 14 per cent, to Dollars
32 1/4 after posting net income of 31 cents a share, up from 18 cents.
Blockbuster Entertainment gained Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 27 1/8 amid
speculation that Disney or one of the regional US telephone companies would
bid against Viacom to take over the company.
IMC Fertilizer shed Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 37 after an offering of 4m new
shares, to be used to reduce debt, was priced at that level.
Canada
Toronto ended little changed in moderate trading. The TSE 300 index slipped
3.66 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 4,267.12. On the week, the index was up
about 100 points.
Declines edged advances 387 to 363, volume of 55.06m shares was above
Thursday's 48.62m shares, and trading value was CDollars 529.0m compared
with CDollars 637.6m.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo ended up 2.8 per cent in narrow margins on a
featureless day.
The Bovespa index rose 357 points to 17,084 in turnover of CR219bn (Dollars
168m). In Rio de Janeiro the ISENN ended up 2.1 per cent at 64,994.
Brazilian prices retreated 20.9 per cent during April. They were chiefly hit
by higher US interest rates and doubts over the government's anti-inflation
plan.

FT  30 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong off 2.5% as
region corrects
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The overnight decline in the US triggered a downward correction among most
of the region's markets.
Tokyo was closed yesterday as the Golden Week holiday began. The market will
re-open on Monday, but will then remain closed until Friday.
HONG KONG lost 2.15 per cent as the Hang Seng index closed below the 9,000
level on selling triggered by Wall Street's overnight drop and concerns over
a possible domestic interest rate rise.
The Hang Seng fell 197.02 to 8,966.07, 2.1 per cent down on the week;
turnover stayed thin at a preliminary HKDollars 3.11bn, up from HKDollars
3.02bn.
The Hong Kong Association of Banks met after the market closed and decided
not to change interest rates, which have not risen after the US Fed Funds
rate quarter point rise on April 18.
Talk that a major south-east Asian institution had cut its rating on Hong
Kong and sold a basket of blue-chip counters led to further falls.
Properties and conglomerates led the declines, with Cheung Kong down
HKDollars 1.25 at HKDollars 36.50, SHK Properties HKDollars 1.25 at
HKDollars 46.50, Hutchison HKDollars 1.25 at HKDollars 31.70 and Swire A
HKDollars 2 at HKDollars 55.50.
AUSTRALIA fell only slightly in contrast to other markets in the region as
many investors preferred to remain on the sidelines. The All Ordinaries
index lost 3.0 to 2,066.1, up 1 per cent on the week.
Turnover was ADollars 752.34m. News Corp went against the trend, advancing
25 cents to ADollars 9.68 ahead of results due next week which are expected
to show a 20 per cent rise in earnings.
The gold index rose 5.2 to 2,186.2, boosted by a 50 cent gain in Great
Central Mines, closing at ADollars 10.00, following a positive quarterly
report which was released on Thursday.
Among the banks, ANZ dropped 7 cents to ADollars 4.71, Commonwealth was down
9 cents at ADollars 8.23 and Westpac slipped 2 cents to ADollars 4.74.
SINGAPORE followed US stock and bond markets lower, but its fall was limited
by interest in quality bank stocks and selected property issues  - the
latter after early falls as investors realised that a new government land
sale scheme would have little impact on property values. The Straits Times
Industrial index eased 8.45 to 2,296.19, up 1.4 per cent.
KUALA LUMPUR saw further volatility in Technology Resources Industries as
the composite index eased 0.84 to 1,054.50, up 1.4 per cent on the week,
after a low of 1,043.12.
TRI fell to a low of MDollars 10.70 on a less buoyant than expected earnings
forecast, before closing 20 cents up on the day at MDollars 11.50.
SEOUL fell as institutional investors took profits. The composite index shed
9.25 to 900.14, having seen a session high of 923.15, for a week's rise of
1.7 per cent.
Turnover was Won1,100bn.
TAIWAN lost 2.7 per cent on profit-taking particularly in the pulp and
textile sectors.
The weighted index shed 158.74 to 5,729.12, off 1.8 per cent on the week.
The paper and pulp index dropped 5.5 per cent after the sector's previous
sharp gains on higher product prices.
NEW ZEALAND weakened in response to a rise in domestic interest rates, in
volume described as 'very light'.
The NZSE-40 capital index fell 17.6 to 2,110.2, up almost 1 per cent over
the week.
BANGKOK's coalition government failed to win enough votes to pass
constitutional amendments, and the SET index fell 4.47 to 1,266, for a
week's loss of 2 per cent. Turnover was thin at Bt4.5bn.
BOMBAY improved slightly on hopes of a relaxation in the ban on forward
trading which was imposed last month.
The BSE index rose 14.98 to 3,755.38, but turnover dipped to Rp200m from the
recent daily average of Rp1bn.
Brokers said that they expected the Securities and Exchange Board to
announce a relaxation in the trading curbs on Monday.
COLOMBO recorded its sharpest-ever one day fall. Brokers blamed growing
political and economic uncertainty as the CSE all-share index dropped 47.34,
or 4.3 per cent to 1,050.85 with some blue chips sustaining double digit
declines.
Political uncertainty became a factor after a stunning opposition victory in
a local government election on March 24 in which the ruling United National
Party lost a key poll after 17 years.

FT  30 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Cinderellas of Europe nudged into
limelight - Prospects for electrical utilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's electricity utilities, for years the public sector Cinderellas of
the industrial sector, have found themselves nudged into the limelight since
the mid-1980s by a succession of generously priced privatisations.
Last year they held centre stage as investors, initially attracted by their
potential for solid earnings growth during an economic downturn, saw their
share prices outperform in rising equity markets.
Kleinwort Benson calculates that, during 1993, power utilities across Europe
rewarded investors with an average total return of 72 per cent, their best
performance over the last four years. They also outperformed their domestic
markets by an average of 19 per cent.
The year's star performer was Motor-Colombus in Switzerland, whose share
price rocketed by 219 per cent as the company pulled back from moves to
diversify its business begun in 1990, and underwent a restructuring to
refocus on electricity.
While many observers expect the sector to continue its outperformance this
year, as interest rates continue to decline, results are unlikely to those
of 1993.
Mr Adam Dickens at James Capel says that the broker's own utilities sector
index, 60 per cent of which is made by electrical utilities, has
outperformed the JC European index by 1.5 per cent since the start of the
year, helped by evidence that the cyclical sides of the diversified
utilities are starting to show significant recovery.
Mr John Willis at Kleinwort Benson, who sees little in the way of regulatory
action from the European Commission to disturb the companies' progress this
year, expects the sector to report average earnings growth of 20 per cent in
1994. Financial charges will fall, he says, although determining the exact
bottom line impact is complicated by the companies' debt structure.
'The core utility business will benefit from lower interest rates as
industrial production begins to rise. This leads to higher energy sales
volumes. In addition, those utilities with cyclical businesses should also
benefit from an improving economic picture,' he says.
Miss Isabelle Hayen at Lehman Brothers does not expect to see the same
momentum in share price movements during 1994 because the magnitude of bond
yield reductions is likely to be much less than in 1993. She also says that
the earnings momentum of cyclical stocks is expected to accelerate in the
current year, making it difficult for the utilities to remain so relatively
attractive.
Nevertheless, Miss Hayen sees structural changes afoot in the European
electricity industry which, she says, will shape the future environment in
which the supply companies operate.
Since the latter part of the 1980s, she says, there has been a growing
movement to introduce more competition, which continues to gain momentum.
Competitive pressures are also growing as result of the concerted efforts of
the European Commision and from consumers who are becoming more vocal about
the need to be placed competitively in the global markets, including access
to cheap energy.
She notes that the industry, itself, is also becoming more competitive.
Utilities in mature and more competitive markets are finding it harder to
increase their earnings and are therefore looking to diversify
internationally. In addition, the trend is also influenced through the
increasing willingness of other countries to open up their electricity
markets to foreign investors.
Finally, Miss Hayen says, privatisation not only increases the relative
importance of the electrical supply industry in market capitalisation terms,
but it also offers investors an opportunity to invest in large companies
which can be viewed as proxies for their domestic markets. 'Even more
appealing is the potential opportunity to invest in companies which may
stand to benefit enormously from operational and financial rationalisation.'
On a pan-European view, Mr Willis expects further outperformance from
Austria's EVN, which, he says, is likely to gain from any liberalisation in
the domestic electricity market.
This could be an unsettling year for RWE, Veba and Viag, Germany's big three
power utilities, he says, as the nuclear debate rolls on, frustrating the
companies' plans to establish a long term generation plan. The companies
face an inquiry by the Federal Cartel Office into the validity of the
present concession arrangements while at the same time, the three have
embarked on a massive capital expenditure programme in eastern Germany,
estimated by the Association of Germany Electricity Producers to total
DM60bn between 1993 and 1997.
In Italy, the new government will have to decide whether to go ahead with
the privatisation of Enel later in the year, while the Spanish electricity
industry, which will see a further 10 per cent of Endesa privatised this
year, should benefit from higher demand, interest rate cuts, a more stable
peseta, and a tariff increase.
Mr Willis sees the UK electricity sector continuing to be supported by the
twin pressures of low interest rates and lack of dividend growth in the
market generally. He forecasts dividend growth for the generating companies
to average 15 to 17 per cent, with 14 to 15 per cent for the distribution
companies.

FT  30 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourse sentiment mixed after
positive April
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Sentiment was mixed as bourses came to the end of a positive month, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT came out of April with a 5.3 per cent gain. Mr Eckhard Frahm, of
Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, said that this has been the year of the
cyclicals, with BMW, Volkswagen, Hoechst, MAN and Mannesmann taking five of
the top six places among Dax constituents during the first four months. He
added that the profile of engineers like MAN and Mannesmann had been raised
by the Hanover Fair in the latter part of the month.
The worst Dax performers this year, Metallgesellschaft, Dresdner Bank and
RWE, all had scare stories attached to them: oil contract losses in the US;
the Schneider property debacle; and worries about the Biblis nuclear power
plant.
On the session, the Dax was off 5.24 at 2,245.98, up 1.4 per cent on the
week; in the post-bourse, it rose to 2,252.51. Turnover fell from DM9.2bn to
DM9.1bn.
PARIS turned higher and the CAC-40 index finished up 15.71 at 2,165.96, a
week's improvement of 1.4 per cent.
Club Mediterranee, the leisure group, showed one of the steepest declines on
the session, the shares dipping FFr31.20 or 7 per cent to FFr414.00 after a
disappointing shareholders meeting.
In contrast, CarnaudMetalbox rose FFr8.70 to FFr183 after reporting that
first quarter sales had grown by nearly 5 per cent.
AMSTERDAM drifted lower again, the AEX index losing 2.75 to 413.06 on the
day, and 1.4 per cent on the week.
The market was in a holding phase ahead of next Tuesday's general election.
While it was likely that there might be significant changes in the
composition of the parliament, Hoare Govett commented that in the medium
term the elections would prove to be a non-event for the Dutch financial
markets since, whoever led the next government, there was unlikely to be a
radical change in economic policy.
Unilever eased Fl 3.90 to Fl 207.10 in response to news that it had
initiated legal action against Procter &amp; Gamble after the latter had alleged
that one of its new washing powders rotted clothing.
MILAN took more profits after the post election advance, the Comit index
edging 8.79 lower to 799.47, still 2.8 per cent higher on the week.
Olivetti fell L26 to L2,972, as it announced higher orders and sales this
year. Cir, the industrial holding company which has been finding favour with
foreign investors, gave up L65 to L2,797.
Insurers, hoping for higher premiums and the introduction of private
pensions under the new government, featured a L761 or 5.2 per cent advance
to L15,280 by Fondiaria, which has recently lagged behind the sector.
ZURICH extended its losses, weighed by US bonds and futures related selling
which hit heavily weighted index stocks most. The blue chip SMI index fell
32.6 to 2,736.3 , convincingly below the 2,780 support level, while the
broadly based SPI index lost 18.67 at 1,781.13. The SMI index fell 1.8 per
cent on the week.
UBS fell SFr10 to SFr1,176, on a first quarter in line with expectations. CS
Holding which raised its 1993 dividend to SFr18 from SFr15, held its loss to
SFr2 at SFr604.
MADRID followed Wall Street with the general index up 1.64 to 325.22 for a 2
per cent gain on the week; but the oil refiner, Cepsa, put up a 11.1 per
cent rise on the day, Pta300 higher at Pta3,000 after a huge rise in first
quarter profits.
In banks, Banesto stayed hopeful with a further rise of Pta50 to Pta1,125 up
44 per cent on a momentous week.
STOCKHOLM was lifted to a higher close by Astra, SKr9 better at SKr158 after
Thursday's weakness, on worries about possible side-effects from its Losec
anti-ulcer drug, brought out positive comments from analysts. The
Affarsvarlden general index closed 5.90 higher at 1,483.40, 1.5 per cent up
on the week.
ISTANBUL staged an intraday recovery, but still closed 4.6 per cent lower
after the authorities banned eight brokerage houses from trading. The
composite index closed 729.64 lower at 15,096.68 after 14,715.49, down 18.3
per cent on the week.

FT  30 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Midland sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Newly-floated newspaper group Midland Independent Newspapers was among the
most actively traded stocks as one of its backers sold an 8 per cent stake
in the company.
The seller is believed to be the Italian arm of a venture capital group
which had bought shares at 140p at the time of the March flotation.
Yesterday, it turned a 23 per cent profit placing 11.6m shares in the market
at 172p a share via the company's broker, James Capel, which then sold them
on to two institutions at 173p a share. Midland shares rose a half penny to
176 1/2 p on turnover of 23m.
RJB Mining was also among the most heavily traded stocks as two investment
funds sold stakes worth a total of Pounds 50m. Schroder Venture Managers
sold 25.81 per cent or 11.73m shares and Charterhouse Capital sold 6 per
cent or 2.7m stakes in the company. BZW the company's broker placed the
shares with institutional investors. The shares eased a penny to 364p.
The investment strategies of the cash generative stores groups were
highlighted by one leading broker finding in favour of Boots and Great
Universal Stores and recommending positive dividend policies to soak up the
companies' cash mountains. GUS - steady at 601p yesterday - has been the
subject of much market speculation in recent weeks over how it intends to
use its Pounds 1.5bn of cash, with market gossip focusing on a possible
share buy-back. Boots put on 3 1/2 to 547 1/2 p. But Marks and Spencer
slipped 2 1/2 to 438 1/2 p.
The two big share losers in the leisure sector this week - Airtours and
Compass Group - both staged rallies yesterday as bargain-hunters moved in.
Holiday group Airtours bounced 5 to 429p, still only slightly denting its
net fall this week of 55. The steep decline was prompted by the purchase of
SAS Leisure, a Scandinavian holiday group, for Pounds 74m to be funded
largely by a rights issue. Compass gained 7 to 315p, making its fall since
talk of its Pounds 300m US deal and rights issue came into the market two
weeks ago, a net 44.
Big turnover in Rank Organisation came as a big buy order begun on Wednesday
was finally wound up, according to dealers. Rank shares added a penny to
430p on final volume of 8.1m.
Food and detergent giant Unilever recovered ground after it announced that
it was to sue its rival Proctor &amp; Gamble over remarks allegedly made against
the former's new soap powder. The shares ended the session 8 1/2 adrift at
1072 1/2 p, after 1065p.
Royal Bank of Scotland bounced 9 to 402p as investors switched funds from
elsewhere in the sector ahead of the Scottish bank's interim figures on May
11. There had been speculation earlier in the day that RBoS was poised to
buy the National &amp; Provincial Building Society but the rumours were
dismissed by analysts.
Big dollar earner HSBC tumbled 22 to 706p in response to the weakness of the
US currency.
Paper and packaging stocks rose sharply in response to a newspaper article
which cited increases in North American and European newsprint groups and
lifted hopes that prices and margins were improving. Arjo Wiggins Appleton
gained 7 to 315p and Bowater rose 8 to 460p.
Weak gilts and continuing negative sentiment over regulatory issues kept the
water and electricity utilities under a cloud, although the late afternoon
gilt rally produced a small bounce.
Among the Recs, Midlands slid 19 to 568p, Southern 11 1/2 to 570 1/2 p and
Eastern 15 to 578p. The generators, under less regulatory threat, held up,
with National Power off 4 at 428p and PowerGen 2 1/2 at 481 1/2 p.
Mobile telecoms group Vodafone continued its recovery following worries,
considered overdone by many in the market, over the threat of competition.
The shares added 5 to 544p. But both competition and regulatory concerns
were said to be again overhanging BT as the fully-paid shares hit their
lowest point of the year and the lowest level since October 1993, down 8 at
368 1/2 p on 6.4m traded. The partly-paid retreated 7 to 251p.
A profits warning from Canadian Pizza sent the shares retreating 46 to 120p.
The company, which supplies products to outlets such as Sainsbury, blamed
lower sales.
In the drinks sector, sentiment was boosted by the clearing of two major
deals, Allied Lyons' Pounds 700m merger with Domecq of Spain and Guinness'
restructuring of its shareholding in French group LVMH. Allied shares added
a penny to 587p, Guinness 3 to 480p and other spirits giant Grand
Metropolitan chipped in with a rise of 7 to 476p.
Car dealer Lex Retail Group moved ahead 3 to 545p after announcing a 17 per
cent increase in new car registrations in the first quarter.

FT  30 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs stocks in demand
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading pharmaceuticals stocks, which tend to be big dollar earners, ignored
yesterday's shock slide in the US currency and powered forward with the help
of technical and fundamental support. The move fuelled hope that one of the
most heavily depressed sectors in the market has turned the corner; over the
past year the pharmaceuticals sector has underperformed the FT-A All Share
Index by nearly 25 per cent.
The technical push came partly from New York where the US pharmaceuticals
sector has been gaining ground as investors switch into defensive stocks. It
also came to SmithKline Beecham, the sector's best performer, after a bought
deal in the morning left marketmakers short of stock. The squeeze on the
share price sent SmithKline up 14 1/2 to 389 1/2 p in the 'A's and 14 to
356p in the Units. Finally, dealers said that overweight UK institutions had
now adjusted their portfolios and the recent selling pressure had dried up.
The corporate relief centred on Glaxo as analysts digested the company's
legal suit against Ciba Geigy. They decided that Ciba's assault on Glaxo's
patent for Zantac, the world's top selling drug, looked less solid than
before. The shares rose 7 1/2 to 576 1/2 . Wellcome improved 9 to 524p.

FT  30 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLARE GASCOIGNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A purchase of 500 Footsie futures contracts minutes before the close of
trading enlivened an otherwise quiet day in derivatives, writes Clare
Gascoigne.
The trade, pushed the June future to 3,155, although it fell back to 3,139
in after-hours dealing. There was speculation that it was linked to an
over-the-counter option expiring next week.
June opened down 12 at 3,109, and drifted to a low of 3,096 with a very weak
bond market and the release of US economic data. A gentle rally took it back
to around 3,134 before the final trade.

FT  30 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market picks up in the wake of
gilts rally - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Transatlantic influences remained the dominant factor affecting London's
stock market which lost ground in the wake of another choppy performance by
UK gilt-edged stocks, before staging a good rally in line with US bonds.
The latter responded immediately to news of intervention by the US Federal
Reserve in global currency markets, stemming an earlier steep decline in the
dollar and earlier weakness in US Treasury bonds.
The US authorities' intervention saw longer-dated gilts, which fell around
3/4 at the outset of trading, rally strongly behind an improving US bond
market and a firmer Dow Jones Average to end a busy session a net  3/16
higher as the market closed.
At the close of what had been expected to be a subdued session, the FT-SE
100 index posted a 4.6 fall at 3,125.3. Over the first week of the first of
a three-week account which takes in the May Day Bank Holiday, the index has
recorded a fall of 8.4.
The late rally in the FT-SE 100 stocks failed to carry over into the second
line stocks which closed around the day's lowest levels, as measured by the
FT-SE Mid 250 index which settled 16.3 off at 3,781.1.
Turnover was regarded as disappointing, at the second lowest this week at
574.9m shares with non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounting for 632 per cent of the
total.
It was a sharp retreat by US bonds overnight, in response to worrying
inflationary pressure in the US and a disappointing response by
international investors to the auction of US Treasury bonds that triggered a
big slide in overnight US markets and induced the opening weakness in gilts
as the London market began trading.
Trading in the equity market got off to a very slow start, affected by the
losses across European equity and bond markets and reflecting thin
attendance around the City as many dealers began their extended Bank Holiday
break.
The FT-SE 100 kicked off almost 12 points lower, in very quiet trading but
then staged a rally, partly, dealers said, in the wake of a modest buy
programme and a temporary rally in gilts which drove the 100 index briefly
into plus territory and to the session's high point of 3,130.0 in
mid-morning.
But with gilts slipping back and the market beginning to worry about renewed
weakness in US markets, the FT-SE began to fall away, eventually hitting a
session low of 3,105.6, down 24.3 shortly after Wall Street opened. The
subsequent Fed intervention produced big rallies in markets across the
globe.
Apart from the Fed intervention there was some big action in the FT-SE
future where one very big buyer, rumoured to have represented a big US
institution, moved into the market during the late afternoon and onwards to
the close.
Dealers were disappointed at the market's performance over the week, given
the emergence of the much rumoured takeover bid for Lasmo. The frantic
activity in Lasmo shares and options over recent sessions was much reduced
yesterday but traders remain convinced that a counter to Enterprise's
all-paper offer for the UK exploration company may yet appear.
The bank sector provided one of the day's big features in Royal Bank of
Scotland whose shares made rapid progress early in the session amid reports
 -quickly denied by the bank - that RBOS was about to follow Lloyds in
acquiring a big UK building society.

FT  30 APR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar wobbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Federal Reserve yesterday took the unusual step of intervening in the
markets to stop the dollar from falling through previous lows, writes Philip
Gawith.
After repeated bouts of intervention, the US currency was trading in the
evening at Y102 and DM1.6640 after touching intra-day lows of Y100.55 and
DM1.6430.
The Fed first bought dollars for D-Marks at DM1.6590 per dollar, and then
later at DM1.6585 and DM1.66. It bought dollars for yen at Y101.45-101.50
and again at Y101.90.
The last time the Fed intervened, at the behest of the Treasury, to support
the dollar was on August 17 last year when the dollar fell to Y100.30.
Elsewhere, comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president,
suggesting that German interest rates might fall faster than anticipated,
led to frenzied trading in Euromark futures.
The Fed's intervention was confirmed by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury
secretary, who commented: 'US monetary authorities intervened today in
foreign exchange markets to counter disorderly conditions. This is in line
with our previously articulated policy which recognises that excessive
volatility is counterproductive to growth. We stand ready to continue to
cooperate in foreign exchange markets.'
Intervention by the Fed overshadowed positive US data, which the market
ignored. March single family home sales rose by 11.1 per cent, the biggest
jump in six months. The purchasing management association of Chicago said
its business barometer rose to 67.6 per cent in April from 66.5.
Analysts were sceptical about whether the Fed's activities offered the
dollar more than a temporary respite. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at
Citibank, commented; 'It is round one to the Fed, but unless it is sustained
and a lot heavier, I think markets will again test the previous lows of the
dollar.'
He said that so long as US/Japan trade talks remained stalled and Japan
experienced political paralysis, 'the US administration will not be averse
to a stronger yen.'
The D-Mark had a mixed performance in Europe yesterday. It was slightly
weaker against the French franc, which closed at FFr3.427 from FFr3.429. It
closed slightly higher at L959 from L958.3 against the Italian lira.
Mr Tietmeyer's comments, delivered in a magazine interview, led to a frenzy
of afternoon activity on the futures markets. Mr Richard Phillips, analyst
at brokers GNI, said the bullish tone of the Bundesbank president's comments
had encouraged a lot of investors to start taking long positions again.
'People got very bulled up on the prospect of a rate cut,' said Mr Phillips.
Trade was heavy with the June contract trading nearly 52,000 lots. The
future closed at 94.92, 13 basis points up on Thursday's close.
The Bank of England yesterday injected Pounds 824m into the UK money markets
after forecasting an Pounds 800m shortage. Market conditions were easy with

FT  30 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Stocks
fall aids copper advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange copper market stepped up a gear at the end of the
week to break out of its recent constricted trading range. And most other
LME contracts followed the upward move.
Bullish chart patterns and signs of renewed nearby supply tightness had
encouraged a resurgence of the speculative buying that lifted copper prices
to 8 1/2 -month peaks in the middle of March, dealers explained as the price
climbed to a 4-week high yesterday morning.
Added impetus was given by another fall in LME warehouse stocks of the
metal, which now stand at the lowest level since last July and are 23 per
cent below the 16-year high reached in January.
Resistance at Dollars 1,930 a tonne for three months delivery had been
broken in after hours trading on Thursday evening. The rise stalled
yesterday at Dollars 1,956 and the price closed at Dollars 1,952.50, up
Dollars 23 on the day and Dollars 38.75 on the week. But dealers still
thought an assault on the recent high of Dollars 1,973 a tonne was possible
after the bank holiday. 'It looks like a good solid technical move,' one
told the Reuter news agency.
Other base metal prices were drawn higher in copper's wake, notably lead and
nickel. The former extended its gain on the week to Dollars 19.75 at Dollars
469.50 a tonne for three months delivery. But traders thought strong
resistance was likely frustrate any early attempt to regain the Dollars
500-plus levels seen a few months ago.
Three months nickel put on another Dollars 137.50 yesterday, taking its rise
on the week to Dollars 285 at Dollars 5,592.50 a tonne. This latest advance
was aided by the announcement of a sharp fall in LME stocks.
Aluminium was able to restablish itself above Dollars 1,300 a tonne for
three months delivery - closing yesterday at Dollars 1,306.75, up Dollars
22.25 overall. But zinc, while staging a substantial rally, remained below
the Dollars 960-a-tonne resistance level.
Precious metals also finished well into the plus columns. Gains in the gold
market encouraged by US dollar weakness and a rise in the CRB index, an
inflation indicator, prompted covering by players who had sold the metal
short earlier in the week as fears of widespread South African election
violence receded, dealers explained.
The London price closed yesterday at Dollars 376.10 a troy ounce, up Dollars
6.60 from a week earlier.
Speculative interest also revived in the silver market, with cash metal
closing in London at Dollars 5.19 1/2 an ounce, up 12 cents on the week.
'It's got a bit more potential than gold,' said one dealer. 'It could be
aiming at Dollars 5.35.' But most doubted that it could build sufficient
momentum for a renewed attempt on the Dollars 6 mark in the near future.
At the London Commodity Exchange May delivery coffee futures yesterday
chalked up a fresh 5-year high of Dollars 1,575 a tonne, driven by renewed
interest from US investment funds. The price closed at Dollars 1,563, up
Dollars 42 on the day and Dollars 90 overall, helped by continuing concern
about nearby supply tightness.
News in mid-week that the arabica indicator price for the coffee producers'
export retention scheme had passed the point at which retention would be
halted appeared to be shrugged off by traders. They had similarly ignored
Monday's news that the robusta indicator, which had already passed the
trigger for retention to be suspended, had risen above the level at which
releases from retention stocks could begin.

FT  30 APR 94 / International Company News: The US wakes up to a new aroma -
Frank McGurty charts the expansion of a coffee shop chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arabian mocha with a 'pungent' aroma and 'fragrant, light-bodied' Mexican
altura are as different as night and day, according to the helpful 'barista'
serving coffee at Starbucks.
It was uncertain how many of the customers crowded into the gleaming
Manhattan coffee bar on its first day of business last week could actually
tell them apart, even after the barman's coaching.
What is clear is that many Americans are finally waking up to the pleasures
of fine 'arabica' coffee, thanks to Starbucks, the Seattle-based chain now
pushing into New York and Boston.
The company's expansion has been as robust as a potful of Sumatra Boengie.
From 11 shops and 100 employees in 1987, Starbucks has grown into the
leading retailer and roaster of specialty coffee in North America, inspiring
fierce loyalty in each new market it enters.
By any measure, Starbucks is one of the most successful new small companies
in the US. Its empire, which includes 317 shops and a mail-order business,
has generated revenue growth of at least 62 per cent over the last three
fiscal years. Net income tripled from 1991 to 1992, and doubled last year.
In its latest quarter, to April 3, the company's net sales rose 69 per cent
to Dollars 57m and net profit 51 per cent to Dollars 1.9m, or 7 cents a
share. On an operating basis, earnings were 91 per cent ahead at Dollars
3.4m.
The improvement reflects more than just expansion. In stores opened at least
a year, sales growth has exceeded 19 per cent over the past five years. It
recently slowed to about 9 per cent, but that compares well with the 2 per
cent gain last year by the average McDonald's restaurant opened at least 12
months.
In June 1992, the company went public at Dollars 8 1/2 a share, adjusted for
a two-for-one split in September. Yesterday, a week after Starbucks cut the
ribbon to open its flagship New York store, the stock was trading at just
under Dollars 30.
While its record is impressive, the potential of the company, as it begins a
long-awaited drive into the big markets of north-east, is still largely
untapped. Mr Christopher Vroom, an analyst with Alex Brown &amp; Sons in
Baltimore, believes sales could exceed Dollars 1bn by the end of the decade.
One reason is that Starbucks sits on top of a market which is booming. The
Specialty Coffee Association expects US sales of pricey arabica coffees, as
opposed to cheaper robusta varieties, to double to Dollars 3bn between 1989
and 1999.
'If this was a 28-chapter book, we are probably at chapter three or four,'
says Mr Howard Schultz, the charismatic chairman and chief executive.
Yesterday he told institutional investors in Boston that customer response
to new shops was exceeding expectations. His ambition is to open 6,000
coffee shops in the US and to push into the UK and other international
markets. Currently, Starbucks operates a coffee kiosk in Harrod's in London.
Mr Schultz' vision came to him during a 1983 trip to Milan. He was
captivated by the ambiance and superb coffee available at almost every
street corner in the city. He vowed to recreate 'the romance and energy of
Italian cafe' in the US.
The story has assumed mythic proportions within Starbucks' corporate
culture. Mr Schultz, then a marketing executive at the company, failed to
convince his superiors to sell fresh-brewed coffee in addition to beans.
So he quit, put together Dollars 4m in financing and bought the business
with the intention of putting his ideas into action.
He began in Seattle and quickly moved into the other cities of the Pacific
north-west, setting off a trend which has brought hundreds of cafes,
espresso carts and coffee roasters in the area.
Next he pushed south into California, and west into Chicago and Washington.
Now Mr Schultz, who grew up on a Brooklyn housing estate, is bringing
Starbucks to his home town, where he expects to open 100 shops in three to
four years.
The 40-year-old chief executive grows animated when explaining the success
of Starbucks. He links it to the company's 'two guiding principles: a
passionate commitment to the quality of our coffee and to the quality of our
people'.
'The reason customers keep coming back - we are now serving 1.5m people a
year - is our service exceeds their expectations,' he says.
The staff are well-trained in lore and preparation of coffee, and most of
them have plenty of experience, since Starbucks enjoys a much lower
attrition rate than other retailers. It was the first private US company to
offer part-time workers equity and healthcare benefits.
The package is part of an approach which Mr Schultz calls 'the Starbucks
paradigm'. He argues that employee relations are the key to bolstering the
bottom line.
'If we are going to build long-term value for our shareholders and
customers, we first must build long-term value for our employees,' he says.
'It's a paradigm shift because most American businesses - and there are
exceptions - have not treated their workers well.'

FT  30 APR 94 / International Company News: Mediobanca to widen ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, yesterday answered its many critics by
launching a rights issue to raise more than L1,500bn (Dollars 937m) and
broaden its ownership to include ordinary and professional investors in
Italy and abroad.
The offer is structured to dilute the 50 per cent holding of Mediobanca's
traditional long-term shareholders - Banca Commerciale Italiana, Credito
Italiano and Banca di Roma, and a group of corporate investors - to about
40.6 per cent.
The bank has come under fierce attack in the past fortnight from
politicians, small shareholders and executives of IRI, the Italian state
holding company, for building up a dangerous dominant position at the centre
of Italian business.
In particular, the bank stands accused of installing its allies on the
boards of the newly-privatised banks, Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito
Italiano, to the detriment of small shareholders.
Early next week, executives from BCI and Credito Italiano will meet
officials from Consob, the Italian stock market watchdog, to discuss the
conduct of those banks' shareholder meetings at which new directors were
elected.
If shareholders approve the rights issue at their annual meeting in
mid-June, the bank intends to issue 100m new shares, with warrants attached
entitling holders to a further 10m shares. The shares will be issued at a
price of at least L15,000 per share, on the basis of one new
share-and-warrant for every four already held. But existing shareholders
will be limited to 1,000 new shares, and the outstanding stock will be
offered to individual investors in Italy and to foreign and Italian
professionals.
The capital-raising exercise, to be co-ordinated by Mediobanca and S. G.
Warburg, comes only eight months after a L1,020bn rights issue, the proceeds
of which helped pay for cash calls by companies in Mediobanca's investment
portfolio.
The bank also reported yesterday that gross profits decreased to L326.6bn
before tax, depreciation and provisions, in the six months to December 31,
compared with L350.7bn in the equivalent period of 1992.

FT  30 APR 94 / International Company News: Strong US sales boost Ford
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford of the US, the world's second largest vehicle maker, more than doubled
net profits to Dollars 1.3bn in the first quarter (excluding a one-off
charge for the sale of First Nationwide Bank) from Dollars 572m in the
corresponding period a year ago.
Including the charge of Dollars 440m for the sale of First Nationwide to
First Madison Bank, net income rose by 58 per cent to Dollars 904m.
The earnings of all the big three US vehicle makers, General Motors, Ford
and Chrysler, are rising sharply in response to the strong increase in new
vehicle demand in the US.
Ford, which is recovering from heavy losses in 1991 and 1992, said profits
had been rising for five quarters in a row.
Earnings in the first three months of 1994 were the fourth highest
first-quarter profits in its history behind the three record years at the
end of the 1980s.
The recovery in financial performance is being powered by Ford's US
automotive operations, which achieved a seven-fold increase in net income to
Dollars 835m in the first three months, the third best quarter on record,
from Dollars 113m in the same period a year ago.
'Our worldwide automotive earnings in the first quarter alone were greater
than in all of 1993 because of substantial improvement in our US results,'
said Mr Alex Trotman, chairman.
Net income from worldwide automotive operations jumped to Dollars 955m, the
best quarter since the second period of 1989, from Dollars 176m a year ago,
with earnings outside the US virtually doubling to Dollars 120m from Dollars
63m.
The financial services group had virtually unchanged net earnings of Dollars
389m, against Dollars 396m, excluding the one-off charge for the sale of
First Nationwide. Including the charge the division had a net loss of
Dollars 51m.
Turnover worldwide rose 13.4 per cent to Dollars 30.4bn from Dollars 26.8bn,
helped by a 9.2 per cent rise in vehicle sales to 1.67m from 1.53m a year
ago.
Despite its strong financial performance in the US, Ford lost market share
there, outperformed both by GM and Chrysler, and by some Japanese and
European carmakers. Its share of the combined US car and truck market fell
to 24.8 per cent (including Jaguar) from 25.7 per cent a year ago.
Ford is optimistic about continuing growth in US new vehicle demand and
forecast a 9.2 per cent increase in sales in the whole of 1994 to 15.5m from
14.2m last year.
Marketing costs in the US, including discounts and incentives, fell to 9.2
per cent of gross revenues in the quarter from 11.6 per cent a year ago but
were still high by historical standards, said the group.

turnround
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford's European automotive operations, which have suffered heavy losses for
the past three years, achieved net profits of Dollars 108m (excluding
Jaguar) in the first quarter compared with a profit of Dollars 19m a year
ago, writes Kevin Done.
The company said it was hopeful that its European operations would return to
profit for the whole of the year after running up accumulated losses
(excluding Jaguar) of Dollars 1.53bn in the past three years, including a
loss of Dollars 407m in 1993.
Jaguar, Ford's UK luxury car subsidiary, which has been in loss for the last
five years, suffered a further net operating loss of Dollars 40m in the
first quarter compared with a loss of Dollars 56m in the same period a year
ago.
The return to profit of Ford's mainstream European operations has been
driven by higher productivity and cost-cutting. It has reduced the workforce
of European operations, excluding Jaguar, by 15.4 per cent from 98,100 in
November 1992 to 83,000 by the end of last year.
Overall, west European new car sales fell by 15.4 per cent last year to
11.4m, and the company forecast only 'a slow recovery' in 1994 with car and
truck sales rising by about 3 per cent.
Wholesale vehicle sales from European plants in the first quarter at 428,102
were 1.8 per cent lower than a year ago.
European market share (excluding Jaguar) has risen only marginally in the
first quarter to 11.9 per cent from 11.8 per cent a year ago.
Jaguar increased its sales worldwide by 12 per cent in the first quarter to
7,100 from 6,300 a year ago. Sales increased year-on-year by 25 per cent in
the UK and by 18 per cent in the US, but these rises were offset by falls of
27 per cent in Germany and 21 per cent in Japan.

Allianz, Europe's largest insurance company, yesterday announced plans for a
DM1.56bn (Dollars 910m) rights issue in May, to bring its share capital in
line with a strong increase in business volume.
At the same time, the Munich-based insurer announced an increase in its
dividend to DM15 from DM13.50 in 1992.
The rights issue will also help the company prepare for the liberalisation
of the European insurance market, it said.
The 15-for-one issue will raise the capital stock to DM1.04bn from DM975m,
the announcement said. Shareholders will be offered the new shares at a
price of DM1,200.

FT  30 APR 94 / International Company News: Aetna Life earnings slide after
catastrophe claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aetna Life &amp; Casualty yesterday reported a big decline in first-quarter
operating earnings to Dollars 53m in the wake of a big increase in
catastrophe costs related to the California earthquake and winter storms. A
year ago, the US insurer recorded operating earnings of Dollars 117m.
Net income in the latest quarter was Dollars 46m, or 40 cents a share. A
year ago, net income was Dollars 394m, or 3.57 cents, following one-off
benefits of Dollars 255m from accounting changes and gains from discontinued
operations.
Mr Ronald Compton, chairman, said the improvement in the company's
underlying businesses was overshadowed by extraordinary catastrophe costs of
Dollars 124m, up from just Dollars 31m at the same stage of 1993. The
earnings of almost every large US insurer were undermined in the quarter by
a big jump in claims from customers affected by the California earthquake
and severe winter storms.
Aside from its commercial and personal property/casualty operations, the
rest of Aetna's businesses reported higher earnings for the quarter,
including health and life insurance, financial services, and international.
Aetna's shares rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 52 before the close on the New
York Stock Exchange.

FT  30 APR 94 / International Company News: LTV back in the black despite
effects of winter

<TEXT>
LTV, the third-largest US steelmaker, yesterday said it managed to return to
profit in the first quarter despite the impact of harsh winter weather on
its operations.
The group posted net income of Dollars 15.3m, or 16 cents a share, reversing
a loss of Dollars 47.7m in the same period of 1993.
The result, which exceeded the forecasts of most analysts, extended a record
of steady improvement by LTV since it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection last June.
LTV, along with the rest of the US steel industry, continued to benefit from
rising production, greater operating efficiencies and improved prices. Sales
in the car industry showed no signs of flagging during the quarter.
Revenues from core steel operations, which accounted for 93 per cent of the
total sales of Dollars 1.07bn, showed an 8 per cent gain. Shipments were up
just 3 per cent, at 1.93m tons. But with steel facilities working at 99 per
cent of capacity, LTV was able to realise higher average selling prices.
However, conditions during the winter led to power cuts, disrupted
deliveries and complicated handling of raw materials which pulled operating
profits down by Dollars 13m. The negative effect on the bottom line was
offset by Dollars 14.4m in favourable state and local tax settlements during
the quarter.

FT  30 APR 94 / UK Company News: JJB (Sports) Pounds 20m flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JJB (Sports), Britain's biggest independent sports retailer, is coming to
market during the summer via a placing with institutional investors, which
is likely to value the group at about Pounds 50m.
The group, formed 21 years ago by Mr David Whelan, the former Blackburn
Rovers player who broke his leg in the 1960 FA cup final against
Wolverhampton Wanderers, plans to raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m of
new money through the flotation.
Mr Whelan, the chairman, who entered the retail sector using the Pounds 400
compensation he received after breaking his leg to buy a market stall in
Wigan, said yesterday that the new money would be used to fund further
domestic expansion.
JJB has grown from a single sports shop in Wigan into a sports chain with
operating profits last year of about Pounds 4.5m on turnover of Pounds 43m
and 107 stores across the UK, mainly in the north west of England, the
Midlands and Scotland. All the stores are supplied from a three year old
distribution centre near Wigan.
The group has targeted towns with more than a 50,000 population for
expansion; there are about 400 in Britain. 'We believe the sports goods
market offers many opportunities for further growth and we hope to take
maximum advantage of them', said Mr Whelan yesterday.
Charterhouse Tilney Securities are the sponsors and stockbrokers to the
issue.

FT  30 APR 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise clarifies position on cash
alternative in Lasmo bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil was forced to clarify comments about a possible cash
alternative to its Pounds 1.4bn bid for rival Lasmo yesterday as its share
price continued to slide, writes David Wighton.
In a statement requested by the Takeover Panel Enterprise said that, in the
light of press comment, 'it has made no decision, at this early stage of its
offer for Lasmo, about the possible introduction of a cash alternative, at
some later stage of the offer'.
A Reuters report had suggested that comments made by Enterprise had ruled
out any prospect of a cash alternative.
Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise chairman and chief executive, had said:'I do
not see any need for it.'
Mr Hearne will be up against a seasoned bid campaigner in the form of Mr
Rudolph Agnew who is to become chairman of Lasmo with immediate effect.
Former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields, Mr Agnew was to have taken over
from Lord Rees as chairman on May 24.
Lord Rees said that with his past experience Mr Agnew was 'ideally qualified
to help see off this unwelcome bid from Enterprise.'
Enterprise shares lost another 8p to 416p yesterday, as City concerns about
the bid grew, with the lack of a cash alternative drawing particular
criticism.
The shares are down 30p since the bid was unveiled cutting the value from
150p to around 138p per Lasmo share. Lasmo shares lost 7.5p to 149.5p.

FT  30 APR 94 / UK Company News: Nixon death almost scuppers bid timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Enterprise team at SG Warburg had reason to mourn the passing of Richard
Nixon.
The bid team was in complex negotiations with the US Securities &amp; Exchange
Commission and New York Stock Exchange when America took Wednesday off to
commemorate the former president.
Enterprise's advisers were already under pressure because they were
attempting something which had never been done before - making a hostile
share offer available to the target's American investors.
Hostile bids involving the issue of shares are almost unheard of in the US
because the new shares have first to be registered with the SEC, a long and
public process.
An offer by a UK company to US shareholders in another UK company run into
the same problem. It also faces the task of meeting the requirements of two
different sets of takeover regulations.
As a result no hostile UK offers have ever been made available to US
shareholders.
The SEC has publicly stated that it is keen for US investors in foreign
companies to be treated equally and Enterprise's advisers SG Warburg has
shown that it can be done.
It compressed into two weeks a process that usually takes at least two
months, persuading the SEC to review its registration statement in private.
It also had to convince the US authorities to allow Enterprise to buy Lasmo
shares for cash in the market, which is banned under US rules for all-share
offers.
Lasmo shareholders will see the results on Tuesday when they will receive
what is thought to be the fattest ever UK takeover document.
At 261 pages it contains the UK offer, the US tender offer, listing
particulars for the new shares for the UK and the effective registration
statement for the US. UK shareholders will also receive a slimline version
which looks more like a normal takeover document.
Enterprise and its advisers went to such lengths because about 23 per cent
of Lasmo's shareholders are American and so could be vital to the outcome.
However, now that they have blazed the trail it is thought likely that
future hostile bidders may follow its example. Indeed at some stage the SEC
may insist that they do so.

FT  30 APR 94 / UK Company News: Profits warning hits Canadian Pizza shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Canadian Pizza fell 46p to 120p yesterday, when the management
issued a profits warning just five months after the company's flotation.
Mr Andrew Dare, chairman, said that sales to UK retail customers had 'seen a
significant slowing', while its largest client, J Sainsbury, had indicated
it would axe purchases of pizza crust for its delicatessen operations. These
accounted for about 10 per cent of last year's turnover.
Last November, a grinning deputy chairman, Mr Harry Kent, unveiled a pizza
crust with the price 200p written in pepperoni. The share price has since
fallen 40 per cent.
The collapse underlines the uncertainties of investing in flotations,
particularly when the track records of companies and management are
relatively short and the issues are heavily promoted.
Hoare Govett, Canadian Pizza's stockbrokers, were brokers to the recent
flotation of Maid, the on-line business information supplier, whose shares
fell 45 per cent within weeks of its launch.
As one fund manager said yesterday: 'To have one flotation nearly halve in
value is unfortunate. To have a second, smacks of carelessness.'
Mr Tim Potter, of Smith New Court, said: 'It was over-priced, and the market
is now learning just how exposed Canadian Pizza is to the whims of the
supermarket trade, and their impact on its one product.' However, he said
there was no evidence that the management could have foreseen the
difficulties.
Canadian Pizza announced its results at the end of February, saying that
although there was some pressure on profit margins for sales of pizza crusts
to retailers, it had picked up new accounts.
Mr Peter Woodall, chief executive, said the company had only heard about the
likely loss of Sainsbury's business last week. As a result previous
expectations of growth had vanished, and the company was no longer certain
it would exceed 1993's profits of Pounds 3.2m. However export sales, which
account for 30 per cent of turnover, were above budget.
The company said that subject to unforeseen circumstances, it would maintain
its dividend.

FT  30 APR 94 / UK Company News: Bromsgrove sale to consortium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bromsgrove Industries, the specialist engineering group, yesterday largely
withdrew from the automotive sector by selling its aluminium diecasting and
machining companies to a consortium led by Mr David Auty of Leicester for
Pounds 16.5m.
The consortium includes the management of the companies which will now be
grouped under the title of BSK Aluminium. These had combined sales of Pounds
30m in the year to March; in the six months to September Bromsgrove's
automotive division had operating profits of Pounds 646,000 from turnover of
Pounds 16.58m.
The sale is part of Bromsgrove's stated policy of divestment to allow for
the creation of larger profit centres.
It reflects concern at the continued pressure on margins in the automotive
sector and comes from an assessment that larger sums than Bromsgrove is
likely to have available, would be necessary to assure the future of the
companies in an industry of growing concentration.
Through 3i, the venture capital group, and Arthur Andersen, accountant, Mr
Auty has arranged Pounds 18.8m of finance to cover the purchase price and
Pounds 2.3m of extra working capital.
The financing is in two parts: Pounds 9m of equity from 3i and Pounds 9.5m
of working capital, senior and mezzanine debt from Midland Bank and Samuel
Montagu.

FT  30 APR 94 / UK Company News: Seasoned campaigner prepared for battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nobody will enjoy the hostilities to come more than Rudolph Agnew. He says
he gets bored easily so 'I'm motivated by a state of excitement.'
His style, mixing relaxed elegance with ironic humour and a very occasional
flash of hot-blooded Irish temper, should certainly add some theatricality
to the grim battle ahead.
Mr Agnew, 60, has been here before. For ten arduous months he took the lead
as chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields, one of the UK's leading mining and
industrial groups, resisting a bid by Minorco, part of the Anglo American
Corporation of South Africa. It turned out to be the UK's biggest,
longest-running and probably the most complex takeover bid ever.
Graham Hearne should beware. Mr Agnew took every opportunity to personalise
the battle by mocking Sir Michael Edwardes, then Minorco's chairman. Mr
Agnew criticised Sir Michael's lack of mining knowledge, his lack of
experience at running profitable companies and even his lack of physical
stature.
Gold Fields, against the odds, fought off Minorco but the strain it had put
on Mr Agnew was clearly visible. The Gitane cigarettes were ever-present. He
seemed worn out, haggard and much thinner.
It was no surprise when, shortly afterwards, the Hanson conglomerate, having
bought Minorco's near-30 per cent stake in Gold Fields, quickly won control
with a knock-out Pounds 3.5bn bid.
Mr Agnew then saw Gold Fields, where he had worked for 32 years and where
his family had connections going back 65 years, dismembered and disappear.
After schooling at Downside, the Catholic public school, Mr Agnew joined the
8th King's Royal Irish Hussars. There his love of a gamble proved difficult.
'It was impossible to live on army pay,' he once recalled. 'I liked backing
horses and was singularly unsuccessful at it.' He joined Gold Fields as a
management trainee and made his reputation by building its quarrying
interests, partly by the acquisition of Amey Roadstone, into the biggest
business of its kind in Britain. He became chairman of Gold Fields in 1983.
Although his his bare-knuckle approach in the bid battle was admired, Mr
Agnew was previously no City favourite. For example, he refused to budge
when analysts suggested Gold Fields sever its South African connections
because this would be good for the share price.
In the early 1980s, when Gold Fields was constantly criticised because of
those South African interests, Mr Agnew's matinee idol good looks and
languid charm did not help him. In public he appeared remote, arrogant and
given to making unhelpful facetious remarks.
His critics complained that he ran Gold Fields from its luxurious St James's
headquarters in London like a personal fiefdom. They whispered of a
ferocious temper, a playboy's lifestyle and a reluctance to do a fair day's
work when it was possible to go shooting - still his favourite pastime.
When Hanson grabbed Gold Fields in 1989, Mr Agnew not only lost his Pounds
300,000 a year salary, he also had to move out of two company-owned houses.
In the case of Lasmo, Mr Agnew has no other compensation than Pounds 150,000
a year for his chairmanship. His maximum pay-off, should things not work
out, would be one year's salary.

Exceptional costs of Pounds 2.6m to cover reorganisation of its Coventry
factory left Norman Hay, the engineer, deeper in the red for the year to
end-December.
At the pre-tax level the deficit widened from Pounds 3.05m to Pounds 3.82m
and losses per share rose from 19.75p to 25.43p. Turnover was down at Pounds
7.84m (Pounds 9.52m).
The directors said the actions taken had radically improved Hay's operating
performance and provided a base from which to rebuild its fortunes. A number
of acquisition opportunities are being considered.

Cost cutting measures helped Reece, the maker of equipment for the ceramic
and glassware industries, to reduce pre-tax losses from Pounds 662,000 to
Pounds 195,000 for the year to December 31.
Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 13.1m) although Mr Peter
Knapton, chairman, said UK sales had fallen with demand sluggish, prices
under pressure and the demise of a number of smaller customers.
The largest contributor to 1993 profits, Service (Engineers), had started
1994 well, Mr Knapton said, and now had a stronger order book than at any
time in the last two years.
Losses per share were cut to 0.16p (0.52p). The shares lost 1p to close at 3
3/4p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richards Group, the engineering concern, raised pre-tax profits from Pounds
53,000 to Pounds 85,000 in 1993.
Earnings per share grew from 1.03p to 1.42p, but a recommended final
dividend of 1.25p makes a reduced total for the year of 2.25p (4.4p).
Turnover rose from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 12.8m, although the company said
markets remained 'very testing'. Order intake for the first quarter was
higher than the same period of 1993.

FT  30 APR 94 / UK Company News: Kitty Little falls Pounds 245,000 into red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kitty Little, the USM-quoted spectacles and fresheners group, fell into
pre-tax losses of Pounds 245,000 for 1993, against profits of Pounds
150,000. The company blamed losses at the Samco acquisition and adverse
factors in the sunglass business.
Turnover was Pounds 4.09m (Pounds 4.74m) and operating losses of Pounds
156,000 from acquisitions left group operating losses of Pounds 107,000
(Pounds 369,000 profits). Losses per share were 2.8p (1.05p earnings) but
the final dividend has been maintained at 1p for a total of 1.5p (1p).
The shares were suspended on April 11 on the announcement that it was
acquiring Groupe L'Amy, the spectacle frame maker. A further announcement on
details and funding is promised as soon as possible but should be before
June 30.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Helene, the fashion wear manufacturer and distributor,
were boosted to Pounds 4.51m for 1993, from turnover expanded to Pounds
101.6m.
Comparatives, which were adjusted in accordance with FRS 3, were Pounds
2.44m and Pounds 78.3m respectively.
Earnings per share were 2.5p compared with 1.9p while the dividend is
unchanged at 2.01p with a same-again final payment of 1.36p.
The directors stated that the Just Jamie Group, in particular, had a 'very
good year', while there were solid performances from the core womenswear
businesses and the textile merchanting activities.
They pointed out that full benefits of the actions taken in regard to the
Gabicci acquisition would be apparent from the current year but the initial
effect had been the contribution of Pounds 780,000 profits and turnover of
Pounds 8.9m to 1993 figures.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Grampian Television, the independent broadcaster for north Scotland,
yesterday announced an 18 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
3.8m for the year ended February 28 1994.
Turnover was marginally lower at Pounds 20.53m (Pounds 20.62m). The shares
climbed 8p to 267p.
Mr Calum MacLeod, in his first year as chairman, said the result represented
a good start to the group's new licence period both in financial terms and
in regional programme service.
The profit was struck after a complete year of licence payments to Channel 4
of Pounds 722,000 (Pounds 90,000).
Earnings per share rose to 18.71p (15.68p) and the dividend is lifted from
6.1p to 7.5p with a final of 6p.

FT  30 APR 94 / UK Company News: A risk taker ready to stake his reputation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insiders say the seal was probably set on Enterprise's bid for Lasmo in one
of Mr Graham Hearne's late-night drink and strategy sessions. Those who know
the chain-smoking chairman and chief executive of Enterprise Oil say the
real work with his key colleagues gets done only when the office staff have
gone home and the whisky comes out.
Yet Mr Hearne's ambition to take on Lasmo appears to be a carefully
considered step. For more than a year he has weighed the right strategic
choice for Enterprise. Low oil prices have presented him with the dilemma:
Should he take the opportunity to buy cheap assets now while prices are
down? Or will the crude market remain so depressed that the upstream oil
business will never offer a sufficient return on the high risks involved?
The bid for Lasmo resolves the debate. In Enterprise's view upstream oil is
still the place to be.
Having made that decision, Mr Hearne will now be faced with the prospects of
what is likely to become a deeply personal battle. Close associates say this
is one aspect of the Lasmo challenge to which he is not looking forward.
'He will want to fight the battle on industrial issues,' said one colleague.
Friends describe the diminutive Mr Hearne as fiercely loyal, dynamic,
mercurial and even say he has a streak of arrogance. The critics accuse him
of megalomania and a tendency to only hear what he wants to hear.
All are agreed, however, that Mr Hearne is well connected. One story has it
that Enterprise had all but given up on getting a response to its bid for
Saxon Oil in 1985, when the tide was turned by just a few phone calls from
him.
Those connections are obviously the result of a varied career which has
crossed the paths of some of Britain's most prominent businessmen. The son
of a Birmingham munitions worker, Mr Hearne left school at 16 to work as an
articled clerk with a firm of lawyers. After a brief stint as a lawyer in
New York, he was recruited by the Wilson Government to the Industrial
Reorganisation Corporation, set up to rationalise British industry. There he
joined the likes of Sir Christopher Hogg of Courtaulds, and Sir Alaistair
Morton of Eurotunnel.
The invitation to join Enterprise in 1984 was based on his experience there,
at Courtaulds as finance director, and the merchant bank Rothchilds, where
he was a director. More importantly he had the oil expertise through his
time as chief executive at Tricentrol.
Mr Hearne has been credited with safeguarding Enterprise from hostile
shareholders - such as RTZ and Lasmo - as well building up a Pounds 2bn
company. Yet there are those who would say the group's perceived success is
due to the team he built up, including the now departed finance director, Mr
John Walmsley. 'If he was on the board he would say this bid is absolute
madness,' says one analyst.
Yet Mr Hearne has taken precautions. By using an 'A' share structure,
Enterprise has limited the risks to its main business if Lasmo goes horribly
wrong. Investors may be unwilling to shoulder the risks that he is keen to
avoid. If so, his response is likely to be phlegmatic. Lasmo is worth
something to him at a price and an acceptable risk. If he cannot buy it at
that level he will walk away, but it might be at some cost to his
reputation.

FT  30 APR 94 / UK Company News: Ransomes shares climb 10% on upbeat
statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Ransomes, the lossmaking manufacturer of grass cutting equipment,
rose by 10 per cent to 22p yesterday, after the group's chairman, Mr John
Clement, gave an upbeat assessment of current trading at the annual meeting.
He indicated that the group, which has Pounds 75m of bank debt, was
negotiating the sale of some of its surplus property.
Mr Clements also told shareholders the company was considering 'many
options' for refinancing.
Earlier this month, Ransomes decided to pay its overdue convertible
preference share dividend and launched an attack on Steinhardt Partners, the
US hedge fund manager which has bought 30 per cent of the preference shares.
Ransomes has rejected proposals it has received from Steinhardt for a
recapitalisation, involving conversion of the preference shares into
ordinary shares.

FT  30 APR 94 / UK Company News: Pelican cash call for Dome chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pelican Group, the acquisitive restaurant operator, has agreed to buy the
Dome cafe chain - which helped to pioneer brasserie-style catering in the UK
 -from Forte, the hotels and restaurants group.
Pelican is paying Pounds 11.5m in cash and also announced a fully
underwritten Pounds 20m rights issue to pay for the chain and the conversion
of most of the outlets into its own Cafe Rouge brand of restaurant.
The 5-for-9 cash call at 80p was well received and Pelican's shares rose by
4p to 95p.
Mr Roger Myers, Pelican's chairman, was advising Courage, the brewer, when
in 1984 it opened the first Dome cafe in Hampstead, London.
In 1986 Forte bought what had by then become a chain of four outlets.
However, they always seemed to sit uneasily within the larger group which
now wants to focus on its core hotels and roadside catering businesses.
The Forte connection was carefully concealed, since the group rightly
suspected that its style-conscious young customers might not want to know
that their trendy local was owned by the same company which controlled the
Little Chef and Happy Eater roadside restaurant chains.
Pelican is buying 16 restaurants, of which 13 currently operate under the
Dome name. Forte will keep and rebrand three Dome outlets - two sited in
group hotels and one in London's Regent Street. The latter was the site of
the original milk bar from which Lord Forte launched his empire.
Pelican is acquiring three other London restaurants in the deal - the Oriel
in Sloane Square, and two Bar Escoba outlets, in Kensington and Ealing.
The new owners will convert nine of the Dome outlets and the Bar Escoba in
Ealing to its Cafe Rouge format. Three other Domes will retain the name and
be run mainly as bars - 'which is what they were always meant to be,'
according to Mr Myers.
Pelican said the deal would enable expansion away from Greater London
through the acquisition of sites in Oxford, Cambridge and Windsor.
The group forecast it would make pre-tax profits in the year to March 31 of
Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 908,000). A final dividend of not less than 1.25p is
forecast.
The rapidly-expanding group, which came to the USM in 1990, has seen its
share price triple since the begining of 1993. It will seek a full listing
when its audited annual results are published in July.

Sir, The plan by Michael Howard, the home secretary, to introduce a law to
punish those who obtain private information by deception is long overdue
('Howard moves to protect confidential information', April 16).
As legislation throughout Europe moves towards greater transparency when
storing personal information on computer, the growth of an underworld
dealing in 'confidential information' is an insidious corollary.
A deterrent is vital, and criminalisation is a welcome development.

FT  30 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: A difference that is more than just
semantics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER CONWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest Lucy Kellaway's excellent article, 'Game rules in
black and white' (April 25). However, her assertion that competencies 'may
include skills, knowledge, understanding and will-power' is fundamentally
flawed.
Our latest research at Ashridge indicates that it is necessary to separate
competence, identified as qualities or attributes, from competencies which
are management behaviours in a role.
The failure to identify these two distinct yet complementary elements lies
at the root of much of the confusion surrounding the successful
implementation of competencies for top managers.
It is not just a question of semantics.

FT  30 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Deregulation proposal a threat to
many local authority markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J S WHITAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Despite a large number of objections, the government is forcing through
a bill which threatens the future of local authority-owned markets. The
Deregulation and Contracting Out Bill will remove common law protection for
markets built on common law and provided by market rights. Rights of markets
in private ownership will not be removed.
The government received 2,322 responses to the bill. Of these 2,049 objected
to the market deregulation proposal.
One of the reasons given in replies from ministers at the Department of
Trade and Industry is that there are 'waiting lists of potential stall
holders' for market stalls. This statement is an indication that ministers
have not visited the markets before proposing legislation which could have
serious effects on the future of markets, particularly those in small market
towns.
In my authority between 2 and 70 per cent of stalls are empty each market
day, and on speaking to colleagues throughout England and Wales the pattern
of empty stalls is very similar. This failure by ministers to visit markets
is in stark contrast to visits by transport minister, Mr Steven Norris, to
towns and cities regarding the review of taxi licensing. He is experiencing
at first hand the views of the trade, public and local authorities.
I ask every MP and member of the House of Lords to visit the markets in
their constituencies on market days and see for themselves the present
situation, and judge whether the city and town centres can afford the rush
of new markets and car boot sales which will appear when the floodgates of
deregulation are opened.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEORGE THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial 'Germany's Europe' (April 28) marks the FT as the last
bastion of those who believe that 'the over-mighty sovereign Germany', as
you put it, can be tamed by absorption into a united Europe. You then go on
to describe this ideal Europe as one in which the many peoples of Europe,
mollified by full bellies and material prosperity, will accept the dominance
of Germany as a fair price for pacification of the monster.
But real people are political and tribal. Real people, even rich ones if we
could always hope to be rich, have aspirations to at least the sense of a
say in their governance. When in a minority they need national loyalty to
accept their disappointment and tolerate laws they dislike. Europe,
particularly one dominated by one country, cannot meet these demands. This
may be bad for business but it is true and for this reason the Europe that
you wish for will not continue to be the 'zone of stability' that we have
come to accept so complacently and which you choose to abandon so
recklessly. Your Europe will be as fractious, unruly and tense as any
previous colonial empire.

FT  30 APR 94 / Spin and tonics: French chefs are trying to whet appetites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quite simply, there are too many restaurants in France.'
This observation comes not from a prospective visitor to France somewhat
perplexed by the 10,676 entries in the 1994 Michelin Guide, but from Michel
Roux, three-star Michelin chef.
Although Roux is based at the Waterside Inn, Bray, Berkshire, he keeps his
finger on the culinary pulse of France via Relais &amp; Chateaux, the marketing
consortium of top hotels and restaurants, and the Maitre Patissiers de
France, an elite culinary group of which he is vice-president.
In Colmar, Alsace, recently for Festiga '94, a gastronomic fair, Roux heard
a collective groan of distress from French restaurateurs. Of immediate
concern is the oversupply of restaurants. But more worrying for a country
that considers itself custodian of the world's finest culinary traditions,
the youth of France, reared on 'le fast food', are no longer attracted to a
career in the kitchen.
Business has been in decline since 1991 but last year was for many
restaurants the worst on record, culminating in chefs' protests in
south-west France, led by local chef Andre Daguin. The French government's
'franc fort' policy has dented the tourist market and to survive several top
Parisian chefs, including Jacques Cagna, Michel Rostang and Guy Savoy, have
opened more relaxed, less expensive brasseries, such as La Butte Chaillot,
La Rotisserie d'en Face and La Rotisserie du Beaujolais, which have menus
priced about 40 per cent lower than at their main establishments.
A few top Parisian restaurants, such as those run by Joel Robuchon and
Bernard Pacaud, may be booked ahead but it is for weeks rather than months
as it was in the 1980s. Outside the big cities, business is quiet,
particularly at lunch. According to Roux, 1994 may be 'bloody'.
Part of the damage is self-inflicted. While French restaurateurs have priced
their food sensibly, via fixed-price menus, their wine pricing has been
rapacious. Normal practice is to take the wine's cost price and multiply it
by between 4.5 and 6 to arrive at a selling price inclusive of 18 per cent
tax and 15 per cent service. This policy has discouraged many US visitors,
used to lower mark-ups, and upset several French winemakers.
Twenty-one top champagne houses have given French restaurateurs a marketing
lesson by launching a campaign to boost consumption. They are offering a 20
per cent rebate on the cost price if restaurants agree not to charge more
than Fr300 for non-vintage champagne. More than 900 restaurants are taking
part.
But at Festiga '94, in the presence of Paul Bocuse, perhaps the world's most
renowned chef, the Maitres Cuisiniers de France launched a much grander
initiative, entitled 'Parcours du Professionalisme Gastronomique', to
overhaul the entire industry, stimulate demand for good food and inspire the
next generation of French chefs.
Put simply, the plan is to grab them when they are young. Chefs will now
visit primary schools throughout France to explain the importance of good
health and good food so that, as schooleavers, they will consider a career
in catering. Other measures were announced to upgrade the training for those
at college and to reward more positively trainee chefs and waiters in
restaurants. Each trainee chef will receive a 'Passport to Professionalism'
sponsored by the local branch of the bank Credit Mutuel.
On the fair's demonstration stands the policy was being put into practice.
As three-star chef, Michel Troisgros, was cooking barbary duck with turnips
in front of an audience of 500 French adults, another professional chef was
supervising 5-year-olds, dressed in white mini-chefs' jackets and hats, as
they cut strawberries and vegetables. Behind were their drawings of
butchers' and bakers' shops under the heading: 'If I do not eat meat, eggs
or fish, I will not grow up big and strong.'
Will French restaurants find it difficult to attract new customers or chefs?
Troisgros laughs. 'At the top end of the market we need extra customers,' he
says. 'Although business is good, we would like an extra 10 customers each
service to take it back to the level it was four years ago.'
For other less well-known French restaurants the competition for customers
and good staff is almost certain to intensify and may lead to a significant
restructuring.
One solution to an oversupply of restaurants and a shortage of good chefs
may lie in restaurants grouping together. Philippe Bohrer, 31, a one-star
Michelin chef at Rouffach, Alsace, has formed Syndicale Gourmande with three
other chefs because, he says: 'Chefs today have to sell themselves to their
customers and to their staff, and go where their customers want, even taking
restaurants into homes or offices.'
'Restauration a la domicile', Bohrer's vision of the future, may be the most
important change the industry has undergone since the French Revolution
broke up many of the great houses and transformed France's domestic cooks
and servants into the world's first restaurateurs.

FT  30 APR 94 / Con artists or cost-cutters: Do Whitehall's outside
consultants provide value for money? John Willman examines their role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Management consultants are the people who borrow your watch to tell you what
time it is and then walk off with it, in the famous judgment of Mr Robert
Townsend, the former chairman of Avis.
His 1971 opinion is still widely held in business. A survey of company
directors in Scotland last year rated management consultants lowest of any
profession for their contribution to business, ability to grasp company
requirements and value for money.
Now dissatisfaction has surfaced in the public sector, with an unpublished
government report on the use of external consultants by the civil service.
The UK Cabinet Office efficiency unit could find savings of just Pounds 10m
from expenditure on consultancy of more than Pounds 500m a year - less than
2 per cent of the cost.
By contrast, Pounds 78m was spent on internal consultancy in 1992-93 saving
Pounds 18m, 23 per cent of the cost.
The findings of the report, revealed in the Financial Times on Tuesday,
unleashed a political storm over the waste of resources. But the
commissioning of the report indicates that ministers have become
increasingly uneasy over the enormous growth in the use of external
management consultants in Whitehall. A series of reports by the National
Audit Office, the public expenditure watchdog, have already criticised the
waste of money on consultants by the civil service and the health service.
One highly placed civil servant, referring to use of consultants, said:
'Some of these reports cost an arm and a leg and tell you nothing you didn't
know already.'
The explosion in consultancy use and other outside advisers by the public
sector has been relatively recent. In 1985, public sector work brought in
Pounds 34.5m for members of the Management Consultancies Association (it
covers about half the consultancy market). By 1993 this had increased to
Pounds 209m.
Privatisation was one important area enabling merchant banks, accountants,
City lawyers and PR consultants to rake in lucrative fees for selling off
utilities such as BT, gas, water and electricity.
Another opportunity was provided by the computerisation of civil service
work such as tax collection, which created some of the largest IT projects
in western Europe. The computerisation of the Department of Social Security
involved at its peak 250 staff from Andersen Consulting, the world's largest
consultancy.
The growing pace of Whitehall reform gave a further boost to consultancy in
the late 1980s. Consultants were called in to advise on the creation of more
than 90 executive agencies to improve the delivery of central government
services, such as the Benefits Agency which pays social security benefits.
The Citizen's Charter required marketing and customer-handling skills that
the civil service lacked. Consultants advised civil service departments on
market-testing, and their staff on how to win contracts. And the latest move
to privatise executive agencies will mean more lucrative work for City
advisers.
By 1992-93, civil service expenditure on all forms of external consultancy
had reached Pounds 565m a year, the efficiency unit estimated. A sample of
quangos - non-civil service bodies financed by government - suggested they
were spending a further Pounds 124m a year on consultants.
Around half the money being spent is used to help implement government
programmes. Consultants help design roads and defence equipment, advise
foreign governments as part of the foreign aid programme and devise training
strategies.
Nearly a third of the total, Pounds 160m, is spent on IT advice. Most of the
remaining Pounds 130m is to help improve the management and structure of the
civil service.
Consultants are quick to point out that the figure of Pounds 10m for the
savings from this expenditure is not an accurate reflection of the benefits.
'Benefits aren't just about savings, they're about achievement,' says Mr
Nick Rawlings, head of the public sector practice at PA, one of the largest
UK consultancies.
Mr Brian O'Rorke, director of the Management Consultancies Association, says
that even where there are savings, the civil service often fails to quantify
them. 'Businesses are much more accustomed to estimating the savings from a
project in advance and then checking on the actual savings afterwards,' he
says.
Mr Keith Burgess, managing partner of Andersen Consulting in the UK, says
that neglecting to calculate the benefits is a consequence of the civil
service obsession with controlling costs.
'Civil servants emphasise process in buying consultancy, ticking boxes to
show that every check has been made so that the result cannot be challenged
by the National Audit Office,' he says. 'In business, there is a far greater
emphasis on individual responsibility, with a senior manager in charge of
commissioning consultancy and seeing it through until the benefits can be
released.'
Much of the efficiency unit report is devoted to improving the process of
buying consultancy. Essential to this is the development of policies for
using consultants.
'There is a common feeling, rightly or wrongly, that for significant
projects some ministers will not be persuaded by advice from civil servants
alone,' the report says. 'There needs to be a report from consultants,
preferably one of the large consultancy firms, to give proposals
credibility.'
In many cases, the report says, consultants are used in a reactive fashion,
to deal with particular problems. Projects are commissioned by relatively
junior staff, which are then not implemented because the staff lack
sufficient authority to carry the projects forward. Communication between
departments on similar consultancy work, which would prevent duplication and
reduce costs, is limited.
Mr O'Rorke says that Whitehall departments need to take consultancy more
seriously. Project specifications should identify expected benefits and be
finalised in a dialogue between the department and consultancy. Mr Burgess
says: 'The best consultancy delivers benefits to the stakeholders in an
organisation by creating a partnership between the consultants and the
clients.'
The report goes further, and questions whether some consultancy is needed at
all. To avoid duplication it suggests a government-wide database of
completed consultancy work.
And some management improvements could be better achieved by adopting
benchmarking techniques used in business. These involve identifying best
practice in other organisations and copying successful techniques.
The consultancy industry is outwardly sanguine about the fall-out from the
report. 'More intelligent buying will mean that the money is spent better -
and the government has plenty of scope for improvement,' says Mr Burgess.
And Mr O'Rorke sees no sign of a collapse in the market.
They may be right. But one thing is certain: the glory days for consultancy
in central government are over. After the embarrassment of this week's
report ministers will make sure that future projects are more rigorously
justified.

FT  30 APR 94 / A debtor's calculated gamble: Iran, accused of planning to
arm the IRA, is using its economic weakness as a weapon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's accusations that Iran has been collaborating with the IRA are
unlikely to dent its smiling defiance, for the simple reason that the
government in Tehran thinks it has the measure of the industrialised world.
It is an assumption based on the calculation that, whatever Iran may say,
and perhaps do, the commercial self-interest of competing nations will
ultimately work in Tehran's favour.
On the face of it, Iran has little to smile about. It is heavily in debt,
oil revenues are sharply down, inflation is rising and the economy
contracting. But it has succeeded in at least postponing the economic crisis
by persuading Germany, Japan and other trading partners to reschedule an
important slice of its short-term debt. Its defiance remains directed
primarily at the US, which unsuccessfully sought to persuade those countries
against offering Iran any relief from its worsening economic problems.
'We always knew the importance of our market to the west and have now
learned the power of owing billions of dollars, rather than just a few
hundred million,' said one official in Tehran recently. 'By halting debt
payments in December we were able to concentrate the minds of our creditors
on achieving favourable agreements.'
Iran offered nothing political in return for the rescheduling and, in
particular, has not moderated its ambition to export the message of
revolutionary Islam to the world's 1bn Moslems. Senior officials are
generally encouraged by events in Algeria, Sudan and Egypt, where they sense
that the popular political tide is swinging ever more in their direction.
For the US, the British allegations that Iran was preparing to supply
finance, weaponry and training to the IRA were particularly timely, as they
appeared to lend weight to its assertion that Iran is one of the main
sponsors of international terrorism, and justify the American policy of
seeking to isolate Tehran economically. However, the US may also reflect
that its efforts to limit Iran's economic prospects have proved less
effective than the self-inflicted damage caused by the government in Tehran.
Since the end of the eight-year war with Iraq in 1988, Iran has squandered
the one solid achievement to have emerged intact from that appalling
conflict: its international financial reputation.
Iran escaped from the war almost without debts and a reputation for meeting
its obligations on time. But the combination of the government's desire to
compensate people for their suffering, and the central bank's failure to
control letters of credit, proved calamitous.
Imports surged out of control, and today Iran's total outstanding debt is
about Dollars 25bn. The country is 14 months behind in meeting payments on
letters of credit, and its access to urgently needed long-term international
funding is almost nil. It also has to cope with a population which has
doubled to more than 60m since the 1979 revolution, an infrastructure
damaged by war and neglect, and the probability of continued oil price
weakness causing a sustained loss of government revenues.
Iran's leaders blame anyone but themselves for their troubles, but as the
country's economic plight continues to deepen, so domestic tensions are
likely to grow. The government has bought itself a financial breathing space
through the debt rescheduling now being finalised, but the respite is
limited, both in time and in the immediate effect on Iran's hard-pressed
finances.
The country's short-term debt is estimated at about Dollars 14bn, including
some amounts rescheduled last year. Of this, current arrears are put at
Dollars 9bn with some Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7bn covered by export credit
agencies. Another Dollars 7bn is thought to be due for repayment during the
rest of this year.
The German package covers arrears of about Dollars 2.5bn. It allows for a
two-year grace period and repayments to be made in equal tranches over the
subsequent four years up to the end of 1999. Similar bilateral deals are
being finalised with Japan, (up to Dollars 2.3bn), Switzerland and Austria
(another Dollars 1bn each). Government officials claim that, together with
reschedulings involving Italy, France, and other European nations, this will
provide relief on nearly Dollars 8bn of debt arrears.
The US may hope that the British revelations will push the creditor nations
into reconsidering the rescheduling arrangements, but whatever the outcome
Tehran is still firmly caught on the financial hook. With about 85 per cent
of government revenues deriving from oil, the shortage of hard currency to
fund all but the most essential imports will remain acute.
But, in a new year message last month, President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani saw not a cloud on the horizon, a view likely to have been
received with scepticism by the Iranian parliament, which has taken a more
critical view of the economy. During the budget debate earlier this year
members forced the government to slash its oil revenue estimates for the
year beginning March 21 from Dollars 14bn to just over Dollars 10bn.
Although imports have fallen by more than 40 per cent in the financial year
which ended last month, visitors to Iran's main ports report quaysides
stacked with consumer goods. Shops in Tehran are still well supplied with
western fashions, perfumes, and electronic equipment, while caviar can be
bought at just Dollars 50 a kilo, somewhat less than the price of a bottle
of smuggled vodka.
Indications that this situation cannot persist for long are beginning to
emerge. Inflation, officially running at 23 per cent, may be closer to 50
per cent, with some items having doubled in price during the past year.
Government efforts to unify the exchange rate are faltering as demand for
dollars increases, with the rial recently trading at about 2,500 to the
dollar on the free market compared with the official rate of 1,780.
One political consequence has been the steady erosion in President
Rafsanjani's authority. Parliament has turned increasingly against him.
First, it refused to endorse the renomination of Mr Mohsen Nourbash as
economics minister, and then in January this year displaced Mr Rafsanjani's
brother from the key role as head of television and broadcasting. And when
the president proposed a doubling of petrol prices, from the ludicrously low
equivalent of 2 US cents a litre, parliament refused.
While President Rafsanjani's fortunes have declined, those of less pragmatic
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the spiritual leader and successor to Ayatollah
Khomeini, have strengthened. Few Iranians doubt Ayatollah Khamenei is an
ambitious man, but opinion is divided over whether he ultimately regards Mr
Rafsanjani as a political ally or a disposable rival. Ayatollah Khamenei
also has his own problems, particularly with the Shia clerical establishment
in Qom, which is ill-disposed to recognise him as the senior religious
authority following the death in December of Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Reza
Golpayegani.
With so many competing centres of authority, the prospect for a single,
coherent approach to the country's economic difficulties and foreign
relations appears remote. Ministers act independently of each other, the
president cannot impose his will on parliament, leaders of wealthy religious
foundations cannot be stopped from dabbling in international politics, and
the clergy is disunited, leaving only the old slogans of the revolution as a
common point of reference.
This, of course, is not the Iran that its leaders see and cherish. They mock
western doubts about the regime's durability and place any current
difficulties in the historical context of Iran's revolution. This, they
remind visitors, is the revolution which overthrew the Shah, survived the
war against Iraq, faced down 15 years of hostility from the US, and routed
all domestic opposition.
But what the revolution has not yet demonstrated is an ability to create
economic growth, reduce unemployment, narrow the vast gap between rich and
poor, and manage the nation's considerable resources intelligently. On those
issues, the Iranian public will eventually make their views felt.

FT  30 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: C&amp;G takeover threatens diversity and
mutuality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ELIZABETH MAYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, How far should the ideal of mutuality be protected? This is the
critical question in the proposed takeover by Lloyds Bank of the Cheltenham
&amp; Gloucester Building Society.
Your report ('Lloyds' High Court hurdle', April 26) of the legal obstacles
in the way of the takeover draws attention to the commission's view that
payments to existing members can only be made to those persons who have been
members for at least two years.
One of the aims of the two-year qualification period is to strengthen the
position of a mutual society. In such an organisation, the assets of the
society are owned by the members themselves. On a takeover, there is a
one-off opportunity to release the value of those assets. The ideal of
mutuality requires that only those who have been members for a period of
time should share in this release. If the take-over of the C&amp;G by Lloyds
succeeds, this ideal will have been damaged.
Ultimately, do we want diversity in the institutions which provide borrowing
facilities to the general public? If so, the mutuals have a vital part to
play. They bring a different perspective to the market and a wide degree of
choice.
The government is currently reviewing the position of building society
mergers and acquisitions. One reason why building societies are vulnerable
to being taken over is the limits that are imposed on their ability to raise
funds in the wholesale market. Part of the review should cover the question
of whether these limits should be revised or removed. If the playing field
between banks and building societies were levelled, many more societies
would be in a stronger position to resist the pressures for take-over and
the ideal of mutuality could be preserved.
Without a successful review, the ideal of mutuality will be lost and
competition sacrificed.

FT  30 APR 94 / Angst of Croydon Man: James Blitz tests Tory support in a
London borough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Could concrete-clad Croydon, in the suburban heartland of London's southern
commuter belt, prove John Major's nemesis?
Like many outer London boroughs, it is a citadel of Tory rule. For the past
30 years, people of the borough - the sixth-largest metropolis in the UK -
have only elected Tory councils.
Much of the population is made up of the aspiring middle-class voters - the
so-called 'C2s' - who, like their counterparts in Basildon, Essex, were
solid supporters of Mrs Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. In the south of the
borough, home-owners predominate. In Croydon town centre, with its towering
office blocks and streets full of chain stores, the main industries are
those which should be providing natural Tory supporters: banking, insurance
and retailing.
And yet, the Conservatives may be on the verge of an historic defeat. At the
last local election in 1990, Labour made impressive gains on the council,
coming within six seats of taking control. On Thursday, only 500 Tory voters
have to switch allegiance in the right wards and Labour will take power. 'If
we lose it would be very serious for Croydon,' says Sir Peter Bowness, who
has been the council's dapper and energetic Tory leader for the past 18
years. 'And I have no doubt that it is something that would have to be taken
very seriously on the national level too.'
In an intense campaign, Labour is focusing on local economic problems.
Several banks in the town centre have recently announced redundancies.
British Gas, with its large regional headquarters, is in the throes of
restructuring its national operation, which may lead to job losses in
Croydon. And, as in all London suburbs, the property depression has brought
misery to those with large mortgages.
'The shake-out in financial services and mortgage lending has taken its
toll,' says Mr Jeff Dixon, who is masterminding the Labour party's campaign.
'We may have the largest shopping centre outside Oxford Street but few have
been going there recently.'
For the Tories, Sir Peter is still 'cautiously optimistic' of victory. In
spite of the apocalyptic scenario painted by Labour, unemployment in the
borough has fallen in the last year, he says. Only one of the office blocks
in the town centre is empty. Yesterday, there was speculation in a local
newspaper that a large US insurance company might open a regional office in
the town.
The Tory vote ought also to gain from the energy of Sir Peter's
administration in recent years. It has pushed through numerous civic
projects with success: a large library in the town centre opened recently, a
building programme for museums and art galleries is under way and a 18-mile
overground tram link between Croydon and neighbouring boroughs is planned.
In the run-up to polling day, that record should help the Tories win votes.
But even all this might not be enough to compensate for what many local
voters regard as the biggest issue in Thursday's contest: the performance of
the Conservative government at the national level.
Worries about Mr Major's leadership credentials and the impact of this
month's income tax and value added tax increases, may - to the embarrassment
of Tory Central Office - overshadow local Conservative achievements. As one
local resident puts it: 'If Tories like us vote out a council like ours, it
can only be because of discontent with the nation's leadership.'

FT  30 APR 94 / The clock starts to tick for Major: The fault-lines that may
threaten the prime minister's survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The conversation is about Mr John Major's prospects of survival. The
minister sitting across the restaurant table hopes he will hold on to 10
Downing Street. But he is just as uncertain as the rest of us about the
prime minister's chances.
The Tory leadership has disappeared these past weeks from the front pages.
The respite is misleading. As the local and European elections approach, the
talk at Westminster is of nothing else.
Scratch beneath the surface and there is something else. Some senior
Conservatives have begun to think the unthinkable. The question they ask is
not whether the prime minister will last the summer but whether the party he
leads can be saved from self-destruction.
Back in the restaurant, the minister wants first to know how active Mr
Michael Heseltine's lieutenants have been. Is the trade secretary, the
favourite for the succession, encouraging them to campaign? Have colleagues
been promised jobs in a Heseltine government?
And what about Mr Michael Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary? Is it true
that the 40-year-old guardian of the Thatcherite torch has decided he will,
after all, stand in any leadership contest? What is the judgment among
political journalists on how many of the Euro-sceptic right would choose
Portillo over Heseltine?
The talk turns to the fading fortunes of Mr Kenneth Clarke. Six months ago
the chancellor was everyone's front-runner. Now he has disappeared from
view. It is time, his friends say, for Mr Clarke to resurrect his profile.
The discussion has a surreal quality. Most ministers are horrified that the
party which once prided itself on discipline and unity might turn out a Tory
prime minister for the second time in four years.
Mr Major won the general election. For all his faults he has held the party
together over Europe. Economic recovery is at last a visible reality. In six
months or a year the government's fortunes might be transformed.
But the fatalistic speculation permeates every conversation among the
journalists, ministers, and Tory backbenchers who daily fill the restaurants
around Westminster.
They are waiting for the explosion. The ordinary business of government is
paralysed. The fear - and for many the expectation - is that the local
elections on May 5 and the poll for the European Parliament a month later
will convulse the Conservative party.
The clock on this electoral timebomb will start ticking next Friday with the
results of the voting up and down the country in about 200 local
authorities.
If the outcome replicates national opinion polls - which show Labour between
20 and 25 points ahead of the Tories - the Conservatives will be swept from
power in virtually every town hall.
The central batteground will be suburban London (see article below), which
four years ago stood aside from the national backlash against the then Mrs
Margaret Thatcher's government. The polls point to the possibility of an
unprecedented Tory collapse around the capital.
Ministers think the outcome will not be so catastrophic. Doorstep
campaigning points to a patchier result. A surge in the Liberal Democrat
vote would complicate the arithmetic. The Tories often do better locally
than nationally. But the local elections are just the beginning: a dress
rehearsal for the main, European, event on June 9.
The risk is the voters will treat the European Parliament poll as a
referendum on the government's performance. Along with the Eastleigh
by-election it will offer a chance to get even with Mr Major's government
for the economic recession, tax increases and government disarray over
Europe.
Even before the start of the campaign the Tory fault-line over Europe has
re-emerged beneath the careful attempts of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, to reconcile the Europhobes and Europhiles.
If a semblance of unity cannot be restored the Conservative vote may well
collapse. The polls suggest the Liberal Democrats could win up to 10
Euro-seats in south-west and southern England. Labour might add the same
number to its present 45. The government would then see its 32 reduced to no
more than 12.
It is that scenario that provokes scarcely-suppressed panic in ministers and
backbench Tory MPs alike. The dispossessed on the right are floating
possible 'stalking-horse' candidates to unseat Mr Major in the autumn if he
cannot be persuaded to go quietly in the summer. The names most commonly
mentioned are Mr Norman Lamont, the embittered former chancellor, and Mr
Kenneth Baker, the distinctly Eurosceptical former home secretary.
Mr Major is aware of the risks. The talk in 10 Downing Street is of a
strategy for survival during the summer. His planned cabinet reshuffle may
come sooner and be more extensive than we think. Friends are assured that
the prime minister is more determined than ever to remain in office.
The leadership crisis may, anyway, be a symptom rather than a cause. There
is the possibility that the Conservatives are on the threshold of
self-destruction. Ministers no longer dismiss the thought that a split over
Europe might do to the Conservative party in the 1990s what the divisions
over economic policy did to Labour in the 1970s. It is not lost on them that
the opposition has spent 15 years in the political wildnerness in its
efforts to repair the damage.
There has been much superficial sound and fury at Westminster this week: Mr
Major does not have a masterplan to threaten Britain's withdrawal from the
EU if its partners do not accept its agenda at the intergovernmental
conference due in 1996. Nor has the prime minister torn up the manifesto
drafted by Mr Hurd for the election this June.
But two important things have happened. The Eurosceptics on the backbenches
have been gaining new recruits for a more uncompromising stance against
further deepening of the Union at the 1996 conference.
Encouraged by one or two of their cabinet allies, they have also floated the
idea that Britain might soon face a stark choice between deeper entanglement
in a European superstate and withdrawal from all but the EU's trading
dimension.
For the overwhelming majority in the government that is an absurd option: in
Mr Hurd's words, it is out of touch with geographical reality, with
commercial reality and with the reality of collective security.
Try telling that to the cabinet minister who has been musing that his party
made a historic mistake 30 years ago when it embraced Europe, or to the Tory
MPs whose political thinking was shaped by the angry rhetoric rather than
the more sober reality of Mrs Thatcher's approach to Brussels.
Mr Major and Mr Hurd throw bridges over the chasm in the party by
emphasising Britain's decentralising agenda is at last making headway with
its partners.
But the sceptics have grown bolder in their defiance, scathing about the
prime minister and careless of the electoral consequences. Better to be
honest in opposition than corrupt in government is how one of them put it
recently.
So it may be that the Conservative party is destined to break itself apart
over Europe. The coming weeks may signal not just another Tory leadership
battle but a seismic shift in British politics. As the minister put it as he
left the restaurant: 'If we get rid of another prime minister, the
Conservative party will not be worth leading.'

FT  30 APR 94 / Man in the News: New contender as Mr Fixit - Jean-Luc
Dehaene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jean-Luc Dehaene is hardly a household name. Built like a slimmed-down
version of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the bespectacled Belgian prime minister
is known at home as the 'fixer', the 'plumber', or, simply, the 'carthorse'.
The idea that Mr Dehaene might succeed Mr Jacques Delors as the next
president of the European Commission seems hard to credit. Many Belgians are
rubbing their eyes in disbelief. In Britain, where the ruling Conservative
party risks splitting apart over Europe, Mr Dehaene is already being
caricatured as the Beast from Brussels.
An editorial in The Sun newspaper summed up the mood: 'Dehaene is dedicated
to a United States of Europe. He wants more power for Brussels . . . Dehaene
will decide what's good for us.'
Much of the fuss is premature. The struggle over the succession to Mr Delors
is taking place in secret, among the EU's 12 heads of government. They will
decide who gets the top executive job in Brussels, most likely when they
meet at the European summit in Corfu in June. Since the choice must be
unanimous, there is plenty of time for horse-trading.
Yet it would be foolish to ignore Mr Dehaene. He is a man of hidden talents
with powerful friends. The most important is Mr Kohl, who encouraged him to
become a candidate late last year as an alternative to Mr Ruud Lubbers, the
long-serving Dutch prime minister.
Mr Lubbers seemed the natural choice for the job, despite a long-shot bid by
Sir Leon Brittan, the chief EU trade negotiator, and a possible future entry
by Mr Peter Sutherland, who announced this week that he was leaving as head
of the new World Trade Organisation on January 1 1995 - which just happens
to coincide with the end of Dr Delors' tenure.
The Kohl-Dehaene connection gelled over a dinner in Brussels last October.
The occasion was a special European summit called to decide the location of
more than a dozen new Euro-institutions. By far the biggest prize was the
European Monetary Institute, the forerunner of a future European central
bank.
Mr Kohl was desperate to secure the EMI for Frankfurt, recognising that this
was the minimum needed to appease the German public's fears about giving up
the D-Mark for a future single currency. The Dutch and British were holding
out for Amsterdam and London.
'Dehaene was a model of self-control. He sat perfectly still and let the
others run out of steam until they realised there was no other answer (to
Frankfurt),' recalls a diplomat. 'That takes a lot of nerve.'
Mr Dehaene's style impressed colleagues during the six-month Belgian
presidency of the European Union which ended last December. Aside from
resolving the two-year battle over the division of Euro-spoils, the Belgian
premier presided over the entry into force of the Maastricht treaty; the
reconciliation between France and its EU partners over the Gatt world trade
talks; and the successful adoption of Mr Delors' white paper on jobs, growth
and competitiveness. 'He is the man to carry the ball,' says a senior EU
diplomat. 'He gets things done.'
What is striking is that the 53-year-old Belgian premier contributed to
these successes when political tensions at home caused by high unemployment,
labour unrest and last summer's currency crisis, which threatened to force
the fragile Belgian coalition to abandon its policy of shadowing the D-Mark.
Yet Mr Dehaene plunged ahead with a pact between government and employers,
the most ambitious attempt to curb social spending since the second world
war.
Mr Dehaene likes to portray Belgium as a test-case for the challenges facing
the EU: slow growth, high non-wage costs, high public debt, and political
disenchantment and separatism. He has clearly thought hard about these
issues, despite his cultivated image as Mr Ordinary.
His vision of Europe rejects the notion of a new super-state ruled from
Brussels. True, he supports a single European currency. He would press ahead
faster with a common security and foreign policy, and he favours
streamlining decision-making at the 1996 Maastricht review conference, at
the expense of the national veto.
But he also favours greater devolution of power to the regions. Without such
a shift, there is a risk of the political elite losing touch not only with
public opinion in general, but also with communities and different cultures,
he argues.
Here speaks Flemish man. For more than 15 years, Mr Dehaene has operated
quietly behind the scenes - first as chief of cabinet to then prime minister
Wilfried Martens in 1979, and latterly as prime minister in 1991 - to defuse
tensions between the French and Flemish communities and manage the
devolution of power to the regions of Wallonia, Brussels and Flanders. 'He
solves problems rather than creating them,' says a long-standing colleague.
'He is not an ideologue, he is a pragmatist.'
How far could these skills be transferred to the European level. A senior EU
diplomat says that what the Union needs after Mr Delors is a 'captain, not a
prophet'. People are a little weary of over-arching visions, according to
this view; they just want someone who can make the Union work.
The advantage of Mr Dehaene is that he might have the courage to take on the
task which Mr Delors ducked during his 10 years in Brussels: the
reorganisation of the Commission, a sprawling bureaucracy of competing
fiefdoms in which the 17 (soon to be 21) nationally-appointed commissioners
have staff cohortswho often duplicate and undercut the work of the 10,000
international civil servants.
Yet making the Brussels machinery tick requires more than administrative
ability. It needs a rare combination of intellectual skills and a persuasive
personality which, at his best, Mr Delors clearly possessed. The jury is out
on whether Mr Dehaene has these qualities; but it is by no means clear that
Mr Lubbers or Sir Leon Brittan fit the task either. Right now, the best
advice from tipsters is: sell Brittans, hold Lubbers, buy Dehaene, and just
maybe invest in Sutherland futures.

FT  30 APR 94 / Leading Article: The high yen vice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As soon as a theory of exchange rate determination is generally accepted as
true, events prove it false. This seems to be an iron law of economic life.
Once upon a time changes in trade balances were thought to determine
movements in exchange rates. Then money supplies, prospective inflation and
relative interest rates were believed crucial. Thereupon, prospective
returns on real assets seemed decisive. Now the weakness of the US dollar
and strength of the yen suggest that trade flows are again the major factor.
Other explanations for why the yen has nudged its all-time record high
against the US dollar are not easy to find.
Unless investors have taken leave of their senses, a popular non-economic
explanation - shifts in political confidence - can be rejected. President
Clinton's administration may have had its rocky moments, notably over the
Whitewater affair. It will probably have such moments again. But Japan can
barely boast a government at all. Only this week the Social Democratic party
 -angered by their coalition partners' decision to form a new conservative
grouping, led by Mr Tsutomu Hata's Japan Renewal party - walked out of the
coalition. The socialists thereby deprived the government of a parliamentary
majority just hours after it had elected Mr Hata prime minister.
Changed views about the prospects for inflation may provide part of the
explanation for the recent strength of the yen. Japan has virtually no
consumer price inflation, while producer prices have been falling since
November 1992, by 2.2 per cent in the year to February 1994. Such price
declines are likely to continue, partly because of the strength of the yen,
but also because the latest data belie earlier hopes of recovery.
Industrial production
Japan's industrial production, for example, fell 3.1 per cent in the year to
March 1994. Output was up in March itself, but the Ministry of Trade and
Industry has argued it will fall once more in April and May. In March,
housing starts fell for the first time in 22 months, while unemployment rose
to the highest level in seven years. True, the rate stood at 2.6 per cent,
which demonstrates that Japan's economic problems are not quite like those
of anyone else.
Japan's inflation may turn out to be still lower than had earlier been
thought, but US inflation is unlikely to be much higher. The only thing
likely to frighten markets about prospects for US inflation would be foolish
pressure from the administration on the Federal Reserve. The nominations of
Mr Alan Blinder and Ms Janet Yellen, though self-proclaimed pragmatists on
inflation, are hardly likely to scare the horses that much. It may be
revealing, however, that a lower than expected growth rate in the first
quarter led to a small rise in long-term interest rates.
One reason why US prospects for inflation have hardly deteriorated have been
the increases in short-term interest rates imposed by the Federal Reserve
since early this year. Partly because of this and partly because Japanese
short rates fell in the second half of last year, short-term interest rate
differentials have moved in favour of the US dollar, by almost two
percentage points, since mid-1993 and by almost one percentage point since
the beginning of 1994. Yet since mid-1993, the US dollar has failed to
strengthen against the yen and has even weakened in the course of this year.
Fundamental fact
If changes in nominal returns on short-term securities fail to explain the
strength of the yen, those on longer-term assets are also unpersuasive.
Returns on long-term bonds have been negative everywhere, including in
Japan. Japanese equities did rise 19 per cent between early 1994 and
mid-March, while the US market went nowhere. But more recent news suggests
that economic prospects in Japan are deteriorating.
The fundamental fact underlying the relation between the US dollar and the
yen is the persistence and size of the Japanese current account surpluses,
at Dollars 131bn in 1993 and forecast by the International Monetary Fund at
virtually the same level this year and in 1995. Meanwhile, there has been a
pronounced decline in the willingness of Japanese investors to purchase
long-term foreign assets since the late 1980s. This puts the burden of
offsetting the current account surplus on more price sensitive short term
capital flows.
If the current account is the main factor driving the exchange rate, there
is reason to worry. Higher exchange rates have little medium-term effect on
the Japanese surplus. There is a danger of a vicious circle of stagnation,
high current account surpluses, a higher yen and then still more stagnation.
The best way out of the dilemma would be for the Bank of Japan to lower
interest rates and buy US dollars, driving down the yen and expanding the
economy. Unlike the Fed, which intervened yesterday, it could do this
without limit. In practice, it is too frightened by the experience of the
bubble economy to try. So while bureaucrats and politicians fiddle,
prospects for a strong Japanese recovery burn away.

FT  30 APR 94 / Des res for buyer with Pounds 60m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The potential departure of the Treasury mandarins from their English
Renaissance-style building overlooking Parliament Square opens an attractive
site to the ambitions of property developers and those seeking a prestigious
London base.
The 646,000 sq ft offices, estimated to be worth about Pounds 60m, are
grand, well-located, loaded with contemporary political history - and faced
with refurbishments which may be too costly for the Treasury to bear.
One possibility is that Treasury Chambers will follow the fate of County
Hall, once the home of London's local authority, and provide rich pickings
for the leisure industry.
Whether dedicated to the great chancellors, or a chamber of horrors of the
others, the idea of halls alive with soundtracks and laser on the theme of
British government could prove irresistible to theme-park magnates. It has
the added benefit of being close to many of London's most popular tourist
sights.
Property developers suggest that a mixture of up-market apartments, a hotel
and offices would be its most likely future, with a high level of Far
Eastern interest in such developments. Alternatively the building could
provide an elegant headquarters for an international institution.
The completion of the new Gatt trade treaty has resulted in a beefed-up
World Trade Organisation, which will need more space than Gatt's current
Geneva base offers. The WTO is talking to the Swiss about expansion, but it
has received offers of buildings from Bonn, which is losing Germany's seat
of government to Berlin.
The problems for any new tenant would be the same as the Treasury's in terms
of the high costs of upgrading the building. Commercial property advisers
say only wholesale refurbishment would bring it up to modern standards.
The building's use would be constrained by its Grade II listing, which
covers internal features including a central marble staircase, panelled
offices and a circular inner courtyard.
Westminster City Council, the local authority, is wary of any use that would
generate traffic, particularly a stream of coaches, around Whitehall.
Another scheme for which the Treasury might be suited is the 'one-stop shop'
for international investors being promoted by the City Development
Corporation and Westminster council. Mooted as a contact point for the
international community and a public relations and information service for
London, it would house exhibitions and conferences.
Other interested parties might include the media, with the site offering
clear advantages for 24-hour news stations.
An unknown quantity, however, is the degree to which security considerations
would come into play. With Whitehall full of secret tunnels, communications
rooms and nuclear shelters, it may be that the site would have to be rented
to an organisation on the 'inside track'.
This might well rule out the chances of it becoming a 'centre of financial
excellence' through the takeover of its corridors by the London School of
Economics, which tried so hard to get County Hall.
The LSE's director, Mr John Ashworth, points out that the prospect of 5,000
LSE students camped so close to Downing Street is a scheme unlikely to
appeal to those in power. 'Can you imagine the signs that would be visible?'

FT  30 APR 94 / Adams sees little hope of ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams has dealt a further blow to hopes of an early end to violence
in Northern Ireland by warning that the IRA is unlikely to call a unilateral
halt to its 25-year armed campaign.
In an interview that coincides with a renewed upsurge of sectarian shootings
in the province, the president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, urged
all sides to lay down their arms, saying that 'demilitarisation' was what
was needed.
Meanwhile, security forces yesterday confirmed they had found the body of a
man near the border town of Newry. Earlier, the IRA claimed it had shot dead
an alleged informer.
The murder takes to 10 the number of killings in the province in nine days -
the worst outbreak of violence since the Downing Street declaration was
signed in December.
Mr Adams's remarks, published in an Austrian newspaper, came as he was urged
to 'walk away' from the IRA's gunmen by Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of
the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party.
Mr Mallon's appeal followed the killing of a Protestant father-of-three by
terrorist gunmen in Armagh on Thursday night.
The Newry and Armagh MP said that if leadership meant anything, it meant
walking away from the perpetrators of 'this type of gross sectarian
slaughter'. 'If Mr Adams is serious, he should walk away,' Mr Mallon said.
Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said the security
situation would get worse unless London recognised that the declaration had
run its course. 'There is no point in bargaining with the IRA,' he said.
Downing Street last night reiterated that it wanted a permanent end to IRA
violence.
Mr Adams, interviewed by Der Standard, said: 'We need a demilitarisation, I
have committed myself to that.
'I have called on all those involved to put down their weapons - the IRA,
the British, the loyalists. And I stand by that.
'I believe we are in a crisis at the moment. If the British stonewall and
refuse to move, everything will freeze - the loyalists will step up their
murder campaign and the British will intensify the military occupation.'
Mr Adams said he was not interested in a 'temporary or partial peace', and
said it was 'most unlikely' that republican forces would unilaterally pledge
a permanent ceasefire.
'It is going too slowly for me,' he said, expressing frustration that 'we
are hostage to the right wing of the British Conservative party'.

FT  30 APR 94 / BCCI official was just 'functionary'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior Bank of Credit and Commerce International official accused of
helping to fraudulently boost the bank's profits acted honestly and on the
instructions of Mr Swaleh Naqvi, the bank's chief executive, the Old Bailey
was told yesterday.
Mr Anthony Glass QC, who was making an opening defence statement on behalf
of Mr Imran Imam, said many of the facts before the jury were not disputed.
Mr Imam, a former BCCI accounts officer, had not disclosed to the bank's
auditors details of BCCI guarantees to underwrite multi-million dollar loans
to wealthy clients. The prosecution has claimed Mr Imam did this to present
a false picture of BCCI's profitability to the outside world.
Mr Imam denies six charges including conspiring to conceal documents,
conspiring to falsify records and furnishing false information.
Mr Glass said Mr Imam had been only a 'minor functionary' in the bank and
had acted purely in an administrative capacity. He had carried out
instructions given to him by Mr Naqvi and other superiors.
The trial resumes on Tuesday.
The jury in the trial of Mr Nazmu Virani, the property entrepreneur, had
still not reached verdicts yesterday. It will resume its deliberations today
and, if necessary, on Monday.
Mr Virani, who is accused of helping artificially to boost the profits of
BCCI, denies charges of theft, false accounting and furnishing false
information.

FT  30 APR 94 / Invesco reduces unit trust charge in quest for clients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Invesco, the fund management group, is to cut the initial charge across the
range of its unit trusts from the industry norm of 5.25 per cent to 3 per
cent from Tuesday.
The move signifies further competition in the unit trust market, which has
so far concentrated its energies on price-cutting in tax-free personal
equity plans.
Mr Alan Wren, managing director of Invesco fund managers, said the decision
was 'purely commercial' with the intention being to grab greater market
share and attract longer-term investors.
He said that in the past two years Invesco's funds under management in the
UK had barely grown compared with a market average growth of between 50 per
cent and 100 per cent. The group had Pounds 1.26bn funds under management in
the UK at the end of last December, according to the Association of Unit and
Investment Funds. Two years ago it was one of the 10 largest fund managers
in the UK but is now just outside the top 20.
Invesco has been dogged by adverse publicity in Britain. This has undermined
the group's ability to attract clients and culminated last year in a fine of
Pounds 750,000 imposed by Imro, the self-regulating body for investment
management.
Imro and the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator,
acknowledged that the group had taken steps to change its management and to
implement compliance procedures that should prevent a repetition of rule
breaches.
Twenty senior executives left the company last year, and it is still in the
process of administrative reorganisation and withdrawal from areas other
than the core business of fund management.
This month it reported sharply improved pre-tax profits for the year to the
end of December of Pounds 33.4m, against Pounds 12.6m the previous year.

FT  30 APR 94 / Conservatives score 'own goal' in poll campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, JOHN AUTHERS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday said that the Conservatives had scored the biggest own goal
of the local election campaign after Tory party managers accidentally
confirmed they were trailing badly in the opinion polls.
Tory hopes were dealt a fresh blow last night when a poll carried out by
MORI for The Times showed them in third place behind Labour and the Liberal
Democrats.
The latest MORI poll, carried out between April 21 and 25, puts Tory support
among individuals who are eligible to vote next week and who intend to do so
at just 20 per cent, compared with 48 per cent for Labour and 25 per cent
for the Liberal Democrats.
The Tories' own figures on voting intentions, confirming that Labour has a
commanding lead over the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, were revealed
in a press release issued by Central Office on behalf of Mr John Patten,
education secretary.
The document contained a Gallup poll for the Conservative party showing that
77 per cent of those polled were in favour of national school tests and that
there was 75 per cent support for the publication of school examination
results.
The Gallup figures also disclosed the overall voting intentions of people
polled between April 13 and 18. This showed that, two weeks before the local
elections, Labour had a 47 per cent lead in the polls, with the Tories on 26
per cent, the Liberal Democrats on 24 per cent and others on 3 per cent. The
Tories' figures are almost identical to the findings of a Gallup poll for
the Daily Telegraph over the same week. Another MORI poll for The Times
taken between April 18 and 25 suggested support for the Tories was at its
lowest for 15 years.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said the inclusion of the
figures was 'the most striking own goal' of the campaign.
The Liberal Democrats were also quick to exploit the Tory poll, saying that
it showed they were within 'striking distance' of the Tories.
Mr Gerald Malone, Tory deputy chairman, said the Tory vote was holding up
when compared with a Gallup poll conducted between March 29 and April 4,
while the Labour vote had fallen 4.5 points.

FT  30 APR 94 / Business hesitates over cash for D-day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies approached for sponsorship for D-day events have become hesitant
about committing themselves in the face of hostility from veterans'
associations such as the Royal British Legion.
GEC and Hanson are thought to have been approached by the London public
relations agency Lowe Bell - acting on behalf of the Department of National
Heritage - to back a programme of events.
These would include a possible concert in Hyde Park involving Dame Vera
Lynn, the singer and 'forces sweetheart' of the second world war.
The Royal British Legion, which represents 750,000 people and is the largest
ex-service organisation in the country, has made known its opposition.
It said yesterday: 'We do not know the position on the Hyde Park event
because it is very sketchy. But yes we do feel that any event should be in
keeping with the occasion and we are not sure that a concert of this kind
would be appropriate. We have nothing against Dame Vera Lynn, of course.'
GEC said yesterday: 'Nothing has been decided about D-day.' Hanson, another
of Britain's largest companies, would only say: 'We are examining what
contribution we can make to D-day.'
The group declined to say whether it had been approached for sponsorship.
The Department of National Heritage confirmed that Lowe Bell had been hired
to sound out industrial companies and other organisations, including media
groups, about the possibilities for sponsorship, but said nothing had been
decided about the Hyde Park event.
The department last week issued assurances to veterans that the anniversary
would not be trivialised.
The Royal British Legion was at pains to point out that the national
programme being contemplated by the national heritage department was what
was at issue.
The programme of commemoration services in Portsmouth and Normandy, some of
which will be attended by the Queen and other heads of state, was not in
contention.

A Chicago-based company which manufactures electronic components is to set
up a plant at East Kilbride, near Glasgow, and hopes to create 400 jobs
during the next three years.
The latest addition to the substantial number of electronics companies in
what is often called Silicon Glen - the central belt of Scotland - is
International Components Corporation, which employs 900 people worldwide.
It designs and manufactures battery chargers for mobile products such as
laptop computers and mobile telephones.
Mr Jim Gaza, president of ICC, said it was setting up a plant in Europe to
meet surging demand.
The 50,000 sq ft facility at East Kilbride would carry out assembly and
testing.
Mr Gaza said ICC was attracted to Scotland because it would soon have ready
access to continental Europe via the Channel tunnel, and also because it had
a flexible workforce with experience of the electronics industry.
The Scottish electronics industry includes computer manufacturers
International Business Machines and Compaq, while Motorola has a
mobile-telephone plant.
This week the Scottish Office said output in the electronics industry rose
by 8 per cent in 1992, accounting for 20 per cent of Scottish manufacturing.
Employment fell 2 per cent to 41,500.

FT  30 APR 94 / Banks seek to restrict societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading banks have launched a campaign to stop building societies being
given a new range of freedoms as a result of the government's review of the
Building Societies Act 1986.
The British Bankers' Association has submitted a memorandum to the Treasury
which argues that the existing regulatory regime for societies is justified,
given their unique privileges.
The association argues that changes to societies' powers should be looked at
on the merits of each case, but that the legal framework - which some
societies want removed - should be retained so long as they are mutual
organisations.
In recent months competition between banks and building societies for market
share in mortgage lending and for retail deposits has intensified.
The review was announced in January as part of the government's
de-regulation initiative. The first conclusions, which are due to be
released next month, are expected to include an increase in the ceiling on
the amount of money that societies can raise on the wholesale markets, from
40 per cent to 50 per cent.
They are also expected to reduce the need for societies to communicate
individually with their millions of members in some circumstances.
Abbey National and TSB have been among the most vocal banks arguing that
societies should not receive greater freedoms without having to become more
accountable to their members.
While the emphasis in the association's memorandum is on maintaining the
existing restrictions, some banks would like to see the rules on takeovers
relaxed.
Mr Peter Birch, chief executive of Abbey National, has proposed ending the
power of societies' boards to block an offer from another organisation by
refusing to put it to society members for a decision.

FT  30 APR 94 / Lancer Boss staff unite to back German bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior management and employees at Lancer Boss, the Bedfordshire-based
lift-truck producer which went into receivership this month, are backing a
takeover by Jungheinrich of Germany.
It emerged yesterday, however, that the Hamburg-based company is facing a
serious challenge for Lancer Boss from Terex, the US industrial and
construction machinery group, which entered the lift-truck business in 1992.
Mr Allan Griffiths, a partner at Grant Thornton and one of the
administrative receivers at Lancer Boss, said there was a shortlist of three
potential purchasers for the businesses.
According to a senior manager at Lancer Boss, two 'very serious' bids have
been made by Jungheinrich and Terex. The third approach is understood to
come from an entrepreneur based in South Africa.
A management buy-out is said to have been discussed but according to the
senior manager there is no buy-out proposal at present. Potential management
'buy-ins' have also been proposed.
Amid continuing speculation about the identity of potential purchasers of
Lancer Boss, one report suggested that Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate,
may also be interested. On Thursday the ITV television programme Anglia News
said it had received a fax, purportedly from the receivers to departmental
heads at Lancer Boss, to which a handwritten addition names Hanson and
Jungheinrich.
Hanson said yesterday that it never commented on rumours or market
speculation. The senior manager at Lancer Boss said staff from Grove, the
Hanson crane company, had visited Lancer Boss's Leighton Buzzard site but
that Hanson's involvement was a 'non-starter' and probably too late.
He said staff were solidly behind the Jungheinrich bid, which would produce
a 'much better fit' than a takeover by Terex. Managers of the UK company
were even prepared to offer a 'seven-figure sum' to top up the German
company's offer.
Jungheinrich has already bought Steinbock Boss, the former German subsidiary
of Lancer Boss, from a German receiver, and the trading relationship between
Steinbock and Lancer is crucial to the Bedfordshire company.
Mr Simon Valente, convener for the GMBU general union at Lancer Boss, said
Jungheinrich had told him that it wanted to 'invest money, secure jobs and
recruit people'.
Mr Griffiths, meanwhile, said he was 'reasonably confident' that he would be
in a position to complete a sale of Lancer Boss by the end of next week.

FT  30 APR 94 / Tory peer criticises finance bill verbiage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Cockfield, the Conservative peer and former Treasury minister,
yesterday criticised the length and complexity of the finance bill as it
completed its passage through the House of Lords.
He contrasted the verbiage of the 259 clauses and 26 schedules in the
462-page bill with the brevity of the legislation that introduced the
pay-as-you-earn income tax regime in the 1940s. Lord Cockfield said that
only 10 or 15 pages had been needed to establish PAYE, which remained the
bedrock of the taxation system.
He said the impetus provided by earlier Conservative administrations to
simplify the tax system had been lost, and legislation was being introduced
that was 'more and more complex, more difficult and more unintelligible'.
Lord Cockfield called on ministers to devote more effort to the style of
legislation.
Lord Boyd-Carpenter, another Conservative peer and former Treasury minister,
said the tax increases in the Bill had been made necessary by the
government's failure to restrain expenditure.
The bill is expected to receive royal assent on Tuesday.

FT  30 APR 94 / Car service industry faces squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A harshly competitive future is being predicted for the car repair and
servicing industry. Several thousand outlets are forecast to close as a
result of improved car reliability and the projected ability of many
vehicles to travel 30,000 miles between services by the end of the decade -
more than double the present norm.
This means the retail market for servicing and repairs will grow in value by
just 14 per cent between now and 2000 from Pounds 6.4bn to Pounds 7.2bn - a
decline in real terms, says Market Facts &amp; Business Information, the
research group.
As a result some 3,600 of the nearly 20,000 independent companies in the
sector are likely to disappear by 2000, according to a study of the sector
by the group.
It says the heightened competition will mean that those jostling for a share
of the market - franchised dealers, 'fast-fit' chains and 'superstore'
outlets such as Halfords in addition to the independents - will be unable to
increase charges to offset the decrease in volumes.
They will also face demands for higher standards of service from motorists,
who will require longer opening hours, a wider range of services and
guarantees of quality on workmanship.
'Garages need to realise that there is a significant difference between
providing the various services motorists need, and the standard of service
quality with which those services are delivered,' the study's author, Mr
Robert Macnab, said.
Interviewing 1,000 motorists for the study, the group found that drivers
still largely mistrust the retail service and repair trade.
As a result, it concludes, the successful participants in the market will
increase their share of the business by using high-quality service as a
competitive advantage. 'The losers will be those who pay lip service to
customer-service quality,' it says.
Independent garages are most at risk, the report warns, and adds that there
will also be a further decline in franchised dealerships which make up the
remainder of the 31,000 companies operating in the sector.

FT  30 APR 94 / Last round-up for landfill cowboys: Taxpayers may foot the
bill for higher waste disposal standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At midnight tonight tough new rules aimed at driving 'cowboys' out of the
waste management industry come into force.
The effect, according to waste companies, will be to treble or quadruple the
cost of rubbish disposal by the end of the decade. While large waste
companies have welcomed the rules they warn that the costs will eventually
be passed on to industry and consumers.
According to Mr Steve Charles of Redland, the building materials group that
runs more than 20 of the UK's landfill rubbish dumps, 'the new regulations
certainly will impose more monitoring requirements and more costs, but we
have been following many of these (practices) for some time'.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, has argued that
taxpayers could be left with the bill for cleaning up landfills whose
operators have rushed to hand in their licences before the new rules apply.
The new rules, whose introduction has been delayed for a year while
contradictions with European directives were sorted out, will require
holders of landfill licences to:
Demonstrate that they are 'fit and proper' to run the site.
Monitor landfill-sites after they are closed, possibly for 50 years, and
clean up any pollution.
Demonstrate that they have the financial resources to meet these long-term
liabilities.
The rules aim to curb the problem of ill-designed and poorly managed
landfills leaking poisons into the soil and water tables, and emitting
polluting gases such as methane.
About 5,000 UK licences were in issue in 1990. Many were held by farmers or
small quarry owners, who gained extra revenue by allowing rubbish to be
tipped on their land.
About 90 per cent of UK waste goes to landfill, a small amount to recycling
and the rest to incineration. The cost of landfill has remained low in
Britain compared with continental Europe because the UK has a large number
of unfilled quarries from the excavation of building materials.
Although environmentalists fear that 'cowboy' operators, anxious to avoid
the new liabilities, will have rushed to hand back licences to local
authorities before tomorrow's deadline, there are no national figures on how
many licences have been surrendered in the past two years since the form of
the new rules became clear.
However Mr Steve Webb, policy director of the National Association of Waste
Disposal Contractors, which represents most of the waste industry, said: 'My
impression is that it has been more dribs and drabs than a rush. If the
pay-off for getting dodgy operators out of the industry is that they
surrender their licences, so be it. If they were unable to meet their
liabilities, the cost would come back to the taxpayer anyway.'
The Department of the Environment has estimated that the new rules could
increase the cost of waste disposal through landfill by 80p per tonne.
Typical charges range from Pounds 3 to Pounds 16 a tonne.
However, the association estimates that there could be a 140 per cent rise
in prices in the near future, although present overcapacity, caused partly
by the recession, may delay this for some months.
Mr Chris Murphy of the Institute of Wastes Management, a professional
association for waste engineers and managers, estimates that prices could
rise by three or four times by 2000 as the cost of opening new sites rises.
But waste companies say the new rules create new problems. No commercial
operator is now likely to take over a half-filled landfill from another
private company or local authority because of the unknown pollution risk.
The companies say it has also become nearly impossible to get long-term
insurance to cover pollution risks.

FT  30 APR 94 / Ford cuts dealer margins on its executive range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford's Granada and Scorpio executive models yesterday joined the list of
vehicles where manufacturers are slashing or eliminating dealer profit
margins in order to cut list prices - and the company car tax liability of
purchasers.
Ford would not disclose the sizes of the cuts in dealer margins but they
reduce the list price of the dearest model, the Scorpio 2.9 litre 24-valve
estate, to Pounds 26,545 - including value added tax - from Pounds 29,310.
The cheapest model, the Executive 2.0L, falls to Pounds 15,995 from Pounds
18,100. The cuts imply a reduction in margins to almost nothing for the
cheaper cars and to about 5 per cent on the more expensive models.
The Granada/Scorpio range has recently been sold on an official dealer
margin of 10 per cent. This followed a decision by Ford and other leading
carmakers last year to reduce the traditional margins of about 15 per cent.
Earlier this month Vauxhall launched its Omega model with a list price based
on a 5 per cent margin for dealers.
Ford has already gone a step further with its new Probe coupe. The cheapest
model costs Pounds 15,995 and dealers are simply being given a handling
charge of about Pounds 1,000 with no formal profit margin.
Rover is also understood to be launching two 'tax-beater' versions of its
Rover 800 executive cars, where dealers will receive only a Pounds 500
handling charge. Volvo and Renault have taken similar action.
The moves will save buyers substantial amounts on their company car tax
bills under the scheme based on list prices introduced earlier this month.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Company car drivers could be playing at least as big a role as thieves and
vandals in sending insurance rates soaring, according to a survey of
accident rates.
Last year more than eight out of 10 drivers employed by companies using the
Shrewsbury-based Fleet Management Services had an accident, according to its
survey.
The survey analysed reports to FMS's insurance claims management department
last year.
Directors and senior managers were the worst offenders, while the most
common form of accident - 10 per cent of the total - was hitting
obstructions while reversing.

FT  30 APR 94 / Proposed tobacco advert ban attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Newspaper and magazine publishers lined up yesterday to oppose a private
members' bill that would outlaw tobacco advertising, warning that such a ban
would 'amount to censorship and set a dangerous precedent'.
The bill, proposed by Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP for Rother Valley, is due
to reach its report stage on May 13. The government, which opposes the bill,
was surprised by the scale of support for the measure at second reading when
MPs voted by 227 to 17 in favour of it.
In an attempt to pre-empt the bill, it is still possible the government will
announce before May 13 that it has reached agreement with tobacco
manufacturers on stricter voluntary controls on advertising.
MPs are being urged by newspaper and magazine publishers to 'reaffirm their
support for the freedom of the press, the freedom of speech and the freedom
of consumer choice by rejecting any attempts to outlaw advertising of
products legally and freely available in the UK'.
A statement circulated to MPs yesterday was signed by industry groups
including the Newspaper Publishers Association, representing national
newspapers; the Newspaper Society, which represents the regional and local
press; and the Periodical Publishers Association, representing magazines.
The Advertising Association, the umbrella group which has been co-ordinating
opposition to the bill, calculates that the publishing industry stands to
lose about Pounds 50m a year in advertising revenue if a ban goes ahead.

Mr Palmer told the conference in Brighton of the National Association of
Pension Funds: 'Many people are justifiably concerned about commission bias.
But I'm not sure that changing the commission structure will be a panacea
which ushers in a new utopia.'
Mr Palmer also said that the Treasury and the Securities and Investments
Board were still concerned about the ability of a small life insurer to
regulate the sales activities of a much larger tied agent, such as a
building society.

FT  30 APR 94 / Indonesian bank scandal investigation widens: Private
banking benefits as clients move over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Indonesians weary of corruption and secrecy in government and big
business, the recent sight of some of President Suharto's most influential
advisers being summoned by the attorney general's office for questioning
about a Dollars 430m (Pounds 286m) bank scandal has been particularly
invigorating.
The crippling bad debt problems of the Indonesian state banks - often the
result of collusion over loans between powerful officials and the ethnic
Chinese businessmen who dominate the economy - have been a topic for gossip
in Jakarta for the past three years.
Only in the past two months, however, has the matter been publicly aired.
The authorities have arrested businessman Mr Eddy Tansil and five officials
of the state-owned PT Bank Pembangunan Indonesia (Bapindo) in connection
with a Dollars 430m letter of credit supposedly earmarked for petrochemical
projects in Java. With accrued interest the loan should be worth some
Dollars 620m, but prosecutors allege some of the money was diverted to Hong
Kong and the loan is not being serviced.
The Bapindo letter of credit is only one of more than 40 bad or doubtful big
loans of Dollars 50m or more believed to be on the books of the seven state
banks, but private commercial bankers have praised Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, the
finance minister, for at least starting to bring the bad debt crisis out
into the open.
Mr Muhammad announced that 21.2 per cent - or about Dollars 7bn - of the
outstanding loans extended by the state banks were classified as bad or
doubtful, compared with 17.4 per cent at the end of 1992, and 6 per cent in
1990; the true situation may be even worse, according to economists and
bankers in Jakarta, because Mr Muhammad's figures are based on the banks'
own, probably over-optimistic, assessments of their loans.
To the delight of Indonesian liberals pressing for a more open and
accountable government, those questioned at the attorney general's office
over the Bapindo scandal include Mr JB Sumarlin, former finance minister and
now chairman of the Supreme Audit Agency, and Mr Sudomo, the former senior
minister in charge of political and security affairs who provided a
reference for Mr Tansil; their testimony will be used in a forthcoming trial
of Mr Tansil and the Bapindo suspects.
The disclosure of the extent of the difficulties faced by Indonesian state
banks has had both good and bad results for the Indonesian authorities. It
may have dented international confidence in the banking sector; the country
has more than 230 commercial banks, but the seven state banks account for
half of banking business and the top 10 private banks for a further 35 per
cent.
However the scandal has helped the growing private bank sector (some of the
state banks' more reputable clients have moved their custom to the stronger
private banks) and shown the seriousness of government efforts to curb
'memo' lending - the informal system whereby bankers approve loans on the
basis of an instruction from an influential official rather than on the
economic merits of the scheme for which the money is theoretically being
disbursed.
A government programme to reform and recapitalise the state banks - financed
by the Indonesian budget, by converting central bank loans to the state
banks into equity, and by a Dollars 300m loan from the World Bank approved
in 1992 - is already well under way, although the troubled Bapindo itself is
excluded from World Bank support.
The authorities have hired Kroll Associates, the international detectives,
to hunt for assets of Golden Key, Mr Tansil's group of companies. They have
raised the possibility of bringing in foreign managers to clean up the
banking system. Disclosures about the activities of the banks are
nevertheless likely to be restricted by the desire to protect the Suharto
family and other influential Indonesians.
Mr Hutomo Mandala Putra, better known as 'Tommy' Suharto, the president's
youngest son, had a stake in one of the Golden Key companies but it is
claimed that he sold it before the controversial loan was made in 1992. The
Bapindo-Golden Key loan agreement, meanwhile, seems to have disappeared, if
it ever existed.
'The squashing of the information is already going on,' said one
Jakarta-based economist who has followed the Bapindo saga.
Or, as a banker put it, 'They are struggling between making a clean breast
of things and not being able to be too open about what happened.'

FT  30 APR 94 / Russia and Latvia to sign troop pull-out
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An agreement to pull out the remaining Russian troops from Latvia is
expected to be signed today in Moscow by the leaders of the two states.
The agreement will mean that only Estonia, the smallest of the three former
Soviet Baltic countries, is at odds with Russia over troop withdrawal.
Negotiators agreed on the last issue between them - that of payment of
pensions and other benefits to the 22,300 Russian military veterans still
living in Latvia - at a meeting yesterday in the resort town of Jurmala.
The agreement allows the officers to stay in Latvia with benefits, but not
to obtain citizenship - a clause which nationalists in the Latvian
parliament say gives retrospective justification to the occupation of Latvia
by Soviet troops between 1940 and 1991.
The Latvians have also agreed to rent out the Skrunda radar base to the
Russians for the next four years.
The sudden worsening in relations between the two countries when a decree
signed by President Boris Yeltsin appeared to suggest that Russia wished to
keep troops in Latvia appears to have been patched over.
Mr Guntis Ulmanis, Latvian president and Mr Valdis Birkavs, prime minister,
are due in Moscow today to sign the treaty with Mr Yeltsin - a treaty which
should remove all 10,500 Russian troops by the end of August.
The deal, if carried through, focuses all attention on Estonia, where fewer
than 3,000 troops remain but where talks have proved fruitless.

FT  30 APR 94 / Foundations laid for Palestinian state: Julian Ozanne
considers the impact of the Israeli-PLO economic agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's economic agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation gives the Palestinians the ability to influence their economy
for the first time in modern history.
More important for the PLO, the agreement allows for limited independent
economic decision making. This could lay the foundation for a future
Palestinian state the PLO hopes to achieve in negotiations with Israel which
are due to start in 1995.
'People will start seeing Palestinian ports, airports, television stations,
economic institutions,' said Mr Nabil Shaath, senior PLO negotiator. 'They
will see a real opportunity to develop their future.'
Yet the accord, essentially a free trade and customs union, keeps the
Palestinian economy largely within Israel's broad macro-economic trade and
taxation policy, recognising the dependence of the territories on their
neighbouring economic giant for the foreseeable future.
The Palestinian economy, backed by Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) of
international aid over five years, can thus expect to enhance the benefits
from association with Israel's Dollars 67bn economy, including continued
migrant labour.
The challenge will be to solve massive unemployment, overhaul neglected
infrastructure and reverse years of stagnation which have left the 1.9m
Palestinians in the occupied territories with per capita income one seventh
that of Israelis.
While critics from both sides will attack the agreement, the great
achievement of the accord has been to balance the economic reality of
Palestinian dependence on the protected and regulated Israeli economy, with
the PLO's political need to show its people that it is on the way to
statehood and economic independence.
In all of the areas of the agreement - trade, taxation, monetary policy,
agriculture and labour - Israel and the PLO have shown their ability to
strike this difficult balance. In trade the two economies will have a
similar import and customs policy, reflecting Israel's staggered trade
liberalisation which envisages reducing all import duties to a uniform 15
per cent rate by 1998.
The Palestinians will be able to import a long list of goods at lower
customs rates to be determined by the incoming Palestinian National
Authority. Most of the goods on this list will be priority materials for the
construction sector. Palestinians will also be able to import cars duty
free, import and price oil products freely except for petrol (for which the
pump price may not be more that 15 per cent below the Israeli price) and
import goods in limited quantities from Arab countries that do not currently
trade with Israel.
A Palestinian tax authority will set its own direct tax policy, including
income, corporate, property and municipal taxes. However it will largely
adopt Israel valued added tax regime, although at a rate of 15-16 per cent
rather than Israel's 17 per cent.
Israel has agreed to end the ban on the importation of Palestinian
agricultural produce which has been in force since the Jewish state captured
the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967. From the day the self-rule agreement
is implemented, Palestinians can export all products freely except five
items - tomatoes, cucumbers, potatoes, eggs and broiler chickens. These
products will be subject to increasing quotas over four years to be phased
out in year five. (Agriculture contributes at least 25 per cent of the
Palestinian economy and employs a quarter of the workforce.)
The Palestinians will establish a monetary authority to regulate and
supervise banks, set liquidity ratios on deposits, manage foreign currency
reserves and oversee foreign exchange transactions. However, the two sides
have yet to agree whether the Palestinians will be able to issue their own
currency. In the meantime, the Israeli shekel and Jordanian dinar will
remain legal tender.
Both sides agreed that Palestinians will need to find expanded work
opportunities in Israel although, due to Israel's security concerns, no
final figure has been agreed on the number of Palestinian workers Israel
will allow into its economy.
Increasing the number of Palestinians who work in Israel from the present
figure of about 16,000 to at least 100,0000 is critical to the short to
medium term viability of the Palestinian economy. Israel will transfer 75
per cent of the income tax it collects on Palestinian migrant workers to the
Palestinian authority.
The agreement will apply to the Gaza Strip and West Bank enclave of Jericho,
due to come under Palestinian self-rule after next Wednesday's signing of an
agreement in Cairo. The economic accord will later apply to the rest of the
West Bank, after Palestinian elections due in July but almost certain to be
delayed.
To strike the agreement, both sides have had to risk the fury of domestic
opposition. Israel will face criticism from protected interests in its
agriculture and manufacturing sector who will be seriously undermined. The
PLO has already been accused by many Palestinians of selling out the
aspiration for an independent economy after more than a quarter century of
Israeli occupation.
But western economists believe both sides have been wise to choose economic
pragmatism over political nationalism.

FT  30 APR 94 / South African Elections: S Africa poll chaos casts doubt on
result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ULUNDI, KWAZULU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's first all-race elections may yet turn out to have been
relatively free and fair; but if they do, no thanks will be owed to the
Independent Electoral Commission, the body charged with conducting the poll.
Though polling took place in an atmosphere of political tolerance
unprecedented in South Africa - a tribute to the spirit of ordinary South
Africans who put rivalries aside for a time - the IEC has managed,
singlehandedly, to cast doubt on the fairness of the vote.
Through incompetence compounded by deceit, the Commission provided countless
invitations to fraud. And the sad irony is that the Commission's records are
in such disarray that no one will ever know - or at least be able to prove -
just how many illegalities actually took place.
The catalogue of IEC inefficiencies and negligence would be funny if its
consequences were not so serious. On the eve of the poll, scores of idle IEC
media officials were unable to provide the name of even one polling station
in Soweto, the biggest black township in the nation. When details were
finally furnished, they turned out to be incorrect.
But that was no more than annoying. According to IEC's own officials, the
commission has no idea of the location of the 35m ballot papers despatched
for the poll; papers were sent to central distribution points, but what
happened to them after that, no one knows. When reports of shortages started
came in, it printed more, but these have no serial numbers or counterfoils,
making it impossible to reconcile them afterwards.
Appropriately, the commission does not know exactly how many extra papers
were printed, because some were done locally. Estimates range from 8m to
12m.
Of the additional papers, some 3m were sent to the Eastern Cape for the
Transkei 'homeland,' where shortages were serious. But the whole of the
Transkei has only 1.57m potential voters. Some 10m ballot papers had already
been sent for the Eastern Cape, including Transkei - three times the total
number of voters in the combined areas. No one knows what happened to those
original ballots.
There can be few more open invitations to fraud than to send excess ballot
papers to an area such as Transkei, its administration corrupt and chaotic,
its chief minister an ANC candidate.
Even before the voting, Transkei head Gen Bantu Holomisa symbolically handed
over the keys of the 'homeland' to the ANC. It is difficult to believe that
he and his supporters could not find ways of using excess ballot papers to
improve their party's performance.
The tragedy is that no one will ever know whether they have done so - or
whether the rival Inkatha Freedom Party has done the same in KwaZulu.
In both areas, electoral officers are almost entirely drawn from the
'homeland' civil service, and neither civil service employs many people who
do not toe the ruling party line.
In almost every case, agents from the dominant party are the only ones
present at polling stations - along with IEC monitors, again local people
with predictable party sympathies, and international observers who make
fleeting visits which could never detect secret frauds.
No records are of those who have voted, and there is no voters roll, so
there is nothing to stop electoral officers from completing a few thousand
ballots and stuffing them into boxes undetected. In both areas, temporary
voter cards are issued on the flimsiest proof of identity and age. In
KwaZulu, the word of the local chief or induna (headman) is sufficient; but
chiefs are paid by the KwaZulu government and are solidly behind Inkatha.
Given a system with so few in-built controls, it will be impossible to tell
whether electoral officials, party agents, or the two working together
colluded to stuff ballot boxes with illegal papers - though if it turns out
that 25m or 30m South Africans voted, far more than the 22m estimated voting
population, this will be a clue.
Not to be put off by facts, Judge Johann Kriegler, the IEC chairman, has
already declared the election an 'outstanding success.' One can only wonder
how he would define a failure.
For though violent political intimidation, so much a feature of the election
campaign, was totally absent from the poll, the administrative mess
engineered by the IEC could still jeopardise the result. One could assume
that fraud on both sides will largely balance out (though smaller, cleaner
parties will suffer); or take a charitable view of human nature and assume
few irregularities took place.
Any element of doubt could still cause political problems in the new South
Africa.

The US and South Korea have rejected a proposal by North Korea to replace
the armistice agreement ending the Korean War of 1950-53 with a peace treaty
between Pyongyang and Washington. Washington and Seoul said the dispute over
North Korean nuclear inspections must be resolved first before a peace
treaty would be considered.
North Korea has revived the peace treaty proposal, one of its main
diplomatic goals, as part of an attempt to win a security guarantee from the
US, possibly in exchange for allowing full nuclear inspections. Pyongyang
has refused to consider signing a peace treaty with Seoul by claiming South
Korea is not a signatory to the armistice.
North Korea has threatened not to participate further in meetings of the
military armistice commission if negotiations are not opened with the US on
a peace agreement. It has also warned that it will try to disband the
neutral nations supervisory commission, including Sweden, Switzerland and
Poland, that oversees the armistice agreement.

The Polish government has told Solidarity it will consider removal of wage
controls if the trade union agrees to a highly controversial reform of the
country's pension system which has been long demanded by the International
Monetary Fund. Yesterday Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister (left),
criticised Solidarity for organising strike action but offered to talk about
the union's demands within the framework of a tripartite committee bringing
together representatives of unions, employers and the government which also
met yesterday. Pensions are linked to wage levels throughout the economy and
increase periodically as wages rise.
Mr Pawlak said removal of state wage controls by the end of this year would
have to be accompanied by a change to indexing pensions. Economists have
long warned that the present system represents an impossible burden on the
state budget.

The four central European countries agreed yesterday to advance the

agreed on fresh cuts in customs duties on industrial goods of between a
quarter and a third to take effect from July 1 this year.
Under the terms of the 1993 Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA)
about half of regional trade is already free and another large class of
goods will be liberalised at the end of 1996. Yesterday's additional accord

<TEXT>
Mr Eddie Antar, 46-year-old perpetrator of one of the biggest stockmarket
swindles in US corporate history, was yesterday sentenced by a federal court
in Newark, New Jersey, to 12 1/2 years in prison for racketeering,
conspiracy and fraud.
The founder and former chairman of the Crazy Eddie electronics store chain
was also ordered to repay Dollars 121m (Pounds 80m) to shareholders who lost
their money when the company went bankrupt. Mr Antar said he would appeal.
Mr Antar was convicted in July last year on 17 counts relating to the
swindle. The prosecution said he pocketed Dollars 75m by selling shares in
Crazie Eddie at a price artificially inflated by phoney statements he made
about the company's financial position.
Crazie Eddie grew in the 1980s from one family-owned store in Brooklyn to a
chain of 43 stores. After it went public in 1984 it became a stock market
flyer, but only because Mr Antar was fiddling the books to suggest that the
enterprise was booming. One manouevre involved flying out of the US with
company cash strapped to his body and re-cycling the funds as company
revenues to bamboozle Wall Street analysts.
The truth emerged after he lost control of the company to a dissident
shareholder group in 1987, but Mr Antar fled the country in 1990 while
facing federal contempt charges. He was only brought to justice after being
extradited from Israel at the end of a two-year manhunt.

FT  30 APR 94 / French jobless rate stabilises: Economic Watch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French unemployment rate remained stable in March for the third
successive month at 12.2 per cent, the employment ministry said yesterday.
The number of people out of work rose by 8,600, or 0.3 per cent, during the
month to 3.32m people, or one in eight of the workforce. However the number
of jobs lost in March, as in January and February, was significantly lower
than in many months last year. The slower pace of job losses and recent
publication a survey showing improvement in business confidence has
encouraged economists to be more positive about the economic outlook. Alice
Rawsthorn, Paris.
Industrial production in eastern Germany rose by over 17 per cent for the
first two months of this year compared with the same period last year, the
German economics ministry said yesterday. The strong growth sectors continue
to include the construction industry, up 26.6 per cent and mining, which
rose by 17 per cent in January and February compared with the same period of
1993. Judy Dempsey, Berlin.
South Korea's economic growth forecast for 1994, as measured by gross
national product, was revised upward to 7.6 per cent from 7 per cent by the
Korea Development Institute, a government think-tank. The revised forecast
compares with the country's 5.6 per cent GNP growth in 1993.
Russia's trade surplus widened 49 per cent to Dollars 5.13bn (Pounds 3.4bn)
in the first quarter from Dollars 3.44bn a year earlier, according to
figures from the ministry of foreign economic relations.
The Russian central bank yesterday lowered its discount rate, the rate at
which it lends money to commercial banks, to 205 per cent from 210 per cent
a year.

FT  30 APR 94 / Daimler mixes business and diplomacy: Arafat visits German
conglomerate

<TEXT>
When Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
lands in Stuttgart on Monday, his hosts will no doubt provide him with the
very latest in protection. They are well-equipped to do so.
He is not coming to see the German government, nor any of his normal
counterparts in the political process, but that other German empire -
Daimler-Benz, manufacturer of the four-tonne armour-plated limousine.
Yet this is not, say Daimler's senior officials, an exercise in salesmanship
or self-promotion. Germany's largest industrial conglomerate claims it is
throwing its commercial weight into the Middle East peace process, in what
it says is an example of business diplomacy.
Mr Arafat will be shown a splendid display of all the main products of the
Stuttgart-based empire, from Mercedes limousines to Unimog trucks, buses,
Airbus and Fokker aircraft, helicopters, even the engine unit of an ICE
high-speed train, all set out in the piazza of the company headquarters. He
will visit the Mercedes plant at Turkheim, and the company museum, designed
to appeal to his background as an engineer.
But the company says the real purpose, promoted by Mr Edzard Reuter,
Daimler's chief executive, is to demonstrate the support of a business
empire for the political negotiations between Israel and the PLO.
The unlikely initiative has official blessing from Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and Mr Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, as well as Israel.
In talks in 1992 with both Mr Yitzhak Rabin and Mr Shimon Peres, Mr Reuter
spelt out his belief that a small, highly industrialised state like Israel,
would only have good economic prospects if its neighbours could be drawn
into a common market. He urged an intiative to promote cross-border
co-operation in the Middle East.
Now Daimler-Benz intends to get involved with projects supporting
development of the Palestinian territories, although nobody is talking of
anything quite so extravagant as new car or bus plants.
What Mr Reuter is proposing is help with analysing the infrastructure
problems, designing water supplies and transportation links, and assistance
with the education and training of the Palestinian workforce. What
Daimler-Benz is not expecting, is a hugely profitable return for its
immediate involvement.

FT  30 APR 94 / Mine group wins landmark Irish planning appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decision heralded as a breakthrough for the mining industry in Ireland was
announced last night by An Bord Pleanala (the Irish National Appeals Board)
which gave final planning clearance for the Dollars 65m (Pounds 44m) Galmoy
zinc-lead project in central Ireland.
Galmoy will be the first new base metal mine in Ireland for 20 years and
enhance the country's position as Europe's second-largest zinc producer.
The planning appeal was widely considered in the mining industry to be a
test case, setting the scene for a new generation of mining in Ireland where
the industry has been the target of a strong - and often successful -
anti-mining campaign for some years.
Arcon International Resources, the Dublin-based company in which Mr Tony
O'Reilly, the Irish businessman, has a 23 per cent stake, said that, subject
to it being issued with a department of energy mining licence, construction
of the Galmoy mine would start in September and be completed in 18 months.
Galmoy is projected to produce an annual 70,000 tonnes of zinc when in full
production (which should be 12 months after start-up), employ 350 in the
18-month construction phase and then provide 200 permanent jobs.
Professor Richard Conroy, Arcon's chairman, said the planning appeal outcome
showed that 'there will be severe environmental scrutiny of any projected
mine (in Ireland) but, as long as this scrutiny can be met, you will be able
to mine. I hope this will encourage other mining companies to look for base
metals in Ireland.' Environmentalists opposed to Galmoy gained some
consolation from the appeal because Arcon has now been instructed to put a
berm (ledge) around its waste pond.
Tara Mines, owned by Outokumpu, the state-controlled Finnish group, is
Ireland's only zinc producer with annual output of 190,000 tonnes.
However, only 8kms from Galmoy is the Lisheen zinc project, close enough to
suggest there is a series of big zinc-lead deposits over a wide area in the
so-called Rathdowney trend.
Mr Eero Laatio, managing director of Tara, recently estimated that the
development of Galmoy and Lisheen would create more than 5,000 jobs.

FT  30 APR 94 / Perverse market logic drives up yen: Examining the factors
behind the dollar's dramatic slide against the yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH

<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday narrowly avoided sinking to an historic low of less
than Y100, but few on the foreign exchanges believe this is more than a
temporary respite.
Sentiment towards the dollar is now so negative that most analysts believe
it will fall through the Y100 level, and that this will trigger a further
precipitate decline.
'Once it breaks that, anything is possible, up to Y95 or Y90, because it is
such an important break,' says Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at the
Industrial Bank of Japan in London.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, says a lot of
investors have held onto their dollar positions, but expects them to sell if
the dollar falls below Y100. 'This is a market trading on fear in
circumstances of illiquidity,' he notes.
Mr Chertkow says a 10 per cent fall, to Y90, would 'not be a big fall given
the weight of funds'. He says in these circumstances markets can move much
further than fundamentals would justify. He cites the case of the dollar
rising from DM2.94 to DM3.4750 in six weeks from December 1984 to
mid-February 1985 when fundamentals suggested that DM3 should never have
been breached in the first place.
It was not supposed to be this way. Indeed, at the turn of the year,
forecasting the dollar was supposed to be one of 1994's easy tasks. Both
economic growth and interest rates in the US currency's favour were seen as
making it virtually certain that the dollar would strengthen against
European currencies and the yen.
These were the main factors why most investors and analysts felt the dollar
would rise to DM1.80-90 and Y115-Y120 in 1994, from DM1.7450 and Y112.50
where it started the year.
Although the dollar is weak against both the yen and the D-Mark, it is the
Japanese leg of events that it is propelling the market. 'The driving force
continues to be the market's perception that the trade dispute is going to
carry on for some time,' says Mr Hannah.
Perversely, the market holds the view that the worse Japan's politics, the
better for the yen.
This logic has its root in the US-Japan trade dispute, where the issue is US
pressure for Japan to curb its Dollars 50bn bilateral trade surplus with the
US. Political instability in Japan is seen as hampering the prospects of the
government delivering market-access agreements which will improve US import
penetration.
In these circumstances the market believes that the US administration will
talk up the yen, to make Japanese exports less competitive, as a way of
closing the gap.
Mr Brendan Brown, head of research at Mitsubishi Bank, is sceptical of the
trade dispute as an explanation for yen strength. He explains it, instead,
as a function of fairly tight monetary policy, repatriation of capital by
Japanese investors from abroad, and foreign buying of Japanese equities.
He asks rhetorically: 'How can the economy with the largest savings (and
current account) surplus consistently import long term capital? Economic
arithmetic and logic tells us that Japan must be the principal supplier of
capital to the world economy, not an importer of funds.'
One way of restoring equilibrium will be for the yen to rise to the level
where Japanese investors see no residual risk in exporting funds, while a
tumbling Nikkei stock market index (a yen below Y100 will push Japanese
exports sharply down) will drive foreigners out.
Analysts argue that a level around Y90 will probably only last a few months.
After that the yen is expected to weaken to the Y115-120 level, depending on
progress with the trade dispute.

FT  30 APR 94 / Lopez daughter named as VW spy case suspect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The daughter of the prime suspect in the VW/General Motors industrial
espionage investigation was the original source of some of the new potential
evidence turned up recently by German state prosecutors, it emerged
yesterday.
A diskette containing data on cost-reduction planning at GM, the existence
of which was made public by the German authorities this week, was compiled
by Ms Begounia Lopez, daughter of the US group's former purchasing director,
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.
Mr Lopez has told his current employer, Volkswagen, that his daughter, now
22, gathered the information for a student thesis while on a work-study
placement with GM shortly before his abrupt departure for VW in March, 1993.
Ms Lopez is known to have been temporarily employed in the Chevrolet
marketing department during the relevant period.
Officials close to the affair said that after a 'complaint' from GM lawyers
Ms Lopez was now being treated formally by investigators as a suspect along
with her father and three of his closest associates. All former GM
employees, they followed him to VW within days of his leaving the US.
Mr Lopez's lawyers last night dismissed the suspicions as groundless. They
claimed the diskette found in Ms Lopez's room contained material she
gathered while studying at the independent General Motors Institute. The
institute was not part of the GM group.
The US group has consistently claimed that it was a victim of a systematic
intelligence-gathering campaign instigated by Mr Lopez in preparation for
his defection.
Details of a secret sub-compact car, supposedly restricted to top-level GM
management, were found in a Wiesbaden house last summer shortly after it was
vacated by two of Mr Lopez's close, but junior associates.
Meanwhile, it also emerged that a US Justice Department official interviewed
Mr Klaus Liesen, chairman of the VW supervisory board in London on Thursday.
The interview suggests the US grand jury probe into suspected wire and mail
fraud by the VW group, Mr Lopez and others, is being focused more on
Germany.

FT  30 APR 94 / OECD members agree action to curb bribery of foreign
officials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The world's main exporters yesterday agreed action to curb bribery of
foreign government officials through a voluntary code of conduct to be
adopted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development at the
end of May.
The OECD's 24 members have agreed a list of recommended measures, such as
making bribes illegal and removing their tax deductibility, which they would
try to implement, said Mr Mark Pieth, a Swiss official who chairs the
organisation's working group on illicit payments. He said it had not been
possible to agree a legally binding anti-bribery convention, as the United
Nations had tried to do in the late 1970s.
Mr Pieth described the OECD recommendation as 'soft law' which would not
oblige member governments to adopt the whole menu of anti-bribery measures.
But governments would exercise 'peer pressure' on each other by holding
periodic reviews to examine what measures individual countries had taken.
The accord ends over four years of negotiations, instigated by the US, which
is the only OECD country to flatly outlaw bribery in its Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act.
US officials yesterday welcomed the recommendation, which they said was
considerably sharper than earlier drafts. 'We've shifted from the notion
that countries would consider taking steps to the notion that countries have
committed themselves to taking steps,' a senior State Department official
said.
'I don't think there's much doubt that the problem is measured in billions
of dollars annually for US companies,' the official added.
Other OECD partners have had greater reservations than the US about the
'extra-territorial' aspect of applying any bribery ban to business
activities on foreign soil.
Mr Pieth said the OECD code of conduct covered illicit payments to
officials, but not to private businessmen, in foreign countries. He also
conceded that corruption was hard to define.
'Inviting a foreign official to dinner hardly constitutes corruption, but
offering him a gift can.'
Mr Pieth said the new OECD anti-bribery code would draw on the experience of
the organisation's Financial Action Task Force whose role has been to crack
down on the laundering of drug and criminal money while respecting the
differences in member countries' banking systems and laws.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The state of California is sueing the US government to recover Dollars 2bn
(Pounds 1.3bn) it says it has spent on jailing illegal immigrants who commit
crimes, Reuter reports from San Diego.
'California has had enough and it's time to stop illegal immigration,'
Governor Pete Wilson said after personally filing the suit in a federal
court.
The governor's aides said it was the first of a series of lawsuits
California plans to file against the federal government to recover billions
of dollars spent on providing services to immigrants who stay in the US
illegally.
Other suits will focus on health, education and welfare  - costs for which
California says the federal government is responsible. Mr Wilson said he
filed the suit reluctantly and would prefer a political solution. But
Congress had failed to deal with the illegal immigrant problem.
Under the constitution the federal government was responsible for regulating
immigration and had failed abysmally to do so.

FT  30 APR 94 / Indians lobby White House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders from more than 500 American Indian tribes gathered at the White
House yesterday for a rare chance to press their concerns at the highest
levels of the US government.
At a breakfast meeting with Vice-President Al Gore, and a subsequent meeting
with President Bill Clinton, delegations from almost all the 545 federally
recognised tribes argued for more freedom for native American religions,
more money for Indian health and education services and more respect for
tribal sovereignty.
'For so long, from the Indian perspective, the doors of the White House have
been closed to us. The symbolism is that the gates are open to us,' said
Gaiashkibos, president of the National Congress of American Indians.
An estimated 80 per cent of native American voters backed Mr Clinton in the
1992 presidential election, but tribal leaders have been disappointed at the
Democratic administration's plans to cut the budget for the Indian Health
Services  - which administration officials have now indicated they are
rethinking  - and at delays in naming a new chairman for the National Indian
Gaming Commission.
'Indian people always expect a greater understanding and commitment from
Democrats. Instead, what's hit us in the eye is budget cuts,' complained Mr
Peterson Zah, president of the Navajo nation, the largest American Indian
nation.
Indian nations range from the 220,000 Navajo, faced with poverty, ill health
and inadequate sanitation, to the 300 Massantucket Pequot, who have grown
rich on the profits from their casino, which is not subject to Connecticut's
ban on gambling.
Sovereignty rights, supposedly guaranteed by hundreds of federal treaties
that the US has honoured more in the breach, have generated conflicts
between Indian nations and states from South Carolina to Montana.
But some Indian leaders argue that the greatest burden on the native
American peoples is the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the federal bureaucracy
that oversees the tribal reservations and which critics describe as one of
the world's last surviving examples of socialist central planning.

FT  30 APR 94 / Fears and scepticism undermine the dollar: Examining the
factors behind the dollar's dramatic slide against the yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After months of apparent indifference, the US Treasury yesterday showed that
it does, after all, care about the fate of the dollar.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, said sales of D-Marks and yen by
the Federal Reserve were needed to counter 'disorderly conditions' in
currency markets and to reaffirm 'our previously articulated policy which
recognises that excessive volatility is counterproductive to growth.'
Following the Fed's intervention, the dollar gained ground against both the
yen and D-Mark but many traders remained sceptical that the official action
would make a lasting impression on currency markets.
An immediate cause of the dollar's weakness against the yen was fear that
the new Japanese government would be unable to agree effective measures to
open Japanese markets to imports from the US.
Until the Fed's action many analysts assumed that the Clinton administration
regarded yen appreciation as a useful means of exerting indirect pressure on
the Japanese political establishment. Mr Bentsen's statement, however,
confirms that Y100 is regarded in Washington as floor below which the dollar
preferably should not fall.
The dollar's weakness against the D-Mark and other leading currencies is
harder to understand. The news this week that US economic growth in the
first quarter was only 2.6 per cent at an annual rate, less than expected in
financial markets, might be interpreted as bad for the dollar. If US growth
is decelerating, the pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates to prevent
upward pressure on inflation is presumably reduced.
The trouble with this argument is that few analysts believe the GDP figures
will deter the Fed from tightening policy in coming weeks. Growth in the
first quarter was artificially depressed by an erratic fall in government
spending and severe winter weather; it was also a reaction to growth at an
unsustainable annual rate of 7 per cent in the fourth quarter. The average
rate of growth in the last two quarters combined was nearly 5 per cent at an
annual rate.
Reports on Friday of a sharp rebound in the housing market  - new home sales
rose 11 per cent between February and March  - and a solid increase in
personal incomes last month were a reminder that the economy is still moving
ahead vigorously.
When set against US economic fundamentals, the weakness of the dollar
remains puzzling. The US is growing much faster than other industrial
countries. The Fed has begun to tighten monetary policy after a five-year
phase of relaxation. Germany and Japan, by contrast, have yet to emerge
decisively from recession. And there still seems to be scope for monetary
relaxation in both countries.
However, several medium-term considerations weigh against the dollar. Mr
Bruce Kasman, an economist at J P Morgan, the New York Bank, points out that
the US trade and net foreign asset position is distinctly weak compared with
that of Japan and Germany. Unless the Fed acts more aggressively, US
monetary policy is likely to remain considerably looser than that in
competitor countries.
Politics is also playing a part. The Clinton administration appears to put
less weight on controlling inflation than most other governments. Officials
too often give the impression that they care little about the dollar's
external value: some appear to regard depreciation as helpful because it
improves the short-term outlook for US exporters.
In Japan any sustained yen appreciation would cast an unwelcome shadow over
hopes of an economic recovery, just as the recession appears to be touching
bottom. It would further hit the fragile earnings of Japan's export
dependent manufacturing industry, with consequences throughout the economy.
Poor economic indicators over the past week, including falls in car
production and retail sales for March and a rise in unemployment have
emphasised that any recovery is likely to be tentative. Mr Hirohisa Fujii,
finance minister, warned on Thursday that a strong currency could dampen
recovery hopes.
The fresh burst of currency speculation will increase the pressure on the
Bank of Japan to push down interest rates, which are high in real terms
because of Japan's low inflation. It will also test the central bank's
resolve to intervene to push the yen down against the US currency during the
Golden Week holiday period.
Bank of Japan officials say they are ready to act in the markets over the
next week, despite traders' belief that the central bank is unable to
intervene on national holidays.
Japan's political problems  - a reason for currency weakness in most
countries  - have perversely given the market a reason for pushing the yen
higher. Traders might fear that Mr Tsutomu Hata's minority cabinet will
prove too weak to produce a permanent income tax cut, needed to prime
domestic demand and pull in imports, to present to the US at the Group of
Seven summit in July. There is also general gloom over prospects for a
persuasive package of market opening measures, which made little progress
under the previous government.

FT  30 APR 94 / Cusani gets eight yearsin jail for corruption: Sentence ends
months of intense media coverage

<TEXT>
Italy's most gripping courtroom drama went off the air this week when a
Milan judge condemned Mr Sergio Cusani, a financial consultant to the
Ferruzzi-Montedison industrial group, to eight years in prison for
corruption and false accounting,
It was the first time a sentence had been transmitted live on Italian
television, ending six months of intense media coverage of the trial, which
featured guest appearances by stars of the discredited old political regime.
Mr Cusani helped conceal Montedison's illicit contributions to ruling
political parties, including the L150bn (Pounds 62m) 'mother of all bribes.
This sum smoothed the way for Ferruzzi-Montedison to pull out of Enimont,
its ill-fated joint venture with the state-owned Eni energy and chemicals
group, at a huge profit in 1990.
The judge ordered Mr Cusani to repay L167.8bn to Montedison, Ferruzzi's
principal industrial subsidiary company.
The sentence, handed down on Thursday night, amounts to a victory for the
prosecutor, Mr Antoni Di Pietro, Italy's best-known and most charismatic
investigating magistrate, who had asked for a seven-year sentence.
During the trial he began to uncover a network of political corruption more
widespread than most Italians had suspected.
The final day of the 400-hour trial did not disappoint armchair viewers. In
a desperate last stand, Mr Cusani accused the Milan magistrates of driving
Mr Raul Gardini, chairman of Ferruzzi, to suicide last year by not
responding to the tycoon's pleas to be questioned on the Enimont affair.
The crowded courtroom also had to be cleared before the sentence could be
delivered, after police officers discovered a small bomb.

<TEXT>
An agreement to pull out the remaining Russian troops from Latvia is
expected to be signed today in Moscow by the leaders of the two states.
The agreement will mean that only Estonia, the smallest of the three former
Soviet Baltic countries, is at odds with Russia over troop withdrawal.
Negotiators from the two sides agreed on the last issue between them - that
of payment of pensions and other benefits to the 22,300 Russian military
veterans still living in Latvia - at a meeting yesterday in the resort town
of Jurmala.
The agreement allows the officers to stay in Latvia with benefits, but not
to obtain citizenship - a clause which nationalists in the Latvian
parliament say gives retrospective justification to the occupation of Latvia
by Soviet troops between 1940 and 1991.
The Latvians have also agreed to rent out the Skrunda radar base to the
Russians for the next four years.
The sudden worsening in relations betwee the two countries when a decree
signed by President Boris Yeltsin appeared to suggest that Russia wished to
keep troops in Latvia appears to have been patched over - with Latvian
leaders prepared to believe the explanation that the decree was carelessly
worded.
Mr Guntis Ulmanis, Latvian president and Mr Valdis Birkavs, prime minister,
are due in Moscow today to sign the treaty with Mr Yeltsin - a treaty which
should remove all 10,500 Russian troops by the end of August.
The deal, if carried through, focuses all attention on Estonia, where fewer
than 3,000 troops remain but where talks have proved fruitless and both
sides trade allegations of breach of good faith and of civil rights.
Mr Mart Laar, the Estonian premier interviewed in the US this week, said he
received assurances from Mr Boutros Boutros Gali, United Nations
secretary-general, that the UN security council would take a hard line on
Russia if there were no sign of further troop withdrawals by June.
Mr Laar said Russian troops in Estonia were undisciplined, and were offering
guns and other military equipment for sale.
Estonian security forces had stopped the attempted sale of two torpedoes by
Russian officers, he claimed.

FT  30 APR 94 / The Japanese seize a golden opportunity: Recession-hit
companies are giving their workers extra days off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many of Japan's hard-pressed industrial companies breathed a sigh of relief
yesterday and packed their surplus workforces off for a long break.
Golden Week, which started yesterday, has always been an elastic holiday.
But this year corporate Japan has stretched it extra long.
On average, Japanese companies have given their workers 6.2 days of holiday
this year, an increase of more than half a day on 1993, according to a
survey by the labour ministry. That is not bad, considering that Golden Week
officially includes only four public holidays.
It is a welcome opportunity to shut down production when stocks of unsold
goods are still uncomfortably high, as Japan continues to labour under its
worst post-war recession.
Just over 450,000 people have seized the chance to spend their strong yen
abroad and have booked a foreign holiday - up 20 per cent on last year,
according to the Japan Travel Bureau, the leading travel agency. This partly
reflects a sharp drop in package tour prices, but some Japanese economists
believe the holiday rush is another sign of the recovery in consumer
confidence that may herald the beginning of the end of the downturn.
But the airport crowds are only a small fraction of the nearly 67m Japanese
who plan to take it easy this week. Many of them headed for the countryside
yesterday, creating motorway jams up to 70km long, another important Golden
Week ritual. The sensible ones stayed at home, to enjoy the pleasant
emptiness of their city streets.
Some people will be taking life easier than others. The car, steel and
consumer electronics industries, burdened with overcapacity, are asking
their workers to stay away for longer than most. Mazda and Honda have
offered 12 days off, to the irritation of some of their suppliers, which
have had to scale back capacity accordingly. Hitachi is taking nine days
off.
Semiconductor makers, by contrast, have asked their workers to take the
minimum four days, to keep up with strong demand for computer components.
Foreign exchange dealers and politicians also get a raw deal this year. The
finance ministry has suggested that some Japanese and foreign banks and life
insurers keep dealers on duty during the holidays.
They are needed to head off another rise in the yen against the dollar, on
fears that Mr Tsutomu Hata's new minority administration proves too weak to
make progress on the US-Japan trade dispute. Japanese markets will be closed
from next Tuesday to Thursday, but a few traders will be closely watching
the yen-dollar movement elsewhere in the world, from their lonely screens in
Tokyo.
Mr Hata, meanwhile, will also be busy next week, when he is due to tour
Europe, his first foreign visit as prime minister. He will no doubt have his
work cut out to persuade his hosts in Italy, Germany, France and at the
European Union headquarters in Belgium that Japan's recent political
turmoils have not harmed its reliability as a partner.

FT  30 APR 94 / Ministers set to reject proposed pensions safeguard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government plans to water down proposed reforms of occupational pension
law drawn up in the wake of the Maxwell scandal.
It intends to reject the recommendation by the Goode committee on pensions
regulation that scheme members should be allowed to appoint at least a third
of all scheme trustees.
Ministers fear that if the proposal were implemented it could seriously
undermine occupational pensions because management might question the value
of such schemes if they did not have absolute control of the trustees.
The government, which is to publish its white paper later this year, favours
a code of 'best practice', which would leave the composition of the board of
trustees to the management, as is now the case. 'Ministers are determined to
resist the temptation to over-regulate,' said a Whitehall official.
Mr Stuart James, a member of the committee, said: 'Although the committee
felt there should be no cherry picking (of its key recommendations) this is
what the government will do.'
Mr James, speaking at the annual conference of the National Association of
Pension Funds in Brighton, predicted the government would 'ditch some of our
less palatable recommen-dations'. The issue has caused a dispute among MPs
on the social security committee, which is due to publish its own report
within the next few weeks.
Conservative MPs are fiercely resisting attempts by Labour committee members
to recommend that at least a third of trustees be appointed by scheme
members. This was put forward by the Goode committee because employee
contributions make up a third of most schemes' assets.
The social security committee plans to take evidence from employers, many of
whom have expressed concern about having member-appointed trustees.
Ministers are confident the committee's final recommendations will be in
line with its thinking, but one or two Labour MPs may issue a minority
report. The government is also leaning towards a self-regulatory structure
in which the industry funds the regulator, contrary to the Goode committee's
recommendation that a new pensions regulator should be funded from general
revenues. 'I believe the regulator we will see will be a pale shadow of what
we recommended,' Mr James said.
Another senior Whitehall official said: 'Ministers committed to deregulation
have no intention of doing anything that would undermine occupational
pensions. We do not want a new pensions regulator setting down hundreds of
new rules.'
However, ministers are likely to face strong pressure to accept the Goode
committee's recommendations in full.

FT  30 APR 94 / Fed steps in to check dollar's fall: Yen's strength reflects
Japan's trade surplus with US - Move helps bonds and equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH, WILLIAM DAWKINS and FRANK MCGURTY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Reserve took the rare step yesterday of intervening in
foreign exchange markets to support the dollar as it fell towards its lowest
level against the yen since last summer.
The central bank's intervention helped arrest the US currency's decline, and
at the close in New York yesterday it was trading at Y101.60 and DM1.6535,
slightly above the lows of the day. The last time the Fed intervened openly
in the market was in August last year when the dollar fell to Y100.30.
The stronger yen reflects market perceptions that Mr Tsutomu Hata, the new
Japanese prime minister, will make only limited progress in curbing the
country's large trade surplus with the US. The US is pressing Japan to open
its markets to US imports, and to stimulate the economy, as means of curbing
the surplus.
However, the dollar looks likely to have earned only temporary respite. Mr
Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank in London, commented:
'It is round one to the Fed, but unless (intervention) is sustained and a
lot heavier, I think the markets will again test the previous low of the
dollar.'
Economists fear that if the dollar sinks below Y100, it could fall as low as
Y80-Y90. Sustained yen strength would hit Japanese exports, with serious
implications for the country's economy. Japan's Economic Planning Agency
recently released a figure suggesting that, on average, Japanese exporters
needed an exchange rate of Y117 to the dollar in order to break even.
Poor economic data over the past week, including falls in car production and
retail sales for March and a rise in unemployment, emphasise that any
recovery in Japan's economy is likely to be tentative. Mr Hirohisa Fujii,
finance minister, warned on Thursday that a strong currency could damp
recovery hopes.
Although the dollar has underperformed market expectations all year, its
renewed weakness appears to stem from Japan's political instability. The
country experienced a political hiatus after the resignation of Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa as prime minister, while there are doubts about the authority of
his successor.
Perversely, Japanese political uncertainty strengthens the yen. Traders fear
Mr Hata's minority cabinet will fail to produce a long-term income tax cut
to prime domestic demand and pull in imports. There is also gloom over
prospects for a persuasive package of market opening measures, which made
little progress under the previous government.
The foreign exchange markets believe that if progress is not made in these
two areas, the US administration will seek to force a stronger yen as a
means of curbing the US's Dollars 50bn (Pounds 33bn) trade deficit with
Japan.
Yesterday Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, said the Fed
intervention was intended to counter 'disorderly conditions' in the markets.
'This is in line with our previously articulated policy which recognises
that excessive volatility is counterproductive to growth.'
The intervention helped prop up bond and equity markets. European bond
prices ended the day unchanged or firmer, recovering earlier losses after
prices had fallen sharply due to concern about the weakening dollar. In New
York, US Treasury bonds stablised after a hectic morning to close moderately
down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 3,681.69, up 13.38 points.
UK equities reacted closely to developments in currencies yesterday
afternoon, plunging sharply as the dollar weakened but rallying after the
Fed intervention. The FT-SE Index closed 4.6 off at 3,125.3, but had fallen
to 3,105.6 earlier. British government bonds also rallied late to close
firmer on the day.
The Fed intervened in the market at least four times, repeatedly buying
dollars for both yen and D-Marks above the Y101.45-50 and DM1.6590 levels.

FT  30 APR 94 / Israel agrees 'self-rule' for Palestine economy: Accord
covers monetary policy, banks and tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The incoming Palestinian government in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
enclave of Jericho will have wide ranging powers to decide its own monetary
policy, supervise Palestinian banks and set its direct taxation rates,
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation agreed yesterday.
The landmark economic accord was signed in Paris after a breakthrough in
peace talks between the PLO and Israel, which have agreed to sign an
agreement next Wednesday on Palestinian self-rule in the occupied Gaza Strip
and Jericho.
The economic pact, which will govern economic relations between the Jewish
state and the future self-governed Palestinian economy for five years, was
described by Mr Avraham Shochat, Israeli finance minister, as 'a historical
breakthrough toward a new economy of peace'.
The comprehensive free trade agreement covers imports and customs, monetary
policy, taxation, labour, agriculture, industry and tourism and was signed
yesterday by Mr Shochat and Mr Ahmed Qurie, PLO negotiator, at the French
foreign ministry. It brought to an end five months of often difficult
negotiations.
However, both sides had to exclude, until further talks, the controversial
issue of whether the Palestinians will have the right to mint their own
currency  - a key demand of the PLO.
In talks in Cairo that precede next week's Gaza signing, Israel also agreed
yesterday to grant other symbols of statehood to the nascent Palestinian
state, including the right of Palestinians to have their own international
dialling code and to issue stamps and travel documents which will also carry
the word 'passport'.
Renewed progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has fuelled hopes
of advancing the peace talks between Israel and Syria. Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday held detailed talks with Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, before his planned departure today
for Damascus.
Israeli officials say they hope Mr Christopher will shuttle between the
Syrian capital and Jerusalem and take fresh Israeli proposals to President
Hafez al-Assad of Syria in order to advance the sluggish talks which focus
on an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights in return for full
peace.
In Paris, Mr Qurie said Palestinians were looking forward to a new era of
common interest rather than dependency in their economic relations with
Israel. He urged international donors, who have promised Dollars 2.5bn
(Pounds 1.6bn) of aid over five years, to fulfil their commitments to what
he said would be a liberal market Palestinian economy.

FT  30 APR 94 / Unilever takes Procter to court in row over 'super'
detergent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The soap wars between Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble spilled into the courts
yesterday as Unilever took legal action to stop Procter making 'untruthful
and misleading' statements about its new generation of detergents.
The dispute between the world's two biggest detergents makers was sparked by
alleged claims from a Procter executive in the Dutch press that Unilever's
new super-concentrated detergents damaged clothes. The products, being
launched across Europe at a cost of several hundred million pounds, are
claimed by Unilever to represent a technological breakthrough. They are also
a vigorous attempt by Unilever to regain ground in the Pounds 6bn European
detergents market. It has lost market share to Procter over the past five
years.
Unilever's subsidiary Lever Nederland has started proceedings in the Dutch
courts on the basis that Procter's statements are 'sowing doubt amongst the
general public' about Omo Power, the Dutch brand name of the new detergent.
It is also seeking an injunction to stop Procter using the term 'Power' for
its own products. Procter is accused of putting stickers with the word
'Power' on its rival brand, Ariel, in a move which a Unilever source
described as 'particularly grubby'.
Procter said: 'This lawsuit is an attempt to silence the debate, but we see
it as an opportunity to bring all the facts into the open. We think the
charges are unfounded and we are confident that we will win the lawsuit.'
Unilever claimed that sales of the new product in the Netherlands were going
well despite wide publicity caused by the first appearance of Procter's
claims on Wednesday.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Operating costs hit Berry Birch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased operating expenses at Berry Birch &amp; Noble resulted in a reduction
in pre-tax profits in the year to January 31 from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds
670,000.
In January, the USM-quoted financial services group had warned of an
expected lower result and the market reacted yesterday by raising the share
price 16p to 134p.
Sales from continuing operations rose 11 per cent to Pounds 7.1m (Pounds
6.4m), but operating expenses increased by Pounds 1m to Pounds 6.51m.
As forecast, a maintained final dividend of 3.3p makes a 5.4p (5.3p) total.
Earnings per share declined to 7.6p (12.8p).

FT  29 APR 94 / Enterprise launches hostile bid for Lasmo: Combined oil and
gas group valued at more than Pounds 3bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil yesterday launched a Pounds 1.45bn (Dollars 2.1bn) hostile
takeover bid for UK rival explorer Lasmo. If successful, the offer would
bring together the UK's two largest independent oil and gas explorers into a
single group valued at more than Pounds 3bn.
The offer is the largest hostile bid in the UK since BTR's Pounds 1.47bn
offer for Hawker Siddeley in 1991. If Lasmo shareholders accept the
all-paper offer, the enlarged company would rank fourth among North Sea
explorers, after British Petroleum, Shell and Exxon.
Enterprise virtually ruled out any prospect of a cash sweetener. 'I do not
see any need for it,' said Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive.
The group's policy was to pay for big acquisitions with paper, he added.
Mr Hearne said Enterprise's strong cash generation over the next few years -
following the completion of the Nelson and Scott fields - would meet Lasmo's
need for funds to bring its exploration opportunities on stream. He rejected
suggestions that Lasmo's recent Pounds 219m rights issue was enough to fund
the loss-making company's future needs.
Lasmo, however, attacked the bid as a 'contrived paper offer . . . which
would dilute significant growth potential for shareholders'. Mr Joe Darby,
chief executive, said the combination of the two companies 'would add no
value for shareholders'.
Financial markets appeared initially to support his view. Enterprise's
shares closed down 21p at 425p, while Lasmo fell 5 1/2 p at 157p.
'This bid is good for neither Lasmo shareholders nor Enterprise
shareholders,' said Mr David Basham, a Kleinwort Benson oil analyst. 'By
1996, they will have to find 164m barrels every year just to keep their
reserve base stable.'
The offer comprises, for every 80 Lasmo shares:
27 Enterprise A shares which will convert to ordinary shares on 1997 and
will carry a 3p annual dividend between 1994 and 1997. This is equivalent to
the dividend which Lasmo indicated it would pay in those year when it
launched its recent rights issue, plus
12 Enterprise warrants exercisable between 1997 and 2001 at 407p.
Enterprise says this values Lasmo shares at 150p, based on the A share price
of 407p and a warrant price of 86p.

FT  29 APR 94 / US spy sentenced to life in prison
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Former CIA officer Mr Aldrich Ames and his wife Rosario pleaded guilty
yesterday to spying for Moscow in one of the most damaging espionage cases
in US history, Reuter reports from Alexandria, Virginia. He was sentenced to
life in prison.
Under a plea-bargain agreement, Mr Ames, 52, accepted the life term without
chance of parole and promised to co-operate fully with investigators in
return for lenient treatment for his wife.
Mr Ames, who served as head of a Soviet counter-intelligence desk in the
1980s, revealed that he had given the KGB Soviet intelligence agency the
names of every Soviet citizen he knew who was working for the US as a spy.
He admitted he was paid about Dollars 2.5m for his espionage work.
US District Court Judge Claude Hilton delayed sentencing Mrs Ames, 42, until
August 26 while prosecutors assess the extent of her husband's co-operation.
The government and Mrs Ames's lawyer agreed to recommend that she be
sentenced to serve five to six years without parole, the Justice Department
said.
After the hearing the couple, shackled in chains, were escorted back to
prison from the federal courthouse in Alexandria, a suburb across the
Potomac river from Washington where the hearing took place.
In an eight-page statement he read to the court, Mr Ames said: 'I bitterly
regret the catastrophe which my betrayal of trust has brought upon my wife
and son and any who have loved and cared for me. No punishment by this court
can balance or ease the profound shame and guilt I bear.'
He expressed sympathy for 'those persons in the former Soviet Union or
elsewhere who may have suffered.'
US government officials believe at least 10 citizens of the former Soviet
Union and allied communist states were executed as a result of Mr Ames's
betrayal.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Management and union representatives edged closer to agreement yesterday on
a deal that could end a three-week strike at the US's largest road haulage
companies, writes George Graham in Washington. Officials of the Teamsters
union said the main issues had been resolved in talks hosted by federal
government mediators, with the union accepting some of the trucking
companies' demands for more part-time workers and greater use of rail
transport in exchange for increases in pay and benefits.
Trucking Management, a consortium representing the haulage companies, said
no agreement had yet been finalised, and Teamster officials acknowledged
that substantial differences remained between the two sides.
The strike, the first national stoppage called by the once-powerful
Teamsters for 15 years, had pulled 75,000 drivers and terminal workers out
at 22 trucking companies.

FT  29 APR 94 / Jests and solemnity as Yeltsin treaty is signed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday claimed that 'only peaceful,
constitutional methods' would now hold sway in Russian politics - after he
and a range of political and social leaders had signed a Treaty on Social
Accord at a Kremlin ceremony yesterday.
The treaty, bearing the mark of last-minute compromises and apparently not
seen in its final form until yesterday morning by many taking part, is
designed to produce a two-year moratorium on any efforts to provoke early
elections or change the constitution and to establish the 'general interest'
as higher than those of any group, organisation or region.
It was signed two days after the assassination of a member of parliament, Mr
Andrei Aizderdzis - an event which has the political world in a turmoil of
calls for law and order. It precedes May 1 rallies in Moscow organised by a
range of far left and right groupings. There are fears the rallies may
become violent.
Mr Yeltsin. looking grave but fit, put the signing ceremony in an epic
context by conjuring up the ghosts of Russia's civil war which followed the
Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. 'We have come to this agreement through long
years,' he said. 'Almost no one who took part in the civil war is left
alive, but there has been no reconciliation. The deep wound in the Russian
body has not healed. Confrontation still lives in our souls. For the sake of
our children's peace of mind, we must sign this treaty.'
His gravity had been undercut in advance by the jesting of Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, the leader of the Liberal Democratic party, who told reporters
he would decide to sign only on arrival at the gorgeous Georgevsky Hall in
the Kremlin - on the basis of whether or not the president smiled at him.
Whether or not he received his smile, he did sign: but the pact was rejected
by the large Communist party, the Agrarian party and the centrist Yabloko
bloc. Mr Ivan Rybkin, the speaker of the lower house, also signed -
provoking Mr Gannady Zyuganov, the Communist party leader, to question his
right and Mr Sergei Baburin, a radical nationalist, to make a threat to his
continued holding of the office.
Outside of the parties, the pact was signed by leaders of nearly all the
autonomous republics and regions; of the main churches, including the
dominant Orthodox; by most of the unions and by women's organisations; and
by the two main Cossack organisations - the leader of one of which, Mr
Victor Rateyev of the Cossack Union of Russia and Abroad, was brought hard
up against the new era of peace by having to unhook his cavalry sabre before
gaining access to the signing ceremony.
The final text made significant concessions to the interest groups powerful
enough to extract them - especially the regions. They no longer have to
promise not to change their status, nor must they bring their constitutions
into conformity with the federal one.
At the same time, a commitment to secure individual rights as the highest
aim was changed to 'general' rights.

FT  29 APR 94 / Iran accused of terrorist links: Intelligence sources say
Tehran is backing IRA and Japanese Red Army
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and the US joined yesterday in warning Iran over its alleged support
for international terrorism after obtaining intelligence information that
Tehran was stepping up its links with groups including the IRA and the
Japanese Red Army.
In London, Mr Gholamreza Ansari, the Iranian charge d'affaires, was summoned
to a meeting with Mr Douglas Hogg, a foreign office minister, and told that
the UK government had evidence of contacts between Iranian intelligence and
the IRA.
The US has long accused Iran of sponsoring international terrorism and
seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, and it has urged other countries not to
offer the Islamic regime economic assistance. The allegations will put
particular pressure on Japan, which has a relatively good relationship with
Tehran.
In London the Foreign Office said: 'We take the gravest view of any contact
which might assist or encourage terrorism.' Mr Hogg was said to have
requested an assurance at senior level that contact between Iran and the IRA
would be immediately and conclusively severed.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, emphasised Washington's
concern after contact with Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary,
Speaking in Cairo, Mr Christopher said: 'I would underscore my deep anger at
the continued terrorism projected by Iran not only here in the Middle East
but through other parts of the world.'
Mr Christopher said such these concerns were behind the US belief that that
Iran did not qualify for equal treatment with other countries in areas such
as financial assistance.
Mr Ansari last night emphatically denied any involvement by Iran in the
supply of arms or money to the IRA. He said: 'Iran has always strongly
condemned any terrorist action in any place in any form or any time.'
Asked whether Mr Hogg had produced any evidence at the meeting that there
had been contacts between the IRA and the Iranian intelligence service, he
replied: 'There was no evidence. I did not receive any evidence'
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the government was
'quite satisfied' there had been contacts.
The IRA is thought to have been drawing on financial support from Iran and
may have been on the verge of securing a large shipment of arms. According
to western diplomats, Iran has also been training Japanese terrorists to
conduct assassinations in Europe and the US.
They say that in recent months the Iranian government has been providing
logistical and financial backing to the Japanese Red Army, a terrorist group
that conducted a series of spectacular terrorist attacks in Asia and Europe
during the 1970s and 1980s.
The allegations, if proved accurate, may embarrass Japan, which has been
conducting an independent foreign policy with Iran.

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (29): Perambulations
around blue chips - Serious riches / Michael Abram, who won an important
Mothercare contract, had suffered early poverty. He learned about shares 'by
watching my father having the wrong ones', and favours Footsie companies for
his UK portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Many of the people you interview are not what I would call seriously rich,'
says Michael Abram. As the man who built up Restmor, the pram business which
became the main supplier to Mothercare and floated on the stock exchange,
Abram knows what it is to have made money.
He also knows what it is like to be poor. When his father was sent to a
Siberian labour camp in the 1930s and then expelled from Russia as an
undesirable alien, Abram was a small child. He and his mother were forced to
leave their native Tashkent. His mother worked as a cleaner to pay for what
turned out to be a four-year journey across the Middle East and Europe, to
rejoin his father in England in 1936 when Abram was eight years old.
He now has several share portfolios, which are run solely for capital gain
and not for income; various members of his family are happy to let him look
after their portfolios, too. Abram takes an enthusiastic interest in the
market, speaking to his portfolio manager, Hugh Giltrow of Kleinwort Benson,
several times a day and even keeping in touch via the telex when he is
travelling.
He is not happy to allow total discretion. 'I've allowed that twice in my
life and I've lost a lot of money, but I've done quite well with Kleinwort.'
Abram learned about stocks and shares 'by watching my father having the
wrong ones', and confines his interest to the UK, leaving the management of
the overseas holdings to Giltrow. He places great faith in blue-chip
companies, and most of his portfolio is invested in FT-SE 100 companies such
as BTR, Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai, Granada, Land Securities. 'Blue chips can go
down a lot, but at least they recover,' says Abram. 'It is very seldom that
they don't recover at all, although there are some, like Rolls-Royce, which
you never thought would go broke. In general though, if you are with the
banks or a company like Glaxo, they will pick up.'
Abram studies the monthly valuations sent to him by Kleinwort Benson, and if
he finds a stock which is not moving, or which is making a loss, he consults
Kleinwort to see whether they should be doing anything about it. 'If we feel
that something is not going to recover, we get out either with a small
profit or a loss - it doesn't matter,' says Abram. 'If we take a loss, we
forget about it and decide how we are going to make it up. Recently we've
used BTR warrants very successfully to make up the losses on other stocks.
In addition to suggesting FT-SE 100 companies, Kleinwort has also
highlighted a number of medium-size companies, such as M&amp;G and Wessex Water'
Abram tends to shy away from smaller companies unless he knows the
management. 'I have made money on second- and third-liners but only when
I've known the industry or the management. But where I've gone blind into
smaller companies, I've found them very risky.'
Tips can be another danger. 'I went into Brown &amp; Jackson about three years
ago on a tip, because I was in textiles - it was my idea, not Hugh's. The
shares were about 27.5p. I could have got out earlier this year with a loss
of Pounds 3,000-Pounds 4,000 but didn't and they fell to 3p. So sometimes it
really is a gamble.'
Trading is not frequent, despite the keen eye kept on the portfolio, but
since it is run for capital growth, some sales are made to mitigate any
capital gains tax liability.
The overseas exposure is through unit and investment trusts, with an
allocation of about 13 per cent in the Far East and 10 per cent in Europe.
The UK holding is 60 per cent. The remainder is held in cash and gilts,
although this figure is higher than normal given an earlier decision to
reduce the family's exposure to one large historic investment. Overseas
funds include Kleinwort's recent European privatisation investment trust and
Baring Eastern, a Far East excluding Japan unit trust.
Abram spoke no language well other than Bukharian when he came to England,
and as soon as he had settled into school the second world war broke out,
which led to his being evacuated.
'I got into grammar school and then Leicester university, but I wanted to go
into business. My father was in the jewellery trade but he always thought it
was dead trade so would not take me.'
Abram's first job was with Anglo-African shipping company, a confirming
house, when he was 19 years old. 'They were very poor payers. The only
reason I could exist was that I was living at home and my father insisted
that I save. I started off on Pounds 4 a week and ended up on Pounds 10.
They could not pay me any more because a senior buyer, who had been with
them since before the war, was on Pounds 12 a week.'
After five years with the company, he decided to start his own business with
a colleague, David Seymour, as partner. Texmore trading company dealt in
wholesale textiles - sheets, curtains, blankets - and was initially run from
a mews house in London's Mornington Crescent. The company grew large enough
to start buying shops, but 'we had no idea how to retail. We were good at
wholesaling but hopeless at retailing.' The two partners moved on in 1962
into the pram business, with Abram as managing director of Restmor and David
Seymour as works director.
The big break came just four months later, after a chance meeting with Selim
Zilkha, the man who founded and built up Mothercare before its sale to
Terence Conran's Habitat group. 'Zilkha had started a year before I met him,
and asked me whether I would make a pram with his own design. I said we've
only got the one shape - they were coach-built prams in those days - our
cane goes this way but I'll make yours go the other way. Then he said, and
will you put my emblem, the 'M', on? So I said, why not? He said you are
just the man I want.'
working relationship culminating in Restmor supplying Mothercare with over
60 lines, including bouncing cradles and baby carriers. Abram acknowledges a
deep debt of gratitude to Zilkha. 'He is the most brilliant businessman I
have ever come across. We would agree twice a year on prices, we'd argue a
little bit and then he'd say jokingly, 'charge me what you like. If I don't
sell it, you suffer' - he was so clever, but always wanted Restmor to make
profits.
'I was 12 to 13 per cent of Mothercare's business but he was 75 per cent of
my business, so that if he dropped me, I would be out. We agreed to give
each other two year's notice but we did not write it out, we just shook
hands on it. When other people went to him when he had 90 to 100 shops, he
kept his word and would not buy from them, because they would not supply
Mothercare at the start.
'He taught me not to be afraid of letting people come into my factory and
going to other people's factories. You learn from each other that way - he
just wanted efficiency. That was also why he and his buying director dealt
directly with the heads of the companies he was involved with; he never left
it to other people.'
Restmor floated in 1969 and was finally sold to BSG Holdings, the consumer
products manufacturer, at the end of 1986 for Pounds 14.9m. Abram stayed
with the company for two years as a consultant before retiring.
He dabbles in the market 'because I just love stocks and shares - I don't
need the money. I've got a nice home and family, and a good golf club. So
long as I can travel, I'm happy.'

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (28): In search of
the missing millions - Unit trusts / Have savers got too much money on
deposit? The industry thinks so
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unit trusts competed fiercely for market share in the first quarter of the
year, as investors' money continued to pour in, mainly through tax-free
personal equity plans and against a continuing background of low interest
rates.
Frustratingly enough for the industry, the value of funds under management
in January fell tantalisingly short of Pounds 100bn, at Pounds 99.86bn, and
the subsequent drop in world markets did not allow the target to be reached
in February either.
The unit trust industry is congratulating itself on having attracted Pounds
8.6bn of net investment in 1993, its best year ever, compared with Pounds
2.9bn of net inflow into the building societies. Despite its satisfaction at
wooing private investors away from the building society, the industry is
still only too aware that the value of its funds amounts roughly to only the
assets of the top two UK building societies.
Its industry body, the Association of Unit and Investment Funds, has begun a
marketing drive aimed at the 'missing millions', which it describes as
'those who may be losing out by keeping too much money on deposit at low
rates of interest.'*
Pep competition
Unit trusts still have much to thank personal equity plans for, as 66 per
cent of unit trust sales to private investors in 1993 was through a Pep.
It is hardly surprising therefore that, in the last quarter of the financial
year, the Pep market was the focus of unit trust competition, as private
investors took their last chance to invest an annual maximum of up to Pounds
9,000 in a Pep.
The Pep price war began well before January, when M&amp;G decided to undercut
other unit trusts groups by waiving altogether the initial charge on its
Managed Income fund. However, since M&amp;G is the largest Pep provider and the
move was backed by heavy advertising, this was a trigger for a steady stream
of 'special offers' and new Pep or fund launches in the run-up to the end of
the tax year.
With attention focused on the initial charge and on withdrawal charges
instead - a step first taken in the UK by Fidelity in 1992 - many companies
have quietly increased their annual management charges, with the standard
fee now at 1.5 per cent. In the long run, this is more detrimental to an
investor's returns: a high initial charge can be made up over time through
performance by a skilled fund manager.
This competition led to Baring Global Fund Managers, the merchant bank's
asset managing arm, pulling out of the Pep market in the new 1994-95 tax
year by ceasing to offer its own Peps. It cited 'a highly congested Pep
marketplace' as putting at risk the provision of 'quality service'.
It may not be long before other small players decide that providing their
own Peps is not cost-effective.
The search for income
Hypo F&amp;C, which attracted Pounds 500m in the first year of its launch in
February 1993 with its High Income fund, announced that it would be cutting
the 'income' paid from 10 per cent to 9 per cent a year from June.
This was interpreted by many as proving how unrealistic the initial 'income'
level had been. The first full year performance figures showed the fund at
the bottom of the tables, with investors suffering a capital loss.
Other companies, mindful of the needs of income-seekers, launched products
aimed at meeting that need. Like F&amp;C, Abbey Life's Extra Income Pep uses
derivatives to boost the yield on the fund, but it has confined the payout
to two percentage points above base rates, capped at 13 per cent. Charges
are 6 per cent initially and 1.5 per cent annually, with a minimum
investment Pounds 3,000.
Others, such as James Capel and Newton, offered Peps which leave it to the
investor to decide the level of income they wish to withdraw. The Generator
Pep is based on Capel's existing UK Tracker fund, which attempts to match
the performance of the FT-SE-A All Share index. The maximum withdrawal level
is 7.5 per cent per annum, with the income paid monthly into a bank or
building society account. Charges are an initial 5.25 per cent initial, with
an annual fee of 1 per cent. Newton's Distributor fund has a higher maximum
withdrawal level of 9 per cent, with charges of 6 per cent initially and 1.5
per cent annually.
Although these are flexible products, in that you can vary the pay-out
levels, withdrawal plans earned a bad name in the 1970s when many investors
had their fingers burnt in the 1974 stock market crash.
Global privatisation
Spurred by the success of two European privatisation funds launched by
Kleinwort Benson and Mercury, which between them raised over Pounds 1bn,
Guinness Flight and Fidelity have marketed two unit trusts investing in
global privatisations.
Both were keen to ensure that their funds qualified for the full annual
general Pep allowance, and have therefore had to restrict themselves to
holding a minimum of 50 per cent in the UK and Europe.
However, Fidelity has allowed itself a broader definition of privatisation
than Guinness Flight, by including companies which it says have benefited,
or will benefit, from the process.
Charges for those investing through the Pep are identical for both funds:
the initial charge is 2 per cent, with withdrawal charges of 3 per cent in
the first year, 2 per cent in the second and 1 per cent in the third. The
annual fee is 1.5 per cent.

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (27): Records
broken, then the market overheats - Investment trusts / Investors should
remember that buying trusts for short-term profit is always a risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Investment trusts had an exciting ride in the first quarter of 1994. Records
were broken and rebroken in the space of a few weeks.
Share issues by new and existing trusts raised about Pounds 2bn - more than
during the whole of 1993. Discounts* were at their lowest level for more
than 20 years, and many trusts in fashionable sectors, such as emerging
markets, were at a premium.
But by the end of February, things were starting to look less rosy. The
floods of money pouring into new issues were starting to thin out; discounts
reappeared on trusts which had become accustomed to trading at a premium; a
few planned issues were postponed as marketing managers realised the
overheated climate was chilling rapidly.
New issues
The biggest launches of the first quarter of 1994 were the two European
privatisation funds from Kleinwort Benson and Mercury Asset Management.
Investor demand was overwhelming: the Kleinwort fund raised Pounds 500m, and
was Pounds 360m oversubscribed; the Mercury fund raised Pounds 575m.
With demand so strong, it was assumed that both funds would go to an
immediate premium when the shares started trading. But that was reckoning
without a distinct change in market sentiment in the period between the
launch and the shares actually hitting the market.
In the event, both trusts have slipped fairly rapidly to a discount to their
initial price of 10 per cent or more - not unusual in historical terms for
investment trusts, but much wider than recent norms, and disappointing for
anyone expecting any investment with the word 'privatisation' attached to be
an immediate moneyspinner.
Investors should remember the golden rule that investment trusts are a
long-term investment - buying them with the aim of making short-term profits
is always a risky proposition.
Three other new funds - Fidelity Japanese Values, Edinburgh New Tiger, and
Schroder UK Growth - raised more than Pounds 100m each, while smaller issues
focused on Israel, Taiwan, Latin America, and smaller companies.
C-shares
Existing trusts also rushed to raise new money with conversion share
(C-share) issues. C-shares are so called because the pool of new money is
kept separate until it has been invested, when the C-shares are converted
into ordinary shares with the same asset value as the existing ordinary
shares.
The most successful of the C-share issues early this year was Fleming
Japanese investment trust, which pulled in Pounds 159m with its conversion
share issue. Abtrust's New Dawn trust and the County Smaller Companies trust
raised about Pounds 29m and Pounds 36m respectively.
Discounts narrow - and widen
The main cause of the record level of interest in investment trusts was
simple: low interest rates.
Savers deserted building societies for shares, as they sought better returns
than the 5 or 6 per cent their money was earning on deposit. Investment and
unit trusts, which spread the risk of investing in equities and are packaged
to make them accessible to private investors, reaped the benefit.
Increased demand pushed up the price of shares in existing investment
trusts, squeezing discounts to their narrowest level for two decades. At one
stage in January, the average discount was 4 per cent - compared with 12 per
cent at the start of 1993 - and discounts of 25 or 30 per cent a decade
earlier.
While existing funds are trading at a premium or near asset value, it makes
sense to buy new issues, as they effectively offer a cheaper way to acquire
the same assets. Fund management groups are happy to oblige with a flood of
new trusts, or additional share issues by existing funds - after all, the
more money they manage, the bigger the fees they earn.
However, as soon as discounts reappear on existing funds, it is more logical
to buy cheaper shares in a trust which has a record, if one exists in your
preferred sector. Demand for new issues then drops off dramatically. This
started to happen by the end of February.
The repercussions in world stock markets of a modest rise in US interest
rates in February also reminded investors that what goes up can also come
down, and made them reluctant to commit more money to the markets.
Public offers which have closed within the last few weeks have generally
raised amounts far short of the original targets. Late this month, the offer
periods for a handful of new trusts were still open, but expectations of how
much money they would raise had been scaled down drastically from the first
month or two of the year.
What next?
The investment trust market needs a little time to digest the huge chunk of
new money it has gobbled up in the past few months. New issues will probably
continue to appear, but as a trickle rather than a flood, and mostly in
specialised areas where there is currently a lack of supply.
The big question now for investment trust companies is how to keep all their
new investors happy. If first-time buyers of trusts see the price of their
shares slumping in the first few months, they may be tempted to cut their
losses and head back to the building society.
The best method investment trusts have found so far for keeping discounts
small and steady (and therefore investors happy) is by establishing savings
schemes, to attract a steady flow of money, providing a constant background
demand for shares. Savings schemes were introduced 10 years ago, and are
increasingly popular among small investors.
Several industry analysts now say that the key to its future lies in
providing more packaged investment products, such as pensions and mortgage
repayment schemes, in direct competition with the traditional life assurance
and pensions industry. This is already starting to happen: Foreign &amp;
Colonial, one of the investment trust giants, recently launched a pension
plan attached to its funds. How soon, and in what way, other providers will
follow remains to be seen.
*An investment trust is said to be trading at a discount when its share
price is lower than the value of assets attributable to each share. A large
discount indicates lack of demand for a share.  Premiums arise when
investors are willing to pay more for a share than its assets are worth.

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (26): Competition
may not lead to lower interest rates - Credit cards / Blame admin and fraud,
says the industry / High Street Investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition in the credit-card market is intensifying. The launch of cards
by General Motors and Ford has created a new means for issuers to attract
cardholders.
Some holders may nevertheless be cynical about whether the market is truly
competitive. Even though base rates have dropped to 5.25 per cent, many
cards still charge an annualised rate above 20 per cent.
However, the card industry points out that the general level of interest
rates is not the main determinant of credit card charges. According to
Elizabeth Phillips, of the Credit Card Research Group, only about 40 per
cent of the interest charged by credit card companies relates to their cost
of funding. The rest relates to administrative costs and fraud.
Nevertheless, the rates charged by the industry did appear a touch uniform
until Save &amp; Prosper broke ranks by introducing a lower rate card last
September. Interest on its Visa and Mastercard is just 0.95 per cent a
month, an APR of 13.9 per cent, compared with annual rates of 23.9 per cent
on cards such NatWest's Primary Visa.
For those who religiously pay off their balance in full each month, the most
important factor is likely to be the annual fee. Lloyds was the first issuer
to impose a fee, in 1990; since when most cards have followed suit, though a
few still hold out against the trend. Some issuers offer a conditional
'no-fee' deal. Others rebate the annual fee if you spend more than a minimum
sum in a year.
The industry norm is an annual fee of Pounds 10-Pounds 12, which still,
according to the industry, is insufficient to cover the costs of servicing a
card account. Those who pay interest, therefore, are still subsidising those
who pay off their bills. And since about three-quarters of cardholders
either never pay interest, or pay it only once or twice a year, this is
another reason why annualised percentage rates are a lot higher than base
rates.
A shift in the balance of power towards the interest-payer is unlikely. The
introduction of annual fees has already led to a reduction in the number of
cards in issue, according to the Credit Card Research Group, and a sharp
rise in annual fees would probably see the trend continue.
Since credit-card spending is still rising, the conclusion is that people
have consolidated their cards, to avoid paying too many annual fees. But the
proportion of adults holding credit cards has also fallen, from a peak of 34
per cent in 1989 to 31 per cent in 1993, according to a study by the
Financial Research Survey and NOP. This may indicate that the bad-debt
problems of the early 1990s have persuaded some consumers to give up their
cards, and may have caused issuers to be more selective when recruiting
holders.
The Ford and GM promotions suggest that the main thrust of future
competition in the credit card market may come from the perks on offer from
issuers. Using a tactic which has already been successful in the US, the
Ford and GM cards offer a points system, which earns the customer a discount
on the price of a new vehicle. The more you spend, the greater the discount
 -although you have to be a big spender to get the full benefit of the
promotion. Earning a Pounds 2,500 discount on a new Vauxhall requires the
holder to spend Pounds 50,000 on the card over five years.
The GM and Ford promotions may merely indicate the level of competition in
the auto market; nevertheless, cards linked to non-financial products may be
the wave of the future. Already the Sunday Times has started to offering its
own Visa card, with an APR of 18.9 per cent. The card offers discounts on a
range of products, including wine.
The probable strategy, rather like the air-miles offer from airlines, is
that a card 'locks in' the consumer to a particular product. Furthermore, as
retailers such as Marks and Spencer have found, a brand-name card allows a
company to accumulate a valuable database on its customers. It would not be
surprising if other groups, such as telecom companies, moved into the
market.
Will all this be of benefit to the consumer? Competition normally does
result in lower prices, though this may well arrive in the form of discounts
off other goods, rather than lower interest rates.
Golden privileges don't come cheap
With the exception of the Co-Op Bank's Visa Gold Card, which is free if used
a minimum of 10 times a year, gold cards do not come cheap. Cardholders pay
an annual fee of between Pounds 25 and Pounds 120 for the privilege.
What are they getting for their money, apart from a feeling of superiority
at the department store counter? Gold cards offer a number of benefits,
including:
Cheap overdrafts. Although you need to be better off to obtain a gold card
(the minimum annual salary is Pounds 20,000), a low-rate loan is the main
incentive. Midland Bank (with its gold Mastercard), Royal Bank of Scotland
(with a gold American Express Card) and the Bank of Scotland (with a gold
Premier card) all charge 2.5 per cent above their base rate. At the time of
writing, that would imply an interest rate of 7.75 per cent.
However, the overdraft limit varies sharply between the three. At Midland,
the limit is just Pounds 2,500; at the Royal Bank of Scotland, Pounds
10,000; and at the Bank of Scotland, Pounds 15,000.
Spending limits. This depends on whether the card is a 'charge card' (in
which case the balance has to be paid off in full every month) or a normal
credit card. Charge cards have no pre-set spending limit, which can be very
handy when paying for flights or hotel bills on foreign trips. On the other
hand, this facility is also available with a plain American Express card.
The conventional credit cards have fairly high minima (Pounds 3,000 with the
Co-Op and Midland's Gold Visa, Pounds 2,500 with Lloyds Bank's Gold
Mastercard).
Cash withdrawals. Gold cards normally allow holders to withdraw substantial
amounts of cash, at home and abroad, but at the expense of a fee, usually of
1.5 to 2 per cent a transaction. Midland's gold Visa, for example, allows
holders to withdraw up to Pounds 500 a day.
Travel. Most cards offer free insurance for travellers, with impressive
levels of cover ranging up to Pounds 250,000 at the Bank of Scotland.
However, this insurance usually covers only death or injury.
Many cards also offer a travel service, and guaranteed hotel reservations,
so that even if you arrive late, your room is not transferred to another
guest.
Extra incentives. Most gold cards offer roughly the same type of services,
so some card issuers have produced enticing extras. to try to differentiate
their product. With Midland's gold Mastercard, for example, you get access
to a priority share-dealing service. With the American Express Gold
Card,there is an 'entertainment service', which offers tickets to special
events.
Lloyds Bank's gold Mastercard offers a discount off on RAC membership. The
Coutts gold card, and the NatWest gold Mastercard offer you air miles
points.

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (25): Banks woo the
new stockmarket investor - Buying shares / Four big clearers are said to
account for 40 per cent of the private-client retail market / High Street
Investment
</HEADLINE>

Anyone rash enough to suggest that the banks have been overtaken in the
scramble to compete for the affections of the new audience of stockmarket
investors is likely to receive a dusty answer.
The stockbroking arms of the high street banks admit that the banks took
some time to come off their starting blocks, but they argue that they are
now firmly in the race. According to Robert Froy, managing director of
Lloyds Bank Stockbrokers, the four major clearing banks account for around
40 per cent of the private client retail market.
Froy comments: 'It has been a very interesting experience for the banks,
which are not naturally inclined to this kind of entrepreneurial activity.
But I think they have overcome that. We have the perceived integrity, and we
have the capital resources to invest in the technology that is needed.'
Justin Urquhart Stewart, director of planning and business development at
Barclays Stockbrokers, adds: 'Traditionally, banks have always had business
going through their branches, which they fed out to local stockbrokers, but
then they woke up to the fact that they were giving away client names,
capital money and 75 per cent of the commission. When we set up Barclays
Stockbrokers, it involved taking a scythe out and cutting off these
relationships.'
Clive Wood, director and general manager of Midland Stockbrokers, believes
that banks have also brought 'some pretty slick systems' into the market. He
says: 'Banks recognised the importance of systems. When they first came into
this in the mid-1980s, there was a settlement backlog and every deal was a
complaint.'
To an extent, too, banks have had the advantage of a captive audience
through their branch networks, although critics claim that they have failed
to exploit this. Bankers would deny the charge, pointing to the fact that
NatWest, for instance, has touch-screens to sell shares in 280 of its
branches, and a telephone-based share-dealing system in the remaining 1,500.
'We average about 3,000 bargains a day,' says Carol Griffiths, NatWest's
controller of savings and investments. 'One in eight share deals is done
through Natwest.'
However, there is some agreement that there may be a shift in the role of
the branch as a simple source of clients. For instance, Froy foresees the
day when bank customers will be able to deal in shares by putting a smart
card in the wall.
Wood believes that the success of telephone dealing services may also lessen
the importance of the branch network.
Midland's Teletrade service is designed for non-Midland customers, and the
bank has recently launched a promotional campaign for the service.
Banks are also trying to develop their share-dealing client base by building
niche services. Likely expansion areas are more provision of advice, the
linking of share-dealing with banks' trustee and nominee services, and the
linking of stock settlement with bank statements.
Urquhart Stewart points out that personalised advice can be priced very
cheaply by banks, 'because the research is already there. A lot of people
want a direct opinion: is it a buy, or is it a sell? More to the point is
the question: 'Is it a buy or a sell, given what I've got?'.'
'We used to focus on investment advice,' says Wood, 'but if you watch the
telephone calls, what people are really desperate for is information. We
don't charge separately for advice. It is a bit of a loss leader, but we are
happy to give information and advice free, as we hope and expect to get the
business.'
Froy says Lloyds Stockbrokers offers 'perfectly adequate advice' over the
telephone. 'Our free advice sets us apart from the others, but I am not
certain that a great number of clients want advice.'
Urquhart Stewart also believes that the expansion of company share schemes -
'the next big growth area of wider and deeper share ownership' - will
present banks with particular marketing opportunities. 'We can provide both
the SAYE contract and the Corporate Pep,' he says. 'Our aim is to make the
share ownership pond a lake.'
All banks will have to decide how far they are prepared to compete on price,
in order to expand their share-dealing businesses, however. Charges for
their telephone services are being undercut by a number of competitors,
including building societies such as the Yorkshire, National &amp; Provincial
and Halifax; and, as Froy says, 'the almost finite number of investors are
now doing the rounds to see where they can do their deals most cheaply.'
Urquhart Stewart comments: 'Price-cutting is in vogue, because firms are
buying market share, but market share of what? Abbey National, TSB and
British Gas are the main shares traded. They are chasing down the lower end
of the market.'
'I'm not going to lose any money on price,' says Wood. 'I will make money by
capturing a reasonably large slice of the market, but l am certainly not
going to compete with a Pounds 9 bargain. I will be competing on price, but
I'll also be competing on service.'
'There are always people for whom price is important,' agrees NatWest's
Griffiths, 'but we think accessibility may be more important than price. We
offer one of the cheapest services around, anyway, with our Pounds 9.99 post
service for those for whom the price of dealing is of paramount importance.'
Froy concludes: 'What Lloyds Bank Stockbrokers offer is good administration.
We make sure we pay clients on time, and we deal at a good price.'

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (24): Old names
compete for new money - Private banking / As the scene changes, prospective
clients should beware of snobbery / High Street Investment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The private banking market of the 1990s is more about serious money
management than serious wealth.
The old names synonymous with private banking, like C. Hoare &amp; Co, Coutts,
Robert Fleming and Child &amp; Co, no longer take it for granted that longevity
and snob appeal attract private clients. Nowadays they have to battle for
their market share with some of the newer entrants, such as Lloyds Private
Banking and Barclays Private Banking, or Credit Suisse and Chase Manhattan.
This month Midland announced that it, too, would launch a private banking
arm in July.
But the term 'private banking' has always been misunderstood, says Michael
Maslinski of Coutts &amp; Co, now owned by National Westminster: 'Historically,
it meant that the bank was actually privately owned by the partners, and not
the type of service it offered. So you had C. Hoare &amp; Co in London, Brown
Brothers Harriman in New York, and Lombard Odier in Geneva.
'Today, different banks have different interpretations of private banking.
Some see it simply as a way of more profitably servicing those clients who
want something over and above a domestic bank account. The serious ones,
however, offer an all-round bespoke service with instant access to a special
manager who can provide quick answers and solutions, or at least knows where
to go to get the right information. Clearly, that type of service is more
likely to appeal to people in a higher income or asset bracket.'
But the 300-year-old Coutts, which once boasted Charles Dickens and Frederic
Chopin as clients and still retains strong links with the arts and
entertainments world, has not abandoned all its links with the past. Says
Maslinski: 'We still retain frock coats, to symbolise the old traditions and
values.'
To use any private banking facility solely for its current account services,
because of its name or smart livery, will prove costly. Coutts prefers its
clients to maintain an average balance of Pounds 3,000 on a current account.
If they do, then there are no bank charges. If, however, that balance is not
maintained, then charges start at Pounds 30 a quarter plus 75p for every
cheque or any other type of transaction that goes through the account. Some
concession is made, though, to clients who are just about to start out on
their money-making careers. Students enjoy free banking with Coutts if they
remain in credit.
On the investment management side, Coutts offers a portfolio service of unit
and investment trusts for Pounds 50,000 or more. The initial fee is 2 per
cent and 1 per cent thereafter. The discretionary management service, which
also includes equity investment, requires a portfolio of Pounds 100,000 or
more.
Even new entrants to the market, such as Barclays Private Banking, find
little demand for a simple banking service, although clients can have a
cheque-book in the special livery. Michael Tomalin, managing director of
Barclays Private Banking, says: 'It is certainly not a lead product, and
some of our clients actually have their current accounts with another bank.
'We see ourselves as being in the business of wealth management. The three
core areas of our business are investment management, banking, and financial
planning through the use of trusts and offshore vehicles. When I say
banking, I don't mean cheque-books for private clients, but providing access
to markets which trade in Treasury products such as swaps, fiduciary
deposits, derivatives and foreign exchange.
'What appeals to many of our clients is the fact that we are not just a
UK-based business. Britain is just part of a worldwide network.'
Broadly speaking, Barclays' Private Banking clients are expected to have a
minimum portfolio of around Pounds 250,000. But the average., according to
Tomalin, is 'Pounds 1m or more'.
Lloyds Private Banking makes no concession to special current account
facilities. Its clients use the standard services provided by the parent
bank through high street branches. On the other hand, they can call on a
private network of 43 offices in England and Wales, which have their own
livery and dedicated account managers for each client.
David Terry, a senior manager at Lloyds Private Banking, which has 24,000
clients with some Pounds 6bn under management, says: 'You don't have to be a
millionaire to be a client with us. Our entry level is Pounds 75,000 of cash
or marketable securities, which generally means shares or fixed-term
deposits.
'That is considerably lower than many of our competitors. Clients receive
independent advice on all aspects of their financial affairs, from asset
management and personal tax planning to wills and estate planning and estate
management.'
Fees start at 1 per cent of funds under management up to Pounds 500,000 and
are negotiable thereafter.
The private banking market is becoming increasingly competitive, and the
choice much wider, as more institutions see the attractions of generating a
healthy and steady flow of fee income from wealthier clients who need more
than straightforward retail banking services.
Terry's advice to prospective private banking clients is 'to assess whether,
for the sum of money you have to invest, you are going to get a full or a
partial service. A full service means access to a dedicated manager at all
times, who knows your business and your particular circumstances and can
advise accordingly. That is the essence of private banking.'

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (23): Trivial
transgressions draw heavy punishment - Current accounts / Banks' biggest
public relations task is to explain to customers why they face such tight
restrictions / High Street Investment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Opinion pollsters and market researchers rarely have a problem finding
people with an opinion to express about banks. But given that 97 per cent of
the population have some form of banking account, that is hardly surprising.
Figures from the British Bankers' Association show that there are 52m
current accounts in the UK. Of these, 18m are non-interest-bearing personal
accounts, and 34m are current accounts which pay interest and offer free
banking facilities to customers in credit.
But the rate of interest paid on credit balances is now negligible.
According to MoneyFacts, the monthly guide to investment rates, interest on
straightforward current accounts, as opposed to high-interest cheque
accounts, could be as low as 0.25 per cent gross on Pounds 1,000. Even
balances of as high as Pounds 50,000 could be earning less than 4 per cent
gross.
However, the public relations battle which the banks have to win is not in
explaining why interest rates are so low on current accounts. Most customers
accept that better rates are available if they are prepared to put their
money in a notice account. The real problem lies in the ever-tighter
restrictions that banks place on current accounts, and which leave customers
facing draconian charges for even the smallest transgression.
Charging anything from Pounds 7.50 to Pounds 20 for a bank letter to tell
you that you are overdrawn by as little as Pounds 10, and then charging
another Pounds 20 to bounce the cheque, is guaranteed to alienate customers.
This type of complaint is widespread, particularly among customers with
interest-bearing current accounts. Many banks have failed to make it clear
enough to these customers that the downside to earning interest on a current
account, and enjoying free banking facilities, is that going overdrawn, even
inadvertently, will often attract higher charges than a non-interest bearing
current account.
Bank customers who do need an overdraft facility should arrange an
authorised version. This is likely to cost at least Pounds 14 or Pounds 15 a
year in fees, and often much more, depending on how often it is used.
Monthly interest is then levied at around 1.4 per cent. Unauthorised
overdrafts will cost twice as much.
Over the past decade, customer demands have changed radically. In order to
keep pace with the increased expectations, the banks have simply bolted on
more and more services to what were originally basic current accounts.
Geoff Ellerton, a general manager at Midland Bank, admits: 'Banks have to
put their own house in order first. But we also have to get across the
message about what we offer. And that is free banking for current accounts
in credit, interest payments, access to cash machines, cheque guarantees,
standing orders and direct debits. The collective cost of money
transmissions alone is Pounds 4.5bn a year.'
Sooner, rather than later, the high street banks will make a move to claw
back the money being spent on current accounts. Charges will be extended
even to those customers with credit balances. The banks have considered the
idea very seriously a number of times. All that is holding them back is that
none of them wants to be the first to put their head above the parapet. Once
the first one breaks rank, the others will follow swiftly.
Linda Skelton, senior marketing manager at Yorkshire Bank, says: 'The first
move to introduce general charges for current accounts will most likely come
from one of the big clearers. It definitely won't be us. The majority of
current accounts do not keep large balances, and it costs the banks money to
run them.'
Skelton believes that the smaller banks, with their lower overheads, are now
well-placed to capture a bigger share of the current account market. She
explains: 'Yorkshire has about 4 per cent of the banking market, which is on
a par with the Co-operative Bank. But we have less bureaucracy than the
bigger banks, and therefore we can offer a more personalised degree of
service. In future it is the genuine level of service which banks offer with
their current accounts that will attract customers.
'Customers want efficiency, particularly if a complaint or a mistake is
made. They also want a quick response to any request for help or advice,
whether it is about mortgages, savings or investments. Increasingly,
customers who do shop around will look at how different banks interpret the
banking code of practice. The good banks will go far beyond just adhering to
the basic principles of the code.'
One current account service that is often overlooked, but is becoming
increasingly popular, is a Money Market account, although these tend to have
much higher minimum opening balances. Midland, for example, insists on
Pounds 5,000 and others will want at least Pounds 25,000. The advantage is
that the interest rate payable on these accounts is the equivalent to that
earned by bankers on the overnight money markets. The most sophisticated
accounts will even conduct a daily sweep of all the customers' accounts and
put any surplus cash on the market to earn interest overnight.
But in spite of such innovations, by far the biggest change, and the one
most likely to broaden customer choice in the personal current account
banking market, has been the growth of telephone banking.
The market leader is Midland's First Direct telephone bank, which is open 24
hours a day, 365 days a year. Although it was the first genuinely branchless
telephone bank, First Direct customers can still pay in their cheques for
nothing over the counter at Midland branches. Competitors to First Direct
now include Bank of Scotland, Girobank, Co-operative and, from this month,
Royal Bank of Scotland. The RBS Direct Banking operation will be able to
draw on the experience gained from the bank's successful and hugely
profitable telephone-based Direct insurance arm.
Kevin Newman, chief executive of First Direct, which was launched in 1989
and has nearly 406,000 customers, says: 'We believe that telephone banking
appeals to about 20 per cent of the market. But we have to explain to
potential customers what we offer against other types of banking services.
It is not just the fact that we can save people time, although the average
call takes about three minutes. It is the overall range we provide, from
mortgages, savings, investments, share-dealing and even foreign currency.'
As the bank current account market moves towards the introduction of charges
for different levels of service, many customers will take stock of what they
actually want from their banks. As Pauline Hedges, of the British Bankers'
Association, points out, the range of services, the interest rates paid and
the charges levied all boil down to much the same, even if the wrapper is
slightly different. At the end of the day, she says, 'customers must choose
the account which suits them personally.'

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (22): Certainty, and
there's no tax to worry about - National Savings / The Government savings
arm has two advantages / High Street Investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
National Savings started the year at a fast clip pace towards its
Treasury-set target of Pounds 3bn.
Pensioners' bonds, launched at the end of January, had pulled in Pounds 906m
in mainly new money from 90,000 over-65s by the end of March. Another 16,300
investors are expected to switch a total of about Pounds 180m from NS income
bonds into the pensioners bonds after the end of this month, when their
three-months' notice is up.
Meanwhile, the Pounds 1m monthly jackpot on premium bonds, which will be
drawn from this month onwards, had attracted record-breaking net sales of
premium bonds totalling Pounds 424m by the end of March.
The Department for National Savings has two main advantages over its
traditional high-street rivals for savings, the building societies:
authorisation to pay interest gross to everyone, not just non-taxpayers; and
a greater range of tax-free or partly tax-exempt products.
Tessas and save-as-you-earn schemes available from the societies, but not
from National Savings, provide tax-free interest on maximum amounts of
Pounds 9,000 and Pounds 1,200 respectively.
The SAYE scheme, which is run by a handful of societies, including the
Bradford &amp; Bingley, the Cheshire and the Halifax, at present offers a higher
rate of tax-free return (8.3 per cent over five years, 8.62 per cent over
seven years) than the National Savings 41st issue of savings certificates
and Yearly Plan, both paying 5.4 per cent compound if held for five years.
But it is clear that savers cannot look forward to any very strenuous
competition for deposit-based savings between building societies and
National Savings, unless house prices rise by far more than the 5 per cent
recently forecast for this year.
Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building
society, who is also chairman of the Council of Mortgage Lenders said the
C&amp;G saw itself as competing with other societies rather than with National
Savings, which was in a different ballpark.
Yet, in July 1992, it was Longhurst who led societies in an attack on
National Savings' newly launched First Option Bond. Within two weeks, this
succeeded in forcing a rate cut from 7.75 to 7.25 per cent, after
threatening to raise mortgage rates.
Longhurst explained this as a 'blip' in which National Savings had been far
out of line with the rest of the savings market: 'Generally we would not be
fazed by the launch of one product, unless, as with the FOB, there were
something out of line that we thought would create a problem,' he said. 'In
that case, we would take the necessary action before it affected our
investors and borrowers.'
Societies made no threats of higher mortgage rates in January, when National
Savings launched the pensioners bonds. Paying gross monthly income at 7 per
cent a year, fixed for five years, the bonds are open to over-65s with
between Pounds 500 and Pounds 20,000 to invest - below the level of lump
sums that societies prefer to attract.
According to Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, the
pensioners bonds target just over half of Britain's 8.7m over-65s - those
estimated to have savings of Pounds 500 or more.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke said of the bonds, in his budget speech:
'Pensioners will be able to invest their savings with complete security and
know exactly what income they will be getting month in, month out.'
But, as with most of National Savings' other products, savers are
effectively asked to lock themselves in for five years at what may be a low
point in the interest-rate cycle. The escape option on the pensioners bonds
is at a cost of 60 days' notice plus 60 days' interest.
In general, the security on offer from National Savings does not include any
protection against inflation. The exception is the 7th issue of index-linked
savings certificates, which offer a tax-free return equal to the change in
the retail prices index plus a guaranteed 3 per cent a year compound when
held for five years.
Premium bonds have always sold well during periods of low savings rates,
when holders feel they are sacrificing little for a shot at some of the 5.2
per cent prize fund. But buyers may not realise how lucky they need to be in
order to hit the Pounds 1m jackpot. With a maximum Pounds 20,000 holding, a
bond-holder currently has a one-in-165,000 chance of collecting Pounds 1m -
slightly more than three times the one-in-54,145 probability of dealing a
five-card hand containing four aces.
Anyone owning Pounds 1,000 of bonds (recently about the average purchase)
has a one-in-3.3m chance of winning the jackpot.
But for each single Pounds 1 bond - and the 4.6m people own just one - the
chance of winning Pounds 1m is one-in-3.3bn. And the more bonds that are
bought, the more remote the chance becomes.
Understandably, National Savings' promotional leaflet on premium bonds
mentions a rather more manageable figure: it cites only the one-in-15,000
chance that each bond stands of winning any prize at all each month.

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (21): Larger savers
get the best deal - Building societies / The societies need more money, and
admit that investors with big sums are receiving more generous interest. But
small depositors need not despair if they will only do some research / High
Street Investment

Having almost negotiated the uncharted waters of the worst housing recession
for more than 50 years, building societies are facing another challenge: how
to attract and retain new money in the present low interest rate
environment.
Income from building society accounts has more than halved since interest
rates peaked in 1990, and increasingly income-seekers are looking elsewhere
for higher returns. As a result, societies are experiencing strong
competition from other savings institutions, particularly from the unit
trust industry and from National Savings, the Government's savings arm.
Unit trusts have been reporting record inflows of new money, on the back of
strong stock market performance; and National Savings had attracted Pounds
906m into its new Pensioner Guaranteed Income Bond by the end of March,
after the bond's launch in January. This competition has not yet caused
widespread concern within the building society industry, because the
fragility of the recovery in the housing market has meant that demand for
mortgage finance is still muted.
According to Graham Berville, who was until recently general manager of
development at Norwich &amp; Peterborough but has since taken up an appointment
with Commercial Union: 'In the current climate, and with current levels of
mortgage demand, the issue is whether building societies need to attract
large volumes of retail funds. At the moment the products available enable
us to attract enough money to satisfy mortgage demand, although I think the
issue of wholesale funding will come into sharper focus over the next year
or so.'
David Gilchrist, general manager of the Halifax, adds: 'I don't think the
industry as a whole is having any problem funding the limited mortgage
business. Money is not leaving societies; savers are leaving the interest to
capitalise. It is just over-the-counter inflow that we are not getting.'
Gilchrist points out that some of the competition facing building societies
may also be short-lived. 'We think stock market returns are unsustainable
over the long term, and that there is some underestimation of the risk. We
can't rule out the possibility of a surge of inflow if anything should
happen to destabilise the stock market.'
David Blake, manager of corporate relations at the Woolwich, agrees: 'You
can't compete with the government's National Savings, but unit trusts are a
changing market. Anything that is linked to the stock market is an immediate
problem, but not a long-term one.'
Building societies also argue that many savers are suffering from what
Gilchrist describes as a 'money illusion', because they concentrate on
headline interest rates rather than returns in relation to inflation.
Berville says: 'People are looking at building society returns in terms of a
straight rate, but the rate in line with inflation looks pretty good. If in
the main your reason for investing is to maintain the value of your money, I
think a rate of 7 per cent, which is easily attainable, is not that bad.'
After several years of shielding battered borrowers, building society
managers are also conscious of the need to cushion their savers from the
effect of lower interest rates. Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of
Nationwide, says: 'The reality is that even now savings rates are above the
prevailing market level. What we are essentially trying to do is protect the
saver, as we protected the borrower when interest rates were high.'
Few building society managers would deny that these days larger investors
are being rather more carefully protected than small savers, however.
'We are all trying to attract the big money,' acknowledges Blake. 'If you
look at the rates, you can't get much of a return on sums below Pounds
5,000. No one wants an account opened with Pounds 1 nowadays. We tend to
ignore that market. All marketing now is geared to the person who has a lot
of money.'
'We would regard Pounds 500 as a relatively small account,' agrees
Gilchrist. 'We pay good rates on children's and teenagers'accounts, but for
other investors a realistic savings target must be in four figures. We do
still have small savings accounts, but they are not paying much of a rate of
interest.'
Increasingly, too, building societies are widening their investment products
to cover unit trusts and equity-linked schemes, in order to meet the
financial needs of a more sophisticated audience.
As Melville-Ross explains: 'We have to ask ourselves what will happen if the
government has got it right, and we are in for a low-inflation, low-interest
rate, steady-growth environment. The scenario there is one of a much lower
demand on both sides of the balance sheet. You therefore end up with a
shrinking balance sheet unless you diversify.
Nevertheless, the savings account is still the core investment product of
every building society, and pricing is crucial if a society is to compete
both with other savings institutions and with its peers. These days some
customers will switch to another building society for a slender 0.5 per cent
interest rate advantage.
Berville comments: 'I came from outside the industry, and I was initially
surprised that the opportunity to differentiate a savings product was so
limited. People haven't done much with building society accounts. They
simply differentiate on price.'
Price advantage is the key to the success of postal accounts, the last major
building society innovation. The theory is that the saving on branch time
can be passed to customers with these accounts. Blake says: 'I think this is
where the growth area is, because a building society can then afford to
offer that little bit of extra margin. And I have to say that building
societies must start to question their huge branch networks.'
An initial deposit of Pounds 2,500 or Pounds 5,000 is required for many
postal accounts, but Birmingham Midshires and Teachers both accept a modest
Pounds 500.
Indeed, despite building societies' unblushing preference for the larger
investor, smaller savers need not despair if they conduct proper market
research. As Adrian Coles, director general of the Building Societies
Association, says: 'Small savers can still find some attractive deals if
they are he is prepared to shop around.'
Coles is also confident that building societies will be able to rise to the
challenge of the current competitive pressures, on both on the savings and
the mortgage fronts. And he cites three reasons for his optimism: 'Building
societies' management costs are lower than their major competitors'; their
image is better; and they are better liked.'

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): Clarify your
needs in the confusing world where everyone is doing everything - A
profusion of overlapping services makes it hard to know where to turn, yet
the dearth of impartial financial advice has pushed the onus of choice
firmly on to the customer / High Street Investment

The 1980s revolution in food retailing was hard to ignore or misunderstand.
The out-of-town superstores were highly visible, and one visit sufficed to
show what they sold and how their goods compared with traditional high
street competitors'.
The revolution in the high street market for savings and investment has been
more confused and confusing. Banks and building societies both seem to be
all things to all customers nowadays. Cash management, mortgages, other
loans, savings, investment and share dealing are all available on most
street corners. But this profusion of overlapping services makes it hard to
know where to go for which service. You no longer get impartial financial
advice from any of the major banks or most building societies, which has
pushed the onus for making the right choice firmly on to the customer.
The clearer your idea of your own financial requirements, the easier you
will find it to work out where to go for what. But the precise services
provided vary considerably, particularly among different building societies.
Bradford &amp; Bingley is the only major society that continues to provide
independent advice. Some societies provide chequebooks; some provide
execution-only stockbroking, some have their own unit trusts, some have
credit cards - and so on.
Current accounts and money transmission
Banks, building societies and customers are all unhappy about this key
aspect of the market. The financial firms admit that they are really only
interested in current accounts with large balances, and keen to introduce
charges on other current accounts.
As an interim measure, they continue to impose stringent penalties on any
current account holders who slip into overdraft, particularly any who fail
to get permission first. Current accounts which pay (currently derisory)
interest often have the steepest penalties for temporary borrowing.
Customers dislike the penalty system, the time it takes for cheques to
clear, and what they see as inefficient bureaucracy.
The remarkable success of the telephone banking system, pioneered by
Midland's First Direct, is testimony as much to the unpopularity of
conventional branch banks as to the convenience of a 24-hour telephone
service.
Telephone banking seems has far wider appeal than the alternative, currently
fashionable with bankers, known as 'private banking'. Broadly this consists
of getting the banks' more affluent customers to pay stiff fees in order to
receive the kind of all round advisory service that most people feel is
their birthright.
Deposit accounts
These still exist, but perhaps it would be better if they did not. Most of
the principal high street chains offer very poor deposit rates. If you
glance quickly down our weekly table of Highest Rates for your Money
(published every Saturday in Weekend FT), it's unlikely you'll find any of
the big high street names there. And once again, if you really want the best
rate you'll probably have to do some shopping around and may well find the
results surprising.
You can often get nearly as good a rate of interest from some instant-access
accounts with relatively small minimum deposits as you do for larger
deposits with a longer notice period. One point to watch: the best rates
often come from postal accounts, which share the cost advantages of
telephone banking. Some of them have the reputation of getting a bit behind
with their paperwork at times.
Short-term borrowing
It's sensible to consider this in tandem with your current account. For, as
we said, the big drawback to many current accounts is the penal costs they
impose on borrowing. Using a credit card to finance short-term borrowing is
usually the cheapest and most flexible way of doing so, even if you have a
card which charges an annual fee as most now do.
Rolling the credit from one card to another, and thus avoiding charges on
longer term borrowing, will appeal only to those who regard avoiding charges
as a sport. But even if you do pay charges for a short period, that may well
be cheaper than an overdraft if you are borrowing a small amount for a
shortish period.
The point to grasp is that the old-fashioned current account with a built-in
overdraft really is dead.
You need an efficient current account and (depending on the extent of your
financial rectitude) a cost-effective borrowing facility. The two may happen
to come from the same source, but there is no longer any automatic tie
between them.
Mortgages
Available everywhere, with rates changing all the time. The high street
banks and big building societies are often competitive here, but the best
offers tend to vary over time.
First decide what kind of mortgage you want - fixed or floating rate,
repayment or endowment (not recommended), or even a Pep mortgage. Then
either prepare for a lot of telephoning, or send off for a free copy of
Moneyfacts (telephone 0692-500677) which carries the latest rates. One
rather dastardly short-cut is to phone a mortgage broker, such as John
Charcol, and find out what his best offer is - then try to match it
yourself.
Longer-term savings
Until the recent stock market setback, very few savings rates looked at all
attractive compared with stockmarket-based alternatives. Now their main
drawback is that the longer-term schemes may look unattractive if interest
rates rise significantly. As so often, some of the National Savings products
look relatively attractive.
Investments
If you want to buy a unit trust or individual shares, all the banks will
oblige and so will a handful of building societies. But be aware that the
banks only sell their own unit trusts nowadays, and these are not
necessarily the leaders in their chosen areas.
With building societies, you need to check what the society's role is -
promoter or agent. Even if you are buying a very conservative trust, it's
worth checking its comparative record in one of the trade magazines, such as
Money Management, first.
For more specialised trusts and advice on share dealing, you might well do
better deserting the high street for a good stockbroker or independent
fee-based financial adviser. But it is misleading to generalise.

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): Launches
reflect faith in Japan - What's new?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Geographic fashion is evident in some of the latest investment vehicles to
be launched, with appearances from both of this year's most favoured areas,
Japan and Latin America.
Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial began a three-week offer period for its Japanese
Growth unit trust on Monday. Charges on the trust are 5 per cent initially
and 1.5 per cent annually, with a bid-offer spread of 5 per cent.
Hypo F&amp;C Japanese Growth will be managed by Mairi Stewart, who says the
group's view is that earnings in Japan are currently extremely depressed
historically - more severely than in previous cyclical downturns - but that
this will change significantly for the better over the next three years.
Stewart said she would be trying to identify areas that will benefit from
the economic improvement expected in the coming 12 months.
She noted that continuing deregulation in Japan would lead to a more
competitive environment, generating winners and losers that the new fund
would seek to identify in advance.
Schroder will launch a Japanese investment trust early in May, and says the
trust will invest in the full range of Japanese equities without any
limitation on the type of company or sector. It will be managed from
Schroder's Tokyo office by Ed Merner, manager of Schroder's Japanese smaller
companies unit trust, ranked top-performing Japanese fund over five and 10
years by Micropal, with gains of 145 per cent and 824 per cent respectively
to April 1 this year, compared with sector averages of 25 per cent over a
total of 62 funds and 261 per cent over a total of 28 funds.
The minimum investment is likely to be Pounds 1,000, and there is to be one
free warrant for every five ordinary shares. The annual management charge is
expected to be 1 per cent, without any additional performance-related fee.
Save &amp; Prosper has scheduled the launch of a Latin America unit trust for
mid-May. The minimum investment is set at either Pounds 1,000 as a lump sum
or Pounds 35 a month for regular savings, with an initial charge of 5.5 per
cent and an annual charge of 1.5 per cent.
S&amp;P's Latin America unit trust will be managed by Susanne Carrington, who
has been with the emerging markets portfolio group at S&amp;P's parent, Robert
Fleming, since 1990, after transferring from institutional marketing. She is
on record as expecting an average 15 to 20 per cent return from Latin
American markets over the next three to five years.
Benoit Buchaud, a member of Carrington's fund management team, explained
that 44 per cent of the portfolio would initially be allocated to Mexico,
reflecting the importance of that market in the Latin American index. The
rest of the breakdown will be: Brazil (29 per cent), Chile (11), Argentina
(8), Colombia (4) and Venezuela and Peru 2 per cent each.
Buchaud said Latin America was beginning to shed its traditional image of
being plagued by political unrest and inflation, despite the peasants'
revolt and recent killing of a presidential candidate in Mexico and
continuing inflation of about 2,500 per cent a year in Brazil.
He noted that inflation in Argentina had come down from about 5,000 per cent
in 1989 to around 7 per cent, while in Peru the level had dropped from 2,700
per cent a year to about 39 per cent.
The M&amp;G Group, which built its reputation on equity investment, has recently
turned more attention to fixed-interest vehicles, with the explicit aim of
attracting disaffected building society depositors.
The latest example of this change of emphasis is the M&amp;G Lifetime
Distribution bond, launched on this month. It is a single-premium policy
involving a minimum investment of Pounds 10,000. Income from the assets is
kept separate from the capital and can be paid out in distributions - hence
the name - or reinvested.
Bill Vasilieff, head of product Bill Vasilieff, head of product marketing at
M&amp;G, said the Lifetime bond was innovative in allowing holders to switch
among five of the group's funds, instead of putting the investor's money
into a set proportion of fixed-interest securities and equities as other
distribution bonds do. The first switch in any year is free, with subsequent
moves from fund to fund charged at about Pounds 20 each (on the Pounds
10,000 minimum investment).
The annual management charge is 1 per cent, and the bid-offer spread is 5
per cent. Early cash-in penalties on the five-year version of the bond rage
from 6 per cent in the first year to 2 per cent in the fifth year. On the
10-year version, the penalties range from 10 per cent in the first year to 1
per cent in the 10th.
With Pounds 200 to Pounds 250m a month going into distribution bonds in the
market as a whole, Vasilieff said M&amp;G hoped to more than double the Pounds
14m a month it currently attracts with an existing bond. Sold purely through
brokers, the Lifetime bond will pay either 5.25 per cent initial commission
or 3.25 per cent plus renewal commission.

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (18): History in the
north, bargains in the south - Alternative investments / Starting in stamps,
3 / Collectors will find fascinating contrasts in the postage of the
American continent. US commemoratives celebrate important events, while in
the Latin countries even rarities are still affordable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The stamps of the Americas offer the widest possible choice for new
collectors. At one extreme there is the philatelic and postal history of the
US, perhaps the most collected, most researched, postage in the world. It is
of primary interest, not unnaturally, to American citizens, and the rarest
items are furiously competed for.
In complete contrast, the stamps of Latin American countries still offer
manifold possibilities. The growing prosperity of nations like Brazil and
Chile have brought some rich locals into the field, but a very impressive
collection of most South American nations can be put together for Pounds
50,000, and a good collection for Pounds 10,000. Anyone concerned about the
investment potential of stamps should look hard at Latin America.
A characteristic of US collecting is that the stamps must be perfect, not
just in the condition of the stamp but in such intricacies as the centring
of the image. One that is well centred can cost 30 times as much as a good
example which is off-centre.
Take one of the most famous, and sought-after, American stamps - the 24 cent
Curtis Jenny of 1918, one sheet of which shows this biplane upside down. If
an example of the Inverted Jenny is perfect, with the plane in the centre of
the stamp, it might sell for Pounds 100,000; if off-centre the price falls
to nearer Pounds 60,000. Not all the stamps from this rogue sheet have been
recovered, and this is definitely a stamp to look out for.
Another priority among leading collectors of American postage is sheets of
unused multiples: the bigger the block, the greater the value. In contrast,
there is also a great interest in novelties, in examples of postal history
destined for exotic locations, or involving famous personalities. For
example, the illustration shows a signed cover by the aviator Amelia
Earhart, carried by her on a flight from Mexico City in 1935 and bearing a
Mexican stamp in her honour, which made Dollars 9,200 at Sotheby's last
summer.
Stamp collecting does not have the cachet of picture collecting among the
very rich, and there are fewer wealthy buyers, so the prices of the great
rarities in any postage depends upon the number of keen affluent collectors
at any one time. The disappearance of just one big player can see the value
of rarities sink until they reach the pocket of the much more numerous group
of middling-rich buyers.
Still, the great rarities usually sell well. Last September, Christie's set
a new record for a single-owner collection of US stamps when it took Dollars
9.5m for the collection of Ryobe Ishikawa. It was one of the best American
collections to come on the market in decades, although Ishikawa was reported
to have spent Dollars 16m acquiring it in the early 1980s. One of only two
known covers bearing the first stamps issued by both Canada and the US, a
letter sent to London in May 1851, sold for Dollars 727,500, a record for an
American cover sold at auction.
But if the US postage seems over-researched, intricate, and dominated by
generations of rich American collectors, there are peripheral areas that
offer opportunities for outsiders: commemoratives, for example. The US was
first into this field, in 1893, with stamps to celebrate the voyage of
Columbus four centuries earlier. This set has always been sought after, and
might cost up to Pounds 10,000, but should prove a durable investment.
In the same way, the postage of the Civil War period, especially the stamps
produced in the southern states, retains its fascination. A stamp bearing
the portrait of the Confederate leader Jefferson Davis might only cost
Pounds 5; but the stamps produced locally, in extremis, by individual
southern cities, like Athens, Georgia, or Greenville, Alabama, are more
costly, but probably safe investments.
As in Europe, there is little interest in stamps issued in the mid to late
20th century: there are just too many of them. And many major collected
issues, like the Zeppelin series, have yet to reach the peak values achieved
in the ill-fated investment boom of 1978-81. But after some years of slow
recovery, the Ishikawa auction proved that the rich and serious players,
some of them new to stamps, had their confidence back.
In contrast, the stamps of Latin America seem cheap, and it is doubtful
whether their price will fall any lower. Price levels depend on the demand
of local collectors, and although a few of the new rich of South America are
becoming interested in stamps, even the greatest rarities are still
affordable.
Of course, South America gave birth to the most famous stamp in the world,
the one cent, black-on-magenta, ship in middle, issued in Demarara in 1857.
Despite strenuous searches by dealers only one stamp of this value has yet
surfaced, and although it looks like a dirty scrap of paper, the American
investor who currently owns it would expect offers between Pounds 1m and
Pounds 2m.
A good collection of a small American nation, like Paraguay, with many rare
early issues, could be acquired for around Pounds 15,000, but there are some
Latin American stamps that have a wide appeal.
Brazil was the third country (after the UK and Switzerland) to issue
adhesive stamps, in 1843, and its initial Bull's Eye series carries the same
attraction as the Penny Black. At a starting price of Pounds 100 for a good
example, it is twice as expensive as the average Penny Black. The
'steamship' stamps issued by Buenos Aires in 1858, before Argentina came
into existence, are rare and sought after, as are the British Guiana 'cotton
reels', which go up to Pounds 50,000, even though they are often restored.
These early stamps are expensive because, in wild and under-developed South
America, few were issued. Like all rare stamps, they are much more valuable
if still attached to letters, and the presence of many British engineers,
businessmen, etc, in Latin America in the 19th century should ensure that
many desirable items of postal history are hidden away in collections in the
UK.
For some Latin American countries, there is just one rich collector who has
probably acquired the definitive postage. If he sells, there could be
wonderful rarities on offer at reasonable prices.
David Feldman, the Zurich dealer, who represents some of the major buyers in
the stamp world, is in the process of selling the celebrated 'Lima'
collection of Brazilian stamps. The second part comes up for auction in
November. But, as in every art field, no one should buy for investment only:
interest and knowledge are as essential as money for the successful
collector.
Antony Thorncroft's concluding article in this series, in the next issue of
the Quarterly Review, will discuss the stamps of eastern Europe.

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): A more
optimistic outlook - The professionals / The downturn has happened, and only
one of our fund managers remains bearish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mood of caution that prevailed among our four fund managers at the end
of 1993 proved to be justified. The Federal Reserve's two increases in US
interest rates prompted sharp falls in bond and equity prices in the first
quarter.
Now the downturn has occurred, however, they are, on balance, feeling more
positive. Paul Myners, of Gartmore, who doubled his cash holdings last time,
is reinvesting the cash in Japanese equities and US bonds. 'We are now more
positive on world markets and wish to be fully invested,' he says.
Even Howard Beaufort, of Newton Investment Management, who has generally
been the most cautious: feels more chirpy. 'The correction will hopefully
prove short and has certainly proved sharp.' He believes that 'fundamental
value is now back into both equities and bonds, particularly in the US and
the UK'.
Tim Howe, of Singer &amp; Friedlander, argues that 'the scenario of improving
growth and relatively loose monetary policy continues to suggest equities as
the most rewarding investment.'
Most bearish is Douglas McDougall, of Baillie Gifford. He thinks that the US
interest rate rise has 'worrying implications for most markets', and he is
accordingly cutting his equity exposure and increasing the cash element of
his portfolio to 15 per cent.
Tim Howe says: 'Although our overall exposure to equities has been little
changed over the quarter, there has been a shift in our strategy; at current
levels, value is apparent in the UK equity market. In continental Europe, we
no longer like France, where the government seems indecisive in its approach
to the fundamental restructuring of companies that is required. Italy looks
as if it has further to go, and the industrial exporters in Germany look
relatively attractive.
'Although the US market was slower to react to rising bond yields than other
world markets, the fall has probably been overdone, and we are increasing
our US exposure, partly because we believe the dollar should appreciate.
'Correctly, in January, we thought that a number of the Far Eastern markets
appeared oversold, and we suggested that we would be taking profits in Hong
Kong, Singapore and Malaysia and reinvesting in Japan. We have increased our
holding in Japan to 6 per cent of the portfolio. As we forecast, we have
been taking profits in Australia and now retain 3 per cent in Australia and
Mexico.'
Howard Beaufort has made only minor changes to his portfolio. He says: 'In
the face of the first quarter's declines, we have retained a defensive
portfolio stance, invested in sound earnings growth stocks round the world.
On any further panic falls, we would be buyers on both a short- and
longer-term view.
'In continental Europe, we continue to believe that interest rates may not
fall far and fast enough to produce the level of economic recovery implicit
in current share ratings. In the Far East, Tokyo remains highly volatile.
Although the immediate economic and profits outlook does not make equities
look particularly attractive, it appears that fiscal 1994 will be the
turning point for Japanese corporate profits.
'In south-east Asia, almost all markets have undergone a significant
correction since the beginning of the year. With the US investor so
important to these markets, further volatility may be anticipated, but we
retain the utmost faith that this area will produce highly attractive
returns. While the US bond market will continue to look ahead to the next
Fed tightening, with the speculative froth now blown firmly away, the
outlook for UK gilts and European bonds appears fundamentally sound.'
'Our asset allocation moves last time added value, as we were moving to a
more liquid position, anticipating a market correction,' says Paul Myners.
'We sold 2.5 per cent holdings in US small cap stocks, the Pacific rim and
Europe. The former two declined over the quarter and the latter was broadly
level.
'Contrary to our expectations, however, the UK was one of the worst
performing developed markets over the quarter. The results season went well,
but profit recovery was insufficient to offset the valuation implications of
bond yields, both real and nominal. Small companies did well, being more
sensitive to positive economic news, and we would strongly recommend that
private investors have an exposure in this area. On the big stocks, it is
probably too late to panic. From this point, we are likely to see a good
return from UK stocks.
'The US bond market should rally strongly, helping all world markets.
Although US equities should benefit, they look expensive relative to bonds.
We have changed our stance on Japan. although we are worried about the level
of the yen. We would hedge the currency risk on Japanese equities, back to
the US dollar if possible. Pacific markets are likely to follow the major
markets but be more volatile.'
Douglas McDougall recalls that 'three months ago, we raised cash from each
of our equity areas and from long gilts and decided to hold the cash in
dollar form.
'The US economic recovery is well advanced now, the cycle of liquidity has
moved into a less favourable stage and shares still look expensive by
historical standards. In the UK, profits should grow quite strongly this
year and next. Although the equity market is statistically expensive by
historical standards, it continues to look reasonable value in international
terms. The main threat to the equity market has come from gilts, where it is
difficult to find a fundamental justification for the severity of the recent
falls.
'In Europe, further cuts in short-term rates should be helpful, but equity
markets are already discounting a substantial recovery. In Japan, the recent
stock market bounce has been led by overseas buyers and has been compounded
by the yen's strength. The market is at low levels by the standard of the
late 1980s, but still looks expensive in terms of company earnings.
'Earlier this year, we made some moves to increase liquidity and to shorten
bond portfolios. The rise in gilt yields may have gone far enough, but for
this portfolio, each of the principal equity sectors is being reduced
slightly to raise cash to 15 per cent.'

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (16): Rising
interest rates in the US create a dilemma for Europe - Bonds / As the turn
in the American economic cycle accelerates, the logic for a 'decoupling' of
bonds is becoming stronger, say analysts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a painful first quarter, the question facing bond investors is whether
Europe's bond markets are going to be able to act independently from the US
market, where rising interest rates are pushing bond prices down and bond
yields up.
As the turn in the interest-rate cycle in the US accelerates, the logic for
a 'decoupling' of European and US bonds becomes stronger.
Malcolm Roberts, head of global bond research at UBS, is confident that it
will come. 'Decoupling between the US and European bond markets will emerge
in coming months: the US market faces monetary tightening, while continental
European bonds will respond favourably to gradual monetary easing. The US
yield curve will flatten, while European curves are likely to steepen.
Despite the likelihood of a stronger dollar, the best common-currency
returns still lie in higher-yielding European markets.'
The logic behind this is that, with most European economies still in
recession, governments will be forced to cut interest rates further, causing
bond prices to rise.
So far, European governments have been constrained in their easing of rates,
largely because, whatever the logic of economic fundamentals, today's
financial markets are strongly interlinked, and falls in US bond prices tend
to drag down European bonds.
Although many analysts believe that, based on economic fundamentals,
European bond prices are currently undervalued, this does not necessarily
make them a good buy. The markets have shown in the first quarter of the
year that they do not always perform according to economic fundamentals.
One thing is clear: the kind of gains which bond investors made last year
are unlikely to be on offer this year.
'It all depends on what kind of investor you are and what your time horizon
is,' cautions Marie Owens-Thomsen, an international strategist at Midland
Global Markets, who advises the bank's own traders. 'If you want to make a
relatively quick but safe buck, you should buy bonds. If you are less
risk-averse you should buy equities.'
Despite the fact the European bonds were able to shrug off declines in the
US market during the Easter break, Ms Owens-Thomsen remains nervous. 'I
still believe that Europe is highly dependent on the US, and the US is still
panicky,' she warns.
However, there are some grounds for optimism. One is that many bond fund
managers who got it wrong at the start of the year by holding long positions
in bonds have now managed to reverse those positions. This means that, while
they are likely to have incurred losses during the first quarter, they are
now better positioned for the more bearish environment.
In the first quarter, many conventional bond funds were slow to start
selling, believing that the price declines were not justified by economic
fundamentals. However, prices were pushed down by hedge-fund managers, who
tend to hold highly leveraged positions, and proprietary traders at banks,
who use their own institutions' capital to take positions on the market.
Bond fund managers have not only lightened their bond holdings in the course
of the first quarter, but have also sold longer-dated bonds in favour of
shorter-dated bonds, hoping that the short end of the yield curve is safer
and will benefit more from any cuts in interest rates.
However, Mr Rob Gambi, manager, international fixed interest and currencies,
at AMP Asset Management in London, believes there are some dangers in this
strategy. 'They are in danger of being whip-sawed,' he warns. That is,
having sold at a loss, they may be forced to buy back long-dated paper at a
higher level, if the market starts to rally.
'Initially favour short ends in Europe, but extend duration when markets
consolidate,' JP Morgan advises its clients, in its latest Global Markets
publication. Of course, just when the markets can be said to be
consolidating is proving a difficult call.
Mr Gambi believes that, at current levels, the market has priced in
over-pessimistic expectations. 'Last year the pendulum went too far the
other way. Now, because it's been such a rapid move downwards, the
perception is too negative,' he says.
For example, the UK money markets are now pricing in a one-point rise in
interest rates in the coming year, although many analysts still believe that
there is room for a further easing in UK rates.
Nevertheless, the UK's economic recovery is likely to continue to undermine
the gilts market, which is particularly vulnerable to scares from the US,
since the UK's economic cycle is ahead of the rest of Europe.
Although they seem particularly undervalued, their high degree of volatility
is likely to keep investors away from the high-yielding markets such as
Italy and Spain. Further, given the shift towards more conservative trading
strategies, it could be safest to stick to markets which can rally on the
back of domestic investment, rather than having to rely on a large inflow of
foreign funds.

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): 'I ignore the
doctor's prescription' - Equities / Building a portfolio / Having seen the
portfolio rise by 7 per cent in the past quarter, its compiler pauses to
consider the risky investment climate in which everyone has a hot tip
</HEADLINE>

'There is nothing I really feel like buying for the portfolio at present.
Stop-loss limits are in place to protect some of the portfolio's profits in
the face of any further downturns in the market. (End of article. Suggest
the rest of the space is filled with photos of attractive men and women in
Speedo swimwear - a company owned by Pentland.)'
Would such an article find favour? It is at times like these that I
sympathise with professional share tipsters, who have to find something new
to recommend to their readers every week, and with fund managers who are
required to find suitable investments for the many millions of pounds that
are sent to their offices every month.
Why am I finding it so difficult just to write about a portfolio that
appears only in a quarterly review? After all, almost everyone you know
currently has a hot tip - something they know will perform better than
leaving cash on deposit.
To me, this is one of the problems. I am reminded of Peter Lynch's 'Cocktail
Theory'. Lynch was the famous manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund, and in
his excellent book, One up on Wall Street, he explained the various stages
of market progress - from the first stage, when he attended cocktail parties
and people were not interested in talking about shares, to the fourth stage
when everyone would crowd around the fund manager and tell him what to buy.
'Even the dentist has three or four tips.'
When the fund manager reads in the newspaper that the tipped shares have all
gone up, and his neighbours are also telling him what to buy (and he wishes
he had taken their advice) then, according to Lynch, 'it's a sure sign that
the market has reached a top and is due for a tumble.'
In the last issue of the Review (January 28/29), I wrote: 'I feel the market
could be due for at least a minor shake-out in the not too distant future.'
Since then, I have experienced the cocktail theory in practice. A friend
phoned me to tell me excitedly about two companies whose shares he was going
to buy. The shares had been recommended to him by a doctor friend of his who
had heard about them from a friend. . .
Many people now seem to be so desperate to get a 'real return' on their
money that they would invest in almost anything. Twelve months ago, if a
share was tipped in a newspaper or magazine, it might well remain unmoved.
But more recently, a tip can move the share price considerably.
This has a number of dangers. The rise may be 'overdone' and the shares
reach an unsustainable level over the longer term. Shares that people rush
into, they might well also rush out of if sentiment switches towards some
other investment. It is also all too easy to create self-fulfilling
prophecies: if every share tipped automatically goes up (just because it was
tipped) then how do you really judge the underlying quality of a portfolio?
My portfolio is, I hope, founded on underlying value in the companies
concerned. After the portfolio's 'acquisition' of Alvis shares in January,
the shares were tipped in another publication, and the share price rose in
the interval between my writing the article and its publication.
They have, however, since risen still further, on the publication of Alvis's
annual report for the year ending September 30, 1993, which revealed cash
balances of Pounds 13.5m and stated that the group's investment in Avimo
Singapore stood, at that time, at approximately Pounds 45m. After
exceptional costs and interest receipts, the pre-tax profit of Alvis showed
an increase from 1992's Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 5.1m. However, I would set a
stop-loss limit (the price at which the shares would be sold) of 50-52p.
In the last Review I set a stop-loss level of 80-85p for Pentland. The
shares fell to 85p, and I considered selling them, especially as the company
has proved a disappointment to the portfolio so far. However, Pentland's
annual report, published in March, showed net cash at the December 31
year-end of Pounds 185m, despite spending on a number of acquisitions, and
paying a special dividend to shareholders of 12p per share in April 1993.
The company is 'optimistic about the prospects' for its operating profits in
1994. So, at present, I would rate it a hold, but set a revised stop-loss of
70-75p.
I remain reasonably hopeful for the longer-term future of the portfolio's
other holdings - Allied Colloids (speciality chemicals), EIS (engineering)
and William Ransom (extraction of plant materials for pharmaceutical and
other uses) - and would retain their stop-loss levels of 205-210p, 365-370p
and 45-47p respectively.
It is too early to judge the performance of the Pointon York BRI Director
Dealings Unit Trust, as the portfolio only 'invested' in it in January. The
trust closely monitors share transactions by directors in their own
companies, and uses this for its own investment decisions.
As for my other suggestions for the portfolio, none of them has fallen to my
ideal buying levels. In the January issue of the Review, I mentioned that I
hoped a general market downturn would make it possible to acquire shares in
Meggitt (an engineering company) for 80p, Renishaw (a manufacturer of
precision metrology and inspection equipment) for 220-230p and OIS
International Inspection (technical inspection services) for 60-65p.
Sadly for the portfolio, none of the shares has fallen to those levels.
Therefore the portfolio's ideal buying price for Meggitt will now be raised
to 85p.
The trouble with markets today is: who can tell what will next move a share
price? I remain concerned that actions on Wall Street will again affect
shares in the UK. But, even more, I am worried about how the UK political
situation will affect share prices.
There are various local council elections on May 5, and six parliamentary
by-elections pending. Elections for the European Parliament take place on
June 9. The Euro MP for the constituency in which I live is an extremely
able and energetic fellow, and I would have thought that his personal vote
was considerable. Yet even he has expressed concern at the possible outcome
of the elections.
This makes me even more unsure as to the short-term political future of the
UK. Stockmarkets do not like uncertainty, especially when the prime
minister's own future is continually being questioned.
So, having all these worries, and having again set stop-loss levels for the
shares in the portfolio, is there not even one more company that I might
name as a possible addition to the portfolio?
I am quite attracted to Taylor Nelson AGB, the market research company. But
the shares were suggested by my friend's doctor's friend. . . So my decision
as to whether or not to use all the cash in the portfolio to buy the shares
will depend on how far the market falls (if at all) in the next few weeks,
and whether or not continuing political uncertainties produce better buying
opportunities. Maybe more market research would be appropriate.
The author of this feature, which first appeared in the autumn 1991 issue of
the Review, is familiar to many readers as the writer of the Diary of a
Private Investor column in the Weekend FT. The Review invited him to suggest
a Pounds 10,000 portfolio for capital growth, without being too speculative.
The opinions expressed are his own. He states that his personal pension fund
has a small holding in Alvis, William Ransom, OIS International and
Pentland.

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): Pinchpenny
picks perks with profit - Equities / Shareholder discounts / Choosing shares
for shareholder discounts is deeply amateurish. Or is it? Gillian O'Connor

Peter Pinchpenny opened his eyes with steely determination. A hard day of
company perking lay ahead of him, but he was equal to the challenge.
Most investors buy shares because they expect their prices to rise. Not
Peter: he bought them to get as many shareholder discounts as he could. And
his life was dedicated to making the most of his share perks.
Chewing stoically through his normal breakfast of crisps (free at the
Benson's AGM), and Stilton from a Park Foods hamper (20 per cent off), Peter
allowed his mind to flicker briefly back to the previous night. London
International Group's AGM handout of samples ('Something for the weekend,
Sir?') was nearly exhausted.
Enough of such wimpish nostalgia. Another day, another discount. And it was
good weather for a journey. Should he Concorde to New York (10 per cent off
to BA shareholders, but only available once a year)? The weather was still a
bit choppy for a sea voyage to the Isle of Man (50 per cent discount IoM
Steam Packet Co), Scandinavia (25 per cent off from Scandinavian Seaways) or
even Calais (50 per cent from P&amp;O). Anyway, he had already decided that his
next foreign trip would be 'The Big One', underneath the Channel whenever
Eurotunnel finally pressed the button. As one of the original '87ers with
1,500 units, he could enjoy unlimited concessionary shuttle trips.
Surely in April he was allowed to indulge himself with a few home thoughts?
It was a little early for the Bluebell Railway (as a 'Benefactor' he got
free lifetime travel). So he appeared to be faced with a choice between the
Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch or Severn Valley railways (more free travel) or
Camelot Chauffeur Hire (10 per cent off, thanks to his Savoy Hotel
shareholding).
To be honest, he found steam travel rather grubby. Yes, of course he could
be sure of a 25 per cent cleaning bill discount at Brooks, Johnson Group or
Sketchley. But today he was not wearing his Gieves Group suit (10 per cent
discount). Friday was Moss Bros day (10 per cent off hire charges). So
Camelot Chauffeurs it was.
There was the normal embarrassing choice of hotels for the night.
Twenty-three different companies offerred shareholder discounts. (Surely
they weren't sufferring from lack of bums in beds during the recession?) He
felt like being cossetted. The Lodore Swiss on Derwentwater had gone off a
bit under Stakis, but Broadway's Lygon Arms (Savoy) was as phonily authentic
as ever.
What's more a slight detour on the way to the Cotswolds would allow him to
pop into the Middle Aston showroom of Fired Earth Tiles and pick some
hand-painted kitchen tiles (12 1/2 per cent off). But then he began to worry
whether they would meld in with the rest of his furnishings.
The kitchen units were Nixons (10 per cent off to Bellway shareholders) and
the furniture a mixture of Courts (10 per cent) and World of Leather (10 per
cent). Crappy decanters from Signet, the former Ratners, (10 per cent off)
mingled with the real thing from Aspreys (15 per cent off to investors with
over Pounds 16,000 worth of shares).
But his real treasure was the 18th century chaise longue from New Bond
Street antique dealers Mallett. Malletts did not operate anything as vulgar
as a shareholder discount, but 'discussed possible reductions' with
shareholders at the time of sale. Quite how these discussions differed from
those they held with customers who were not shareholders was not quite clear
to Peter. But he was much fonder of his Malletts chaise longue than of his
Ratners decanter. Even his new glasses (10 per cent off at Specialeyes)
could not make the decanter look anything other than crappy.
Somehow the day was drifting away. And he hadn't actually done any perking
yet. Lethargy assaulted him. Wouldn't it be comfortable just to put his feet
up (20 per cent off his Stylo shoes), and browse gently? He had discount
subscriptions to any number of EMAP and Reed magazines, and his shelves were
stuffed with 90 per cent bargains from Dillons (Pentos).
Could anything be done to assuage the sadness of the human condition? Even
at 25 per cent off, Regina Royal Jelly never seemed to do much for him. He
had a choice of 10 different crates of discount booze, but his unhappiness
was beyond the reach of mere alcohol.
Suddenly a longing for a fine and private place surged over him. The words
'Chosen Heritage' floated in front of his eyes. And for the first time that
day Peter Pinchpenny actually smiled. Thanks to Great Southern, he could not
only pre-pay his funeral, but also get a discount on it.
Choosing shares because they offer attractive shareholder discounts is
deeply amateurish. So it's rather irritating that Peter Pinchpenny's
portfolio has actually done well recently. When we checked out the 29 quoted
companies mentioned, we discovered that over the past year, their prices had
risen by an average 42 per cent compared with 13 per cent for the FT-SE-A
All share Index over the same period. Maybe we ought to launch a Pinchpenny
Pep.
The Perks Book, by Seymour Pierce Butterfield lists 150 companies offerring
shareholder discounts. It is available free from Seymour Pierce Butterfield,
24 Chiswell Street, London EClY 4TY

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (12): US analysts
expect Dow to fluctuate around 3,600 - Equities / Regional reports

<TEXT>
After a promising January, the rest of the first quarter was all downhill
for the US stock market, after the Federal Reserve twice raised interest
rates during the period.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the quarter at 3,635.97, down 118
points, or 3 per cent, since the New Year. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was at
445.76, having fallen 21 points during the quarter, while the Nasdaq
composite index was at 743.46, down 33 points.
Yet 1994 had started so well. Prices rose steadily throughout January, with
the Dow breaking through 3,800 and then 3,900 for the first time, before
confidently marching toward the 4,000 mark. The market was helped by another
strong results season from Corporate America, which, thanks to a resurgent
economy, productivity improvements and tough cost-containment policies,
posted impressive quarterly earnings.
At this stage, the Dow was outperforming the rest of the market as investors
favoured cyclical stocks, which traditionally do well during periods of
economic recovery.
Then, suddenly, the market's mood changed. The catalyst was the Fed's
decision on February 4 to raise short-term interest rates from 3 per cent to
3.25 per cent in a pre-emptive move against inflation. It was the first
tightening of monetary policy in five years, and it marked a turning point
in the investment cycle.
As soon as rates were raised, investors knew that conditions for investing
in equities would not be so favourable again for a long time. Fearing
further interest-rate increases, and worried that the strengthening economy
would push inflation higher, bond market investors pushed long-term interest
rates up sharply from their historic lows.
Within weeks, bond yields had climbed from below 6 per cent to 6.5 per cent.
The sharp rise in interest rates unnerved the stock market, which began to
follow bond prices lower. By mid-March indications that the economy was
growing even faster than expected sent bonds into a tailspin and the 30-year
yield over 7 per cent, and stocks began suffering heavy losses.
A second Fed tightening - another quarter of a point on short-term rates -
followed on March 22, and with investors also worried by the Whitewater
affair in Washington DC and political unrest in Mexico and Korea, the
quarter ended with Wall Street contemplating the possibility that a bear
market phase had begun.
Opinions, however, were divided as to whether the sharp declines at the end
of the quarter marked the end of the long bull market in stocks. Some
analysts pointed out that the economic and earnings fundamentals of the
market remained strong, and predicted that the Fed's two rate increases
would soon slow the pace of economic growth, allowing for long-term interest
rates to come down and for share prices to resume their upward path.
The majority of analysts, however, were adopting a more cautious stance on
the outlook for the second quarter. Most believed long-term interest rates
would stabilise between 7 per cent and 7.5 per cent, and predicted a choppy
three months for stocks, with the Dow in a fairly broad trading range either
side of 3,600.
In Mexico, the first quarter of trading on the stock market was dominated by
the negative impact on share prices of the peasant uprising in Chiapas, and
later, the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's
candidate in the August elections.
Although analysts were quick to point out that the assassination did not
alter the positive economic factors underpinning the market, they predicted
uncertainties in the political scene would make for an unsettled second
quarter. The Prices and Quotations index ended the quarter at 2,410.38, down
192 points, or 7.3 per cent.
In Canada, the stock market held up remarkably well, in spite of the sharp
losses on Wall Street and concern about rising domestic interest rates and
the weakening Canadian dollar. The Toronto Stock Exchange composite index
ended at 4,329.62, up just 8.19 points on the quarter.

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13): Pacific Rim
may regain some of its lost funds - Equities / Regional reports

It was a poor first quarter for most of the Pacific Rim, as the majority of
south-east Asian stock markets were casualties of the turmoil stemming from
financial uncertainty in the US.
Since many of the previous rises in the region had been prompted by
investment by US fund managers, the effect of the increase in US interest
rates has been severe. However, many analysts reckon that the sell-off has
been overdone, and they expect some of the funds to be re-allocated to the
Pacific Rim region during the coming quarter.
Short-term players are likely to choose those markets that suffered most.
Hong Kong, which fell 24 per cent in the last quarter; Singapore, down 12.2
per cent; and Malaysia, which retreated 25.3 per cent, are expected to
rebound on bargain-hunting by investors who regard these markets as
oversold.
Mr Andrew Hunt, chief economist at Thornton Management Asia, predicts that,
as markets in the US stabilise, so too will the Hong Kong market.
Deflationary pressures are likely to ease in the second quarter, as fears
over economic tightening in China recede. Although the US decision to make
China's 'most favoured nation' trade status dependent on human rights
improvements will cause some volatility, he expects the floor for the Hang
Seng index to be around 8,000 to 8,500.
In Malaysia, monetary flows have surged, and the stock market has been
supported by excess liquidity. While both Malaysia and Singapore are likely
to see tightening in the medium term, short-term players should benefit from
such liquidity flows in the immediate future.
On a medium- to long-term view, Thailand, which lost 26.3 per cent last
quarter; Indonesia, which fell 16.3 per cent; and Korea, up 0.1 per cent,
seem to be attractive.
Such countries have been beneficiaries of the recent rise in the yen, as
exports to Japan have become cheaper and competitiveness against Japanese
products in the international markets has increased. South Korea is
experiencing a slight fall in short-term interest rates, and is expected to
see solid growth while authorities check inflation.
Taiwan, which lost 13.5 per cent last quarter, remains counter-cyclical to
China. Once the Chinese economy starts to fall, Chinese dissidents will
retain their funds within Taiwan, hence increasing domestic investment.
The high level of net buying of the Tokyo market, which rose 9.7 per cent
during the first quarter, by overseas investors seems to signal a shift from
the south-east Asian markets into Japanese shares.
Purchases by overseas investors totalled about Y2,250bn during the first two
months of the year, soaking up selling by Japanese companies that were
liquidating stock holdings to supplement their flagging earnings. However,
such support has started to slow, and at a price-to-earnings ratio of 100
the Nikkei index may be looking expensive.
Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel, believes that, for the near term,
the stock market, relative to bond yields, has become unattractive, and that
domestic institutions are likely to allocate their cash to bonds rather than
shares.
Political uncertainty is also hampering buying by investors, and although a
corporate earnings recovery for the business year seems to be in place, the
Nikkei average is expected to fluctuate within a narrow range for the near
term.
Mr Hunt, at Thornton, expects further investor interest in India and Sri
Lanka to support the two markets. He expects easier monetary policy towards
the end of the year and a rise in demand from German and Japanese investors
supporting India; while the Sri Lankan market could rise by 100 per cent
over the next three months due the low value of the stocks.
Meanwhile, Baring Securities recommends that commodity-linked stock markets,
namely Australia in the Pacific Rim region, be bought in view of economic
recovery in the US and possibly in Japan and Europe.

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11): Euro-bears
unimpressed by signs of recovery - Equities / Regional reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE

<TEXT>
Investors in continental European equities lost money, on average, in the
first three months of 1994. But they didn't lose much.
The problem they face now is an extension of the uncertainty that was
present three months ago: will European economic recovery develop quickly
enough to offset the threatened withdrawal of US investment funds from the
continent?
Measured by the FT-A World indices, Europe excluding the UK fell by 2.85 per
cent in the first three months of 1994, after gaining 40 per cent in 1993.
However, investors would have done a lot worse elsewhere. Equities fell by
4.4 per cent in the US and 8.5 per cent in the UK; while the Pacific Basin,
excluding Japan, an area which had a halcyon year in 1993, experienced a
first quarter's drop of 18.4 per cent.
The European setback reflected another stage in the conflict between those
analysts who had been saying for some time that shares were fundamentally
overvalued, and the pragmatists who believed in the weight-of-money argument
 -that share prices were driven up by funds coming into Europe from the US.
The geographical diversification of US investment funds is seen as a
long-term trend, and may have a further beneficial impact on the world's
financial markets by the end of 1994; but in the short term it has been
braked by increases in US short-term interest rates.
Bearishness on Europe is widespread. Mr Bert Jansen, of Paribas Capital
Markets, says that the bull market in European bonds has come to an end,
removing the last three years' main prop under equities. 'Historic
evidence,' he maintains, 'shows that the odds for equities are not good in a
rising-yield environment, regardless of the economic background.'
On valuation, Mr Jansen is uncompromising. 'All European equities are
over-valued,' he says, 'both in absolute and relative terms.'
Writing earlier this month, Mr Anthony Thomas, of Kleinwort Benson, faced
the need to make an uneasy compromise. 'We remain very wary of the European
markets is the near term,' he said. 'Global markets generally are under
pressure, bond markets are weak and there is a lingering fear of large-scale
US repatriation.'
However, he added that the signs of economic recovery were increasing, in
such a way that investment funds did need to begin lowering their exposure
to defensive areas, and to move into cyclical stocks as opportunities arose.
KB raised its weightings in capital goods and basic industries, and lowered
them in financials, utilities, pharmaceuticals and retailers.
A similar trend was implicit in the performance of individual stocks in the
first three months of 1994. The list of top-performing European stocks was
peppered with front-line cyclicals, including three leading carmakers in
Fiat, BMW and Volvo.
In contrast, the bottom echelon featured insurance companies, banks, a
pharmaceutical company (Sweden's Astra) and a German utility (RWE).
In country terms, there have been surprises. The conversion of investors to
the Italian cause was on the cards; but Italy has surprised everyone with
the scale of its rise - 19.4 per cent in the world index series, building on
the country's macro-economic revival, excitement over privatisation and
hopes for corporate earnings recovery this year and next.
Unfortunately, a recent perennial hope, France, has disappointed with a fall
of 6.5 per cent on the quarter, in spite of a 4.2 per cent gain in January.
Mr Thomas, of Kleinwort, is recommending a switch out of France, where he
sees a flood of rights issues capping the market at a time of only limited
interest-rate cuts, and into Germany.
In Germany, investors took the bit between their teeth when they saw exports
rising, although the D-Mark was strong. Cyclicals are fashionable, Germany
has them - and in Germany they seem capable of recovery rather sooner than
expected.

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): Short-term
optimists are elusive - Equities / Global overview / A number of markets hit
all-time highs early in the year, but it has been generally downhill ever
since. However, amid the talk of corrections, bargains are available
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The suggestion offered here in the last issue of the Review, that investors
take some profits from the 1993 stock markets bonanza, proved useful,
especially as the first quarter of this year progressed.
A number of markets hit all-time highs in January and early February,
including Wall Street, London, Frankfurt and Paris, but it has been
generally downhill ever since.
Just as the quarter ended with the Easter break came the 'Garzarelli
factor'. Ms Elaine Garzarelli is more than a stock market analyst with
Lehman Brothers in New York; she has been held in considerable awe by both
market-watchers and participants ever since she accurately predicted
(virtually alone among her peers) the 1987 crash.
Ms Garzarelli warned at the end of March that the US market could fall by as
much as 15 per cent before the current 'correction' was completed  - a
forecast which sparked an immediate one-day fall of 72 points on the Dow
Jones index.
American investment sentiment, already shaken by monetary tightening by the
Federal Reserve, appeared less impressed with Ms Garzarelli's subsequent
clarification, that she wanted to distinguish between a current correction
and her belief that Wall Street would be sharply higher a year from now.
New York's jitters quickly spread to other markets - Italy, Japan and most
of the Nordic countries were exceptions during the quarter - and global
investors with a neutral stance, based on the FT Actuaries World Index, had
a negative total return of 1.8 per cent.
But that small worldwide loss cloaked some massive setbacks. Hong Kong,
Malaysia and Singapore, all star attractions last year, were sharply lower
over the quarter. The Pacific markets, excluding Japan, were down by almost
18 per cent as the 1993 flood of money into emerging markets went into
reverse. Tokyo itself returned a positive 16 per cent plus for both sterling
and dollar investors. Europe collectively was off by 4.4 per cent, weighed
down by a near 8 per cent fall in London.
As the second quarter opened, it was hard to find market optimists, at least
for the short term. Market sentiment is seldom based wholly on fundamentals,
but it can spread like wildfire, especially when it is negative. Sellers
encourage more sellers, and in global market trading there is often a
simultaneous rush for the exits.
Market liquidity (the 'weight of money' argument, which drove many bourses
to starry heights in 1992-93) is being reversed as American funds in
particular perceive that interest rates are on the way up again on worries
about higher inflation - more feared than obvious, for the time being.
There have certainly been signs of institutional selling of Pacific markets,
although some US and European funds have moved lately to overweight
positions in Japan itself. Most fund managers, however, are being very
cautious, setting both their equity and bond portfolios in neutral
positions, based on the FT-A Index, although with a somewhat higher overall
cash element. It won't make for outperformance, but it will provide an
answer of sorts for trustees when the April-June quarter comes to be
measured.
Yet, despite institutional and private-investor caution, and a whole lot of
talk about market corrections, there have got to be some bargains out there,
for such is the nature of stock markets. Neutral weightings in countries can
still allow scope for well-informed stock selection, and already some
investors are buying in anticipation of a return of consumer confidence in
the big economies.
In the last quarter, the consumer goods and services sector globally was off
4 per cent, the same as the energy sector. Capital goods did less badly at
minus 2.2 per cent. All three should benefit from economic growth. The US is
already looking very good in this respect, and better news is coming through
in Britain all the time. Germany is hoping for a sharp rise in exports this
year and next, and that just may explain why some big Swiss and French funds
are reportedly overweight in German equities and bonds. But then they invest
for the long haul.

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (10): Dividend rises
comfort London - Equities / Global overview
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first quarter of the year brought the first serious check to the bull
market in UK stocks, which had started in September 1992 when sterling left
the ERM,.
By the close of the quarter, the stock market was looking distinctly
unhappy, having paid dearly for a burst of enthusiasm in January and
struggled through an Easter weekend pregnant with threats of a repeat of the
crash of 1987. As the second quarter opened, UK equity strategists were
still sharply divided on the outlook for the London market.
UK equities were among the weakest global performers, the FT-SE 100 Share
Index returning minus 8.7 per cent for the three months.
In London, as in many other markets, the rot set in at the beginning of
February when the US Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy for the first
time in five years. That move changed perceptions on inflation, which had
been declared formally dead by the UK stock market at the beginning of the
year. It was therefore no surprise that the downswing in UK shares was
heralded, indeed led, by long-dated British government bonds, which peaked
just before the Fed moved.
Heavy daily losses in gilts soon undermined equities and were still doing so
at the end of the quarter. Even those strategists who insist that share
prices are now poised to respond to the increasing indications of recovery
in the domestic economy agree that a stronger bond market is a necessary
basis for an equity upturn.
The debate about inflation, and thus over interest rates has been
sub-divided into debates about whether interest rates can be cut
significantly in Europe if they are being raised in the US. Both the
Bundesbank and the US Federal Reserve have made clear their respective
policies; much of the doubt is over the timing. This is likely to continue
into the second quarter, with the market temperature rising every time the
Bundesbank meets or Mr Alan Greenspan spells out the Fed's views.
The division of views about interest rates will continue to hit London hard,
because, since the turn of the year, strategists and investors have focused
on the chances of a further cut in UK base rates this spring. At first,
these hopes reflected belief that further measures would be taken to
stimulate economic recovery. Now that inflation worries have resurfaced, the
argument is that, with higher taxes in place, the government, facing local
and European elections, will deliver the base rate cut whatever the
inflation risk.
Mr Nicholas Knight, the once bullish but now bearish strategist at Nomura
Research in London, believes that 'base rate will be cut for the wrong (ie
political) reasons, and that this will be the signal to sell UK equities.'
Mr Knight alarmed the market over Easter by predicting that the FT-SE Index
would fall to 2,800 and the Dow Industrial Average to 3,200 in the near
future. The market may have been alarmed, but there was a surprising number
of supporters for his forecast.
Not all market gurus take quite such a dramatic stance, however. Support is
coming from growth in corporate dividends, which, in aggregate, are now 10
per cent up on the year, and in earnings where gains have been more
selective. At Strauss Turnbull, the UK market arm of Societe Generale, Mr
Ian Harnett sees further upside in the second quarter, perhaps to around
FT-SE 3,600, although the second half of the year may be more difficult.

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (8): The unit trust
route
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors who wish to leave the running of their gilt portfolio to a
professional fund manager have several unit trusts from which to choose. But
be warned - these are the funds that many investment advisers love to hate.
The gilt fund manager should be able to move swiftly in and out of various
areas of the gilt market in order to maximise the return - for example,
switching into short-dated issues if it looks as though gilt prices in that
area of the yield curve will rally, benefiting from expectations of an
interest rate cut.
Gilt funds aim to outperform the gilt market through skilful management,
providing investors with regular income payments - although these are likely
to vary in size according to how well or badly the fund has performed.
However, investors should be aware of two crucial points. First, unlike a
direct investment in a gilt, you do not have your investment redeemed at
par. If the gilt market takes a severe knock, your investment may do so too,
and your units may fall in value. Whereas a gilt will be redeemed at par on
reaching maturity, the recovery of your unit trust investment will depend on
the ability of the fund manager.
Second, you will need to read the small print of your unit trust literature
carefully to find out what the manager's strategy is. Some managers may aim
for such a high income that they can only achieve it at the expense of the
capital. So look for a fund that aims for a reasonable income level combined
with security of capital.
Finally, be aware that you will have to pay management and administration
fees.

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (7): Rising yields
should act as a reminder that values can fall - A regular income 4 / Gilts /
This year's shake-up in financial markets has enabled private investors to
lock into a decent income. But what about their capital?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK government bonds, known as gilts, have been a popular source of income
for private investors in recent years, and a prominent feature in many a
small investor's portfolio.
But, given the decline in inflation and the fall in interest rates in the UK
during the 1990s, investors in search of income may need to think carefully
about whether to invest new money in gilts. For example, the yield on a
long-dated (15-year) gilt had fallen from 12.05 per cent in 1990 to a low of
6.389 per cent by the end of 1993.
However, since the start of this year, there has been a considerable
shake-up in the world's financial markets, sparked by the US Federal
Reserve's decision to raise US short-term interest rates in February and
again in March as a pre-emptive strike against inflationary pressures. The
result in the gilt market has been to push up yields again, with 15-year
yields rising from 6.39 per cent to a 1994 high of 7.948 per cent.
The recent shake-up means that private investors have been able to lock into
more attractive yields compared with a few weeks ago. But the rise in yields
(and corresponding fall in prices) should also serve as a warning that gilt
prices can go down as well as up. If you had invested money in gilts at the
start of the year, the value of the securities would have fallen back
dramatically.
Gilts come with an assortment of coupons, maturities and forms (whether
conventional or index-linked). When you buy a conventional gilt, you are
entitled to receive a fixed stream of income over a specified period of
time.
To take an example: say you buy Pounds 1,000 nominal amount of ten-year
stock, such as the Treasury 6 3/4 per cent 2004. This does not mean you are
paying Pounds 1,000 for the stock: the price you pay for the gilt may be
more or less than that. What it means is that, when the stock reaches
maturity in 2004, you will receive a capital repayment of Pounds 1,000. The
coupon is 6 3/4 per cent, which is the rate of interest applied to the
nominal value of the holding, to determine the size of the interest payment
or dividend. Dividends are usually paid every six months.
If you buy Pounds 1,000 nominal of this particular stock, you will receive
Pounds 67.50 in income a year. In fact, as an investor you would not
necessarily pay Pounds 1,000 for Pounds 1,000 nominal of stock. The price of
the stock will fluctuate - just as a share price fluctuates - in response to
investor demand, and that can be determined by a variety of factors, such as
the prospect of new gilt supply, or the outlook for inflation and for
interest rates.
The yield is the interest rate based on the actual buying price. The flat
yield is calculated by dividing the coupon by the price and multiplying by
100. The redemption yield, which is also usually quoted for gilts, gives a
picture of the total return, as it takes into account the capital gain (or
loss) from holding the stock to maturity and assumes that the investor
reinvests interest payments in the stock.
Assuming you have decided that this is the time to buy your gilts, in order
to obtain a steady income, there are two main ways of buying gilts - through
the National Savings Stock Register (NSSR) or through a bank or broker.
The NSSR method has the advantage of being cheap in terms of commission, and
convenient in that you receive your dividend income gross - although it is
important to remember that taxpayers are obliged to declare the income.
The NSSR offers the complete range of gilts. You fill in an application
form, available from most post offices, and send it off with your cheque.
The NSSR is the best way of buying small amounts of stock, because the
commissions are low - Pounds 1 for amounts up to Pounds 250. Above Pounds
250, there is an extra 50p for each multiple of Pounds 125 purchased.
The main disadvantage, however, is that you have no say in the price you pay
for the individual stock, because the NSSR may not be able to process your
application immediately, even though it aims to process applications the
morning they arrive. In volatile market conditions, such as the gilt market
has seen from time to time in the past couple of years, you could find that
a day's delay makes a significant difference to the price at which you buy
the stock.
Alternatively, if you buy or sell gilts through a bank or stockbroker, the
commissions charged vary, and tend to be higher than those charged by the
NSSR. Although the bank or broker route is more expensive, you do have more
flexibility when it comes to choosing when to buy or sell. Your broker
should also be able to advise you about particular issues, and tell you
whether the stock is ex-dividend or approaching the dividend payment date.
Income from gilts is taxable, but capital gains are tax-exempt. However,
capital losses on gilts cannot be used to offset other capital gains. If you
buy gilts through a broker, you are buying them from the Bank of England
register, and your income will be paid net.
While non-taxpayers can reclaim the tax, you can arrange to receive income
gross by transferring up to Pounds 5,000 nominal of any one stock in any
given calendar year from the Bank of England register to the NSSR.

An annuity is the regular income, usually for life, that is secured by
payment of a lump sum to an insurance company.
For retired people in their late sixties or older, annuity rates are very
competitive, compared with other guaranteed income products. But investors
must appreciate that once the annuity has been bought it cannot be changed;
and in most cases the purchase fund is forfeited on death.
Most people come across annuities in the context of 'money purchase'
pensions - that is, pension arrangements which invest contributions to
provide a fund at retirement, rather than base the pension on the employee's
final salary.
Under these arrangements, the bulk of the accumulated fund must be used to
buy a 'compulsory purchase annuity' (CPA) from a life office, which then
guarantees to pay a lifetime income.
There is, however, a second type of annuity, known as a 'purchased life
annuity' (PLA), which is bought voluntarily by individuals who need to
receive a regular income, either for a fixed period or for life.
Annuities can only be sold by life offices, due to their ability to cover a
large spread of risk. Purchased life annuities are complex products, and it
is essential to seek independent advice to obtain the best value for your
lump sum investment.
The amount of guaranteed regular income you receive in return for your
lump-sum investment is broadly determined by the prevailing gilt rates, and
can therefore fluctuate considerably. Age is also a major factor, since the
insurance companies use mortality tables to assess your life expectancy, and
offer lower rates where the annuity is likely to be paid over a longer
period, as can be seen by comparing the figures in Table 1, A and B.
Since, on average, women live about seven years longer than men, female
annuity rates are lower than rates for men of the same age.
The annuity most commonly sold provides a fixed or level income for life.
The popularity of this product is primarily due to the fact that it provides
the highest income at the outset compared with other options. Clearly,
however, once inflation takes its toll the value of the income plummets, as
can be seen in Table 2.
The trend towards early retirement - whether voluntary or enforced -
combined with increased longevity, exacerbates this problem.
In recent years the choice of annuities has increased. For example, you can
arrange to have annual increases, of 3 or 5 per cent, or increases linked to
the retail price index. Clearly, inflation-proofing makes sense, but it is
important to appreciate that this feature carries a cost in terms of a
forfeit of income in the early years to compensate for increasing income in
the latter years.
For example, an annuity that increases by 5 per cent each year provides an
initial income about 30 per cent lower than that provided by the level
annuity, as can be seen by comparing the figures in Table 1, B and C.
Of course, eventually the cumulative income from both annuities will break
even, and after this point the escalating annuity will provide much better
value - but only for those blessed with longevity. What is important is that
each individual should strike a balance between their need to safeguard
their income against inflation and their need for immediate spending power.
Other factors to consider are whether you should take out the annuity on a
joint life basis. This is the most popular option for couples, since the
annuity income does not stop on the death of one partner but continues to be
paid until the second partner dies.
One of the biggest problems with annuities is that to get the best rates you
must hand over your capital for good. Even if you die the following week,
there is no return. Those who would like to pass on some of their money to
their children should examine the rates offered on annuities with a capital
protection guarantee.
Under this arrangement, if you die and the gross amount you have received to
date is less than the original purchase price, the balance is paid into your
estate.
Annuity payments can be arranged on a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or
annual basis. Unlike compulsory purchase annuities, which are taxed in full,
with a purchased life annuity only part of the income is taxed.
Peter Quinton, managing director of the Annuity Bureau, explained: 'Each
annuity payment is divided into two parts, a capital element and an interest
element. Tax is deducted from the interest element at the time of payment,
but the capital element is tax-free.'
The tax charged is at the rate that applies to your total income, including
the interest element of the annuity which is added to your other earned and
unearned income. Quinton added: 'If you are a non-taxpayer, it is possible
for the whole of the annuity to be paid tax-free.' For higher-rate
taxpayers, the interest element should be declared on an annual tax return,
since basic-rate tax is the maximum amount deducted at source.
Those with a money-purchase pension, who have the choice between using the
whole fund at retirement to buy a compulsory purchase annuity or taking part
of the fund as a tax-free cash lump sum, should opt for the latter
arrangement if they are after maximum income. Quinton said: 'This can then
be invested in a purchased life annuity, to provide an income which in part
is tax-free. Under the compulsory purchase annuity, the whole of the income
is subject to tax.'

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (5): Higher interest
or immediate access? - A regular income 2: Deposits / Investors chosing a
bank or building society account are being obliged to compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four years ago, a typical building society account would pay more than 13
per cent interest on a balance of about Pounds 5,000 in an instant access
account.
Now, the equivalent rate would be just over 4 per cent; if you searched
carefully, you might be able to find a postal account paying in the region
of 6 per cent. Some building society accounts, particularly the instant
access ones, offer what seem like derisory amounts of interest - as little
as 0.25 per cent on Pounds 1,000 in some cases.
Declining interest rates may have been the salvation of the over-mortgaged
segment of the population, but they have not been so welcome to those
depending on savings for a living, who have seen their income cut by a half
or two thirds.
All over the country, pensioners and others are conducting a desperate
search for high-interest accounts. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as
a safe account with a respectable high street institution paying 10 per cent
at the moment.
If 10 per cent is what you are looking for, you must either enter the
higher-risk, higher-reward world of stocks and shares (where 10 per cent
returns are still difficult to come by), or come to terms with reality and
resign yourself to tightening your belt.
If you depend on savings for a noticeable proportion of your income, you
will probably have at least a five-figure sum to invest. Rates available
from building societies range from roughly 4 per cent to about 7.5 per cent
on that sort of amount. However, if you are looking for a regular income,
with interest paid monthly or quarterly, you will not get rates quite as
high as on accounts paying interest annually, or at the end of a fixed term.
The choice of account depends not only on which has the highest rate, but
also your priorities: are you prepared to sacrifice flexibility and ease of
access for marginally higher rates? Is your future financial position
unclear, so that you need to have instant access to your savings? Or are you
happy to lock your money away with the same institution for five years, as
long as you receive a reasonable rate of interest on it?
Naturally, there are stages in between those two extremes. Postal accounts
are becoming increasingly popular, with both savers and societies. They
offer access as instant as first-class post can make it, but reduce branch
administration costs, so usually offer better rates than accounts operated
over the counter or with a plastic card.
Then come one-month or 30-day notice accounts: if you give a months' notice
of any withdrawal, you do not suffer any penalty, but otherwise you lose 30
days' interest. Other accounts with notice periods of 60 days, 90 days etc
generally work in the same way. Check the conditions carefully before
signing up: some accounts do not allow any access before the notice period
is up, even in an emergency, while others offer a bonus if you make less
than a certain number of withdrawals each year.
Finally, fixed-term accounts require you to tie up your money for a period
of one to five years, usually with very limited ability to make withdrawals,
except of interest, or heavy penalties if you do.
Which institution is offering the best rates will tend to vary considerably
over time: high rates are often offered during a marketing campaign to
attract new savers, and are then scaled down over a few months.
Obviously, if you are locked into a 90-day notice account, you cannot make
frequent switches between accounts without losing a lot of money, but it is
worth checking a couple of times a year that your account has not fallen too
seriously behind the typical rates. One way to do this is to look in the
Weekend FT for the weekly table of the highest rates for your money,
provided by Moneyfacts.
Banks are not usually the first place to look for a regular income from
money on deposit; rates at the high street names tend to look unappealing by
comparison with most building societies. When a bank is for once offering
extraordinarily attractive rates, do not rush to deposit all your money
there immediately.
Higher returns are a sign of higher risk. This is an eternal principle, but
one which the public regularly ignores. The pitiful situation of savers left
stranded by a series of collapsed banks, from BCCI to the Wimbledon South
West Finance, which offered suspiciously high rates on supposedly secure
deposit accounts, is all too graphic evidence of this.
There are compensation schemes covering bank deposits, but the maximum
amount covered is Pounds 20,000 a person, and the maximum amount refunded is
75 per cent of that, ie Pounds 15,000. It can also be a long wait before the
compensation comes through, and of course you will not be earning any
interest on the money during that time.
Judging by recent history, small, struggling building societies are likely
to be rescued by a larger society before they collapse entirely, but the
possibility remains. Smaller building societies often offer attractive
rates, but cautious savers may want to consider the wisdom of putting too
much money in any single small society. The compensation for building
society deposits is slightly more generous, at 90 per cent of the first
Pounds 20,000 - so if you have more than that to invest, it is safer to
spread it around a little.
No matter what your opinion of the present government, it is less likely to
go bust than any bank or building society. This means that National Savings
products (see also page 20 of this Review) are the safest possible option
for savers.
At the moment, NS has two products offering a monthly income. One is
available to everybody: income bonds. These pay interest gross at a variable
rate (currently 6.5-6.75 per cent) on a minimum deposit of Pounds 2,000,
maximum Pounds 250,000. They have no fixed term, but impose a three-month
notice period; and if you cash in within the first year, you forfeit half
the income paid.
Over-65s also have access to the pensioners guaranteed income bond -
inevitably nicknamed the 'granny bond' - which currently pays 7 per cent
(fixed) on a minimum of Pounds 500, maximum of Pounds 20,000, with a
five-year term. Earlier withdrawals can be made with 60 days notice, and you
lose 60 days' interest on the sum withdrawn. This has proved popular, having
pulled in Pounds 906m by the end of March.
Building societies, seeing record outflows of funds, have responded with
lookalike products, in the form of five-year fixed-rate bonds, but rates and
conditions differ from the National Savings version. For example, there have
been some complaints that the National Savings 'granny bonds' are only
available to the over-65s. Building society equivalents do not necessarily
have the same age limits, and so could be a better bet for anyone retiring
early.

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4): One expert's
income suggestions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With so many different products available, we asked fee-based adviser, Julie
Lord of Cardiff-based Cavendish Financial Management, for her
recommendations:
'One of the problems with setting up a unit trust portfolio to provide
regular income is that the amount of income will not always be the same,'
she explained.
'Abbey Life Extra Income Pep provides monthly income at a level of base rate
plus 2 percentage points (subject to a maximum of 13 per cent). The
investment is currently about 55 per cent into EC blue-chip companies, with
up to 40 per cent in special financial securities such as put options, to
limit any downside. The intention is to provide a realistic level of income,
not capital growth.
* * *
'Scottish Equitable High Income Plus provides a regular quarterly income of
9.25 per cent net (to basic-rate taxpayers) guaranteed for five years.
Capital is invested in the FT-SE Tracker fund which will give back 100 per
cent of capital if it grows by 5.95 per cent per annum. In any event, at
least 40 per cent of the original capital will be returned, in addition to
the income received.
'Distribution bonds are an extremely simple, tax-paid (for basic-rate
taxpayers) regular income-producing investment. Two of the oldest, Sun Life
and M&amp;G High Yield fund, have an annual compound growth rate since launch in
1979 in excess of 15 per cent a year. Sun Life's distribution bond currently
has a 5.15 per cent yield, with distributions in May and November. M&amp;G has a
yield of 4.42 per cent, payable in March, July, September and December.
* * *
'Finally, and not for the cautious investor, there is the Govett Monthly
Income scheme currently paying 10 per cent gross per annum in monthly
instalments. The fund invests 60 per cent in UK equities (mainly utilities),
from which it expects a 5 per cent yield and a further 40 per cent in
foreign bonds, pushing up the current yield to more than 11 per cent.
Neither income or capital is guaranteed, and the capital value has fallen.
This is a good investment for part of an income portfolio, but it involves a
much higher risk.'

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): Pursue total
return and heed inflation - Gillian O'Connor introduces a sequence of
articles for those seeking a regular income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse in interest rates has made pensioners' Catch 22 even more
horrendous. The catch is that few people needing to rely on investment
income can afford to adopt the most sensible long-term investment strategy.
Inflation is the biggest threat to people living off a fixed income. Unless
your income grows in line with inflation, you will find yourself getting
steadily poorer in real terms. Even 3 per cent inflation cuts nearly 15 per
cent off the buying power of a fixed income in just five years. And if your
capital has suffered similarly, there is no hope of boosting your income in
future years. You are caught in a vicious circle.
The theoretical answer to the problem of inflation-proofing your investments
is equities. Over the long term, equities have held up remarkably well
against inflation - unlike ordinary deposits or gilt-edged stocks. This
means both that the capital value of shares has risen over time, but also
that the income paid out has risen. So in a surprisingly short time the
income from a portfolio of shares will overtake that from deposits or gilts.
The snag, of course, is that many investors need a high income at once,
because they need to live on it. Even after their recent setback, UK shares
are yielding only 3.6 gross, ie the net yield to a basic-rate taxpayer is
under 3 per cent and slightly over 2 per cent to a higher-rate taxpayer.
Even instant-access building society accounts have gross yields of over 6
per cent. It seems obvious that shares cannot compete.
But that takes no account of the capital side of the calculation. Over the
past year, the FT-SE-A All-Share index has risen by some 15 per cent. So the
total return before tax has been around 18 per cent, far better than you
could have got from even the most competitive deposit account, because the
capital value of the deposit account is static.
It is important to see the capital and income as part of a single pool. How
that pool should be divided between re-investment and income is a different
question. No prudent adviser would recommend regularly stripping all the
capital gains off an equity investment as income. Share prices can fall, and
returns have been unusually good in the last few years. But, provided you
can afford some short-term upsets, your primary objective should be securing
the best long-term total return possible. And, provided that you make sure
you are not endangering your capital, there is no reason why you cannot cash
in some of your gains to provide an income.
Indeed, the tax system nowadays positively encourages people to take some of
their income in the form of capital gains. You can make capital gains of a
certain amount each year (currently Pounds 5,800) before having to pay any
tax on them - a particularly useful concession for people paying tax at the
higher (40 per cent ) rate.
So both inflation and tax efficiency suggest that pensioners should have at
least some of their capital in equities. In practice, many investors are
primarily influenced by their immediate income needs and their suspicion of
equities. In the last couple of years, as interest rates have tumbled, UK
fund managers have been concocting products to appeal to investors who have
never ventured outside bank and building society deposits before.
A similar collapse in savings rates in the US had already sent American
savers stampeding into mutual funds (the US equivalent of unit trusts).
British savers have been slightly more hesitant, partly because stock market
investment is still more alien to ordinary people in this country.
What should you look at if you are searching for the best available income?
Capital security. Some of the schemes aimed at income-seekers provide an
unusually high income by dipping into, or at least risking, your original
capital. It is crucial to know what the capital risk is before entering into
this kind of investment.
Some people will be reluctant to take on any capital risk - in which case
they can reasonably shun equities. Others are prepared to face the
possibility of capital risk, but not the certainty. Some of the income
shares of split-level investment trusts, for example, will have virtually no
capital value at the end of the day. The basic rule of thumb is that
anything which offers an unusually high income probably has a snag.
Taxation. Some types of income are more suitable for certain people. For
example, many National Savings schemes, which provide investors with
tax-free income, are most beneficial to people who would otherwise pay high
rates of tax.

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): A well run
equity pool will retain its value - A regular income 1 / Collective funds /
Many new unit and investment trusts have been designed for income-seekers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those who enter the stock market through investment or unit trusts do not
lack for choice when it comes to income. Mindful of the needs of investors,
both types of fund have in recent years designed products specifically for
income-seekers.
Some pay monthly income but most do not, which means that you may need to
act as your own portfolio manager by structuring your investments to pick up
quarterly dividends in a more regular flow. Alternatively, some stockbrokers
will be able to provide this facility.
The attraction of equity-based investments is that, over the long term, your
capital will keep up with inflation; and, if you are in a well-managed fund,
the returns should outstrip those offered by deposits or gilts.
However, the recession has cut the level of dividends paid out by companies
to their shareholders, and the yield on the FT-SE-A All-Share now hovers at
a disappointingly low 3.6 per cent, although some companies, such as
utilities, are able to paying larger dividends.
Investment trusts
Income-seekers are catered for in the investment trust industry with the
formation of the split-level trust.
This divides its shares into at least two classes: income shares, which take
all the income of the trust; and capital shares, which reap all the capital
growth. However, the income shares are many and various, and it is essential
to take sound investment advice before succumbing to the lure of a high
yield on an income share. Some income shares are similar to annuities and
become virtually worthless when the trust's assets are wound up.
Paradoxically, Nigel Sidebottom, of the stockbroker, Gerard Vivian Gray,
says that he does not necessarily favour income shares or UK income growth
investment trusts when he manages a client's investment trust portfolio for
income.
'The trouble with UK income growth trusts is that, because they are popular
vehicles for income, they tend to trade on a premium which has the effect of
diluting the yield. I prefer to buy a conventional trust with an
above-average yield trading at a discount in order to get an enhanced
yield.'
For those who need regular income, Gerrard Vivian Gray has a monthly income
facility with a bank account into which dividends from the investment trusts
are paid. A fixed amount of 'income' is then paid by standing order into the
client's bank account each month. There is no charge if the income account
is 'overdrawn', while balances will attract a small amount of interest.
'Doing it this way means that I do not have to buy trusts simply because of
the date on which they pay dividends,' says Sidebottom.
The level of monthly income depends on market conditions. Sidebottom says
that he is happy to aim for a yield which is one and a half times that of
the All-Share index but that anything above this means a sacrifice, either
in terms of capital or increased risk.
Charges for the service are the company's standard portfolio management
initial charge of 3 per cent plus VAT and 1.25 per cent plus VAT annual
management fee, with a further Pounds 50 a year (plus VAT) for the monthly
income facility.
Unit trusts
Hypo F&amp;C has been extremely successful with its Higher Income Plan, a unit
trust in a personal equity plan (Pep) wrapper, paying 10 per cent a year on
a monthly basis. This will fall to 9 per cent from June. Morgan Grenfell
also has a High Income Trust paying 10 per cent a year, but the income is
paid quarterly.
James Capel's Generator Pep and Newton's Distributor fund allow the investor
to choose the annual level of income they withdraw up to a maximum of 9 per
cent (Newton) and 7.5 per cent (Capel). Both aim to replace the capital
withdrawn but cannot guarantee to do so. By investing through a Pep, the
investor does not face capital gains or income tax. The initial and annual
charges are 5.25 per cent and 1 per cent (Capel) and 6 per cent and 1.5 per
cent (Newton).
The advantage of these Peps is that, theoretically, the investor is in
control, so that, if the stock market falls, he can stop taking income in
order to minimise capital erosion. However, the danger is that this is not
made clear to him or that he becomes dependent on the income stream.
Murray Johnstone has recently launched a variant on the idea by marrying two
of its investment trusts (Murray International trust and Murray Income
trust) with a unit trust (Murray Equity Income fund) to pay monthly income
at a level decided by the investor of up to 9 per cent annually.
However, as the company's literature states, 'Rates of 'income' selected
that are higher than the underlying yield on the portfolio could lead to

FT  29 APR 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): There is no
magic carpet - Keynote / On the bumpy ride ahead, investors must make sure
they get value for money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Look on the bright side for a moment: yields have gone up. Of course, by and
large capital values have dropped this year, but as I said in this space
three months ago, not everybody should be miserable about a modest retreat.
The old lesson taught once again during the first quarter of 1994 was: never
to get caught up in a mood of euphoria.
Investment returns in 1993 had been wonderful, and at the start of 1994 it
seemed as though share prices could only continue to go up. So, for a month
more, they did. Smaller company shares did especially well, helping to push
the All-Share Index up another 5 per cent to a peak on February 2, although
the Footsie index composed exclusively of blue chips was not quite so
buoyant.
There were some tell-tale warning signs. Unit trust sales were setting new
records - especially in December and January - and extraordinary amounts of
money, some Pounds 1.1bn in all, were put up for two new European
privatisation investment trusts launched in January by Mercury Asset
Management and Kleinwort Benson.
Investors, it seemed, were desperate to get their cash into the market. It
was unhealthily reminiscent of the spectacular Royal Event of September
1987, when investors subscribed Pounds 240m to unit trusts launched by Royal
Life.
Those Royal investors blundered straight into Black Monday in October 1987,
and although the European privatisation fans did not face quite such a
disaster this time, they were badly damaged by stray bullets and shrapnel
from something slightly different - a bond market crash.
Dollar bonds had been modestly weak since last October, but European bonds -
including UK gilt-edged - had powered ahead until January. Then, on February
4, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, announced a
quarter-point rise in US short-term interest rates, which had been at a rock
bottom 3 per cent for 18 months. Mayhem then ensued in the fixed interest
markets around the world.
It turned out that vast amounts of that money borrowed at 3 per cent had
been financing huge speculation in international bonds by hedge funds,
securities firms and commercial banks. So a modest, prudent and not totally
unexpected move by the Fed, which in theory should have encouraged bond
investors because of the implied crackdown on future inflation, caused a
meltdown in fixed income securities.
Yields on long-dated gilts, for instance, jumped from 6.4 per cent at the
beginning of January to 8 per cent at one stage in March. The equity market
was sent spinning by this, because the 3.2 per cent average dividend yield
on shares was no longer adequate. However, share prices really only suffered
something of a glancing blow. The All-Share Index was down no more than
about 7 per cent during the January-March quarter as a whole.
At times the markets became quite scary, but a reversal was in fact long
overdue and a better structure has now been established for yields. At last
there is a decently steep yield curve between short-term deposit rates and
long gilt rates, so real investors - rather than speculators - have an
incentive to buy gilts. Meanwhile, UK company profits and dividends appear
to be moving up quite nicely, thanks to a favourable combination of rising
output and stable costs of labour and raw materials.
Yet there has been an important shift in the mood of the equity market.
Until recently the conditions for a bull market were clearly evident: a
recovering economy (and thus rising company profits) but still-declining
short-term interest rates, increasing the incentive for investors to shift
their cash into shares. Now it is no longer at all clear that the next move
in bank base rates will be down.
The quarter-point fall in base rates to 5 1/4 per cent on February 8, just a
few days after Alan Greenspan had moved in the opposite direction, turned
out to be a minor disaster. It was far from justified by some mediocre
inflation figures for January and the clash of opinion between chancellor
Kenneth Clarke and Bank governor Eddie George was confirmed by minutes of
their February meeting published on April 13.
Such a small cut was not enough to be passed on in lower mortgage rates to
house-buyers by the hard-pressed building societies, which have been losing
deposits heavily to the unit trusts and to the new National Savings granny
bond. In fact, fixed medium-term rates on mortgages have jumped sharply,
reflecting the recent rises in gilt-edged yields; and although the housing
market appears to be moderately strong, it does not appear as though it is
going to get any more help from cheaper money - perhaps the reverse.
In the short term, the stock market faces two domestic uncertainties: the
impact of the higher taxes that are hitting this month's pay packets, and
the political problems that might result from poor results for the
Conservatives in the forthcoming local and European elections, leading
perhaps to a full-scale leadership crisis.
If the growth of consumer spending slows down, it may be no bad thing. The
consumer-led recovery is taking us towards a balance of payments crisis, and
the emphasis must now switch towards capital investment and exports. But
that transition could be tricky.
Last year's global bond market bubble created something of an illusion, an
impression that securities prices could float on upwards effortlessly,
regardless of the lower and lower yields they were offering.
But after the bubble burst in February and March we came back to reality.
There is no magic-carpet ride for investors. The trip could be bumpy from
now on, and you should make sure that you get good value. Investors in the
European privatisation funds forgot that principle, and within two months or
so were showing losses of anything up to 20 per cent on their investment.
This was not quite the dead cert that Sid spotted with British Gas or the
water companies.
Insist on decent yields - of say 4 per cent on equities and 7 1/2 per cent
on gilts. If you cannot get them, remember that although the return on a
savings account may be low by past standards it is still a lot better better
than making a capital loss.
In the first quarter of the year, the average investor with a substantial
portfolio of securities will have shown a negative return of 4.6 per cent,
according to a model devised by Cantrade Investment Management. This made it
the worst quarter since the third quarter of 1990.
It is scarcely the end of the world, coming after all the handsome profits
of the past few years, but it is a warning that the climate has changed.

FT  29 APR 94 / Hurd to stress Tory 'middle way' of working within EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, will today stress the government's
commitment to the European Union when he reasserts his personal vision of
Britain's future in Europe.
Amid renewed questions from rightwing Euro-sceptics about the government's
ability to roll back the tide of federalism, Mr Hurd will re-state the
government's determination to shape the future of, rather than stand aside
from, the EU.
Aides said the foreign secretary would use a European election campaign tour
in the west country to contrast the 'middle way' offered by the
Conservatives in promoting a wider, decentralised Europe with the 'Brussels
federalism' of the Liberal Democrats.
But Mr Hurd will make clear that suggestions being floated on the Tory right
that Britain could prosper outside the mainstream of the EU are totally
unrealistic.
The speech will follow claims on the Tory right that an earlier plea by Mr
Hurd for the party to end its 'lunatic' argument over Europe has been
fatally undermined by a Euro-sceptic surge among constituency activists.
Some say the surge was provoked by the retreat of the prime minister, Mr
John Major, on the EU's qualified majority voting system. Others say
Conservative activists are becoming concerned about the growing powers
delegated to the European parliament by last year's Maastricht treaty.
Party leaders had hoped the divisions would be contained by Mr Major's
promise to build a free-market Europe of nation states. The promise, in an
Economist article last autumn, was the basis for an as yet unpublished
compromise manifesto for the European elections, which is intended to heal
the rift.
Uncertainty over the party's stance on Europe was underlined last night by
reports that Mr Major had ordered a redrafting of the manifesto. It is
understood that Downing Street officials believe the draft document is too
long, and needs to be 'less elegant and more street-fighting'.
Rightwingers, however, say the party is moving away from Europe so fast that
compromise will only be possible if the Tories achieve an unlikely triumph
in the elections. Heavy Tory losses would put pressure on Mr Major to adopt
an aggressively Euro-sceptic stance, they say.
'The morale of the party faithful will be at rock bottom, and our only hope
at the next election will be to offer a distinctive position on Europe,'
said a leading Euro-sceptic.
The growing confidence of the Euro-sceptics appeared to lie behind reports,
dismissed as 'nonsense' by Downing Street, that to appease the right Mr
Major was considering a referendum on continued British membership of the
EU.

FT  29 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains sharply reversed towards
the close - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The return to business in the US securities markets soon reversed the
optimistic mood in London yesterday afternoon, sending share prices down
sharply towards the close in the wake of weakness in British government
bonds. The stock market also reacted sharply to a profits warning from
British Gas which topped the active stocks list as its shares fell heavily
as worries gathered regarding the dividend outlook.
The FT-SE Index was more than 17 points ahead in early dealings, buoyed by a
firm start in bond prices in the UK and in other European markets. The
equity session opened with the widely expected bid for Lasmo from Enterprise
Oil, which offered Pounds 1.45bn, wholly in shares and warrants valued by
Enterprise at 150p for each Lasmo share.
Shares in Lasmo remained comfortably above the Enterprise terms, with the
market clearly looking for a rival offer, perhaps from British Gas. Later
its profits warning was regarded as not relevant to any plans it might have
for Lasmo, although some institutions sold Lasmo shares near the end of the
session. Selling appeared to reflect fund managers' preference for cash
rather than Enterprise paper.
The stock market came back from its best levels, with ICI giving some ground
in spite of generally satisfactory profits figures. ICI shares had performed
well ahead of the results, encouraged by good trading news from leading
chemical groups in Germany and the US, and profit-taking was enough to turn
the shares lower following the statement.
However, UK equities continued to trade confidently until US markets
re-opened in the face of statistics on gross domestic product and durable
goods orders which failed to please either equities or bonds in New York.
The apparent slowing of growth in the US first quarter depressed Wall
Street, while the rise in price deflator, hinting at inflation, hit Federal
bonds. In London, gilts turned down by a full point and the Footsie by more
than 20 points to show a final reading of 20.1 at 3,129.9.
Trading volume jumped smartly as marketmakers recognised that London was
still unable to resist the influence of both Wall Street and the bond
markets. The final Seaq total of 756.5m shares was more than one-fifth down
from Wednesday's figure, which in turn showed a lower retail, or customer,
value of Pounds 1.27bn; recent daily averages have been closer to Pounds
1.50bn.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, slower to respond to US influences than the blue
chip Footsie list, closed 3.5 up at 3,797.4. The London market has been slow
to respond to this week's flow of improved corporate results and increased
bid activity, and traders were disappointed to see the sharp reaction
yesterday to the bad news from British Gas. Confidence in the pace of
economic recovery has now replaced near term base rate hopes as the
significant factor behind UK stocks.
By the close, when the FT-SE 100 was virtually at the day's low and the
futures contract on the Index was showing a substantial discount to the
underlying equity stocks, the overall picture was decidely negative. Not
even the sharp rise in profits at General Motors seemed likely to brighten
the picture on Wall Street and nervousness regarding the timing of the next
tightening move from the US Federal Reserve unsettled investors in London.

FT  29 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disappointing US economic data put a stop to a gently rising futures market
yesterday, although turnover improved on this week's low levels, writes
Christopher Price.
The June contract on the FT-SE opened firmly, hitting 3,168 at the outset
and immediately finding enough buyers to nudge it forward during the morning
session. But there was little for the market to focus on in terms of
economic or financial statistics and the Bundesbank's decision not to move
rates typified the featureless early trading.
It all changed in the early afternoon with the release of disappointing GDP
and inflation figures from the US, and June immediately retraced its steps,
a move reinforced when Wall Street opened sharply lower.
June closed at 3,121, its low of the day, but with turnover a more
respectable 12,289 contracts - compared with 6,900 on Wednesday. Dealers
said Wall Street's attempt at a recovery in after hours trading had lifted
June to 3,125.
Turnover in traded options was also higher, with 42,721 contracts dealt
against 37,037 the previous session. Among the stock options, bid target
Lasmo once again figured strongly at 2,083 contracts, although food retailer
Sainsbury led the way at 2,303.

FT  29 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo sellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evidence that some of the big institutions had been selling Lasmo stock in
the market, following the first shot in what is expected to be a protracted
takeover battle, saw Lasmo ordinaries and nil-paids lose ground.
Neither the market, nor Lasmo was impressed with the terms of the all-paper
bid from Enterprise Oil, which the latter valued at 150p a share. Lasmo
ordinaries dipped to close 5 1/2 lower at 157p after more big turnover of
22m, while the nil-paids settled 4 1/2 to 53p with 15m changing hands.
Enterprise fell 21 at 424p.
However, dealers and analysts said the market still expected a counter
bidder for Lasmo to emerge, citing British Gas and Total as favourites. Elf,
which retains a 10 per cent stake in Enterprise, was ruled out, while
Atlantic Richfield, the US group is thought to have been unhappy with the
results of its acquisition of UK oil group Tricentrol in the late 1980's.
Dealers said the level of activity in Lasmo since the rights issue last week
suggested at least one and possibly more stake builders had been operating
in Lasmo shares.
First quarter figures from ICI were, at Pounds 93m, on the bright side of
expectations but a share price rise of 50p in one week proved unsustainable.
The shares ignored the spate of subsequent upgrades and responded more to a
weak US market by sliding 22 to 831p with 3.8m traded.
Smith New Court, which has been a supporter of the stock, maintained its
bullish stance with analyst Mr Charles Lambert commenting: 'Recovery is
obviously getting under way. The company gave a very good upbeat meeting.'
Elsewhere, Hoare Govett, which has been negative on the company for several
years shifted its recommendation from hold to undervalued and raised its
end-of-year forecast by Pounds 45m to Dollars 450m, around the top of the
existing range of analysts' estimates. Kleinwort Benson continued to be
merely holding the stock and pointed out that the 31 per cent improvement in
profits was from a very low base. Analyst Mr Jeremy Chantry lifted his
forecast by Pounds 35m to Pounds 430m but said earnings per share would
remain broadly unchanged.
Glaxo rose in response to an aggressive legal move and worrying news for its
Swedish rival, Astra. But the shares were taken back from their high of 580p
by a sell-off in the US to close 5 up at 569p.
Initially, the shares responded to a Swedish newspaper article about Astra's
Losec, the principal competition for Glaxo's top product, Zantac. The
article said the German health authorities had received reports from other
European countries on possible side effects from Losec.
Then, in the afternoon, Glaxo announced it was initiating legal action
against Geneva Pharmaceuticals, the US arm of Switzerland's Ciba Geigy,
which has claimed it can bypass Glaxo's patent on Zantac. The move had been
flagged but one analyst said: 'It does illustrate that the company is not
rilling over and playing dead.' The legal action includes Uquifa, the
Spanish arm of Holliday Chemicals whose shares have only just recovered from
a profits warning in November. The shares rose a penny at 223p.
Leading property stocks remained in positive territory, with James Capel
reiterating its positive stance on the sector. Analyst Mr Andrew Causer said
that encouraging prospects for rental recovery would underpin sentiment and
favour those stocks with prime retail properties and rental potential, such
as Land Securities, up 2 at 670p, and British Land ahead 4 at 409p. The
latter yesterday paid Pounds 70.5m for a City of London property.
Abbey National shares were heavily traded but failed to hold on to an
initial small rise that followed news that the company's pre-tax profits in
the first quarter are more than 20 per cent higher than the same period last
year. The shares closed 6 off at 442p after turnover of 6m, with dealers
reporting switching into Royal Bank of Scotland, 3 at 393p.
Gerrard &amp; National, the financial services group, was one of the market's
best individual performers, the shares racing up 39 to 448p after the good
results and news that it was buying the rest of GNI, its derivatives
subsidiary.
Holiday operator Airtours remained friendless as it announced the details of
its purchase of SAS Leisure. The shares slumped a further 24 yesterday,
closing at 424p, in heavy turnover approaching 900,000. Airtours has slid
60p on the week and 162p since its year-high on February 9. Analysts blamed
the stock's fall on the lack of synergies in the latest purchase - to be
largely funded by a Pounds 82m one-for-five rights issue at 390p - and
concerns over growth prospects.
Reed International rose 12p to 837p with dealers saying NatWest had
reiterated its long-term outperformance stance.
The day's two newcomers both enjoyed healthy market debuts; SuperscapeVR,
issued at 198p, closed at 261p while Oxford Molecular settled at 84p, a
premium of 4 to the 80p issue price.

FT  29 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Profits warning hits Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A profits warning from British Gas chairman Mr Richard Giordano at the
group's annual meeting, and a growing worry among fund managers that a
dividend cut could be on the horizon, saw Gas shares tumble in exceptionally
heavy trading. Mr Giordano said first quarter profits were the same as the
comparable period, but warned that profits for the rest of the year would
not match those of last year.
Trading at 300p before the meeting, the shares subsequently dropped to close
a net 15 off at 280p. Turnover of 26m was the highest single-day's business
since last August when the Monopolies and Mergers Commission released its
report on the gas industry.
Some analysts questioned whether Mr Giordano's comments were designed to win
sympathy from the government as it assembles the ground rules for
competition in the domestic gas sector.
However, Mr Steve Turner of Nomura, one of the more bearish analysts on Gas,
said: 'The dividend is not under threat; earnings will move ahead in 1995 as
a result of Gas's cost cutting efforts.
But Mr Chris Perry at Charterhouse Tilney maintained his deeply bearish view
of Gas; 'To achieve dividend cover of two times, Gas needs annual earnings
growth of 40 per cent; the shares are a sell down to at least 250p.'

FT  29 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico claws back some of early losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico
Equities recovered some of the ground lost earlier as investment funds made
end-of-month portfolio adjustments. The key IPC index of 36 top shares ended
down 11.55 points or 0.5 percent to 2,321.33 in active trade of 92.4m.
Analysts said the index may rise in coming sessions to its next technical
resistance point of 2,380, a point at which profit-taking could break out.
Advancing shares topped declining issues 40 to 39.
Textile company Cydsa A series led gainers, with an advance of 7.32 per
cent. Analysts noted Cydsa's report of a loss of 140.87m new pesos in the
first quarter came out too late to affect trading in the stock.
Other rising issues were food producer Herdez A series, up 5.18 per cent,
tile maker Porcelanite A shares, gaining 5.18 percent, and Palacio de Hierro
1 shares, up 5.01 per cent.
Mexicana and Aeromexico airlines were both pressured by losses in their
quarterly numbers and led declining issues with drops of 15.89 per cent and
9.09 per cent, respectively.
Venezuela
Equities on the Caracas stock exchange closed down amid continuing anxiety
following Tuesday's resignation Ms Ruth de Krivoy from the presidency of the
central bank.
The Merinvest index fell 1.28 per cent to 107.50 on 4.5m shares as 20 stocks
fell, six rose and four remained stable.
Ms de Krivoy resigned in a public clash with the government over its
strategy for bolstering an ailing banking system and economy in recession.
She indicated that the government's plans to reduce interest rates would
compromose her efforts to maintain currency stability and lower inflation.
Benchmark Electricidad de Caracas fell B7.10 to 330 on 1.1m shares whilst
textile company Sudamtex A rose B0.10 to 15.60 on 900,000. The Merinvest
index fell 4.3 per cent on Wednesday.
The government announced yesterday that it is planning to open up its oil
sector, including an offer of up to 10 per cent of oil company shares to
employees as well as a widening of the scope for local and foreign
investment.
Brazil
Sao Paulo ended up 4.2 per cent close to the day's highs in moderate trade
helped by signs that Congress might have reached a final short list of items
to be reformed in the constitution.
The Bovespa index of 56 most-traded shares rose 675 points to 16,727. In Rio
de Janeiro, the ISENN index ended at 63,640 points, up 4.8 perc ent on the
day.
Traded volume was CR304bn (Dollars 237m).

FT  29 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow follows bearish line in
bond trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue chip stocks fell back yesterday after wary interpretations of
first-quarter economic data triggered a sell-off in bonds, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 31.23 lower at 3,668.31, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 2.77 to 449.10 in brisk
activity.
Secondary markets were mixed, with the American SE composite up 0.72 at
438.92, and the Nasdaq composite down 2.52 to 731.69.
Equity investors were surprised and disappointed by the severity of the bond
market's reaction to the Commerce Department's preliminary report on first
quarter gross domestic product. The headline figure of 2.6 per cent growth
was about a half point lower than most economists had forecast. The data
raised the possibility of a rally in fixed-rate securities, which benefit
from slow growth and inflation.
But bonds defied expectations as traders focused on a slightly
higher-than-expected 2.9 per cent rise in the fixed-weight deflator, which
is taken as a measure of inflation. The market's losses steepened in the
afternoon when a Treasury supply auction proved disappointing. Late in the
session, the price of the benchmark 30-year government bond was down nearly
two points and the yield up 17 basis points to 7.26 per cent.
The blue chips closely tracked the Treasury market until mid-morning, when
the Dow touched bottom with a 30-point decline and began to retrace its
losses. But equity investors flinched a second time when bonds lurched
downward in the afternoon. Stocks which are closely linked to the economic
cycle registered moderate declines.
Caterpillar dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 108 7/8 , Deere shed Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 77 1/2 and International Business Machines lost Dollars 1 3/8
to Dollars 57 1/8 . Oil stocks were also weak, with Exxon shedding Dollars 1
to Dollars 61 7/8 and Chevron Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 88 5/8 . Investors
tended to play down favourable earnings reports released during the session.
Dow Chemical slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 62 1/4 after announcing an
impressive 38 per cent earnings gain, excluding special items.
General Motors posted operating income of Dollars 1.86 a share, against 42
cents last year, but the robust results failed to move the market. Its share
price ended unchanged at Dollars 56 3/4 .
Transport issues were a bright spot amid optimism that the Teamsters union
and trucking companies would soon reach an agreement to end a week-long
strike. Consolidated Freightways climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 26 1/4 and
Roadway Services jumped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 70.
Airline stocks were also buoyant, helping to lift the Dow transportation
index 11.82 to 1,635.63.
Delta gained Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 45 1/4 after unveiling a plan to cut
Dollars 2bn in annual operating costs by reducing its workforce by up to
15,000. UAL, parent of United Airlines, was marked up Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 128 7/8 after announcing that it had halved its loss in the first
quarter.
Canada
Toronto stocks broke a three-day winning streak, falling in moderate
activity dominated by the continued release of quarterly financial results.
The TSE-300 composite index lost 16.99 points, or 0.40 per cent, to
4,270.78, with declines leading advances 436 to 321.
Volume of 48.62m shares was above Wednesday's 42.29m and trading value rose
to CDollars 637m from CDollars 504m.
Golds recorded the day's biggest change, rising 1.87 per cent on index. In
that group, Placer Dome and TVX Gold both reported higher first-quarter
earnings. Placer's latest quarter including a gain on the sale of
investments. Placer rose 7/8 to 28 7/8 while TVX was up 1/8 to 7 7/8.
Northern Telecom named Donald Schuenke as chairman and said it expects its
gross profit margins to improve in 1995 and 1996. NorTel's shares fell 5/8
to 41 1/4.

FT  29 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Premium for Tele Danmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tele Danmark, the Danish telecommunications monopoly, went to a premium when
trading in the shares opened in Copenhagen and New York yesterday.
The domestic market took the shares to DKr332.50, a premium of 7.3 per cent
over the selling price of DKr310 (Dollars 23.53 per American depositary
share) fixed for the privatisation earlier in the day, when subscriptions
closed.
The offer was four times oversubscribed and raised a total of DKr19.5bn
(Dollars 2.96bn). It was made on the book-building system, involving bids
from potential shareholders, and the selling price was at the upper end of
the DKr275-315 range at which bids were made.
The issue, which reduces the state's holding in the company to 51 per cent,
has been watched with considerable interest as it is the first of a series
of privatisations expected to be made by European telephone companies.
The selling price puts a value on Tele Danmark which is closely in line with
telephone companies already listed on European and American stock exchanges.
The flotation was by far the biggest by a Danish company and one of the
largest international issues ever made, according to Goldman Sachs, which
acted, with Den Danske Bank, as international co-ordinator for the offer.
About 18 per cent of the shares were sold domestically and the rest to
non-residents, including 41 per cent of the issue in the USA. The retail
issue raised about Dollars 300m, said Tele Danmark, most of it through sales
to 28,000 Danish investors.
The latter had more reason to feel pleased than investors in a recent
Copenhagen Airport privatisation issue, where the shares traded at a
discount to the offer price. The 10,500 employees of Tele Danmark, who
bought 718,000 shares at a preferential price of DKr100, had even more of an
excuse to celebrate last night.

FT  29 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): US influenced, bourses lose
early gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US bond and equity markets, coming back from a day's closure, spoiled the
mood in Europe yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT flirted early in the day with its 1994 Dax closing high of 2,268,
inspired by a near 47 per cent jump in first quarter profits from BASF, but
it ran out of steam later, and went into decline under foreign and domestic
pressure.
The Dax closed officially 2.35 lower at 2,251.22 with BASF DM3.20 higher at
DM337.90, after DM343.80, and an eloquent contrast in carmakers where BMW
rose DM15 to DM895 but Volkswagen, under renewed pressure from the Lopez
case, ended 80 pfg lower at DM523.70. Turnover fell from DM10.9bn to
DM9.2bn.
There was worse to come for VW, down to DM515 in the post bourse, said Mr
Nigel Longley at Commerzbank, as weakness in the US bond market took German
bunds down with it. VW was outdone in terms of discomfort by Allianz, DM69
lower overall at DM2,602, and both Deutsche Bank and Siemens also saw post
bourse weakness.
AMSTERDAM retreated from earlier highs following the release of US economic
data. The AEX index, which had earlier seen a session high of 420.18, ended
the day off 1.51 at 415.81.
While there was weakness among some of the heavily weighted issues, such as
Royal Dutch, down Fl 1.60 at Fl 207.90, other stocks maintained a positive
stance.
Elsevier, for example, retained a 30 cent gain to Fl 167.70, helped by a
number of positive brokers' reports. Mr Ian Blackford of NatWest Securities
was among those who reiterated an outperform rating on the stock on
expectation of higher earnings this year.
ZURICH continued to track Wall Street and the SMI index fell 22.4 to
2,768.9.
Nestle fell SFr25 to SFr1,185 on foreign selling in delayed response to
figures released at Wednesday's press conference.
UBS fell SFr22 to SFr1,186. NatWest Securities added its voice to those
recommending a switch from UBS to Deutsche Bank. It noted that Deutsche had
underperformed UBS by 45 per cent since early 1990.
Ciba registered fell SFr16 to SFr855. Shortly before the close, Glaxo said
it had launched patent infringement proceedings in the US against a Ciba
subsidiary over its application to launch a generic form of the Zantac ulcer
drug. Analysts commented that Glaxo's action, which blocks the application
for 30 months, should have come as no surprise to investors.
Swissair fell SFr25 or 3.2 per cent to SFr760 in response to its 1993
results.
PARIS, too, reflected the US data. The CAC-40 index, which had been as high
as 2,172 at one point during the day, closed just 2.93 higher at 2,150.25.
Turnover was FFr3.9bn.
The 10 basis point cut by the Bank of France in the intervention rate,
reducing the level to 5.70 per cent, excited only a modicum of interest: the
news had been expected and had already been discounted.
MILAN stepped back from Wednesday's eight year high, awaiting the
appointment of Mr Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister. The Comit index, up
16.6 per cent since the general election at the end of March, fell 5.37 to
808.26.
Banks were lower, but some industrials remained in demand on expectations
for economic recovery. Pirelli was L77 higher at L3,246 and Fiat rose L47 to
L6,968.
Magneti Marelli, a Fiat components subsidiary, fell L88 or 5.9 per cent to
L1,410 on much heavier losses for 1993.
Sip fell L65 to L4,830 as the managing director said the company should hand
over control of its mobile telephone business to Stet later in the year, in
preparation for privatisation. Stet rose L52 to L6,207.
MADRID featured a fall of 1.80 to 323.58 in the general index, in turnover
of Pta39bn, but Santander and Banesto continued to celebrate with gains of
Pta210 to Pta6,020, and Pta77 to Pta1,075 respectively.
Brokers said that Santander was on a fully-diluted, ex-rights p/e for 1994
of about 9 1/2 compared with between 10 and 11 for most Spanish banks; with
Banesto, buying relied on price history before the Bank of Spain intervened,
and Santander's ability to strengthen, and turn the company round.
STOCKHOLM was lower in spite of stronger bonds and the Affaersvarlden Index
lost 6.3 to 1477.5. Astra fell SKr8 to SKr149 after a local press report
suggested that Germany's regulatory authority might expand its review of
possible side-effects from Losec, the anti-ulcer drug that is Astra's best
selling product. The company subsequently challenged the report.
WARSAW tested its 10 per cent limits on the downside for the second
successive session, the Wig index falling 1,201.4, or 9.8 per cent to
11,020.3.

FT  29 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei subdued as region
makes progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Nikkei closed virtually unchanged in pre-holiday trading, with most
investors cautious over the volatility in the currency markets, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei index slipped 3.90 to 19,725.25 after a high of 19,762.95 and a
low of 19,644.53. The yen rose Y0.30 to Y102.38 triggering profit-taking in
electronics, precision instruments and automobile stocks by overseas
investors.
Volume was 210m shares against 219m on Wednesday. The Topix index of all
first section stocks edged up 1.82 to 1,603.33 and the Nikkei 300 rose 0.40
to 293.10. Gainers led losers by 507 to 440, with 203 issues remaining
unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.10 to 1,302.56.
Traders said that the inauguration of Mr Tsutomu Hata's government yesterday
did little to help investor confidence: because the coalition does not have
a majority within the parliamentary lower house, some investors expect it to
be forced out within a couple of months after the budget bill is passed.
Some steel shares were higher on a rise in steel production figures and
reduction of inventories. Kawasaki Steel rose Y10 to Y371 and Nippon Steel
gained Y5 to Y347. Electric blast furnace steels were also higher with Tokyo
Tekko rising Y100 to Y1,200 and Tokyo Steel up Y130 to Y2,390.
Sumitomo Coal Mining, the most actively traded issue of the day, lost Y23 to
Y970 on profit-taking, while Pacific Metals declined Y4 to Y451.
Profit-taking also depressed some high-technology stocks. Sony fell Y130 to
Y5,760, TDK lost Y90 to Y4,580 and Hitachi declined Y6 to Y960.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone lost ground for the fourth consecutive day,
declining Y3,000 to Y882,000. East Japan Railway fell Y1,000 to Y482,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 61.16 to 22,018.49 in volume of 25.1m shares.
Roundup
The region's market were generally firmer yesterday.
AUSTRALIA was helped by an improvement in the futures market as the All
Ordinaries index advanced 9.4 to 2,069.1. Volume was 179m shares valued at
ADollars 471.4m.
Brokers noted strong support for BHP, News Corp and Western Mining. BHP
firmed 18 cents to ADollars 17.02 after falling 8 cents on Wednesday; News
Corp rose 14 cents to ADollars 9.43 with 3.35m shares traded; and Western
Mining jumped 17 cents to ADollars 6.95, with 3.75m shares traded.
SEOUL's composite index added 11.96 to 909.39. Strong foreign interest in
Kepco prompted domestic investors to follow suit and buying spread to Posco
and other primary blue chips.
Kepco and Posco - both heavily weighted in the index - went limit high,
gaining Won1,000 and Won2,000 to close at Won28,600 and Won64,200
respectively.
SINGAPORE was boosted by demand for blue chips and property issues, the
latter on expectations that the government would release land, currently
subject to long leases, for sale. The Straits Times Industrials index closed
13.93 higher at 2,304.64.
HONG KONG reversed a morning futures-induced dip to end the day modestly
higher, but trade was very quiet. The Hang Seng index closed 49.84 higher at
9,163.09, having dipped during the morning to 9,013.82. Turnover remained
light at HKDollars 3.02bn.
MANILA saw interest in San Miguel, up 2 pesos to 242 pesos and Manila
Electric, up 10 pesos at 530 pesos, as the composite index rose 13.48 to
2,854.46. Turnover eased to 864.3m pesos from Wednesday's 945.4m.
TAIWAN was mixed in volatile trading as profit-taking in industrials
intensified, but the the weighted index managed to end the day 4.88 ahead at
5,887.86.
KUALA LUMPUR lost some ground on afternoon profit-taking as Technology
Resources Industries continued to be sold down. The composite index,
however, still finished 1.99 ahead at 1,055.34.
TRI fell 80 cents to MDollars 11.30 in volume of 8.4m shares after its lower
than expected earnings forecast on Wednesday.
NEW ZEALAND was led down by a fall in Telecom, off 8 cents at NZDollars 5.08
and the NZSE-40 capital index lost 13.55 to 2,127.8 in low overall turnover
of NZDollars 23.5m.
BOMBAY continued to be weak although sentiment was helped after the stock
exchange authorities denied newspaper reports that brokers would halt
trading today in protest over a new tax on transactions.
The BSE index lost 14.08 to 3,739.
KARACHI rebounded from Wednesday's fall with a rise in the KSE index of
27.08 or 1.15 per cent to 2,388.88.

FT  29 APR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar looked very precarious on foreign exchanges yesterday, as the
market responded negatively to the release of mixed economic data, writes
Philip Gawith.
Advance first quarter US GDP figures produced the unfavourable combination
of lower than expected growth and higher than expected inflation.
The dollar finished in London at DM1.6697 against the D-Mark from DM1.6727
on Wednesday. It was also very weak against the yen, closing at Y101.885
from Y102.650.
The US currency was not helped by technical analysts calling a major
downward trend.
Elsewhere, the D-Mark lost ground in Europe on profit taking after the
German currency's recent bout of strength. The French and Dutch central
banks both trimmed 10 basis points off short term lending rates.
Sterling had a fairly stable day, staying above Dollars 1.50 against the
dollar - it closed at Dollars 1.5073 - but closing lower against the D-Mark
at DM2.5167 from DM2.52. The sterling index finished at 80.4 from 80.5 on
Wednesday.
There was a suspicion before the release of the US data that the market
would put a negative gloss on it, no matter what. In the event, it did not
require much effort.
On the one hand, the 2.6 per cent GDP growth figure compared with a market
forecast of 3.1 per cent. On the other, the Q1 GDP price deflator was 2.6
per cent, double the last figure and higher than the 2.3 per cent forecast.
Mr Brian Hilliard, senior international economist at SGST, commented: 'A
downward surprise on growth was not accompanied by a similar downward move
on inflation.'
Although the inflation figure might be seen as justifying higher interest
rates, the dollar was sold off, in tandem with weaker US debt and equity
markets. 'People are generally bearish about US financial instruments,' said
Mr Hilliard. Although he retains a medium term forecast of DM1.80 for the
dollar, he says 'the risk is all on the downside'.
Chartists are also predicting that the dollar will fall. Mr Brian Marber, an
independent technical analyst, said yesterday that it had breached key
technical resistance levels. 'The major trend is down and I am talking big
numbers,' said Mr Marber. He said this forecast would stand unless the
dollar rose again above DM1.72, which he is not predicting.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, said the latest data
would require the Fed to keep policy on hold for now. 'It will not be able
to raise rates further against the backdrop of a clear slowdown in the
economy.'
The yen rose further with analysts predicting that the market would try and
test whether, and at what level, the Fed would intervene to defend the
dollar.
The last time the Fed supported the dollar was at Y101.30 in August last
year.
Mr Steve Barrow, economist at Chemical Bank, said the market was cautious
about short dollar positions. The last two times the dollar has fallen to
this level - August and February - it has bounced back quite sharply. He
predicted that the Fed would come in and intervene before the dollar fell to
Y100.
Mr Lyons argues that the Dollars /yen rate is more likely to be determined
by what the US says and does than by Japan. Evidence of the Japanese
government's concern about the level of thge yen came from Mr Eijiro Hata,
newly appointed minister for international trade and industry. He said Japan
needed to tackle the yen with other countries.
As expected, the Bundesbank council left the Lombard and Discount rates
unchanged at 6.5 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. The D-Mark was
slightly weaker, with dealers reporting profit-taking, and European
currencies gaining against the D-Mark on the back of dollar sales.
On the day that businessman Mr Silvio Berlusconi was asked to form Italy's
new government, the Italian lira firmed to close at L958.3 against the
D-Mark from L961.5.
The French franc also closed higher, at FFr3.429 from FFr3.434, after the
Bank of France announced it was trimming the intervention rate by ten basis
points to 5.7 per cent. The guilder was barely changed after the Dutch
central bank cut its special advances rate to 5.3 per cent from 5.4 per
cent.
German call money rates eased to 5.60/5.70 per cent after rising towards 6
per cent on Wednesday. Traders said the liquidity shortage had not been as
severe as anticipated.
Trade in the euromark futures was fairly brisk, but there was little change
in the five shortest contracts. The June contract settled one basis point
lower at 94.79.
Volumes in the short sterling futures were more modest and the June contract
closed unchanged at 94.61.
In the money market, the Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds
365m after forecasting a Pounds 550m shortage. Earlier the bank had
purchased bills totalling Pounds 33m.

Report

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The July COFFEE futures price rose by Dollars 45 a tonne yesterday to
Dollars 1,521 a tonne in London as the market clawed back previous days'
losses and prices were pushed up by strong fund buying in New York, writes
Deborah Hargreaves.
The market shrugged off confirmation of Brazil's plans to sell 2.4m bags
from its government stockpile this year and the news that exporters could
take part in the auction if the price reached 85 cents per pound.
Traders said fundamentally tight supplies of coffee were continuing to fuel
the market's rise and attracting speculative buying. The producers'
retention scheme has helped create a rundown in stocks of coffee held by
consumers.
COPPER led a general rise at the London Metal Exchange as it mounted a
successful assault on resistance at Dollars 1,930 a tonne, for three months
delivery, reports Reuter.
Dealers said the rise, which took the three months delivery position to
Dollars 1,936, up Dollars 16, in after hours trading, was encouraged by
trade buying and covering against short positions, plus some option-related
covering.

FT  29 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Most funding in place for
Nigerian LNG project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS

<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The second stage of funding for the Nigerian liquefied natural gas company
is now in place.
The government and its foreign partners, Shell, Elf and Agip, recently
increased the total shareholders' capital in two escrow accounts to about
Dollars 1bn, most of the equity that it expects to need for the project,
which has an estimated total cost of between Dollars 4.5bn and Dollars 5bn.
About 40 per cent will be equity and the rest from loans.
Schroders merchant bank is helping the company to raise finance from export
credit agencies and other official lenders while the International Finance
Corporation will lead the commercial bank funding.
'A lot of people were sceptical about Nigeria raising the cash but it has
paid 60 per cent of the cash so far,' says Mr Theo Oerlemans, the new
managing director.
Subject to funding, the final investment decision is due early next year,
once the contract for construction has been awarded to one of two
consortiums led by Bechtel and Kellogg, both using the American APCI
process.
NLNG plans to start shipping 5.6m tonnes a year from two LNG trains by early
1999 to its four end-users, of which two thirds will go to Italy's Enel and
the rest to Enagas of Spain, Gaz de France and Distrigas in the US.
The company was re-launched last December when the state-owned Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation agreed to reduce its 60 per cent stake to 49
per cent and Shell in effect took control. When the shareholding has been
restructured in the coming months, Shell will own 24 per cent, Elf 15 per
cent, Agip 10 per cent and the International Finance Corporation is
committed to take 2 per cent.

FT  29 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brussels plans to blacklist CAP
fraudsters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies involved in defrauding the Common Agricultural Policy could be
permanently excluded from participating in any European Union regimes,
according to a proposal by the European Commission.
The Commission yesterday formally put its plans for drawing up a blacklist
of companies involved in fraudulent activities to member governments.
The idea of a blacklist follows a report from the European Court of Auditors
criticising the Commission and member countries for not doing enough to
stamp out fraud in the Ecu36bn farm budget. Some estimates put the amount of
farm funds lost through fraud at Ecu200m a year.
The Commission is now looking at a system for levying penalties at EU-level
from companies involved in fraud. Penalties are currently left to individual
member governments which are not consistent in applying them.
Mr Rene Steichen, the EU farm commissioner, wants to make the blacklist
available in all EU countries so that companies could find their trading
activities affected.
'Even the suspicion of fraud could be enough to get some companies put on
the blacklist,' said one Commission official.
The Commission is also trying to get around the problem of companies
involved in defrauding the CAP closing down and opening up under another
name.
The blacklist is expected to target companies or traders which have
deliberately or as a result of serious negligence defrauded farm funds or
can be justifiably suspected of having done so. But the Commission is aware
that the measure could be highly sensitive legally and politically.
In addition, the blacklist is not likely to be adopted much before the end
of the year as the Commission must wait for an opinion from the European
Parliament. Elections to the parliament will hold its comments up until
September at the earliest.

FT  29 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India tries to crack its cashew
nut problem - Development of processing capacity has far outstripped output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India, the world's biggest producer and exporter of cashew nuts, has earned
nearly Rs10bn (Pounds 210m) from the export of 60,000 tonnes during the year
to March 1994, up from Rs7.45bn in 1993-94, when the amount exported was
53,241 tonnes.
However, the country last year had to import nearly 10,000 tonnes of raw
cashews for processing and re-export.
Because of the lack of co-ordinated planning cashew processing capacity has
run well ahead of requirements. There are now 677 factories, mostly in the
southern parts of the country, which together could handle over 650,000
tonnes of nuts a year. But annual domestic production of raw nuts is only
about 350,000 tonnes.
As is the case with so many other crops, cashew productivity in India lags
behind the competition - at less than 650kg a hectare, compared with over
1,000kg in other major producing countries.
India has about 540,000 hectares under cashews, most of it in the coastal
areas, and according to the National Commission on Agriculture, it should be
able to produce 700,000 tonnes of raw nuts by the year 2000.
Experts do not, however, accept the commission's contention that it should
be possible to produce this amount from 350,000 hectares by raising
productivity to 2,000kg a hectare. They maintain that achieving the turn of
the century production target would require both productivity improvement
and the devotion of more land to the crop.
The most important initiative to be taken for improving productivity is the
encouragement of the cultivation of clonal materials from high yielding
varieties. The National Research Centre for Cashew has developed nearly 30
such varieties and in some areas of Maharashtra where their use has been
combined with efficient horticulture practices yields of up to 1,300kg a
hectare have been achieved.
The setting up of 40 regional nurseries in the first phase will go a long
way towards meeting the demand for high quality planting material.
Scientists say state authorities must ban the use of low-yielding,
low-quality seedlings.
Though cashew is a highly resilient crop that withstands drought,
supplementary irrigation during the flowering and fruiting period gives a
useful boost to productivity. Similarly, the use of fertilisers,
particularly nitrogen, leads to a higher cashew yield. Supplementary
irrigation and use of fertilisers need to be promoted through farm extension
programmes, according to the experts.
While many trees in the traditional growing areas need immediate
replacement, the crop is becoming increasingly popular in new centres like
Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. And more and more farmers are being drawn to
cashew nuts as inter-cropping with pineapple, groundnut and coconut has
proved successful.

FT  29 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's official market indicator ended the week at 568 cents a kg., 6
cents lower than a week ago. Prices eased at the first sales of the week on
April 26, but since then the market has tended to become firmer again, and
auction clearances improved. The other main auction this week was held in
Bradford with British wool on offer. This too saw the market firm and at
times slightly dearer, but there was no definite upward trend. Some coarser
carpet wools met with practically no interest at prices acceptable to the
marketing board, adding to the impression that earlier pressures from
oversold firms have lessened. The main selling season in Australia now has
only two months to run, and from July 1 Stockpile wool will be sold
according to fixed schedule.

FT  29 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rescuing land from the creeping
desert - Deborah Hargreaves on UN efforts to rehabilitate barren, eroded
land in Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the Yatenga region of Burkina Faso in Africa, farmers are rehabilitating
barren, uncultivated land by digging small pits and filling them with
manure. The dung attracts termites which digest it and start digging holes.
In this way the insects increase soil fertility and the land's capacity to
filter water.
Rehabilitated land in this region is now giving high yields of millet and
sorghum of over 1,000kg a hectare compared with much of Africa's
agricultural land, which is suffering from overgrazing, overcropping and bad
irrigation. The United Nations estimates that a quarter of the Earth's
agricultural land is at risk of becoming a desert.
This erosion of agricultural land in the world's dry zones is 'one of the
gravest problems our planet and its people face', according to the UN, which
is trying to broker a deal between countries over action on desertification
with a final treaty expected to be signed at a conference in Paris on June
6-18.
At the same time, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, a
Rome-based UN agency, is trying to demonstrate how land erosion can be
tackled with small-scale local projects aimed at turning barren areas back
into viable agricultural land.
In 1989 Ifad took producers from Niger to Burkina Faso to see the land
reclamation project. Those farmers decided to adapt the methods used in
Yatenga to their local conditions. By 1991 hundreds of Niger farmers had
joined the project.
Mr Bahman Mansuri, director of Ifad's Africa division, says the example
illustrates the importance of drawing on local skills and know-how to
reclaim degraded land. 'Indigenous technologies are very important because
they are low-cost, manageable by farmers and closely linked to local
conditions,' he explains.
Ifad has spent Dollars 700m on similar projects in sub-Saharan Africa since
1985 involving over 2m farmers. The organisation is holding a workshop in
Washington on Monday to try to increase public awareness of the problems
caused by desertification worldwide.
The UN Environmental Programme estimates that it will cost between Dollars
10bn and Dollars 22bn a year for 20 years to combat the problem of land
degradation. This compares with just Dollars 1bn currently being spent and
rich nations are reluctant to promise more.
'This is a real test of whether governments are serious about protecting the
fertility of this planet or not,' says Mr Nick Dunlop, London co-ordinator
of EarthAction, a network of 850 environmental groups in 111 countries.
'It's a question of how development resources are spent: some funds could be
re-directed from large infrastructure projects to help the poor conserve
their own land.'
Mr Mansuri stresses the importance of working with local farmers: 'One of
the greatest weaknesses of most large-scale soil and water development
projects financed with international support is that they come grinding to a
halt as soon as external project funding is withdrawn,' he says.
In Africa, Ifad is helping local farmers to conserve water and soil in a
number of ways, largely using low-tech ideas coming from the farmers
themselves.
Earth mounds are used in some areas where weeds are heaped into piles and
covered with soil between plants. These mounds help to slow run-off and also
become mini-compost heaps. In addition, stone bunds or rock walls about 1
foot high built along contour lines can help to reduce the amount of soil
washed away by the rain.
Half moons are shallow, semi-circular pits dug into barren areas near
deserts and filled with manure. These ditches catch water when it falls and
enable grasses to grow for feeding cattle. Ifad helped to install this
system in northern Niger, close to the Sahara desert and thick grass soon
covered what had been barren fields.
Another ingenious way of rejuvenating the land is to construct a network of
stone squares on naked rock which are filled with silt and soil from a
nearby river bed. Manure is added and vegetables can be grown.
These techniques can halt land degradation almost immediately, with crop
yields increasing by 30 per cent and because the results are so quick,
farmers are encouraged to continue.
Mr Mansuri is keen to spread these practices over a wide enough area in
Africa to prevent future famines, but for that he has to raise more money.
'At the Earth Summit countries were all worried about the ozone layer and
what happens if the ceiling falls on our heads,' he says, 'but I'm saying
the ground is crumbling beneath our feet.'

FT  29 APR 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries collapse as demand for auction
falters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US bond prices collapsed yesterday afternoon after a Treasury supply auction
drew poor demand in a market already shaken by preliminary data on the
economy's first-quarter performance.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 27/32 lower
at 87 21/32 , with the yield rising nearly 17 basis points to 7.267 per
cent. At the short end, the two-year note dropped  7/32 to 99 9/16 , to
yield 5.719 per cent.
The session started on a positive note. The initial reaction to the Commerce
Department's preliminary estimate of gross domestic product was rousing.
Prices jumped on the news that the economy grew by 2.6 per cent, well below
the level forecast by most economists.
However, the market quickly reversed course after delving deeper into the
report. Though the economy slowed markedly from the 7 per cent rate of
growth in the fourth quarter, traders were particularly concerned by a 2.9
per cent increase in the fixed-weight deflator measure of inflation, which
slightly exceeded a median forecast of 2.6 per cent.
In another worrying development, private-sector demand remained robust,
offsetting a sharp decline in government spending which was unlikely to be
repeated in the second quarter.
Traders seized on these undercurrents as an excuse to sell after a powerful
upturn over the past week. They virtually ignored a soft 0.4 per cent
increase in March durable goods orders. The data, which compared with
expectations of a 1 per cent gain, suggested tame conditions going into the
second quarter.
The morning selling was led by dealers hoping to push prices lower ahead of
an afternoon Treasury auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes. Their
strategy was to buy the newly-issued securities cheaply and sell them on to
retail customers at a profit.
In the event, the issue was badly-received, and follow-through buying failed
to develop. Prices, especially at the long end, went into a tail-spin before
steadying toward the close.
European government bonds took their cue from the US again yesterday
afternoon, imitating the Treasury bond sell-off. There were declines of a
quarter point in Germany and a point in the UK.
The European bond markets opened on a relatively-stable note, and the
decision by the Bank of France to shave another 10 basis points off its
intervention in the morning gave a welcome - if short-lived - lift to French
government bond prices. However, the sell-off in the US Treasury bond market
in the afternoon pulled French prices lower.
The French central bank lowered its intervention rate, from 5.8 per cent to
5.7 per cent at the securities repurchase tender yesterday, in line with
market expectations. The notional bond futures contract quoted on the Matif
exchange opened at 121.92 and reached a high of 121.98 before falling to a
low of 121.18 and then settling at 121.24.
The initial focus in the German government bond market was the Bundesbank's
council meeting, where members decided to leave the key discount and Lombard
rates unchanged, as expected.
The announcement of the west German inflation data provided a minor
disappointment. Bavaria was the last of the German states to report its
consumer prices data, announcing yesterday a rise of 0.3 per cent in the
month to mid-April for a year-on-year increase of 2.9 per cent. Meanwhile,
the west German figure rose 0.3 per cent to give a year-on-year rise of 3.2
per cent.
'Obviously, the market will be watching the Bundesbank's repo next week,'
said Mr Kit Juckes, economist at SG Warburg Securities. 'And while the 3.2
per cent inflation figure is disappointing, it should get down to 3 per cent
in the summer.'
The bund futures contract opened at 95.12 and reached a high of 95.47, then
dropped to a low of 94.55 in the wake of the US sell-off. The contract
settled at 94.67, down a quarter of a point on the previous close.
Elsewhere in Europe, the sell-off in Spanish government bonds was partly
triggered by domestic factors. At the Treasury's auction of three-, five-,
and 10-year paper yesterday, the accepted yields were significantly higher
than at the previous bond auction, reflecting the secondary market levels.
While the amounts sold were relatively small, there was disappointment that
the Treasury accepted such high yields.
The Spanish three-year note yield rose to 8.376 per cent at the auction,
from 7.296 per cent previously. The five-year note yield was set at 8.761
per cent from 7.388 per cent, and the 10-year bond yield rose to 9.242 per
cent from 7.811 per cent.
UK government bonds fell nearly a point, under the influence of the US
decline and new supply in the Eurosterling sector. Dealers noted switching
out of long-dated gilts into the new Cable &amp; Wireless Eurosterling issue, as
well as shortening trades.

FT  29 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: VSNL pricing puts bankers and
investors at odds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By Indian standards, the international equity offering from Videsh Sanchar
Nigam (VSNL), India's international telecommunications group, is a
juggernaut.
VSNL hopes to raise up to Dollars 1bn through the deal, which has been
road-showing in Asia, Europe and the US. However, investment bankers are
haggling with investors over the actual pricing of the deal, due on Tuesday.
In general, it is in investors' interests to talk down the company's value,
while lead managers, who may have won the mandate by suggesting a price at
the higher end of the range, tend to argue in favour of as high a price as
possible.
In the case of VSNL, joint global co-ordinators Salomon Brothers and
Kleinwort Benson have indicated a price of between Rs1,400 and R1,600 per
share, where each global depositary receipt represents one half of a share.
With the Indian stock market trading at relatively-stable levels after its
February peak, it seems likely the VSNL issue will be priced towards the
lower end of the indicated range, based on a 'discounted cashflow' model.
The stock is already traded on the Bombay exchange. However, there is only a
small free-float of shares, corresponding to about 6 per cent (the
government owns 85 per cent), and the price is easily manipulated.
Bankers say the quoted share price has escalated from Rs150 last summer to a
high of Rs1,700 in January, buoyed by the prospect of the international
offering. However, the price has moved down quite sharply recently, from
Rs1,700 in February to Rs1,250 at the end of March.
Mr Roger Bade, emerging market fund manager at Commercial Union, says: 'I
haven't got a problem with the pricing: it's the Indian market that is a
problem.' He says the recent clampdown on domestic speculative trading, and
the glut of international equity offerings, have made the market background
tricky.
'Even if the price is lower (than Rs1,400), I'm not sure it will go well or
jump to a premium because the background sentiment is so poor,' he says.
Like many other fund managers, Mr Bade says 'Rs1,400 to Rs1,600 is too high.
I would tend to look at p/e ratios, rather than the cashflow analysis, and
on that basis it looks expensive'.
'I would be looking at a price of Rs1,000 as fair value,' said one US
analyst. 'Taking the average of the research notes, I think it is aggressive
pricing even for a dramatic growth stock.'
Mr Jim McAlear, vice-president of the Columbia International Stock Fund, a
US-based mutual fund, said: 'VSNL is an important stock; it fills a role as
a proxy for the Indian market, but I have a problem putting a price on it.
The problem is the growth rate will be very strong in the medium term, but I
think it is overpriced based on short-term growth prospects.'
While many fund managers regard VSNL as an interesting company with strong
growth potential, and like its 10-year monopoly on international telephone
traffic, they see the pricing as too optimistic.

FT  29 APR 94 / International Bonds: Cable &amp; Wireless leads quiet day with
Pounds 200m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable &amp; Wireless provided the highlight of an otherwise featureless day in
the Eurobond market with its issue of Pounds 200m of 25-year bonds.
According to lead manager Samuel Montagu, the deal sold out within hours of
the launch, with the bulk of the issue placed with UK institutions seeking
long-dated debt. 'There's been nothing else at the long end (of the
Eurosterling market),' said a syndicate official.
The gilt market, too, has been starved of long-dated supply, with the Bank
of England concentrating issuance at the shorter end of the yield curve.
The lack of a credit rating for C&amp;W was no deterrent. 'UK institutionals
don't really mind - they like UK blue-chips,' said a dealer at another bank.
The 8 5/8 per cent bonds were priced to yield 90 basis points over the 8 3/4
per cent gilt due 2017. The spread narrowed slightly to close around 88
basis points over gilts.
The Republic of Ireland tapped the Dutch guilder market for Fl 250m of 6 7/8
per cent 10-year bonds. Yielding 30 basis points over the corresponding
government bond at re-offer, the pricing was widely considered to be
aggressive.
'Triple-A rated Credit Local issued 10-year bonds at 30 over (government
bonds) last week - Ireland with its lower rating should have yielded at
least 35 over,' said one trader.
However, lead manager Rabobank argued that, although Ireland has a lower
rating (Aa3 from Moody's and AA- from Standard &amp; Poor's), its sovereign
status and strong fundamental outlook justified the pricing. Traders said
the spread widened to around 34 basis points over the government bond, but
Rabobank said it remained stable at 30 basis points over.
In the French franc sector, Volvo Group Finance issued FFr1bn of 6 3/4 per
cent five-year bonds. While traders felt the pricing was reasonable, they
reported little demand for unrated Volvo paper.
However, lead manager Credit Lyonnais said French investors have shown a
healthy appetite for corporate bonds in the five-year sector offering a
substantial yield pick-up over government bonds. The bonds were priced to
yield 67 basis points over the corresponding French government bond.
Elsewhere, ABN Amro Australia and Cadbury Schweppes Australia each issued
ADollars 75m of five-year bonds targeted mainly at retail investors.
Eastern Electricity, the UK regional electricity company, bought back its
Pounds 118m of government debt, redeeming two Pounds 59m tranches of
government bonds maturing in 1999 and 2008. The purchase, financed in part
by Eastern's Pounds 350m bond issue on Tuesday, will involve a redemption
premium of Pounds 27m and will result in subsequent interest savings, the
company said.

<TEXT>
Gold mines in the stable of Johannesburg Consolidated Industries, the South
African mining conglomerate due to be sold off to black investors later this
year, reported a decline in after-tax profit to R52.3m (Dollars 14.6m) in
the March quarter from R72.6m in the preceding three months. The year-ago
figure was R58.8m.
As expected, the drop from the December quarter's good results was largely
due to a failure of a steel drum shaft at the Western Areas mine in January.
However, this loss of production was partly offset by record gold production
at Randfontein Estates and a 2.7 per cent rise in the average gold price
received.
Total revenue from the mines fell to R513.9m, a drop of 1.6 per cent from
the previous quarter's results of R522.4m. Overall ore milled dipped to
2.65m tonnes, from 2.77m tonnes, and overall gold production was down 5.6
per cent to 12,625kg from 13,373kg.
At Western Areas, production declined 20.8 per cent to 3,405kg from 4,300kg
as a result of the accident as the group turned in what management described
as a 'creditable' performance under the circumstances. Nevertheless, a
decision to count the cost of the repairs in the next quarter meant that the
mine still recorded an after-tax profit of R14.3m, down from R40.9m.
In an excellent quarter, Randfontein saw production boosted to a record
8,392kg from 8,187kg, largely on the strength of a higher yield. Successful
cost containment led to bonuses of R5.6m for employees.
The group's HJ Joel operation, which recently announced a R284m rights issue
to help fund capital expenditure, recorded an operating loss of R0.8m
following an operating profit of R0.7m in the December quarter.

<TEXT>
Poseidon Gold, part of the Normandy Poseidon group, yesterday announced
operating profits of ADollars 52.2m (USDollars 36.7m), after tax, for the
nine months to end-March. This compares with ADollars 51.6m in the same
period of the previous year.
The company, which recently won a contested bid battle for Aztec Mining,
said equity production for the nine-month period was 548,342 ounces, a 1.6
per cent increase over the corresponding period of 1992-93. The average gold
price received by the PosGold companies was ADollars 586 per ounce, compared
with an average spot price of ADollars 555.
Great Central Mines, the Australian mining group whose shares soared last
year when it became known that a New York rabbi had prophesied it would
enjoy significant finds, is to spin off its diamond exploration interests
into a separate company and concentrate on gold mining.
The diamond interests will be transferred to Astro Mining, at an
'anticipated' value of ADollars 7m. Astro will issue 70.2m shares to GCM,
which will pass them on to its current shareholders, on a pro-rata basis.
GCM is run by Mr Joseph Gutnick, a member of the ultra-orthodox Lubavicher
sect whose leader is Brooklyn-based Rebbe Schneerson.
GCM's market capitalisation rose to more than ADollars 1bn last year on the
back of the discovery of 'microdiamonds' in the Greater Nabberu region of
Western Australia and talk of the rabbi's prophesy.
The diamond interests have yet to prove economic, but GCM has subsequently
discovered a more promising gold deposit at Bronzewing in Western Australia.

FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Samsung buys Nissan technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Samsung Heavy Industries has signed a contract to import car technology from
Nissan Motor of Japan as part of its plan to become South Korea's fifth
passenger car manufacturer.
The subsidiary of South Korea's largest conglomerate said it would build
three mid-sized models based on Nissan technology beginning in 1997 and sell
them only under its own badge. Production in the first year will be 50,000
cars, with a subsequent increase.
Nissan will receive a total of Y8.66bn (Dollars 84.4m) in royalty and
technology fees from Samsung, plus between 1.6 per cent and 1.9 per cent of
the shipment price for every Samsung car.
Nissan said it saw the alliance with Samsung 'as a way of further expanding
its business foundations in Asia.' It said that it would develop a new car
based on one of its vehicles for Samsung. A two-litre saloon car was under
consideration.
It said Samsung planned to build a plant either near Pusan or on the west
coast of South Korea to make the car developed by Nissan.
Mr Minoru Nakamura, a Nissan board member, said that Samsung's investment in
the plant could total Y450bn.
The Korean government has expressed concerns that Samsung's entry into the
crowded car industry could cause severe problems for the country's other
motor companies.
Samsung plans soon to file an application for the import of vehicle
technology with the ministry of trade, industry and energy. If the ministry
turns down the request, it would in effect block Samsung's ambitions.
The Korea Automobile Manufacturers' Association criticised Samsung for
importing technology, which contradicts the government's goal for Korea to
achieve technical independence in the motor industry.
Under the contract, Nissan will transfer the technology for its latest range
of compacts, including newly-developed engines and suspension systems, and
jointly develop new versions for Samsung. It will also provide engineering
assistance for Samsung's production of the vehicles, which would use at
least 70 per cent Korean-made components.
Samsung will have unrestricted access to export markets under the agreement
with Nissan, which also granted the right for Samsung to change components
and designs as desired. Samsung will also receive advice from Nissan on
sales, marketing and after-sales service.
Other Korean car companies, including Kia and Daewoo, have previously been
forced to accept export restrictions in return for gaining technology from
Ford and General Motors, respectively.

FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Moody's assigns ratings to
reflect derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moody's, the US ratings agency, plans to start assigning specific ratings to
institutions, based on their creditworthiness as counterparties in the
derivatives market.
The expanded coverage is designed 'to meet a clear market need for credit
assessments that apply specifically to the financial capacity of individual
obligors to meet their financial contracts,' said Moody's associate
director, Mr John Kriz.
He warned that bond and deposit ratings may not accurately reflect an
obligor's creditworthiness from a derivatives claim perspective.
As a first step, Moody's has assigned 'counterparty' ratings to 276 US banks
and thrifts which are participants in the derivatives markets. Twenty-five
of these ratings are lower than for the institutions' domestic deposit
ratings, typically by one notch.
The differences 'reflect analytical concerns such as the relative standing
and potential loss content of financial contract claims, such as
derivatives, vis-a-vis domestic deposits,' the agency said.
Until now, Moody's has rated only derivative products companies such as
Salomon Brothers' Swapco. Other ratings apply to the debt, rather than the
institution.

Kemper bid
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gary Wendt, president of GE Capital, yesterday suggested his company
might increase its Dollars 2.2bn bid for Kemper Corporation and accused
Kemper's chief executive of 'stonewalling' on the merger negotiations.
In a letter to Mr David Mathis, Kemper chairman, Mr Wendt said: 'We have the
money available to pay any price we agree to. Your shareholders will be
rewarded if you will stop stonewalling and begin negotiations.'
However, responding to the letter, Mr Mathis said Kemper's major
shareholders supported the board's decision to reject GE Capital's offer.
'Your ongoing Dollars 55 per share proposal, found by our board and its
financial adviser to be inadequate, has been and continues to be rejected,'
Mr Mathis said.
GE Capital's suggestion that it might pay more for the diversified
securities and insurance company came as Kemper reported an improvement in
first-quarter earnings.
Operating earnings rose to Dollars 35.4m, or 87 cents a share in the
quarter, from Dollars 10.4m, or 17 cents, in the same quarter of 1993.
First-quarter 1993 results include an extraordinary charge of Dollars 11.9m
or 24 cents. Kemper's first-quarter revenues rose to Dollars 464.5m, from
Dollars 419.2 in the same quarter last year.
Kemper's troubled real estate division made significant progress in the
quarter, showing a net loss of Dollars 2.3m, or 6 cents a share, compared
with a 1993 first-quarter loss of Dollars 30.9m, or 63 cents a share.
The company's life insurance division saw operating earnings rise to Dollars
28.8m, from last year's Dollars 17.9m. However, results from Kemper's asset
management and securities operations were flat, and assets under management
fell during the quarter to Dollars 67.4bn, from Dollars 69.3bn at the end of
last year's first quarter.

Imasco
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Higher tobacco and financial services profits propelled Imasco, the
diversified Canadian group controlled by the UK's BAT Industries, to a 12
per cent rise in first-quarter earnings.
Net earnings climbed to CDollars 75m (USDollars 54m), or 60 cents a share,
from CDollars 66m, or 50 cents, a year earlier. Revenues fell by 2 per cent
to CDollars 1.86bn, largely due to the impact of lower interest rates on CT
Financial, holding company for Canada Trust, which is Canada's biggest trust
company.
Although Imasco described prospects for the rest of the year as 'very good',
earnings growth will be dampened by a temporary surtax on tobacco
manufacturers, introduced earlier this year as part of a package to clamp
down on cross-border cigarette smuggling.
The tax, which was imposed in February, reduced Imasco's first-quarter
earnings by CDollars 7m. The company said, however, that the anti-smuggling
measures are generally favourable to its tobacco subsidiary, Imperial
Tobacco.
Imperial posted a 15 per cent rise in operating earnings to CDollars 114m
and CT Financial boosted earnings by 24 per cent to CDollars 73m. But UCS, a
news stand chain, reported a slightly higher loss of CDollars 3m.

FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Buying into an industry's
heritage - Agco has grown by acquiring famous names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Agco, the farm equipment manufacturer and distributor based near Atlanta, is
an upstart in an industry decimated by rationalisation and plummeting demand
for tractors in the past two decades.
The company is barely three years old, but its products bear familiar names
going back to the early days of manufacturing history. This week it added to
its range by acquiring the remaining assets of Massey Ferguson's European
operations in a Dollars 328m deal.
Agco's network of 2,600 North American dealers sells tractors with
trademarks such as Allis of Allis-Chalmers, White and Massey Ferguson, and
combines and reapers under the Gleaner and Hesston names.
Mr Robert Ratliff, chairman, has been building the company from the ground
up, buying the remains of ailing equipment manufacturers at fire-sale
prices, boosting their dealer networks and squeezing profits from
rationalisations and strategic product combinations. Agco's stock has jumped
from Dollars 14, when the company went public in April 1992, to around
Dollars 34.
Although 98 per cent of Agco's business has been centred on North America,
the Massey Ferguson acquisition, with its European operations and worldwide
dealer network, will make Agco's strategy global.
Mr Ratliff founded Agco when he led a management buy-out of what was left of
Allis-Chalmers' farm equipment division from Germany's
Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz.
Deutz wanted to divest the farm business because it was a poor fit with its
automotive businesses. Mr Ratliff, a former International Harvestor
executive, financed the Dollars 89.4m purchase by selling the company's
dealer receivables to Whirlpool Financial.
Since then he has completed a string of acquisitions, expanding his sales
force but where possible avoiding capital-intensive manufacturing
operations. Agco, for example, contracts with manufacturers such as Italy's
SLH to produce equipment that Agco sells under its own brand names.
While expanding the dealer network, the acquisitions have also provided a
wider selection of equipment to sell in a broad range of prices, a strategy
which has proved popular with farmers. It has also given Agco a profitable
business in replacement parts, which is less sensitive to industry cycles
than new equipment sales.
'Farmers keep their machines a long time, and need replacement parts. It's
the most profitable part of this business now,' says Mr Frank Manfredi, a
Chicago-based farm equipment analyst.
Agco's main US competitors are Deere and Co and J. I. Case, owned by
Tenneco. Agco's stock price has moved up in tandem with Deere and Tenneco,
benefiting from recovery in the US farm sector.
The company's 1993 sales rose to Dollars 600m, mostly on the strength of
acquisitions, generating profits of Dollars 34m. Following the Massey
Ferguson deal, Mr Ratliff expects Agco's sales to hit Dollars 1.5bn, though
the debt-to-capital ratio will increase to 57 per cent from 49 per cent.
At first glance the Massey Ferguson purchase is at odds with the Agco
strategy - Massey Ferguson has large manufacturing operations in the UK and
France, and was bought at a premium to book value.
However, Mr Ratliff says that the deal is a logical step in his plan to
expand Agco worldwide. It adds 4,000 dealers to its distribution network,
all of them outside the US, and Agco will use these outlets to market lines
now offered only in North America.

<TEXT>
A surge in beer sales helped Anheuser-Busch, the biggest brewing group in
the US, report an unexpectedly good start to the year with its first-quarter
results.
After a long period of lacklustre volume growth and indifferent results, net
income rose by 5.4 per cent to Dollars 204.4m from Dollars 194.1m.
Anheuser-Busch said that if its tax charge had not risen from 34 to 35 per
cent, the profits rise would have been 7.1 per cent.
Fully-diluted earnings per share, boosted by the company's aggressive stock
repurchase programme, rose by 10.1 per cent.
Higher sales produced the profits growth, the company said. Turnover rose by
4.8 per cent to Dollars 3.02bn, with beer deliveries to wholesalers rising
by 4.4 per cent and sales to retailers - a more accurate indicator of
consumer demand - rising by more than 5 per cent.
Anheuser-Busch said the growth was led by Bud Light, one of the Budweiser
family of beers, which continued to grow at double-digit rates, and by Ice
Draft, a new type of beer brewed through an ultra-cold process. Ice Draft
had steadily gained market share since its launch in January, the company
said.
The company's market share rose by 1.1 percentage points to 44.3 per cent of
total US beer sales in the quarter, reaffirming its position as market
leader. It has held the number one slot since 1957.
Mr August Busch, chairman, said the company was extremely pleased with the
performance of Ice Draft and planned to introduce Ice Draft Lite in selected
markets in May.
He said that he looked forward to favourable demographic trends in the

FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: AIG ahead in spite of earthquake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
American International Group, the large US insurer, yesterday reported
modest growth in first-quarter profits, in spite of a big jump in
catastrophe losses from the January earthquake in southern California.
AIG said net income during the quarter totalled Dollars 505.6m, against
Dollars 495.6m in the same period last year. After adjustments for
accounting changes and capital gains the group's underlying income rose 6
per cent over the year to Dollars 480.1m.
Catastrophe losses at AIG reached Dollars 55m, up from Dollars 7.8m a year
earlier. All the losses related to the earthquake, which has become the
second-costliest natural disaster in the history of the US insurance
industry, behind Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
Commenting on market conditions, Mr Maurice Greenberg, AIG's chairman, said
property insurance rates continued to strengthen in the domestic commercial
market, a trend that should be reinforced as the industry absorbs the impact
of the recent earthquake and weather-related catastrophes.
Apart from the impact of the earthquake, AIG's businesses put in a solid
performance. The group's general insurance division recorded earnings of
Dollars 349.5m, down slightly from Dollars 351.8m a year ago but up 12.5 per
cent if the catastrophe business is excluded. Life insurance earnings
climbed 18 per cent to Dollars 194.4m, and financial services posted
operating income of Dollars 97.1m, up 13 per cent from a year earlier.
USF&amp;G, another big insurer, also reported higher catastrophe losses in its
quarterly results yesterday, partly from the earthquake and partly from the
severe winter storms that swept large parts of the US during the quarter.
First-quarter net income was Dollars 23m, down from Dollars 61m a year
earlier, although those results included a one-time gain of Dollars 38m
related to the adoption of new accounting standards.
Catastrophe losses totalled Dollars 40m, Dollars 10m of which was the
California earthquake with the remainder being winter storms. Even with the
losses, USF&amp;G was able to post income of Dollars 33m on its
property/casualty business, down from Dollars 40m a year ago.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A stronger gold price and higher investment income helped Placer Dome, the
Vancouver-based gold producer, more than treble first-quarter earnings.
Net earnings were USDollars 37m, or 16 cents a share, up from Dollars 11m,
or 5 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest figures include a Dollars 6m
after-tax gain from the sale of investments in other mining companies.
Revenues edged up to Dollars 216m from Dollars 213m.
Cash production costs rose to Dollars 198 from Dollars 192 per ounce, but
this was more than offset by an increase in the average gold price received
to Dollars 385 per ounce from Dollars 352.
Placer's share of gold output from its 13 mines dipped to 442,000 ounces
from 450,000 ounces.
Production increases at eight mines were offset by lower output at the
Kidston mine in Australia, Detour Lake in Ontario and Misima in Papua New
Guinea. Placer's share was also affected by its lower interest, currently 25
per cent, in the Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea.
Production for 1994 as a whole is forecast at 2.1m ounces, up from 1.8m
ounces in 1993.
Placer said construction of the 50 per cent-owned Zaldivar copper mine in
Chile is on schedule and on budget. The mine, with an annual capacity of
125,000 tonnes, is due to start production in the second half of 1995.

FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Eastern says it may fly again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Airlines, once one of the best-known names in US aviation but now
defunct, may start flying again under a plan being considered by its
administrator.
Mr Martin Shugrue, court-appointed trustee of the company under the US
bankruptcy code, said that he was looking at the possibility of re-starting
the airline as an alternative to pressing ahead with its liquidation.
The plan is believed to involve using some of the 50 or so Eastern aircraft
now owned by the airline's senior secured creditors and stored in the Mojave
Desert, California. Its supporters believe that if Eastern can raise the
required capital, it could become another of the low-cost start-up carriers
that have successfully taken market share from the bigger US airlines.
Eastern went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 1989 amid a bitter power
struggle between its unions and its then chairman, Mr Frank Lorenzo. It kept
flying during attempts to organise a rescue, but was grounded - apparently
for good - in January 1991.
Mr Shugrue, a former vice-chairman and chief operating officer of Pan
American World Airways, was appointed Eastern's trustee in April 1990, and
has since been supervising plans for its liquidation.
Yesterday, however, Mr Shugrue claimed Eastern's creditors would get more
money if the airline went back into business.

FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Newsprint groups set to raise
prices again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Several North American and European newsprint producers are expected to
announce their second price increase of the year in the next few weeks.
Their expectations have been lifted by firm demand, the high capacity at
which most mills are operating, and the low inventories carried by some
large publishers. Tighter domestic markets have led to a sharp fall in
exports from both Europe and North America.
Recent price rises have stuck for the first time in four years. European
discounts have narrowed by about 3-3.5 per cent, while prices in eastern
North America are up by about 6 to 7 per cent. Western US and Canadian
producers will raise their prices by a similar margin on May 1.
Mr Ronald Oberlander, chairman of Abitibi-Price, the world's biggest
producer of newsprint, told the annual meeting last week that 'the
possibility of another price increase this year should not be discounted'.
Fletcher Challenge Canada expects to announce a price increase by mid-May,
which would take effect in early autumn.
European newsprint consumption climbed by about 5 per cent in the first two
months of the year.
In the UK, mills have guaranteed prices only until the end of June, and are
expected to try for another increase before the end of the year.
According to Mr John Maine, an analyst at Resource Information Systems in
Virginia: 'It's not a question of whether we'll get a price increase, it's
when.' He predicts a discount cut of about Dollars 40 a tonne from the
present eastern US price, lifting the price to around Dollars 475 a tonne,
which is still well below the list price of Dollars 685.
Recent experience in the newsprint industry has shown however, that
announcing a price rise does not guarantee its implementation.

FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Dow Chemical advances 38%
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dow Chemical said higher sales volume and improved productivity had paid off
in a 38 per cent jump in first-quarter earnings, excluding special items.
The US basic and specialty chemical producer yesterday posted revenues of
Dollars 4.5bn for the quarter , a 4 per cent rise on the year-earlier result
of Dollars 4.36bn.
The gain was struck on an 8 per cent increase in sales volume, reflecting
the moderate expansion of the US economy and the beginning of an upturn in
European markets. But prices remained under pressure amid a capacity glut
within the world chemical industry.
An off-setting factor was the group's extensive streamlining efforts, which
resulted in further productivity gains. Cost-cutting in the quarter saved
Dollars 40m in research, promotion and administrative expenses, following an
estimated Dollars 100m in savings in 1993.
The net effect of higher volumes and lower costs was best highlighted by
Dow's plastics business. Sales of Dollars 1.6bn were unchanged from the 1993
period, but operating income surged 85 per cent to Dollars 161m.
The overall result was a bottom line figure of Dollars 173m, or 62 cents a
share, after a provision of 3 cents a share related to a fall in the value
of a short-term investment portfolio.
The group realised net income of Dollars 402m, or Dollars 1.47, in the first
quarter of last year, but the figure was bolstered by a one-time Dollars 1 a
share from the sale of the 50 per cent interest in Dowell Schlumberger, an
oil-field services group.
The consumer specialties division, including pharmaceuticals, agricultural
supplies and household products, turned in the most buoyant performance.
Sales were up 16 per cent to Dollars 1.5bn and income 52 per cent ahead at
Dollars 246m.
The hydrocarbons and energy division showed a 9 per cent sales improvement
and narrowed its operating loss to Dollars 1m, from Dollars 7m a year ago.
Sales of chemicals and performance products slipped 7 per cent to Dollars
1bn. Operating income slumped 25 per cent to Dollars 109m.

FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Panama plans bond exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Panama, the one Latin American country which went into long-standing default
on its foreign bond issues during the 1980s, is set to complete a bond
exchange next month aimed at resolving the default.
Under the exchange, more than Dollars 400m of new floating-rate notes will
be issued by the government in place of nine bonds issued during the 1970s
and 1980s.
The new notes will carry interest at 1 per cent over London interbank
offered rates and will be redeemed in semi-annual instalments between 1996
and 2002, giving an average life of five years.
The exchange, for which the government was advised by S. G. Warburg, has
been accepted by bondholders representing 97 per cent of the outstanding
notes and bonds.
The move is the latest step by the current Panamanian government to right
the foreign debt defaults of the Noriega era. In a first step, the
government cleared Dollars 685m of arrears to the Paris Club of creditor
governments and the multilateral financial institutions in early 1992.
Talks with leading creditor banks over the settlement of some Dollars 1.9bn
of debt, with around Dollars 1bn of back interest, are continuing, though
they are likely to be put on hold at least until after presidential
elections on May 8.
The bond exchange - aimed at the creation of one liquid floating-rate note
issue which could conceivably act as a future benchmark - has only one
recent precedent in Latin America: the exchange in 1985 by Costa Rica of
three Eurobond issues.
The nine Panamanian bonds in default, which should all have matured by now,
include five US dollar issues totalling Dollars 195m, one issue of 20m
European units of account, the precursor to the Ecu, and three Japanese
issues totalling Y27m.
The accord includes a settlement totalling some Dollars 180m of interest
payments on both capital and interest outstanding. A quarter of this will be
paid initially in cash and the rest will be rolled into the bonds.

<TEXT>
United Airlines, the world's biggest airline, almost halved its losses in
the first quarter but warned that it still could not compete effectively
with low-cost carriers in the US domestic market.
Net losses in the quarter to March were Dollars 71m - excluding the effect
of an accounting change - a 49 per cent fall from the comparable period's
Dollars 138m net loss before extraordinary items. Losses per share,
excluding unusual items, were down from Dollars 5.92 to Dollars 3.31.
Revenues rose from Dollars 3.05bn to Dollars 3.19bn, while operating losses
fell from Dollars 121m to Dollars 36m.
Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman and chief executive, said the results were still
far from satisfactory in spite of the significant improvement. He blamed
lower passenger yields, brought about by the proliferation of reduced fares
that had accompanied the expansion of low-cost carriers.
'With our high cost structures, we are unable to compete effectively in
these markets,' Mr Wolf said.
United is awaiting shareholder approval for a radical plan to give employees
a controlling stake in the airline in return for wage cuts and productivity
improvements worth Dollars 4.9bn in today's money over the next 12 years.
Unlike the restructuring unveiled by Delta yesterday, United's plan also
envisages setting up a low-cost 'airline within an airline' to compete
head-on with low-cost carriers like Southwest Airlines on short-haul routes.
Mr Wolf said the plan would 'substantially and permanently' lower United's
labour costs. If it had been in place during the first quarter, the
airline's labour costs would have been Dollars 105m lower.
In fact, United's cost per available seat mile - the standard measure of
competitiveness in the industry - rose from 8.83 cents to 9.04 cents in the
first quarter. That compares with a figure of 7.2 cents for Southwest and
the target figure of 7.5 cents announced by Delta yesterday.
Trans World Airlines, the US carrier that emerged from bankruptcy protection
in November, reduced net losses from Dollars 476.5m to Dollars 122.4m in the
first quarter. The previous year's figure, however, included a one-time
charge of Dollars 300m relating to pension obligations. Operating losses
fell from Dollars 93.4m to Dollars 79.6m.

Delta Air Lines, the third-biggest US airline, plans to cut between 12,000
and 15,000 jobs from its workforce of 73,000 in the next three years in an
attempt to restore profitability.
It said the jobs would go as part of a restructuring that would cut Dollars
2bn a year from operating costs by mid-1997 and enable the airline to fight
back against low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines.
It described the changes as the most important in its history. Like other US
airlines, Delta has been hit by tough competition and low fares in its
domestic market.
It accompanied yesterday's restructuring announcement with figures showing
it had lost Dollars 77.9m after tax in the quarter to March.
Although this figure was a turnround on the comparable period's Dollars
152.3m net loss, the previous year's figure included an Dollars 82.5m
pre-tax charge relating to a fleet rationalisation, and much of the rest of
the improvement was due to a 10 per cent fall in fuel costs.
Some industry observers suggested that Delta would follow United Airlines'
example by setting up a low-cost, no-frills operation to take on its
short-haul routes, buying employees' co-operation by giving them an equity
stake in the airline.
Instead, Delta has opted for a less radical plan to leave it much the same,
but with a more competitive cost structure. However, Mr Ron Allen, chairman,
warned that if the company met employee resistance to its plans it might
hand over short-haul routes to joint ventures.
Mr Allen said Delta's goal was to reduce costs per available seat mile from
9.26 cents last year to 7.5 cents by 1997. That would be almost on a par
with Southwest's 7.2 cents.
Delta has shed more than 7,400 jobs since June 1992, and last February it
cut employees' pay by 5 per cent. Of its workforce, only the 8,500 pilots
belong to a labour union.

<TEXT>
Christiania Bank, Norway's second biggest bank, yesterday reported a rise in
first-quarter net profit to NKr375m (Dollars 51m) from NKr209m in the same
period last year.
It attributed the advance primarily to a lower level of loan losses and a
NKr250m gain from the disposal of the bank's 47 per cent interest in Norsk
Skibs Hypothekbank.
Net interest income fell slightly to NKr744m from NKr779m while non-interest
income declined to NKr595m from NKr699m.
Non-interest income was affected by losses of NKr155m on bonds and
certificates - against a gain of NKr169m in last year's first quarter - as a
result of interest rate upheaval.
Non-interest expenses rose to NKr771m from NKr695m due to allocations of
NKr14m to the Commercial Banks' Guarantee Fund and NKr20m associated with
the takeover of branches in the west coast city of Bergen previously owned
by Fokus Bank, Norway's third biggest commercial bank.
Operating profit, before loan losses, fell to NKr569m from NKr724m, while
provisions for losses on loans and guarantees were cut sharply to NKr191m
from NKr504m. Credit losses in the retail market were low but losses on
loans to the fisheries sector were a burden, it said.

FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Strube not satisfied with 47%
profits gain at BASF

<TEXT>
First-quarter pre-tax profits at BASF, one of the big three German chemical
groups, rose 46.6 per cent to DM349m (Dollars 205m), bolstering hopes that
the European chemical industry is pulling out of a cyclical recession.
However, Mr Jurgen Strube, chief executive, said he was 'not satisfied'
given the poor performance in the comparable period a year ago.
BASF is the last of the big three to report first-quarter results. Hoechst
saw pre-tax profits rise 16 per cent to DM506m while Bayer revealed a 18 per
cent rise to DM755m.
Mr Strube said rising demand and cost-cutting would enable the company to
meet its profit forecasts for 1994.
'We will continue our efforts to examine all costs with a view to further
lowering fixed costs and improving the organisation,' Mr Strube said.
BASF pre-tax profits totalled DM1.06bn in 1993. Foreign sales rose 5 per
cent to DM7.6bn while domestic demand fell 6.4 per cent to DM3bn. Group
turnover rose 2.1 per cent to DM11.27bn while turnover at the parent company
rose 5.1 per cent to DM4.7bn.
BASF is more dependent on oil prices than Hoechst or Bayer and it said that
while demand in Germany was picking up slightly the 3.4 per cent fall in
first-quarter turnover was due to falling oil prices.
Higher returns on gas trading could not compensate for lower oil prices, the
company said.
Sales of synthetics and fibres rose 10.6 per cent and the chemicals division

products fell 15.5 per cent.
The company said investment in 1994 would be reduced to DM3.2bn and would be
focused more on Asian markets.
BASF shed 2,495 jobs in the quarter, reducing total workforce to 112,020

It said its foam plastics and polyurethane were developing 'especially well'

Ballast Nedam, the Dutch construction group which was sold last year by
British Aerospace, is to be partially floated on the Amsterdam stock
exchange next month in a transaction worth at least Fl 259m (Dollars 136m).
ING Group, which bought the company for Fl 500m in December as part of a
consortium that includes German construction group Hochtief, is to sell 3.7m
convertible cumulative preference shares at a price of between Fl 70 and Fl
75 each.
The shares, worth up to Fl 277.5m at these prices, represent 37 per cent of
Ballast Nedam's share capital of 10m shares, divided between 4.7m cumulative
preference shares and 5.3m ordinary shares.
The shares on offer are all part of ING's large minority holding. Besides
Hochtief, which holds 48 per cent, other shareholders include Ballast
Nedam's pension fund.
The underwriting syndicate, led by ING Bank, may sell an additional 450,000
cumulative preference shares if demand permits.

FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Air France predicts FFr3.7bn
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Air France plans to limit losses to FFr3.7bn (Dollars 627m) in the financial
year, a sharp reduction from the FFr8.48bn deficit suffered in 1993, Mr
Christian Blanc, chairman, said yesterday.
The state-owned airline is changing its reporting period to bring it into
line with other members of the International Air Transport Association.
The predicted FFr3.7bn loss will therefore cover the period from January 1
this year to the end of March 1995.
The prediction followed confirmation of a sharp deterioration in the
airline's results for last year.
The company said '1993 was the darkest year for Air France'. The downturn
was blamed on several factors, including overcapacity in the airline
industry, the impact of recession and the effects of damaging strikes last
October.
Turnover declined by 3.6 per cent to FFr55.16bn, with the main air transport
business shrinking by about 6 per cent to FFr42.71bn.
Passenger traffic was flat compared with 1992 while freight traffic fell by
about 4.1 per cent. Financial charges rose by more than 60 per cent to
FFr3.51bn and there was a FFr1.8bn charge taken for restructuring measures.
The expected improvement in results this year is to be achieved partly
through the implementation of a recovery package and, to a lesser extent,
through improved market conditions.
Mr Blanc has won approval from the airline's 40,000 staff for a package of
measures which include 5,000 job cuts, a freeze on wages and promotions and
a reorganisation of the group structure.
The airline has also been pledged a FFr20bn capital injection from the
French government over the next three years which will ease its debt burden.
Air France said that passenger traffic had increased in the first quarter of
the year, rising by 19.9 per cent over the same period in 1993.
In March, the number of passengers rose by 23 per cent and the rate of
occupancy of Air France aircraft rose by almost 10 percentage points to 74.9
per cent.
However, the increase in passengers has largely been achieved by
price-cutting measures aimed at winning back passengers after last October's
strikes. As a result, the increases have not yet fed through into higher
profits.
The airline suffered a further blow this week with the decision by the
European Commission to order the French government to allow competition on
three routes serving Orly airport in Paris.

FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Turnround at SKF in first term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKF, the world's leading maker of roller bearings, showed a strong upward
trend yesterday when it announced a SKr661m (Dollars 83.7m) turnround in the
first quarter.
It said the SKr306m surplus, after losses of SKr355m a year ago, was helped
by clear evidence of recovery in leading European markets.
Mr Mauritz Sahlin, managing director, said: 'The recovery in the European
economy means that SKF's most important market is now on the way up again
after four years of decline.'
He said the group expected a full-year profit of about SKr1bn, compared with
the SKr669m deficit last year.
The 12 per cent rise in group sales to SKr8.05bn was driven by a 10 per cent
increase in volumes.
Sales to Europe rose faster than the market, consolidating the company's
leading position. The automotive industry, its most important segment,
accounted for a big portion of the increased volumes, with sales to Italy,
Germany, Spain and Sweden all rising strongly.
Both the group's main businesses, Seals and Bearings and Ovako Steel,
returned to the black. For Ovako, the special steels unit, it was the first
quarterly profit since 1989.
Seals and Bearings produced a SKr274m surplus, swinging from a loss of
SKr250m. This was after sales expanded to SKr7.46bn from SKr6.68bn.
Ovako achieved a SKr35m profit on sales of SKr929m. This compares with a
loss of SKr109m in the first quarter of 1993 on sales of SKr724m.
However, SKF does not consider Ovako a core operation, and its improved
performance may facilitate a sell-off.
SKF intends to start production in China, partly to meet the expected growth
in demand for ball bearings from the country's car industry.

<TEXT>
Shareholders in Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the Italian Treasury-controlled
bank, yesterday elected a new chairman and managing director to pilot the
group into the private sector.
Mr Mario Sarcinelli, former director-general of the Treasury and
vice-president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is
to be chairman. Mr Gino Trombi, managing director of Banco Ambrosiano
Veneto, will join him as one of two managing directors.
The Treasury, which owns just under 55 per cent of the group, yesterday
promised Mr Sarcinelli and Mr Trombi its 'full support . . . in completing
the restructuring and strategic repositioning of the group'.
However, Mr Sarcinelli admitted after yesterday's shareholder meeting in
Rome that preparing BNL for privatisation would not be an easy task.
The sell-off would have to be confirmed by a new Treasury minister, and BNL
would need to be recapitalised before a sale can take place, he said.
As if to underline the difficulties, Mr Davide Croff, the group's other
managing director, warned yesterday that 1994 would be a difficult year for
BNL, partly because of the delayed impact of bad debts caused by the
recession.

FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Soap war of words intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The war of words between the world's two leading detergents companies hotted
up yesterday, as Unilever accused Procter &amp; Gamble of 'sour grapes' in its
attacks on Unilever's new concentrated detergents. The products, presently
being launched across Europe under such brand names as Persil and Omo, were
claimed by Procter two days ago to damage clothing.
The argument centres on the catalyst developed by Unilever for the new
products, dubbed the Accelerator. Containing manganese, the catalyst is
claimed to permit faster washing at lower temperatures.
Procter said: 'Our own experience of the manganese Accelerator is that it
causes abnormal fabric damage. Our own initial testing of the Lever
Accelerator products caused us to raise serious concerns with Unilever . . .
We subsequently requested independent institutes to run fabric safety
testing (of the products).'
Procter said it was worried that because fabric damage was progressive, and
consumers switched brands, Procter products could be blamed for damage.
Unilever confirmed that meetings had taken place with Procter but said it
could not confirm Procter's findings. Unilever offered a joint approach to
an independent institute to test the results, but Procter had refused. A
Unilever spokesman said: 'I can only assume they wanted to find a way of
scuppering (our products). They suggested to us we stop the launch.  You can
imagine what response they got.'
Unilever said although attempts to use manganese in detergents went back
many years, only 10 per cent to 15 per cent of the catalyst consisted of the
chemical. Rather than causing unusual damage to fabrics, a Unilever
scientist said, the new detergents should preserve them longer.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: RTZ in cut-price deal for Colowyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ Corporation of the UK, which in the past year became the fifth-largest
coal producer in the US, is now to buy most of the Colowyo Coal Company from
WR Grace, the US speciality chemicals group.
The deal is worth Dollars 233m (Pounds 160m) to Grace but will cost RTZ only
Dollars 13m cash.
RTZ will not buy an interest in some long-term coal contracts. Instead,
these will be used to secure a proposed non-recourse financing which will
give Grace Dollars 220m prior to completion of the deal.
Grace will also retain a limited partnership interest in Colowyo entitling
it to share in proceeds from those coal contracts.
Colowyo is a surface mine located in north-west Colorado, producing about 4m
tonnes a year of low-sulphur, high-energy coal. About 60 per cent of output
will be used to repay the financing but RTZ will get some benefit because it
will sell the coal to Grace for re-sale. Present leased reserves total about
180m tonnes of mineable coal of which 60m tonnes are committed to long-term
contracts.
Early last year RTZ took its first step into the US coal business when its
Kennecott subsidiary bought the Nerco company from PacificCorp and quickly
followed up with the purchase of Cordero from the Sun Company. These deals
cost RTZ Dollars 475m net.
RTZ said Colowyo would add a higher energy coal to Kennecott's portfolio,
enabling it to offer a broader range of products. After completion of the
deal, scheduled for June, Kennecott's annual coal output will be 35m tonnes.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Usborne offer could end its suspension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Usborne, the grain trading and pig production company, said an offer had
been made for control of the company and that its shares could return from
suspension next month.
Shares in Usborne were suspended earlier this month at 19 1/2 p after the
group warned of substantial interim losses following problems on the pig
production side.
The group said yesterday that it had been informed that Mr David Frame, it
chief executive, had agreed to sell a 36 per cent stake in the company for
5p a share to a major shareholder, Mr David Thompson. This would give Mr
Thompson's company, Thompson Investments, control of just over 50 per cent
of Usborne's equity.
Following completion of his purchase of Mr Frame's shares, expected within
the next seven days, Mr Thompson will make an unconditional cash offer at
not less than 5p per share for all the outstanding shares, and loan the
group Pounds 10m to support the company's trading.
The board said it welcomed the financial commitment which Thompson
Investments had made to Usborne.
The interim results would be published as soon as practicable.
In the meantime, shareholders were advised to take no action until the
interim results have been released and the board has expressed its view on
forthcoming offer.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Hicking Pentecost expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hicking Pentecost, the textile and industrial products group, is buying the
Barbour Campbell industrial thread manufacturing business for a maximum
Pounds 8.93m, writes Graham Deller.
The deal is to be partly funded by a placing and open offer to shareholders,
fully underwritten by Credit Lyonnais Laing, to raise about Pounds 7.9m net
of expenses.
Barbour Campbell, a former Hanson offshoot, was acquired by its management
in 1989 for Pounds 25.8m. After expansion it lapsed into losses, blaming the
recession and high interest rates. It sold its troubled linen yarn
subsidiary in September last year; the remaining business being acquired by
Hicking made operating profits of Pounds 1.6m in the 18 months to March 26
1993, on turnover of Pounds 44.2m.
Consideration will be satisfied by up to Pounds 400,000 cash and the issue
of up to 4.06m shares at 220p apiece. The shares rose 7p to 234p yesterday.
An initial Pounds 5.53m is payable on completion with further payments
dependent on profit performance.
CLL has conditionally placed 4.13m shares with institutions at 210p per
share, subject to clawback on a 1-for-4 basis at the same price.
Hicking also said it expected to achieve pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.4m
(Pounds 2.85m) for the 12 months to March 31 1994. Estimated earnings per
share were 15.25p (13.01p). A second interim dividend of 3.05p is declared,
making a total for the year of 4.6p (4p).

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: US hikers put Hi-Tec back on track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US penchant for hiking boots helped Hi-Tec, the sports and leisure wear
company which is 54 per cent owned by its founder, Mr Frank van Wezel, to
return to the black in the year to January 31.
Pre-tax profits emerged at Pounds 1.13m, compared with an Pounds 8.3m loss
previously. Turnover rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 126.2m (Pounds 106.9m).
The profits were struck after Pounds 2.43m of exceptional items, including
Pounds 442,000 for cost cutting measures in the UK and the Netherlands and
Pounds 437,000 for capital restructuring in the US. However, most of this
was offset by an exceptional tax credit of Pounds 1.68m.
Last time exceptional charges of Pounds 4.82m were incurred through the
closure of the continental European sales network.
North America accounted for most of 1993's profits, making Pounds 5m (Pounds
2.4m) on sales of Pounds 48m (Pounds 29.4m).
Mr Peter Butler, finance director, said the group was well placed to exploit
the nineties trend for 'outdoor' footwear. The company expected this year to
sell 1m pairs of its Sierra Lite hiking boots.
Footwear is now sold through independent distributors in continental Europe,
where turnover fell by Pounds 6m to Pounds 22.2m. Mr Butler said that in
continental Europe the footwear side was breaking even. But sales at Cofex,
which makes fashion jackets, had fallen by 9 per cent, pushing the division
into the red.
The UK and Ireland division made profits of Pounds 1.85m (Pounds 1.58m loss)
on sales of Pounds 40.8m (Pounds 37.5m).
In the rest of the world, turnover rose from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 15.2m,
helped by the fashion trend to US-style outdoor footwear. Operating profits
were Pounds 900,000 (Pounds 400,000).
Net interest payable rose to Pounds 2.77m (Pounds 2m), giving gearing of 84
per cent (81 per cent).
Earnings were 3.7p (18.8p loss). The final dividend of 1.5p makes a total of
2.75p (2p).

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Mortgage beats benchmarks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Net asset value at Scottish Mortgage and Trust, Baillie Gifford's flagship
international general investment trust, rose by 17 per cent to 257.4p per
share over the year to March 31, beating both the FT-SE-A All-Share Index
and the FT-A World Index over the same period.
Total net assets reached a new year-end high of Pounds 1.04bn at end-March,
compared with Pounds 1.03bn a year earlier.
The trust said it had not made any significant strategic shifts in asset
allocation, apart from a slight reduction of exposure to the smaller Pacific
markets at the end of 1993 on the grounds that they were overvalued.
However, the trust said it was still enthusiastic about the region for the
long term.
As at March 31, some 51 per cent of the trust's assets were in UK equities,
compared with 48.7 per cent 12 months earlier.
Japan accounted for 4 per cent (2.9 per cent), and other Pacific markets
14.1 per cent (10.3 per cent).
The sale by the end of 1993 of a portfolio of gilts, which had been financed
largely by variable rate borrowings, contributed to profits.
The trust has since acquired a new gilt portfolio during market weakness,
again using variable rate borrowings.
Earnings advanced by 7 per cent, to 4.12p per share.
A final dividend of 2.75p is proposed, giving a total of 4.1p, up 2.5 per
cent from last year's 4p, an increase marginally ahead of inflation.

its quotation from London to the Toronto stock exchange.
Monarch said the scheme was being delayed by two to four weeks to give time
for gold market conditions to stabilise. Since it announced the plan on
March 29, the price of gold bullion has fallen by 4 per cent, from Dollars
390 to Dollars 374 a troy ounce and gold company share prices in Toronto
have fallen by between 15 and 20 per cent.
The company previously said it was disillusioned by London investors' lack
of interest in smaller mining companies. It planned to raise Dollars 30m
(Pounds 20.5m), principally from Canadian investors, so that it could apply
for a listing in Toronto where investors had a better understanding of gold
stocks.
Present shareholders would be able to take part via an open offer for up to
Pounds 7m. At a special meeting which approved these arrangements yesterday,
it was also announced that the closing date for the shareholder offer had
been extended from May 4 to May 16.
After the market had time to absorb the full implications, Monarch's share
price recovered slightly to 290p.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Stanhope cuts loss and sees further advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stanhope Properties, the development and investment company which jointly
owns the Broadgate development, announced lower interim losses of Pounds
9.3m, against Pounds 15.4m. Turnover for the six months to December 31 fell
from Pounds 27.5m to Pounds 17.1m.
At the end of the period negative net worth stood at Pounds 15m but Mr
Stuart Lipton, chief executive, said he was confident Stanhope would achieve
a positive value by the June 30 year end.
However, the company remains under pressure to proceed with the refinancing
of its Pounds 130m of debt, after incurring losses of Pounds 277m in the two
previous fiscal years.
Mr Lipton said Stanhope was talking to a number of groups over refinancing
proposals, which might include the sale of Broadgate or equity financing. An
agreement would be reached before the end of the year, he said.
One of the companies involved in the talks is British Land, which on
Wednesday completed its purchase of a 29.9 per cent stake in Stanhope.
The purchase is being disputed by Stanhope, as breaching pre-emption rights
agreed with Olympia &amp; York, the collapsed Canadian property group, whose
stake was sold via its bankers, the Bank of Nova Scotia.
Mr John Ritblat, British Land chairman, said yesterday: 'We bought the
shares because they were offered to us, and because we thought it would be
of mutual advantage.
'Stanhope has done rather well, because the share price has almost doubled
and it has encouraged interest in the property.'
Broadgate Properties, contributed an operating surplus of Pounds 500,000,
compared with losses of Pounds 4.9m, which was the main factor behind an
improvement in the share of losses of associates of Pounds 1.22m (Pounds
6.46m). However, the 1994 figure was helped by the capitalisation of Pounds
10m of interest costs.
Broadgate is now 96 per cent let. In addition, a further 215,000 sq ft of
the Ludgate development has been let, leaving it 34 per cent vacant.
Stanhope's net interest payments fell to Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 11.6m), because
of the proceeds from property sales.
The company has obtained planning consent for a 1,000 acre development near
Cambridge in a joint venture with Alfred McAlpine. It will comprise 3,000
houses, a business park and a retail centre.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Hopkinsons declines by 69% to Pounds
642,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopkinsons Group, the industrial abrasives, engineering equipment and
plastic products company which issued a profits warning in January,
yesterday reported a further decline in full-year profits, but, as expected,
is maintaining its dividend.
Pre-tax profits fell by 69 per cent to Pounds 642,000 in the year to January
31, down from Pounds 2.06m in 1992 when the group carried an exceptional
charge of Pounds 600,000 covering redundancies at the Bryan Donkin
engineering business.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 99m (Pounds 102.5m), but the decline was
cushioned by exchange rate movements. Based on constant exchange rates,
sales would have fallen by 6.5 per cent to Pounds 95.9m. After a tax credit
of Pounds 287,000 (Pounds 1.02m charge), reflecting German losses and the
release of tax provisions, earnings per share slipped to 1.17p (1.31p).
A final dividend of 0.8p (0.4p) is recommended, making an unchanged total
for the year of 1.3p.
Operating profits fell by 62 per cent to Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 3.79m), partly
reflecting a swing into losses by the abrasives division. Despite success in
exports outside western Europe and cost reductions, the division reported a
Pounds 1.24m loss (Pounds 374,000 profit) on sales which slipped to Pounds
53m (Pounds 53.6m).
Further reductions in demand from the UK gas industry adversely affected the
engineering operations, although this was partly offset by continued
development of export markets. The division reported reduced profits of
Pounds 451,000 (Pounds 2.04m) on turnover of Pounds 24.9m (Pounds 29.1m).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Laser-Scan Holdings, the USM-quoted maker of digital mapping systems and
high resolution laser plotters, reported a jump in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 80,000 to Pounds 113,000 in 1993.
Mr Jim Utterson, chairman, said the improvement was achieved in spite of
continuing difficult economic conditions in most of the group's markets.
Turnover fell to Pounds 9.59m (Pounds 10m) as a result of the impact of the
Inegi contract, most of which was delivered in 1992.
The group launched its Open Systems software platform during the year, and
agreement for its use has been reached with IBM in North America and Ssang
Yong in South Korea. As the group intends to concentrate on developing the
software it is to discontinue the in-house manufacture of Imaging Systems
hardware, the costs of which will be reflected in the 1994 results.
After tax of Pounds 166,000 (Pounds 1,000), losses per share amounted to
0.3p (0.5p earnings).

Over 1993 - 'a year of transition' according to directors - Toye &amp; Company,
the civil and military regalia manufacturer, reduced pre-tax losses from
Pounds 1.46m to Pounds 511,000.
The outcome, achieved on turnover of Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 10.5m), including
Pounds 9.44m (Pounds 8.98m) from continuing operations, was after a
provision of Pounds 105,000 against the discontinued corporate clothing

The integration of the Cornelia James Neckwear business, acquired last July,
was completed by the year-end and should contribute to profits in the
future.
Losses per share narrowed to 21.41p (51.56p).

Folkes Group, the property and engineering concern, fell into the red in
1993 with pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.72m, against profits of Pounds 1m.
Continuing activities showed profits down from Pounds 2.31m to Pounds 1.1m.
Mr Constantine Folkes, chairman, said that the recession and fierce
competition had resulted in a squeeze on margins.
Turnover was Pounds 39.4m (Pounds 39.8m) of which Pounds 35.6m (Pounds
34.1m) was related to continuing activities. Exports increased by 17 per
cent, which meant they represented 20 per cent of sales.
Property reported an operating profit of Pounds 2.51m (Pounds 2.4m) as
vacant commercial property was cut from 13 per cent to 6 per cent over the
year. Engineering and services showed a loss of Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 68,000)
despite severe cost cutting due to a deterioration in market prices.
Losses per share were 4.68p (earnings 1.24p) but in view of prospects, the
recommended final dividend is held at 0.925p for an unchanged total of 1.5p.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: British Land Quantum buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Total property investments of the British Land Quantum Fund have been taken
up to Pounds 500m with the Pounds 70.5m purchase of a freehold building at
122 Leadenhall Street, in the City of London, writes Simon Davies.
Mr John Ritblat, British Land chairman, said the property, bought from Union
Bank of Switzerland, offered an excellent location at an attractive price.
Average rents were about Pounds 30 per sq ft, but there are large rent-free
periods on some leases. The building had been substantially refurbished
following the damage from the IRA bomb explosion in 1992.
The property, with a net area of almost 180,000 sq ft, is 80 per cent let to
Banque Indosuez and is believed to be on a yield of 7.5 per cent.
The purchase follows the fund's acquisition of the Pounds 19.2m Barwell
Business Park and the Pounds 128m purchase of a portfolio from Royal
Insurance.
The fund was formed last June between British Land and Mr George Soros as a
Pounds 500m investment partnership, but it is looking to invest up to Pounds
1bn in the UK property market.
In addition to its property holdings, the fund will also hold the British
Land stake in Stanhope. It plans to use this in an attempt to buy Broadgate
Properties.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: British Gas warns of 'period of
instability'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at British Gas in the first quarter will be similar to those
of last year. But the underlying trend is downwards and the full-year
outcome will be lower than 1993 after an exceptional charge of Pounds 1.65bn
is stripped out.
The shares fell 15p to 280p.
Mr Richard Giordano, taking the chair at the annual meeting in Birmingham
for the first time since his appointment last January, predicted a period of
instability, as the group restructured.
This would lead to a drop in service, although that service 'will stack up
well compared with what will be offered by competitors,' he said.
'I am under no illusion that morale will be high during the process of
restructuring'.
Earlier, he had warned that 'thousands of British Gas managers and workers
will have to learn new ways of doing business and in a relatively short
time. It will not be accomplished without stress and conflict.'
British Gas made the exceptional charge in its accounts in the year to
December 31 to cope with the cost of closures and 25,000 redundancies.
The effect was to plunge the group, on a current cost basis, to a loss of
Pounds 613m. Profits before exceptionals were Pounds 1.07bn.
Mr Giordano said 1994 profits would be below this level as the group was
squeezed by competition and the effect of regulation. Pre-tax profits of
Pounds 898m were indicated for the first quarter.
British Gas unveiled a new logo at the AGM, 'a new corporate identity,' Mr
Giordano said.
He was quick to add, in view of the heavy expense incurred by BT on a
similar exercise, that introduction of the logo, created by Coley Porter
Bell, would cost up to Pounds 3m.

<TEXT>
Abbey National, the bank and mortgage lender, yesterday disclosed pre-tax
profits 20 per cent higher for the first quarter of the year, compared with
1993, while directors said there was 'a clear upward trend in the housing
market', writes John Gapper.
Lord Tugendhat, chairman, said at the annual meeting that there was 'a
positive outlook' for 1994, with the UK retail banking provisions charge
expected to be lower over the year.
He added that Abbey's policy of locking in a spread on its investments meant
that treasury operations had been 'little affected'
Abbey announced it was applying to join the Personal Investment Authority,
which is to take over responsibility for personal financial services
regulation in July.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Charles Sidney in Pounds 3m purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles Sidney, the Yorkshire-based Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicle and
passenger car dealer spun off by Albert Fisher last year, is paying Pounds
3.1m cash for the Aberdeen and Dundee Motor Group.
The vendor is Motherwell Bridge Holdings, one of the largest privately-owned
engineering companies in Scotland.
Charles Sidney also reported a 4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds
1.3m for the six months to February 28 on turnover ahead 8 per cent at
Pounds 2.92m (Pounds 2.71m).
Operating profits were flat at Pounds 1.25m after charging additional
central costs of Pounds 165,000. Profits at the pre-tax level were boosted
by Pounds 46,000 of interest receipts compared with Pounds 12,000 of
interest costs a year earlier.
Mr Raymond Edwards, chairman, said 'performance in our first six months as a
public company was in line with our expectations'.
Earnings per share slipped to 3.9p (4p), mainly reflecting low returns from
holding the new money raised at the time of flotation on deposit during the
period. A maiden interim divided of 1.2p is declared. The acquisition marks
the first step in Sidney's growth strategy set out at the time of flotation
in November.
As well as expanding the group's geographic coverage, which is particularly
important for the truck fleet market, the deal will increase trucks and car
unit sales by about 20 per cent.
Aberdeen and Dundee Motor operates Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicle
franchises in Aberdeen and Dundee and the Mercedes-Benz passenger car
franchise in Dundee.
Last year the operations returned profits of Pounds 469,000 before interest,
group management charges of Pounds 146,000 and tax.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: VTR seeks Pounds 3m for expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in VTR, the video post-production house, rose 20p to 166p yesterday
on news of a Pounds 2.95m rights issue and trebled half-year profits.
The company has also applied for a move from the USM to a full listing.
Group pre-tax profits for the six months to end-February jumped from Pounds
202,000 to Pounds 697,000 on turnover up 38 per cent at Pounds 5.75m.
The interim dividend is lifted 21 per cent to 1.45p, payable from earnings
per share of 6p (1.7p).
The final distribution will be maintained at at least 2.55p on the enlarged
capital.
Mr John Banks, managing director, said the new funds would enable the group
to continue its capital investment programme and take advantage of possible
acquisition opportunities.
Capital expenditure has been running at about Pounds 2m a year, leaving the
company with net debt of Pounds 2.8m and gearing of 65 per cent at the end
of February.
The rights issue, fully underwritten by Greig Middleton, is on a 1-for-3
basis at 125p a share.

FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Fitzwilton lifts Wellworth stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fitzwilton, the Irish holding company chaired by Mr Tony O'Reilly, chief
executive of Heinz, surprised the market with the announcement of a 1-for-1
open offer worth IPounds 47.3m (Pounds 45.9m) to lift its stake in the
Northern Ireland-based Wellworth food retailing group from 42.7 per cent to
97 per cent.
At the same time Fitzwilton announced a pre-tax loss of IPounds 13.8m
(IPounds 27.9m restated) for the year to December 31 1993, after an IPounds
18.3m provision for goodwill write-off on the proposed disposal of its M6
cash and carry division in the UK.
Operating profits more than doubled from IPounds 4.3m to IPounds 10.5m,
largely on the back of the turnround at Waterford Wedgwood, in which
Fitzwilton has a 9.4 per cent stake.
The open offer, at 43p per share, is underwritten by Morgan Grenfell and
together with various options being exercised by Mr O'Reilly lifts the total
shares in the group from 117m to 252m.
Fitzwilton's original 42.7 per cent stake was bought for Pounds 18.3m. The
additional 54.3 per cent will cost Pounds 41.6m on completion, and Pounds
75m in senior and mezzanine debt used in the original purchase in October
1992 by Erne, the buy-out vehicle, will be taken into the Fitzwilton balance
sheet giving a post-acquisition gearing of about 93 per cent.
According to Fitzwilton, Wellworth had audited net assets of Pounds 63.9m at
December 31. It showed operating profits of Pounds 18.2m on turnover of
Pounds 252.6m. This compared with Pounds 18.6m in pre-tax profits on
turnover of Pounds 236m for the year to April 25 1992, prior to its buy-out
from Isosceles.
Fitzwilton's stake in its Rennicks subsidiary, a road sign manufacturer, is
also to be increased from 51 to 76 per cent, costing IPounds 2.9m.
Losses per share came to 14.77p, while headline earnings per share amounted
to 1.63p compared with losses of 2.77p in 1992. An unchanged final dividend
of 2p is proposed for a 3.5p total.
COMMENT
Fitzwilton has a history of acquisitions and disposals over the years which
have done little to enhance shareholder value. Its cash and carry and motor
vehicle finance divisions have each stayed about five years in the group,
and have resulted in a total goodwill write-off of some IPounds 43m on
disposal. One can only hope that its new focus on the highly competitive
business of food retailing will not end up similarly blurred five years down
the road. A 1994 earnings figure of about 3.5p looks probable giving a
prospective p/e in excess of 15, and making even the discounted open offer
price of 43p look close to being fully valued.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Airtours acquires SAS Leisure - Pounds 82m
rights issue to help purchase tour operator and cruise ship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airtours, the holiday group, yesterday announced that it was buying
Scandinavia's largest tour operator and a cruise ship. It also launched an
Pounds 82m rights issue to help fund the purchases.
Airtours is buying SAS Leisure from Scandinavian Airlines System for Pounds
74m. SAS Leisure, which has 31 per cent of the Scandinavian tour operating
market, owns or manages 14 resort hotels and has a 50 per cent stake in
Premiair, a charter airline.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours' chairman, said the purchase of the 752-berth
ship from Closter Cruise of Norway, would require an investment of Pounds
16m - including the cost of refurbishment. Airtours will begin selling
cruises in the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands to both UK and
Scandinavian customers in spring 1995.
Mr Crossland said that if the venture was successful, Airtours would invest
in further cruise ships, although there were no immediate plans to do so.
The rights issue is on a 1-for-5 basis at 390p a share. Airtours' shares
fell 24p yesterday to close at 424p.
Mr Crossland said the purchase of SAS Leisure would provide the enlarged
group with greater strength in the purchase of accommodation, aviation fuel
and airline insurance.
He said the Scandinavian company's hotels had average occupancy levels of 73
per cent, compared with close to 100 per cent at Airtours' own hotel in
Majorca. He said the combined group would be able to boost occupancy
substantially at the newly-acquired hotels.
Mr Crossland added that SAS Leisure was expected to return to profit in the
year to December 31 after incurring pre-tax losses of SKr94m (Pounds 8m) in
1993.
He said the purchase would be earnings enhancing in the current year.
COMMENT
When Airtours ventured from its Lancashire base to London to launch its
ultimately unsuccessful bid for its rival Owners Abroad, it showed better
judgment than the City. Shareholders backed Owners Abroad's top executives,
only to see them depart last year when profits dived. When Airtours moved on
to Cardiff to buy Aspro Travel last year its judgment was less sure. It is
now suing the vendors for fraudulent misrepresentation. Airtours' decision
to wade into the icy waters of Scandinavia clearly has the City shivering.
As a move into a new, and for UK investors, relatively unknown market, the
SAS Leisure purchase has its dangers. But it would be a pity if a company
which has achieved the UK growth that Airtours has did not try to reproduce
that success on a wider stage. If Airtours is to expand outside its UK base,
this is the time to do it. The Scandinavian company has already cut costs
and Airtours' UK summer 1994 bookings are up 42 per cent.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Losses deepen to Pounds 1.53m at CI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses increased at CI Group, the Wolverhampton-based engineer, as it
absorbed the costs of selling an unprofitable French steel mill and a new
round of redundancies.
For the year to January 31, pre-tax losses were Pounds 1.53m (Pounds
338,000) after redundancy costs and disposal losses totalling Pounds 2.05m
(Pounds 2.85m). During the year Societe Metallurgique de Brevilly, the
French subsidiary, was sold and the workforce cut by 11 per cent to less
than 1,000.
Turnover was Pounds 66.7m (Pounds 65.6m) including Pounds 4.5m (Pounds
6.93m) from discontinued activities.
Losses per share rose to 1.54p (0.47p). However, the group is paying what Mr
Rob Yates, chief executive, called 'a very modest final dividend' of 0.1p as
a gesture of confidence for the present year. With an interim of 0.4p, which
was covered at the time, the total is 0.5p, half the previous year's 1p.
CI also announced that its new chairman would be Mr Robert Jordan, who until
1991 was chief executive of Foseco. He succeeds Mr Patrick McTighe who died
on April 17.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Redrow scales down flotation proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent decline in housebuilding shares yesterday persuaded Redrow, the
third housebuilder to come to the market this year, to scale down its
flotation plans.
The company announced that 87m shares would be sold at 135p apiece, raising
a total of Pounds 117m and giving a market capitalisation of Pounds 298m.
At the beginning of March issue proposals were expected to place a value of
Pounds 350m on the company.
Redrow is raising Pounds 55.4m from the sale of 41m shares while Mr Steve
Morgan, the founder and chief executive, is raising Pounds 62m from the sale
of 46m shares, reducing his stake to 60 per cent.
Mr Morgan had planned to raise Pounds 100m, reducing his stake to about 50
per cent, but decided to reduce the size of the sale following the recent
decline in building shares.
Up to 35 per cent of the shares will be sold to the public with the
remainder placed with institutions.
The issue price puts the shares on a prospective p/e of 17.1 on forecast
pre-tax profits of Pounds 21m for the year to June 30.
The notional gross yield on a forecast total dividend of 2.7p is 2.5 per
cent.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd has fully underwritten the offer with Cazenove acting
as broker.
Applications close at midday on May 9 with dealings due to start on May 17.
Mr Morgan said that proceeds from the issue would be used to repay group
borrowings of Pounds 25m and to finance land purchases.
COMMENT
Redrow is the pick of the housebuilders to float this year. It follows
Beazer Homes and Wainhomes, both of which have recently been trading below
their issue prices as construction shares have underperformed the FT-SE-A
All-Share Index by 8 per cent since the end of February. Earlier in the year
Redrow had been looking at price of about 145p but has carefully pitched the
issue to stand at a small discount to class acts in the sector like Wilson
Bowden and Berkeley. Redrow does not look out of place in this company and
the shares deserve to open at a small premium.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: David Brown shares fall on cautious
statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in David Brown Group, the Yorkshire-based specialist engineer which
came to the market last April, fell by 23p to 263p after the company sounded
a cautious note on trading.
Mr Derek Kingsbury, chairman, said the group - which in November bought the
hydraulics and transmissions division of Hamworthy from Powell Duffryn for
Pounds 11.1m - still saw few signs of widespread recovery.
He said: 'Progress remains largely dependent on the many initiatives our
management is taking to grow the businesses, together with the benefits from
rationalisation and turnround of the Hamworthy operation.'
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 9.3m to Pounds 10.8m in the year to
February 4, but the increase was entirely due to the post-flotation
reduction in interest payments to Pounds 234,000 (Pounds 1.78m).
Turnover rose to Pounds 86.5m (Pounds 81m), because of an 11-week
contribution from the Hamworthy operations.
Despite a small profits contribution from the new businesses, operating
profit was flat at Pounds 11.1m, which the group said reflected the
difficult conditions in its main markets.
The vehicle transmissions division maintained sales and profits, in spite of
a first-half gap between orders for gearboxes in the Challenger 1 and
Challenger 2 tanks.
The group said a 20 per cent drop in sales to the military had been replaced
by developing commercial business.
Mr Chris Brown, joint chief executive, said the recent government decision
to buy up to 259 Challenger 2 tanks was likely to extend the group's order
book from 1997 well into the next century.
The pumps division increased sales, but operating profits fell by 26 per
cent because of a change in the sales mix towards lower-margin business.
Some 150 jobs have been shed from the Hamworthy operations at Poole, Dorset,
and of the two factories there, one is being closed.
A further 100 net jobs will be lost in the transmissions business.
Pro-forma earnings per share were flat at 14.1p. A final dividend of 4.3p
gives a total of 6.4p
COMMENT
The shares have had a good run since flotation at 170p, but the tone of this
statement caused analysts to downgrade expectations. There was
disappointment over the extent of pricing pressure in special products,
which makes custome-built gearboxes, and the recent collapse of Lancer Boss
will not help the group - sales to the lift-truck maker were worth more than
Pounds 1m a year, and a hefty bad debt charge is expected. The strategy of
consolidating and modernising the group's businesses still makes a lot of
sense, but the benefits may take longer to materialise than had been hoped.
Even after yesterday's 9 per cent fall, a prospective multiple of 18 puts
the shares on a 16 per cent premium to the market - which looks fully
valued.

<TEXT>
The Go-Ahead Group, the Gateshead-based bus service operator, is to place
17.5m shares at 120p each in a flotation which will give it a market value
of Pounds 40.1m.
The proceeds of Pounds 12m will be used to pay back all of the debt assumed
to finance its recent purchase of the Brighton and Hove Bus Company and the
Oxford Bus Company.
About 16.96m shares are being placed firm with institutions, with the
balance being offered to the group's 3,500 employees. After the flotation,
the directors will control 34 per cent of the equity.
The placing has been fully underwritten by Hill Samuel, with Panmure Gordon

Hobson, the vehicle for 28-year-old Mr Andrew Regan, is planning to buy the
food manufacturing division of Co-operative Wholesale Society Limited for
Pounds 111m.
The deal will be financed through bank debt and the issue of 296.3m shares
at 27p, to raise about Pounds 73m net of expenses.
Some 98.4m shares are being placed firm with a further 94.2m placed subject
to a 1-for-1 clawback to existing shareholders. The balance of 103.7m are
being offered to the public. Hobson is also proposing a reduction in
capital.
Hobson has a market capitalisation of Pounds 25m. The shares, traded on the
USM, were suspended on February 10 at 27p pending the announcement. Mr Regan
became chief executive after reversing Cadismark, his household products
business, into Hobson at the end of 1992.
The CWS division, known as FMG, mainly supplies own-brand label goods to the
Co-op. It made a profit last year of Pounds 9.8m on sales of Pounds 304.2m,
of which Pounds 221.6m were made to the Co-op. Three years ago sales to
other retailers, including Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway, were Pounds 51.8m,
of which Pounds 38m were non-milk. Last year total sales rose to Pounds
82.6m, of which Pounds 78m were non-milk.
Mr Regan said the company was under-achieving with margins of about 3 per
cent. A target of 6 per cent in two years would be realistic. He also wanted
to continue the rapid rise in sales outside CWS, however, in order to
protect its turnover, Hobson has a supply agreement with CWS for three
years.
Once shareholders approve the offer at an EGM on May 23, Hobson will request
dealings to restart on the Official List.
COMMENT
The retailers must be rubbing their hands with glee as another own-brand
supplier with excess capacity joins a fiercely competitive market. Assuming
that by the end of next year the new management has doubled margins to 6 per
cent, earnings per share would emerge at 3.9p. This puts the shares on a
multiple of 6.9, which looks attractive and should ensure a premium. Hobson,
however, is operating at the sharp end, and could soon find itself running
hard to stand still.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Industrial logic that's very compelling -
How the Enterprise Oil chairman sees the future with the prospect of Lasmo
in the pipeline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'This is a big boys' game', said Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief
executive of Enterprise Oil, yesterday.
It is a message he will have to press home hard, judging by the generally
sceptical reaction in the City to his Pounds 1.4bn bid for fellow
independent oil company Lasmo. But there are several points to his game
plan.
As his opening remark suggests, Mr Hearne is looking for size and strength.
In an environment where low oil prices are exposing the weaknesses in the
oil industry, he believes that a company needs 'clout and credibility' if it
is to succeed.
The combination of Enterprise and Lasmo, two medium-sized exploration and
production companies, will have 'critical mass' he says, as well as the
financial and technical strength needed to operate on a world scale. The
deal would virtually double Enterprise's reserves and production.
But having said that, Mr Hearne is also keen to dismiss the idea that he is
after size for its own sake. 'This is not megalomania. I feel very
passionately about this,' he said. And though a successful bid would greatly
enlarge Enterprise, it would still be small relative to the oil 'majors' -
about one tenth the market capitalisation of Shell, for example. So there
was no question of stifling Enterprise's flair but of creating more
opportunities to put it to work.
Mr Andrew Shilston, finance director, said: 'We aim to create further value,
not just add the two companies together.'
Although both companies are strong in the North Sea, their operations have
relatively little overlap elsewhere, and cover all the continents.
The financial match is also good, Mr Hearne says. Lasmo is strapped for cash
whereas Enterprise has completed the bulk of its Pounds 1.3bn capital
spending programme and is about to reap the benefits in swelling cash flow.
By merging Enterprise's strong balance sheet with Lasmo's, he expects to end
up with a gearing of 44 per cent. This is lower than Enterprise's existing
gearing of 48 per cent because it will include the proceeds of Lasmo's
current Pounds 219m rights issue.
'We have the cash and they have the exploration prospects,' he said. 'The
industrial logic is very compelling'.
Above all, Mr Hearne believes that Enterprise can make more of Lasmo's oil
and gas assets than Lasmo itself, though he was unwilling to come up with
any specific examples yesterday - or point fingers at particular members of
Lasmo management, though he says it suffers from 'continuing weakness'
despite a reshuffle at the top.
However, some market sceptics point out that Enterprise's own recent record
has not been that brilliant, despite its stronger market standing compared
to Lasmo. Its earnings per share are down from late 1980 levels, and its
exploration record has tailed off even though capital spending has gone up.
In particular, the market is worried that Enterprise is about to make the
same mistake as Lasmo when it paid Pounds 1bn for Ultramar in 1991 in a bid
for expansion, only to plunge into loss. Mr Hearne points to several
differences.
One is that his bid will be paid for with shares rather than topped up with
cash, leaving the balance sheet in good shape. 'It is our policy to fund big
deals with paper,' he says.
A second is that, unlike Ultramar, Lasmo is not in the hard-pressed refining
business. Another is that Enterprise is not planning on a 'fire sale' of
Lasmo assets to finance the deal, as was the case with Ultramar. And lastly,
Mr Hearne believes that his offer has been pitched at a realistic level
given the unexciting outlook for the oil price. 'It's wrong to suppose that
if you invest, the oil price will bail you out.'
Mr Hearne says 'I honestly do not know' when asked what might happen to the
oil price. But he says the offer has been examined in the light of a whole
range of assumptions from Pounds 9 to Pounds 12 a barrel.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Gerrard &amp; National to buy rest of GNI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Gerrard &amp; National rose 39p to 448p after the discount house and
financial services company announced better-than-expected annual profits and
the buy-out of the minority shareholders in its fastest growing business.
The group also said it was pulling out of gilt-edged marketmaking.
Gerrard is issuing shares worth Pounds 38.4m, after yesterday's rise, in
return for the 32.4 per cent minority in GNI Holdings, its derivatives
broker and fund manager.
GNI's profits leapt 75 per cent to Pounds 12.5m last year, helping peg group
pre-tax profits at Pounds 25m (Pounds 25.2m) in the year to April 5. The
previous year's results were boosted by the fall in interest rates following
the UK's withdrawal from the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Mr Brian Williamson, chairman, said the announcements represented the
successful completion of the first phase of the company's strategy to
improve the quality of earnings by expanding into broking and fund
management.
'We have been trying to get away from being a specialist money dealer with
volatile earnings and last year our efforts came to fruition. For the first
time the dividend was covered by earnings from the broking division.'
Earnings per share slipped from 38p to 34.7p but dividends edge up to 22p
(21.5p) with a proposed final of 16p.
Profits from the trading division, which includes the Gerrard &amp; National Ltd
discount house, fell from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 4.3m with the gilt-edged
marketmaker contributing Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 2.7m). Mr Williamson said the
marketmaker had been generally profitable since Big Bang in 1986 and its
return on capital, at more than 15 per cent, had been higher than most of
its competitors.
However, the group has decided 'the obligations and risks of gilt-edged
marketmaking exceed the benefits and rewards'. It will continue to trade in
gilts and there are no staff cuts planned.
Profits from the broking division rose by almost 50 per cent to Pounds
20.7m, fuelled by GNI Holdings which since 1985 has increased its profits by
an average of 45 per cent a year.
Gerrard Vivian Gray, the stockbroker and fund manager, made profits of
Pounds 4.17m (Pounds 2.44m).
COMMENT
Group profits were better than the City expected and more heavily-weighted
towards the broking businesses which have been the focus of its efforts over
the last few years. There was also some relief that the gilt-edged
marketmaker had coped with the market downturn rather better than it handled
the bull run. The withdrawal from marketmaking should further improve the
quality of group earnings while the acquisition, at a pretty good price, of
the GNI minority should enable Gerrard to offer integrated services in areas
such as fund management. Earnings per share should show some recovery this
year, cutting the multiple below 13, while the yield is still more than 6
per cent. The rating looks well behind the times.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Buckingham Pounds 104m loss after property
write-down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buckingham International, the hotels and property group, yesterday reported
a pre-tax loss of Pounds 104m in the year to October 31, as a result of
massive write-downs on the value of its properties.
The result, on turnover of Pounds 55.4m (Pounds 58.5m), compared with a
Pounds 258,000 pre-tax profit last time.
The company completed a support plan in February, in the face of net
borrowings of Pounds 92.9m, and a fall in shareholders' funds from Pounds
112.6m to Pounds 3.15m. This represents gearing of almost 3,000 per cent.
Mr John Clark, chief executive, said yesterday that the support plan was
intact, in spite of the latest results.
However, Buckingham's bankers and Pounds 33m stock holders are still
insisting that debts remain payable upon demand, in order to continue to put
pressure on management to pursue its disposal programme.
The group's problems centre on rising debt and falling hotel values in the
US and Portugal.
Of the Pounds 103m exceptional charge, Pounds 95.7m was related to property
write-downs, of which more than 60 per cent was on Portuguese investments.
Buckingham has only tentative support from its creditors. Its survival
relies on the Inland Revenue allowing the postponement of Pounds 2.7m of tax
payments, and on the failure of an ongoing Pounds 12m legal claim against
the company.
Mr Clark admits that all this 'is necessarily uncertain'. The support plan
runs until October, when Buckingham hopes to refinance its debt.
Buckingham sold the Holiday Inn, Lisbon, and its nursing home division, for
a total of Pounds 16m. This was a significant component of the support plan.
The shares fell by 1 1/2 p to 4p yesterday, which compares with its 1991
high of 51 1/2 p.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Counterbids played down by possible
frontrunners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The buoyancy of Lasmo's share price yesterday suggested that the market is
either expecting Enterprise to raise its offer, or the arrival of a
counterbid.
The second possibility, however, was played down by many of the companies
rumoured to be planning a run at Lasmo.
British Gas, which made an unsuccessful bid for Lasmo in 1991, said it did
not 'comment on market rumour,' and was not planning to make any
announcements on the sub-ject.
Analysts in London dismissed the possibility of a bid from British Gas as
highly unlikely. This view was reinforced by yesterday's profits warning at
the annual meeting.
Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group which was privatised earlier this year,
also declined to comment. But industry observers in Paris played down the
possibility, pointing to Elf's debt-equity ratio of 48 per cent and the
strategy of its chairman, Mr Philippe Jaffre, who has given priority to the
reduction of borrowings.
'Elf is not in a financial position to bid for Lasmo,' said Mr Vincent Bazi,
head of research at Barings Securities in Paris.
Elf may, however, be seeking to restructure its relationship with Enterprise
Oil, in which it currently holds 10 per cent and with which it operates
Elf-Enterprise, a joint exploration and production company owned 66 per cent
by the French group.
Elf is thought to be considering selling its 10 per cent stake in Enterprise
and taking full control of the joint company. 'This would allow it to fully
consolidate cash flow from the company', said one industry observer.
Total, France's other large oil company, denied it was interested in Lasmo.
'We are not a buyer', the group said.
Total already has a strong presence in the North Sea and is expected to see
a sharp increase in production from new sites, particularly in Latin
America.
'They don't really need to reinforce upstream activities, their main
objective is to reinforce downstream and refining,' said one analyst.
Atlantic Richfield, the US oil company, would not comment on speculation
that it would also make a bid for Lasmo.

FT  29 APR 94 / Enterprise bids for Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Graham Hearne (right), chairman and chief executive of Enterprise Oil,
which has bid for rival explorer Lasmo, said Lasmo's Pounds 219m rights

FT  29 APR 94 / Bell's runs a neat whisky promotion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drinkers of Bell's whisky, Britain's favourite Scotch, are about to be made
an offer they cannot refuse. Their familiar tipple, which holds 20 per cent
of the market, will vanish from the shelves. In its place will come an
older, smoother, classier version, with all its constituent whiskies
guaranteed at least eight years old. The price - to begin with, anyway -
will remain the same.
Opinion is divided on whether this represents a fresh outbreak of price
warfare in the beleaguered whisky trade, or a rather neat marketing gimmick.
Discounting and special offers have been rife in the industry over the past
18 months. Guinness, which owns Bell's, saw a slight fall in its spirits
profits last year. Highland Distillers, owner of the number two UK brand
Famous Grouse, with 14 per cent of the market, claims to have been the only
producer not to have cut its prices.
On the other hand, it is unclear how much of the whisky in the Bell's blend
is less than eight years old at present. Guinness said yesterday: 'The
product has been changed very, very marginally. There could be an existing
bottle of Bell's which is eight years old. I wouldn't know.'
Industry analysts were inclined to agree. Ms Michelle Proud, drinks analyst
at NatWest Markets, said: 'I understand the extra cost of the whisky is
pretty marginal.'
However, the new whisky is claimed by Guinness to taste somewhat different
from the old, being designed to retain the loyalty of existing Bell's
drinkers while appealing to a wider market. If successful, it will allow
Guinness to increase prices, as the maintained price is only an introductory
offer.
Behind the launch is a concerted effort by Guinness to rejuvenate the Scotch
market on both sides of the Atlantic. The US and UK are the two largest
mature markets for the product. In both, Guinness says, young drinkers in
the 20-30 age range are not being recruited in sufficient numbers.
In the north-east US, Guinness plans to double its marketing expenditure
this year on Dewar's, its leading US brand. A similar onslaught is planned
for the UK. The new whisky, an analyst said yesterday, 'doesn't mean much in
itself if they don't get the advertising right'.

FT  29 APR 94 / Float values TeleWest at Pounds 1.7bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TeleWest, the largest cable television operator in Britain, yesterday
confirmed plans for a global share offering this summer which is likely to
place a value of about Pounds 1.7bn on the fast growing company.
The flotation, which had been widely expected, will be the first by a UK
cable group and highlights the sharply improved economics of companies
combining cable television and telephone service on one network.
Kleinwort Benson, which is advising TeleWest, has suggested that even on
conservative assumptions, the television side of the UK cable communications
industry should produce annual revenues of Pounds 1bn with
telecommunications adding a further Pounds 1.6bn by the end of the decade.
Mr Alan Michels, TeleWest's chief executive, emphasised yesterday that the
UK cable industry represents the first opportunity in the world to invest in
broadband networks that will act as 'information super-highways'.
These networks are expected to provide a highly cost effective delivery
system for a wide range of entertainment, communications, multi-media and
interactive services.
Under the proposals outlined yesterday new shares representing about an 18
per cent stake fully diluted in the expanded capital of TeleWest will be
sold through a placing and intermediaries offer on both sides of the
Atlantic. The placing is expected to raise about Pounds 300m in new funds to
continue building the group's franchise cable network.
TeleWest - a joint venture between TCI of Denver, the world's largest cable
operator, and US West, the American telephone company - expects to spend
Pounds 1.25bn by the end of 1998.
It owns and operates 16 cable franchises and has minority equity interests
in three other companies which own and operate another seven cable
franchises. In total the owned and affiliated franchises will eventually
cover 3.6m homes - with TeleWest's 'equity' interest set at 2.8m homes.
By the end of last year cable television was available to about 700,000 of
these homes of which roughly 25 per cent had signed up for cable television.
TeleWest intends to seek a full listing for its shares on the London Stock
Exchange and a registration of American Depository Shares on the Nasdaq.
A pathfinder prospectus is expected to be published in June and will be
followed by a three-week 'roadshow' presentation to institutions in Europe
and the US. Kleinwort Benson Securities and Goldman Sachs International are
acting as joint global co-ordinators for the offering.

FT  29 APR 94 / GM triples profits to Dollars 1.6bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors of the US, the world's largest vehicle maker, more than
tripled its net profit in the first quarter to Dollars 1.6bn (excluding
one-off charges) from Dollars 513m in the same quarter a year ago.
Net income totalled Dollars 854m, however, after a Dollars 758m charge for a
change in accounting rules for the cost of benefits to former or laid-off
employees. GM turnover rose by 8.5 per cent to Dollars 37.5bn (Dollars
34.6bn).
The group, which is recovering from three years of heavy losses between 1990
and 1992, remains the highest-cost vehicle maker in the US behind Chrysler
and Ford.
Its financial performance is improving, however, helped by the strength of
new vehicle demand in the US and restructuring of its North American
automotive operations, which have suffered huge losses for the past four
years.
Mr Jack Smith, chief executive, said the group's performance in the first
quarter had been 'strong, reflecting continued cost-reduction efforts,
improved productivity and a strong vehicle market'. GM accumulated net
losses of Dollars 29.9bn in the three years from 1990-92 and recovered to a
net profit of Dollars 2.5bn last year.
The GM workforce was cut to 688,000 in the first quarter of 1994 from
732,000 a year ago.
The group's battered North American automotive operations achieved a net
profit of Dollars 511m, before one-off charges, in the first quarter, a
Dollars 681m turnround from a loss of Dollars 170m a year ago. After a
Dollars 708m charge for accounting changes it still suffered a net loss of
Dollars 197m, however.
Mr Smith said that the North American automotive operations were key to
rebuilding the balance sheet. They were still on track to profitability at
the net income level in the whole of 1994 but were short of the profit
margins 'we are looking for in a strong sales environment'.
GM retail sales of cars and light trucks in the US jumped 19.6 per cent in a
market which rose by 18.3 per cent.
GM, which is the most profitable carmaker in Europe, increased its profits
significantly in its international operations to Dollars 425m, against
Dollars 141m a year ago.
Profits were more than doubled year-on-year both in Europe and in Latin
America.

FT  29 APR 94 / ICI ahead on rising sales volumes and cost cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rising sales volumes and restructuring benefits helped ICI post
first-quarter pre-tax profits of Pounds 93m, compared with Pounds 71m for
the first quarter of 1993.
The rise would have been at least Pounds 10m higher if exchange rates had
been constant, said Mr Alan Spall, ICI's finance director.
Sales rose from Pounds 2.08bn to Pounds 2.15bn, with half the gain coming
from higher volumes while prices remained under pressure, said Sir Denys
Henderson, chairman.
The results were in the middle of the range of City expectations and concern
over the inability to raise prices pushed the shares down 22p to 831p.
Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive, said that price rises were still patchy
but that further savings would be made during the year as the benefits of
reorganisations last year were realised.
Strong cash flow and a debt payment of more than Pounds 700m from Zeneca,
the pharmaceuticals group spun off last year, cut gearing during the quarter
to 11 per cent. Earnings per share rose from 5p to 6.1p.
Within the main divisions, trading profits at Paints were unchanged at
Pounds 17m with with higher profits in Asia-Pacific offset by a cold-weather
related decline in the US. In Materials, trading profits more than doubled
to Pounds 19m from Pounds 8m, mainly the result of cost reduction and the
contribution of the acrylics business acquired in July 1993. Higher volumes
were partially offset by lower selling prices, mainly in Europe.
In Explosives, where the company has a strong position in the car airbag
market, trading profit was Pounds 12m (against Pounds 3m), the increase
primarily because of gaining full control of AECI Explosives, its South
Africa subsidiary.
Industrial chemicals saw trading profits rise to Pounds 42m (Pounds 24m),
where recent capital investments had led to lower fixed costs and improved
profit margins.
Mr Hampel said further disposals were likely as ICI reorganised in the wake
of the demerger last summer from drugs groups Zeneca.
'I have the greatest long-term question mark over the polyester film
business,' he said, adding that he could 'see the ownership changing' of the
company's petrochemicals operations. On acquisitions, he said there were no
large deals planned, but there would be a stream of smaller deals.

FT  29 APR 94 / Forte faces delay on Meridien decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Air France, the state-owned airline, yesterday announced that it is to delay
a decision on the sale of its Meridien hotel chain which is at the centre of
a fierce battle for control between Accor of France and Forte of the UK,
which has made the higher bid.
The airline said it had sent the Forte and Accor bids to the privatisation
commission, an independent body which advises the French government on
privatisation issues. It said a final decision, which had been expected at
yesterday's board meeting, should be made soon.
The statement was seen on both side of the Channel as evidence of the strong
pressure being exerted on Air France not to sell the chain, in which it has
a 57 per cent stake, to a non-French buyer.
A minority shareholder in Meridien said yesterday: 'We've been appalled at
the clear political pressures that have been brought to bear that have
nothing to do with the economics of the bid.'
Air France confirmed yesterday that it suffered losses of FFr8.48bn (Pounds
990m) last year, the biggest in its history and almost three times the
deficit of FFr3.3bn recorded in 1992.
The sale of a controlling stake in Meridien is an important element of a
rescue package for the airline.
This would also include a FFr20bn capital injection from the French
government, which would require European Commission approval.
Industry observers in Paris argue that a decision to accept a lower bid
could add to resistance in Brussels to the capital increase.
A reference to the privatisation commission is part of the procedure for the
selling off of state assets. However, hotel industry observers said that the
Air France board could have expressed a preference for one of the bidders
and referred only its offer to the commission.
The board eliminated from the contest a third potential buyer, Kempinski,
the German hotel group, but declined to come down in favour of either Forte
or Accor.
Meridien said this week that it favoured the approach from Forte, which
values the chain at FFr1.8bn.
Accor, which has joined up with Prince Al Waleed of Saudi Arabia, has made a
bid which values Meridien at about FFr1.6bn. It argues that its offer would
keep Meridien in French hands and that it would ensure a flow of business to
Air France, thereby aiding its recovery.
Some owners of hotels managed by Meridien are believed to have warned Air
France that they would attempt to cancel the management contracts if Accor
won control of the chain.

FT  29 APR 94 / UK bank takes 5% Swissair stake for 'mystery investors'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A British bank has accumulated a 5 per cent stake in Swissair, Switzerland's
flag carrier, worth nearly SFr100m (Pounds 46.5m), on behalf of what
Swissair calls 'mystery investors'.
The accumulation of the block of shares comes at a time when Swissair is
warning that its longer term future is in jeopardy because of Switzerland's
isolation from the European Union.
Mr Otto Loepfe, chief executive, told the group's annual press conference
yesterday: 'In the end, it may well be Switzerland's integration into, or
isolation from, the European Union that determines our own corporate
survival.'
Switzerland's decision in December 1992 to stay outside of the European
Economic Area means that Swissair cannot take advantage of the new
liberalised single European airline market.
Mr Loepfe denied that British Airways was the mystery buyer of the shares.
Mr Peter Nydegger, finance director, conceded that the airline was 'not very
comfortable' with the purchases.
Swissair restricts any single shareholder to 3 per cent of the votes. Also,
non-Swiss citizens may not hold more than 40 per cent in aggregate, and
nominees may not vote.
The airline, which has already reported a 48 per cent decline in 1993 net
income to SFr59m and passed its annual dividend, has seen its registered
shares tumble from a peak of SFr1,176 in 1989 to a low of SFr420 last
December. They have since recovered to the SFr785 level.
The group, which said its flight operations were improving but would
continue losing money in 1994 for the fifth consecutive year, is still
struggling to develop a strategy for long term survival.
Following the collapse last November of its planned merger with Scandinavian
Airlines System, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Austrian Airlines, Swissair
said it was seeking to intensify its commercial links with SAS and Austrian
in Europe and with Delta Air Lines and Singapore Airlines in the long-haul
market.
The group, which has more than SFr2bn in liquid reserves, has concentrated
on expanding its non-flight business in the EU.
It is in negotiations to acquire SAS's airline catering operations to turn
its own catering subsidiary into the world's third largest.

FT  29 APR 94 / Israel and PLO agree pact date: Landmark deal on Palestinian
self-rule to be signed next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday appeared to end
months of bitter wrangling by agreeing to meet next Wednesday in Cairo to
sign a landmark Palestinian self-rule agreement.
The agreement on self-rule in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank enclave
of Jericho was originally supposed to have been signed last December 13. The
breakthrough came in a meeting in Cairo between President Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt, Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli
foreign minister, and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state.
The agreement signals the beginning of the end of more than a quarter of a
century of Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and could prove to be the
first step towards an independent Palestinian state. It could also speed up
progress towards a comprehensive Middle East peace agreement between Israel
and neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.
'For us it is the end of a long voyage and the beginning of a new chapter in
the relations between the Palestinian people and ourselves, adding another
footstep to peace in the Middle East,' Mr Peres said yesterday.
Mr Christopher, who is on a Middle East tour, said he was impressed by 'the
sense of urgency that both sides now have on reaching a conclusion on this
implementation agreement'. He will cancel engagements in Europe and extend
his regional tour to attend the signing ceremony between Mr Arafat and Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister.
Mr Mubarak said Mr Rabin would attend a pre-signing summit with Mr Arafat in
Cairo on Tuesday evening. The two leaders face two outstanding issues: the
final size of the Jericho enclave; and whether Israel will allow the PLO to
station Palestinian policemen on the Allenby bridge border crossing between
Jordan and the West Bank.
Several other issues remain to be resolved, including the extent of
jurisdiction of Palestinian courts, the security zoning arrangements for the
Gaza Strip, and the composition of an 18-member interim Palestinian National
Authority led by Mr Arafat which will govern Gaza-Jericho before elections.
It is also unclear whether the Palestinians will have symbols of sovereignty
such as the right to issue their own stamps, travel documents and currency,
and have their own international dialling code. However, both sides have
said they are prepared to overlook these issues to allow next Wednesday's
signing ceremony to go ahead.
Mr Christopher said the conclusion of the agreement 'creates an important
sense of momentum' for talks between Israel and Syria. Israeli officials
hope Mr Christopher will shuttle between Damascus and Jerusalem with new
Israeli proposals which focus on security issues and a three-stage Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights over a number of years.

FT  29 APR 94 / S Africa poll extended by one day for some after criticisms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Voting in South Africa's first all-race election was yesterday extended by
the country's interim executive into today in some regions.
The decision followed widespread criticism prompted by organisational
difficulties in what had been planned as a three-day poll.
Officials of all main parties expressed concern about shortages of ballot
papers and other election materials, particularly in many of the former
black 'homelands'. Judge Johann Kriegler, head of the Independent Electoral
Commission, the body charged with organising the elections, admitted that
there had been a 'substantial inadequacy' of voting supplies.
At his request, the ruling Transitional Executive Council gave permission
for an extra day of voting in the affected areas.
'We must be able to say that all South Africans who want to vote are given
the opportunity,' said President FW de Klerk. Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi,
leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, who on Wednesday had threatened to pull
out of the election unless the problems were solved, said the decision
'would go a long way towards allaying the fears of many people about the
election as a whole'.
However, he maintained there were still 'many irregularities, gross
irregularities' and left open the possibility of later withdrawal from the
poll. 'It doesn't seem likely that it is going to be free and fair,' he
said.
Earlier Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, claimed the delays in
distribution were the result of 'massive sabotage' to prevent voting
supplies being delivered to black areas. ANC officials later played down the
comments, attributing them to frustration with the slow progress.
The areas most affected were the former homelands of Lebowa, Venda and
Gazankulu in the northern Transvaal, the Transkei in the eastern Cape, and
KwaZulu in Natal, where in many places some polling stations had still not
received sufficient ballot papers and other voting supplies by last night
when voting was scheduled to end. Polling booths in all these regions will
remain open all day today to compensate for the delays.
Counting of votes, which had been due to begin today, will now commence
tomorrow morning. Full results are not expected until Monday, though
computer projections may appear earlier.
Millions of newly printed ballots were airlifted out to remote areas in
military aircraft to meet the extra demand. But party officials and foreign
observers were uneasy about the adequacy of security for the distribution of
ballot papers, and stressed the need for an accurate tally both of ballots
delivered and votes cast.
In most of the country, however, the queues of Wednesday dwindled yesterday
as the electoral commission managed to sort out many of the problems. The
dramatic fall-off in inter-party violence was sustained.

FT  29 APR 94 / Life sales customers set for Pounds 1bn boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fiercer competition among life insurers, arising from new requirements on
sales agents to provide more information about their pay and products, is
likely to benefit customers by Pounds 1bn a year, research published
yesterday concludes.
The report coincided with the publication by the Securities and Investments
Board, the City's chief regulator, of the final format for the documents
sales agents must provide for their clients, together with guidance to help
companies comply with the rules on disclosure.
The life industry has been expecting for some time to have to disclose more
information on products and commissions. But many companies have argued that
until the detailed requirements set out yesterday became available, they
could not carry out much of the work necessary to adapt to the new regime.
Companies have until the beginning of next year before they are required to
adopt the new rules and documentation, but regulators hope that competitive
pressures will encourage some insurers to volunteer the information later
this year.
While one or two companies have indicated that they expect to be able to
meet the new requirements well before then, many face an extensive task
which will include redesigning their products to make the 'up front'
commission costs lower and policies more attractive.
The study carried out by consultancy firm National Economic Research
Associates found that consumers were likely to benefit by about Pounds 1bn a
year from lower charges and reduced sales, notably of policies which lapse
early, together with more unquantifiable advantages such as being better
able to take decisions on an informed basis.
The costs to the industry of implementing the new regime were estimated at
Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m a year for the first 10 years.
Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, emphasised the significance of a single
regulatory organisation to protect the private investor, ensuring that
companies adopted the new requirements. 'Regulators have got to ensure that
the new regime is adequately complied with,' he said.
The SIB has said it intends to recognise as a regulator the Personal
Investment Authority, which will take over retail financial services
regulation in July.

until it had all gone. Cable television companies promise to do much the
same. The streetwise investor should recoil in horror at any company which
starts pontificating about the definition of profit on being asked when it
will first make one. TeleWest, which is seeking some Pounds 300m from a
flotation, conjures up any number of theoretical answers.
The proposition is that cable companies can be given a stock market worth on
the basis of the net present value of future cash flows. Similar theories
have been used to justify the flotations of other enterprises, such as
biotechnology stocks, Eurotunnel and Vodafone. It is perhaps in the nature
of such investments that immense initial scepticism is followed by frantic
buying at the first whiff of profit.
UK cable companies could prove especially attractive given their rare
ability to combine both telephone and television services. The costs of
building networks are substantially higher than in the US but then so are
the possible revenue streams. There are big and largely unquantifiable
risks. If BT were ever unchained, it could wreck the industry almost
overnight. But TeleWest, at least, may be conservatively valued to discount
most risks and attract supporters. Its giant US parents hardly need the
cash. Their chief consideration seems political. A quoted UK company should
have more influence in the regulatory debate than distant US corporations.

FT  29 APR 94 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After a first quarter disrupted by storm and earthquake it was anybody's
guess where the US growth rate was going to settle. At first glance,
yesterday's figure of 2.6 per cent looks on the low side, but there is
little in the detail to deflect the Federal Reserve from further tightening.
Admittedly first-quarter growth was fuelled by a build-up of inventories,
especially in the auto sector. That may not last. Net exports are a drag,
but that reflects economic weakness abroad. At home, consumer demand remains
quite strong. The slowdown in residential construction was almost certainly
weather-related. If one assumes government spending will recover in the
second quarter as it did last year, the growth rate could easily snap back
over 3 per cent. On top of that the GDP deflator is now back at 2.6 per
cent.
Small wonder the bond market turned down as it digested the figures. With
the long bond yield having fallen back to around 7.1 per cent, the recent
rally was due for a correction anyway. More striking is that the prospect of
higher short term interest rates did nothing to revive the dollar. The US
current account deficit and capital outflows as US investors diversify their
portfolios combine to hold it back. Currency investors who started the year
long must be losing heart. If they sell, the dollar could fall further. That
would only worry the bond market more.

FT  29 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Life assurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market was quick to appreciate the danger last summer when the
Treasury told life assurance companies to stop stalling over commission
disclosure. The sector has since underperformed by 20 per cent. Research by
the Securities and Investments Board suggests this was not an over-reaction.
The anticipated 10 per cent drop in sales as a result of disclosure would be
a sharp reversal of fortune from the boom years of the 1980s. Since the UK
already spends more on life assurance in relation to national income than
any other OECD country, a bounce in sales thereafter cannot be taken for
granted.
The pain will not be spread evenly. Companies with low expenses and
distribution costs might actually benefit in the longer term. The new rules
may thus contribute to the onward march of bancassurance. With almost 200
life companies serving a working population of 25m, rationalisation is
overdue. But the Pounds 1bn annual cost-saving predicted by SIB's research
will only be delivered if commissions actually fall. That will not happen if
consumers simply buy less life insurance. For market forces to have the
desired effect, they also need to use the additional information to shop
around.
Both SIB and the Personal Investment Authority - should it get off the
ground - are reluctant to regulate commissions directly. Under current
legislation they may not have the authority to do so. Unless disclosure
brings about a real reduction in costs and commissions, though, the argument
in favour of the direct approach will be greatly strengthened.

FT  29 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Big boys' game
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil has a long way to go before convincing the market that its
bid for Lasmo makes sense. None of the reasons produced yesterday by Mr
Graham Hearne, Enterprise's chairman, was persuasive. He argued that
Enterprise's stronger balance sheet would enable it to accelerate the
exploitation of Lasmo's assets but could not give a single example of an
asset which should be developed more quickly. He said Lasmo's management
would not be able to deliver shareholder value but could not spell out what
the company's management deficiencies were. Finally, he argued it was
necessary to be one of the 'big boys' to flourish in the world oil industry
but was vague when pressed to elaborate on what opportunities would be
missed by two smaller groups.
It is more difficult to quibble with the bid price. Enterprise seems to be
neither underpaying nor overpaying for Lasmo's assets, though the valuation
depends heavily on oil price expectations. The snag is that Lasmo
shareholders are unlikely to sell at the offer price, which was worth just
over 140p last night, following the slide in Enterprise's share price. But
Enterprise shareholders would not benefit if Mr Hearne was then tempted to
increase the bid and so overpaid for his rival.
Enterprise will not escape from this bind unless it can produce better
arguments showing there is value in putting the two companies together. In
their absence, shareholders will conclude that Mr Hearne has been swept away
by his ambition to sit at the same table as the likes of BP and Mobil. They
would then see no point in swapping shares in two smaller groups for a stake
in a big boy.

FT  29 APR 94 / Criticism brings extra poll day for some in S African
election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's interim executive yesterday responded to widespread criticism
prompted by organisational problems in the first all-race election by
extending the voting into an unscheduled fourth day in several parts of the
country today.
Officials of all main parties expressed concern about shortages of ballot
papers and other election materials, particularly in many of the former
black 'homelands'. Judge Johann Kriegler, head of the Independent Electoral
Commission, the body charged with organising the elections, admitted that
there had been a 'substantial inadequacy' of voting supplies.
At his request, the ruling Transitional Executive Council gave permission
for an extra day of voting in the affected areas.
'We must be able to say that all South Africans who want to vote are given
the opportunity,' said President FW de Klerk. 'We've got to make this
election work for all the people.' Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the
Inkatha Freedom party, who on Wednesday had threatened to pull out of the
election unless the problems were solved, said the decision 'would go a long
way towards allaying the fears of many people about the election as a
whole'.
However, he maintained there were still 'many irregularities, gross
irregularities' and left open the possibility of later withdrawal from the
poll. 'It doesn't seem likely that it is going to be free and fair,' he
said.
Earlier Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, claimed the delays in
distribution were the result of 'massive sabotage' to prevent voting
supplies being delivered to black areas. ANC officials later played down the
comments, attributing them to frustration with the slow progress.
The areas most affected were the former homelands of Lebowa, Venda and
Gazankulu in the northern Transvaal, the Transkei in the eastern Cape, and
KwaZulu in Natal, where in many places some polling stations had still not
received sufficient ballot papers and other voting supplies by last night
when voting was scheduled to end. Polling booths in all these regions will
remain open all day today to compensate for the delays.
Counting of votes, which had been due to begin today, will now commence
tomorrow morning. Full results are not expected until Monday, though
computer projections may appear earlier.
Millions of newly printed ballots were airlifted out to remote areas in
military aircraft to meet the extra demand. But party officials and foreign
observers were uneasy about the adequacy of security for the distribution of
ballot papers, and stressed the need for an accurate tally both of ballots
delivered and votes cast.
In most of the country, however, the queues of Wednesday dwindled yesterday
as the electoral commission managed to sort out many of the problems. The
dramatic fall-off in inter-party violence was sustained.

FT  29 APR 94 / Tories fail to reach truce on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative efforts to forge a truce on Europe until after the European
parliament elections have broken down in the face of growing backbench
scepticism about the government's ability to roll back the tide of
federalism.
Rightwing backbenchers say a recent plea by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, for the party to end its 'lunatic' argument on the European Union
has been fatally undermined by a Euro-sceptic surge among constituency
activists.
Some say the shift was triggered by the retreat by the prime minister, Mr
John Major, on the EU's qualified majority voting system. Others say
Conservative activists are becoming concerned about the growing powers
delegated to the European parliament by last year's Maastricht treaty.
There is also concern about reports that France and Germany are backing Mr
Jean-Luc Dehaene, the federalist Belgian prime minister, to replace Mr
Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission.
Party leaders had hopedthe divisions would be contained by Mr Major's
promise to build a free-market Europe of nation states.
The promise, in an Economist article last autumn, was the basis for an as
yet unpublished compromise manifesto for the elections, which is intended to
heal the rift on Europe.
Rightwingers, however, say the party is moving away from Europe so fast that
compromise will be delivered only by an unlikely Tory triumph in the
elections.
Heavy Tory losses would put pressure on Mr Major to adopt an aggressively
Euro-sceptic stance, they say. 'The morale of the party faithful will be at
rock bottom, and our only hope at the next election will be to offer a
distinctive position on Europe,' said a leading Euro-sceptic.
The growing confidence of the Euro-sceptics appeared to lie behind reports,
dismissed as 'nonsense' by Downing Street, that Mr Major was considering a
referendum on continued British membership of the EU.
A well-informed rightwinger said the government was considering using the
threat of a referendum to head off further progress towards a federal Europe
at the 1996 intergovernmental review of the union.
Such a ploy would be welcomed by the right, which believes the other 11
member states would not bow to British doubts, and that Mr Major would have
to call a referendum.

FT  29 APR 94 / On a wing and a prayer: Peter Norman examines the deputy
governor's plans for Bank of England management restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, could have something
concrete to celebrate to mark his first year in office on July 1.
If all goes according to plan, the Bank will have put into operation a new
management structure designed to help it respond better to rapid change in
global financial markets and pursue its two main objectives of monetary and
financial stability.
The restructuring project has been the responsibility of Mr Rupert
Pennant-Rea, the former editor of the Economist appointed deputy governor
last July. Early in December, the Bank had a weekend brain-storming session
about its future at Ashridge management college near London. After five
months of planning in three working groups, and extensive consultation
inside the Bank, Mr Pennant-Rea yesterday outlined his proposals to the
Financial Times as the first details were being disclosed to Bank staff in
The Bank Fortnight, a staff newspaper.
The planned management changes still have some hurdles to clear, including
approval by the Bank's Court which advises the management on policy. Some
details are still unclear, notably the proposals for a revised staffing
structure. But the shake-up proposals, which insiders say will be more
radical than anything seen in Threadneedle Street since 1980, are moving
into a high gear. Directors will be giving presentations to the staff this
week. It is hoped that the new 'organogram' will be agreed by mid-May so
that the Bank's operations can be grouped into two broad 'wings' by July 1.
If agreed, the internal restructuring will come after a hectic two years in
which the Bank has bounced back from the humiliation of Britain's forced
exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 and has
been able to carve out significantly greater influence over monetary and
economic policy.
The Bank now produces a quarterly inflation report, which it publishes
without censorship by the Treasury. It has been given discretion over the
precise timing of interest rate cuts. Since earlier this month, the views of
the governor and chancellor in their regular monthly meetings have been
published after a short delay, giving the Bank extra clout in the debate
over interest rate decisions.
The restructuring will also take effect only weeks after the Old Lady has
celebrated her tercentenary. But if the changes symbolise anything, it is
the emergence of a leaner, fitter and more professional Bank, reflecting Mr
George's 32 years of service, his no-nonsense personality and his determined
pursuit of the twin goals of lasting low inflation and a solid financial
system in Britain.
The reforms will group the Bank's activities under two equally important
wings: one to secure monetary stability and one to make secure the financial
system. These will replace the Bank's present tangled allocation of
responsibilities in which the markets area, economics, international
activities, banking supervision and the banking department have all been
self-contained departments or divisions.
The Bank will continue to have four executive directors below the governor
and his deputy. But whereas each has run his own department until now, in
future two will be responsible for the running of each wing.
At first sight, the functional responsibilities of the executive directors
do not seem to change greatly. Mr Ian Plenderleith will contine to head
monetary operations and Mr Mervyn King, the Bank's chief economist, will be
responsible for analysis in the monetary stability wing.
In the financial stability wing, Mr Brian Quinn will be in overall charge of
regulation, supervision and surveillance, with the aim of achieving what Mr
Pennant-Rea calls 'stability and soundness' in the financial system. There
would be some tidying up of anomalies, with Mr Quinn taking control of the
supervisors of wholesale money markets and gilt-edged market makers, which
at present report to Mr Plenderleith.
Mr Pen Kent will be put in charge of 'financial infrastructure', meaning
that he would remain in charge of finance for industry, the financial
markets and institutions division, and Crest, the Bank's programme for a
stock exchange settlement system. The official purpose of Mr Kent's part of
the wing will be to boost the efficiency and competitiveness of the UK
financial sector.
The proposed restructuring is intended to bring the Bank's operational and
analytical work closer together. An important motive is the wish to make the
Bank more adept at spotting dangerous trends in the world economy and
financial markets. As the markets become more integrated, it makes little
sense for the Bank to maintain a segmented structure. The planned
reorganisation also recognises that the international aspects of monetary
policy and financial supervision should not be handled separately.
The Bank's international division will no longer exist as a separate entity.
Such a move has been on the cards since the start of this year when there
was no immediate replacement for Mr Andrew Crockett, who resigned as an
executive director to take over as general manager at the Basle-based Bank
for International Settlements.
However, getting rid of the international division is bound to be
controversial. No other comparable central bank has shown an urge to take
such a step. But Mr Pennant-Rea argued yesterday that this was necessary to
ensure that the Bank's international work was 'absolutely plugged into' its
dual monetary and financial objectives.
In the past, international staff have tended to become detached from the
main work of the Bank. With huge financial flows passing through London and
more than 500 foreign banks in the City, this is something the Bank cannot
afford.
In future, senior Bank people from the governor down will be directly
involved in international representation, according to their subject matter
or expertise. Mr King, for example, will be the Bank's key man on issues
relating to economic policy co-ordination in the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries and on matters relating to the European Monetary
System. Mr Quinn will take the lead on international co-ordination of
supervisory issues. Significantly, given past traumas for the Bank, such as
the BCCI affair, the bulk of the international staff will be transferred to
Mr Quinn's department.
Each of the two wings will have what Mr Pennant-Rea calls a 'wing liaison
function' which will 'act as a lynchpin between the operations and analysis
segments of the wings'. The wing liaison staff, already dubbed 'Wincos' by
some wags after the handle-bar moustached RAF wing commanders of the second
world war, would be crucial to cutting out duplication of effort and making
the system work.
A new management layer - that of deputy director - will be created for the
top five people below the executive. These, according to Mr Pennant-Rea,
will be key senior appointments of people who would be expected to take on a
lot of the responsibilities of the executive directors. One hope of the
deputy governor is that the reorganisation will gradually alter the culture
of the bank 'to create a stronger sense of involvement and common purpose
among the staff'. That means more accountability for their actions and
greater flexibility to ensure that the Bank has the right resources in the
right place.
Greater flexibility is often a euphemism for downsizing. But that is not a
reason for the present restructuring. The bank has been cutting staff
steadily for some years, dropping to just under 4,000 from 7,500 in 1979.
Mr Pennant-Rea says: 'We will be better at formulating monetary advice;
better at executing the monetary policy decisions of the chancellor; better
at carrying out our banking responsibilities and much better at anticipating
some of the big glacial-like changes that happen in the financial world.
Those are huge prizes.'
But huge prizes generally involve large risks. The Bank has a blueprint for
the start of its fourth century, but this will only work if it carries all
its staff with it.

New heights in sophisticated advertising have been scaled by a firm of
London solicitors, Maurice Cohen &amp; Co. Specialists in immigration law, the
firm has taken a poster site directly opposite the immigration offices in
Croydon. 'No Joy?' the poster asks rhetorically. It then explains that
anyone having trouble should call the firm for legal advice.
Trouble is, the most notorious deportation case in the public gaze in
Britain today concerns Joy Gardner, who died in December 1993 after being
manhandled by police serving her with a deportation notice. The police
involved have now been charged with manslaughter.
'It's not meant to be a reference to Joy Gardner,' says Maurice Cohen,
adding that the agency responsible for the 'eye-catching' ad is called Hype.

Before abolishing the two self-regulatory organisations Lautro and Fimbra
when it establishes the dreaded Personal Investment Authority, it is obliged
to listen to representations from all those with a lingering fondness for
the supervisor they know. Two retired judges are hearing submissions, and
the SIB has thoughtfully equipped participants with some 'procedural
guidance'.
'Although the hearings are not intended to have needless formality,' the
blurb runs, 'the appointed persons may be addressed appropriately as

Booth should be addressed as Dame Margaret.' You don't say.

It has not taken British Gas's new chairman Richard Giordano long to get
into the swing.
Giordano arrived too late to have the pleasure of jousting with Sir James
McKinnon, Clare Spottiswoode's combative predecessor at Ofgas, but he
certainly seems to have inherited a dose of the corporate hostility towards
the man.
When a shareholder at yesterday's agm raised the subject of McKinnon's
appearance on the board of rival gas company Calor, he admitted to sharing
the questioner's outrage.
But then, the benefit of McKinnon's knowledge of gas would not necessarily
get Calor all that far. 'Some of us did not think it very high,' he
remarked.

Were any sights in South Africa's election more touching than the spectacle
of a kind young lady apparently guiding an elderly black gentleman to the
polling booth?
Protective arm outstretched, she smiled proudly as he managed - without much
assistance - to drop his vote in the ballot box. Such was her devotion that
even hard-bitten photographers and television crews were unable to separate
them.

Who should carry the can for the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia?
For historians of the esoteric, Karol Wojtyla - also known as John Paul II -
is high on the list of suspects.
His culpability was scrutinised in London yesterday at the Royal Institute
for International Affairs. The case for the prosecution is that in June 1991
His Holiness allegedly egged on Catholic Croats and Slovenes to separate
themselves from Orthodox Serbs. A diplomatic campaign, partly waged through
the German press, was then conducted to secure international recognition of
their independence.
Nonsense, says Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, papal Secretary for Relations
with States - foreign minister for short. John Paul II 'never pressed for
the disintegration' but instead 'suggested democratic openings within the
constitutional framework'. Moreover, 'in messages to all the leaders of the
republics seeking independence . . .the Holy See considered it desirable
that a form of confederation be preserved', only changing its mind after the
federal army began attacking Croat and Slovene civilians.
Up piped Misha Gavrilovic, of the Serb Information Office. Yugoslavia 'was
and is . . .a federation'. Papal calls for a confederation mean the Pope
advocates Yugoslav dissolution. 'Federation, I meant,' replied Tauran, who
must be hoping his next posting is not Belgrade.

FT  29 APR 94 / Leading Article: Euro-networks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last December Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, won
qualified approval from EU government leaders for a long-term plan to
integrate the region's transport, energy and telecommunications networks. Mr
Delors argues that such trans-European networks are needed because the EU's
single market will be incomplete while its infrastructure remains fragmented
along national lines.
Mr Delors is right in his diagnosis. However, his chosen remedy, an
ambitious programme of trans-border official co-operation backed by public
expenditure totalling Ecu400bn, looks misconceived. As currently envisaged,
it risks proving a wasteful irrelevance, and could even make unattainable
the very goal it sets out to achieve.
The reason is that the networks the programme aims to integrate are mostly
operated by monopolies, which have long enjoyed immunity from competition in
return for staying within national or regional borders. It is their
introverted attitudes and stubborn determination to cling to historic
privileges and captive markets - not the existence of national borders per
se - which pose the biggest obstacle to a true single market in Europe.
That is clear from the fact the liberalisation has encountered most
resistance in areas traditionally dominated by national monopolies. Even in
air transport, where progress has been greatest, France has reneged on its
commitments by keeping Orly airport closed to competition. In
telecommunications services, no real liberalisation is planned before 1998,
while in energy there has been almost no movement at all.
That is not for lack of prodding by the Commission, which showed commendable
firmness this week in ordering France to open up Orly. Brussels' call for
full liberalisation of mobile telecommunications is also a positive step. It
is, however, a sorry fact that even in this area, where a pan-European
service was planned from the outset, its achievement has been blocked by
national policy and technical differences.
It is regrettable that the Commission's powers to act against state
monopolies are less than clear-cut. They may have been further clouded by a
European Court decision this week upholding a Dutch energy utility's
monopoly-selling arrangements. Nonetheless, it is vital that Brussels
continues to seek ways to promote competition. One would be to advance the
date for full liberalisation of telecommunications.
Failure to keep up the attack on monopolies will enable them to hi-jack the
trans-European networks plan, at the expense of the rest of the economy.
Truly open markets, by contrast, could render such a grand,
officially-planned scheme unnecessary by stimulating service providers
spontaneously to innovate, compete and collaborate across borders. Unless
preceded by vigorous liberalisation, Mr Delors' blueprint for further
integration will remain an empty dream.

FT  29 APR 94 / Leading Article: Come clean, Mr Berlusconi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, who yesterday was asked officially to form the new
Italian government, does not seem yet to have fully grasped the implications
of his sudden transformation from successful businessman to successful
politician. He has accepted only under pressure, rather than spontaneously,
the need to place his business empire in an arm's length trust for the
duration of his term of office; and he has not accepted at all the need to
make public what exactly that empire consists of or how its ownership is
structured.
Some of his compatriots will sympathise instinctively with this attitude. A
certain discretion about one's assets and balance-sheet is not considered
unethical in Italy. But a prime minister, and more especially one who has
just been elected offering a clean break with the old, corrupt political
system, cannot take the same attitude to the tax system as an ordinary
private businessman. It is his job to see that the state receives its due
revenues and that its accounts add up.
The notion of 'conflict of interest', familiar in English-speaking
countries, is less so in Italy where businessmen have traditionally used
political connections, and politicians used business connections, to make
money. But Mr Berlusconi's rise to power is the direct result of a national
revulsion against the extremes to which that ethos had been carried by the
established political class. If the notion of a clean break means anything
at all, it should mean that from now on public and private interests will be
kept firmly separate.
That is even more important in Mr Berlusconi's case because of the nature of
his business, or rather of one of his businesses. Many people regarded the
concentration of media ownership in his hands as excessive and unhealthy
even before he went into politics, and when he did so his opponents not
unnaturally claimed that it gave him an unfair advantage. That such power
should be combined with control of the state is hardly compatible with
democracy, since it would allow its holder to impede the access of his
opponents to the public ear and eye.
The right course for Mr Berlusconi is not to react defensively to such
arguments, but to take the initiative. He could and should set a timetable
to divest himself of parts of his empire, such as the Standa supermarket
chain, by selling them on the open (which must mean the international)
market.
To do that with his media interests would be more difficult, given
prevailing uncertainty about the legal framework in which they will operate.
(The present legislation may be overturned by referendum.) Here, Mr
Berlusconi should turn his interests over to trustees of unimpeachable
integrity and propose himself a new media ownership law to make such
concentrations impossible in the future. If he does that, Italians will know
that they are indeed entering a new era, and can do so with pride.

FT  29 APR 94 / Personal View: A vicious circle of social kindness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY DE JASAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployment in the industrialised west is now clearly endemic and not
cyclical as in the past. No reversal appears in prospect. At best the next
few years will bring a minor rise in employment, at worst a further fall.
In the search for an explanation and cure, many old - but unsatisfactory -
chestnuts are trotted out: a deep technological transformation is taking
place (it always is); world trade has become too free and not fair enough
(but freer trade, surely, brings greater riches?); or labour markets are too
rigid and training inadequate (but did not the same apply 20 years ago?)
There may, however, be a different explanation for high unemployment in
modern, redistributive democracies.
This is best illustrated with a simplified example. Imagine an economy where
income comes from only two sources - profits and wages. Rents are
negligible, and there is full employment. If the government wished to
redistribute income in favour of wage earners, it would tax employers'
profits and add the money raised to wages.
The natural response would be for employers to cut the wages they offer  -
and for employees to demand less. Consequently, the impact in terms of
redistribution would be negligible and harmless: there would be no
unemployment created and after-tax, after-subsidy incomes would remain
unchanged.
But imagine that instead of transferring money, the government offered
employees a basket of 'social protection' - insurance against illness,
unemployment, or destitution in old age. If we make the (large) assumption
that collecting the tax and distributing it in the form of social protection
are costless, the effect on the demand and supply of labour would depend on
the difference between the cost of the package and the value attached to it
by recipients.
At first sight, it would appear that employees would attach great value to
social protection: reaction to proposals for curtailing benefits is usually
virulent. But that is because most wage-earners are under the illusion that
the greater part of the 'insurance premium' is being paid by someone other
than themselves.
If wage earners understood that, ultimately, the cost had to be borne out of
their own wages, would they prefer to have the 'social protection' on offer
 -or would they rather buy some private insurance, save some, and spend the
rest?
There is a strong paternalistic argument for saying that wage-earners should
not be given such a choice - improvidence would make many take the money and
'blow it'. But the important point is that 'social protection' costs more
than it is worth to at least some of those that it protects.
The result is that, at the margin, employment is taxed more than the subsidy
is worth to workers. The two no longer cancel out and there is a net extra
burden on the economy. Enterprises have to 'restructure' and unemployment is
born of 'social protection'.
Worse, a vicious circle comes into operation. The initial unemployment
created by the tax-subsidy inequality increases the amount of 'social
protection' that has to be handed out.
That extra cost results in a further increase in the tax on employment,
widening the gap between the non-wage costs of labour and the value of the
benefits in kind. Demand for labour is further depressed relative to its
supply, more unemployment is created and the cycle is repeated.
Under an optimistic scenario, non-cyclical unemployment would stabilise, at
some point, at a level that society would have to support indefinitely. But
under a pessi-mistic scenario the rise in unemployment would prove
inexorable.
There is empirical evidence to lend weight to such a theory. Comparisons
across countries show a high correlation between cyclically-corrected
unemployment and 'social protection' expressed as a share of national
income. Unemployment in Europe, where the welfare system is more costly per
head, is twice as high as in the US and many times higher than in east Asia.
Within post-Maastricht Europe, unemployment is worse in the centre than on
its periphery, and the more 'social' the country, the more it is plagued.
Democracies, we are told, cannot relax social protection. Are they, then,
condemned to smother the young and the long-term unemployed with their
caring kindness?

FT  29 APR 94 / Leading Article: Iran accused
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and its main allies have been at odds for more than a year about how
to handle Iran. For the Clinton administration the issue has been fairly cut
and dried. It asserted that the Iranian government sponsored international
terrorism, was seeking to acquire nuclear weapons and wished to undermine
stability in the Middle East. Accordingly, the US enunciated a
'dual-containment' policy designed to isolate Iran, and Iraq, and to deny
those two countries the benefits of economic relations with the
industrialised world.
Most Western European countries and Japan, while wary of Iranian intentions,
have resisted US pressure to follow its lead. In part their reasons have
been straightforwardly commercial. Iran is an important trading partner, and
at a time of international recession there was an understandable reluctance
to close off a profitable market.
On the political level there is a continuing debate about the composition
and intentions of the Iranian regime. President Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani
appears to represent the more pragmatic face of the government, seeking
better relations with the west and supporting market-oriented reforms at
home. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the spiritual leader, appears on the other
hand to be more in the mould of his predecessor, Ayatollah Khomeini. Whether
they are the two sides of the same coin, or represent opposing political
trends in Iran, has yet to be satisfactorily answered.
Britain's accusation yesterday that Iran has established contacts with the
IRA, and perhaps with other international terrorist groups, suggests support
for the US interpretation. At best, it would indicate that the more moderate
elements in the Iranian regime are unable fully to control the most radical
factions who remain deeply hostile to the west and no less committed to
exporting their view of Islamic radicalism.
The US believes that they can best be brought to heel by offering Iran no
relief from its already grave economic crisis, brought on by war, gross
government mismanagement and by the decline in the price of oil. Almost all
Iran's main trading partners are in the process of providing such relief, by
resheduling a large part of the short-term debt built up since the end of
the war with Iraq. Britain's latest accusations against Iran seem unlikely
to stop the process.
But the Iranian regime would be foolish to believe that it can rely
indefinitely on the individual self-interest of western nations to offset
its attempts to destabilise governments it does not like. Its high level of
debt, deteriorating infrastructure, and urgent need for access to
international financial markets, makes an accommodation with the west vital
in order to head off the threat of domestic discontent. By behaving in such
a way internationally, the Iranian regime risks provoking its own
destruction and so, indirectly, plays into Washington's hands.

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Here is a confident prediction. You will not see long snaking queues of
voters threading through grass huts and leading to the polling stations of
Britain next Thursday. The typical turnout at elections to the oldest
democracy's local councils is around 40 per cent. So there will be no
last-minute extra print runs of ballot papers, no extension of the poll
until the following day, no stickers showing the beaming face of a
spear-waving late entrant (Richard Branson?). Absent a miraculous
intervention by the Virgin king, next week's contest will pass us by
quietly.
This is hardly surprising. The local councillors due to be elected will sit
in chambers of impotence. Housing, health, education and locally-raised
taxation are among the many areas in which local authorities formerly
reigned, but in which they now lie supine before Whitehall. True, the
overall shares of the local vote won by the national parties may tell us
about the present mood of the electorate. The value of that will be
short-lived. Calculations about how much support has fallen away from the
government may affect the prime minister's chances of staying in office, but
whether Mr John Major stays or goes is of little relevance. What counts is
the evident disintegration of his party.
In short, next week's elections will not answer the central political
question of the day - to wit, will a resurgent economy lead to a surprise
fifth Tory victory in the general election of 1996 or 1997? The question
assumes that economic factors alone determine the outcome of a poll - that
the issue is always, in the words of the Clinton campaign, 'the economy,
stupid'. This might be true, but it is not universally accepted. Two or
three years hence factors other than how good the punters feel may have a
strong influence on the outcome. Voters have begun to notice the clumsiness
of this exhausted government. In office too long, the Conservatives have
forgotten how to avoid mistakes. Fearful of what may lie ahead, they seem
unable to take decisions. When the government does reach a conclusion, it is
nowhere. The faintest zephyr of unpopularity dissolves its stated intent.
All of which is another way of saying that many Tories have lost the will to
govern. The component parts of what in other countries would be a coalition
have forsaken their unity of purpose. They have forgotten that the desire to
win is the cement that binds them. When this proposition is put to
Conservatives, the reply from ministers and backbenchers alike is that all
the new thinking is taking place on the right. It is among Conservatives
that you find political debate. The Liberal Democrats have projected a set
of national policies but these are not seriously debated. Labour is silent.
There is something in this. The importance of political ideas was stressed
by Mr Peter Lilley in his recent Spectator lecture. He pointed out that if
elections were determined just by the state of the economy the Conservatives
would have lost in April 1992. That was the only contest fought at the
bottom of a recession since 1945. There was a sharp rise in living standards
immediately prior to the national votes of 1964 and February 1974, yet the
incumbent Conservatives lost both. The tide of ideas clearly matters.
Mr Lilley has a point, but it is not wholly convincing. It is true that the
Labour party will come a cropper if it continues to present a face of dumb
complacency to the public. In such circumstances it will deserve to fail.
Against that, prudence suggests that Mr John Smith may be believed when he
intimates that he is biding his time. Let us give him the benefit of the
doubt. We shall assume that, when he decides the moment is right, the Labour
leader will produce popular philosophies so wondrous in their beauty, so
marvellous in their intellectual clarity, that the ghosts of previous
thinkers from Plato to Marx will tremble. A synopsis will do. Post it.
Pulses racing, we will have a look at it.
Meanwhile the Conservatives propose to pursue the strategy that they
stumbled upon during the 1980s. Reduce the responsibilities of the state.
Promote competition, choice, and self-reliance. Privatise manufacturing and
service industries. Devolve the day-to-day management of the social services
to appointed boards, with budgetary responsibility. Steadily reduce handouts
of taxpayers' money to the undeserving poor. Mr Lilley, in common with
colleagues on the Conservative right, takes this theme as far backwards as
it will stretch. His faction is cautious-minimalist, anxious to limit the
role of government, but restrained by a sense of what is politically
possible.
Although Labour lacks the imagination to say so, that is what is wrong with
the Tory strategy. The new job-seeker's allowance is close to the American
notion of workfare. Expecting those on the dole to take work was inherent in
the Beveridge report. Labour could offer more radical reform of unemployment
benefit than the Tories, simply by going back to Beveridge. There are other
opportunities. The new trust hospitals, budget-holding practices and
opted-out schools, Mr Lilley reminds us, are based on the principle of the
money following the customer. This is not working. In health, patients are
chasing the money. There is no clamour for grant-maintained schools.
These new marketised institutions are expected to provide 'value for money'.
This is a useful Thatcherite concept, but insensitively applied it destroys
trust and distorts professional standards. The case is argued by Mr Micheal
Power, in The Audit Explosion, a pamphlet available from Demos (9 Bridewell
Place, London EC4V 6AP). Mr Power demonstrates that audit-mania plus
performance-related pay can reduce the quality of public services. Here too
Labour has an opening. Put the money in the purchasers' hands, or give them
vouchers. Armed with health vouchers NHS patients would have the status of
frequenters of Harley Street. Distribute education vouchers to parents, and
all schools will compete on quality of education. As to democratic control,
Labour has the edge. Its likely proposals for local and regional elected
authorities cannot be matched by government-averse Conservatives.
Yet no major British party promises salvation today. Join a queue to vote
for one of them? I'd sooner vote Inkatha.

Sir, Your editorial, 'Eurosuperman step forward' (April 27), on the
appointment of a new European Commission president omitted one crucial fact.
It is true that there will be 'an obscure political bargaining process' over
the next two months, but it will be to select only a nominee for president.
The final decision on both the presidency and the Commission as a whole will
be taken in December, and not by the national governments. It will be taken
by the European parliament.
This is one reason why the elections to the parliament on June 9 are of
greater importance than in the past. Whichever political tendency gains the
upper hand will wish to see its views reflected in the Commission.
It was, indeed, precisely so that this would be the case that the
Commission's terms of office was changed by the Maastricht Treaty so as to
coincide as closely as possible with that of the parliament.

<TEXT>
Sir, During the House of Commons debate on April 21, the secretary of state
for transport reiterated the government's support for the CrossRail project.
Such a welcome and positive restatement of commitment from government - as
the select committee moves towards a decision on the future of the CrossRail
project - signifies just how fundamental this scheme is to the future of
London.
CrossRail is crucial to London's image as a world-class city. Its
cancellation or postponement would be a severe setback to achieving a modern
and integrated transport network for the capital.
Not only would such a delay cause planning blight to swathes of property
across London on a scale not experienced since the Planning Act came into
force, but the resulting uncertainty - which seems to dog all new transport
projects - would also dampen the private sector's appetite for investment.
We urge most strenuously that the CrossRail Bill is taken to a prompt and
positive conclusion. London cannot afford blight on the scale implicit in a
deferred decision. The select committee must seize this opportunity to bring
into being a vital component of London's transport system and to help bring
about a transport network fit for the 21st century.

FT  29 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cruel deception perpetrated by
opponents of PO privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL E CORBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Troubles pile up for the Post Office' (April 25) was
timely, but I fear the consequences of the delay in Post Office
privatisation could be even worse than you suggested. The PO is not only
ripe for privatisation, but such a step is essential if it is to be in a
position to continue to provide the range of facilities to the current high
standards, and keep its prices within current inflation levels. In the last
decade the management and staff have transformed the business in terms of
profit, service and prices. This is now being put at risk by the lack of a
decision on privatisation by the government.
Concerns about privatisation resulting in loss of service are ill-founded.
Similar dire prospects were conjured up at the time of telecoms
privatisation but services, particularly the social and public ones, greatly
improved.
The change from Crown offices to franchised offices has already produced
improvements in services. Entrusting former Crown offices to entrepreneurs
has led to longer opening hours and a more customer-friendly approach.
However, if PO Counters continues to be inhibited from developing
alternative trade then unit costs will rise, to the detriment of the
service. Those relying on Counters for pensions and social security payments
will be hurt the most. Those who oppose privatisation of PO Counters are
perpetrating a cruel deception on the very people they are purporting to
help.
With mails, the risk is that, as letter traffic is eroded, the existing PO
will be less well able to underpin current service levels across all its
business. The underlying trends of PO finances are now becoming adverse. If
the PO slips back from its current position it will be even harder to turn
round than it was during the 1970s.
The Treasury is in a lose-lose position. If it allows matters to drift then
either it will receive reduced contributions to the public sector borrowing
requirement from the PO, or, if it insists on them being maintained, the PO
will have to fund them by a combination of inflationary price increases and
service cuts.
This is avoidable: an imaginative privatisation, involving all the staff and
the public, will ensure that the PO has the financial strength and
managerial flexibility to maintain and develop its services and secure its
future. Regulation by 'Ofpost' will safeguard the social service elements.
The more the government delays, the bigger risks it is taking.

FT  29 APR 94 / Hard days, dollar nights: Stephen Fidler on the pressure for
economic reform in Cuba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To eat well in Havana, you need dollars.
The currency, once the hated symbol of US imperialism, was made legal tender
by President Fidel Castro last July. It gives those Cubans with access to
dollars the means to supplement minimal food rations, to buy petrol and
other 'luxury' items. It is their passport to illegal private restaurants in
houses around Havana and to the unofficial taxis cruising the city.
Those without dollars, at least in the city, are forced to depend on
government hand-outs of a few pounds of rice and beans a month, rum,
cigarettes and occasional other items. For many, daily life in Cuba after
the collapse of the Soviet Union is dominated by the chore of finding
something extra for the cooking pot.
Since the fall of the Soviet Union, which channelled Dollars 65bn in
financial support to Cuba over three decades, Cuba's economy has shrunk by
an estimated 50 per cent. Fuel shortages have closed factories and most
households suffer power cuts of six to 12 hours a day. The bicycle is the
main means of transport through Havana; many travel two or even three to a
bike.
Getting hold of dollars has become an obsession for many Cubans, forcing
almost everyone to break the country's restrictive laws. As a result,
hundreds of women in Havana have turned to part-time prostitution. A
foreigner walking along the Malecon, Havana's waterfront, does not go far
without being propositioned.
The government recognises the problem. Its reluctant legalising of the
dollar benefited those least loyal to Castro's 1959 revolution. They
included those who kept in touch with exiled relatives in defiance of the
government. Now, the government is, ironically, trying to mend fences with
Cubans abroad who send home about Dollars 400m a year in cash and goods.
The growth of a dollar economy - already probably bigger than the socialist
state sector - inevitably reduces the government's ability to dictate
Cubans' living conditions.
The government's shortage of hard currency means it has little with which to
buy the loyalty of the population. The old levers of control are rusting as
defenders of the revolution are themselves forced to move to the margins of
the law. 'The police are just the same as everyone else,' says Andres, a
catering student who is among the hundreds of youths who gather every
evening along the Malecon. 'When they've finished work, they have to find
ways to get food.'
Castro's government appears at best equivocal about what it should do next,
and there seems to be no model for reform. Officials deprecate the idea that
they are seeking some kind of 'Chinese model' - economic reform in a
strictly controlled political setting - perhaps because they recall the
Tiananmen square massacre. They argue that China's huge domestic market and
large rural population is not replicated in Cuba.
So far, the reforms have done little more than legitimise already rampant
black market activity. After authorising limited private enterprise last
year, the government last month attempted a crackdown on the black market.
The police rounded up many of the capital's Lycra-clad prostitutes, closed
private restaurants and searched cars going into Havana, confiscating food -
which by law must be sold to the government - intended for illegal sale.
This was interpreted by some Cubans as a practical move to stamp out some of
the more egregious black market activities, and to underline the
government's determination to maintain law and order. According to one Cuban
sympathetic to the government, many private restaurants were unsanitary and
were becoming havens for delinquents. But others saw the measures as a sign
that Castro remained opposed to market reform.
Either way, the effectiveness of repression has been limited. New
restaurants have replaced those that closed, while some restaurateurs have
become caterers, delivering food to the homes of customers.
If the government is to build on the limited reforms already made, many
observers reckon it should start sooner rather than later. Mr Jacques de
Groote, an executive director of the International Monetary Fund, who
visited Cuba in an informal capacity last November, said then that 'time is
running out for the orderly introduction of a critical mass of
market-oriented measures'.
His view was that the government's 'time-frame for decisive action seems to
be in the next three to six months'.
The six months is nearly up, with no sign of action. Things may be clearer
after the meeting of the country's National Assembly, scheduled to open on
Sunday. Government officials have played down expectations of what might be
achieved, though they have held meetings - with often frank exchanges - in
workplaces across the country. Mr Roberto Rivas, director of the
government's Committee of Economic Co-operation, which tries to encourage
inward investment, said this month that 'the process has been slow because
of the need to obtain consensus'.
Some fiscal and monetary measures may be adopted. For example, the National
Assembly may agree to the closure of some state enterprises - 69 per cent of
which lost money last year, according to the government, and many of which
have ceased production.
However, there is no indication of strong action on the supply side of the
economy. The most important single measure would be the liberalisation of
the agriculture sector to legalise private markets for food. But Castro has
in the past opposed this move.
Many observers see his dilemma becoming more acute. He can either try to
lead the economic reform, ceding some political control but preserving some
gains of the revolution, such as its education and health services. Or he
can resist it, and watch while the remaining structures of government decay
and 'illegal' activity proliferates.
Castro, now 67, will probably take the decision he calculates will best
preserve his hold on power. That power may be dissolving daily as the
economy moves inexorably towards the market. But there is little evidence
yet that Cubans' falling standards of living are translating into coherent
political opposition.
This may be because Havana is still free of the abject poverty that blights
most Latin cities, but it is more likely that most Cubans are too tired to
indulge in political intrigue. 'At 10pm, the last thought that working men
and women have is to get out on a bicycle once again to attend a political
meeting,' said one Cuban cited by the Cuban-born US academic Jorge Dominguez
in a recent report. 'They just want to rest and sleep because the next day
will be just as tough.'

FT  29 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Works councils not costly, nor a
cause of delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BERT THIERRON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your article, 'EU works council costs put at Pounds 1m' (April 22),
the Engineering Employers' Federation claimed that European works councils
would cost Pounds 1m a year and Unice, the European employers' organisation,
added that the existence of these consultative bodies would delay
decision-making in multinational companies by three months.
The European Metalworkers' Federation has in the past three years organised
150 meetings for workers' representatives from multinational companies in
the metal sector. These meetings cost between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds
40,000 each depending on the number of participants and the number of
countries and languages involved. Our experience tells us that these are
realistic figures provided the meetings are not held in five-star hotels,
participants do not travel first class and meals are not taken in three-star
restaurants.
With regard to the delay in decision-making, I would like to draw your
attention to the 18 European works councils already existing in the metal
sector. Many of these voluntary agreements between management and workers'
representatives of multinational companies include provisions for
consultation procedures. So far, not a single manager has reproached the
workers' side for trying to delay decisions. In all cases management has
tried to obtain support for planned action through the force of good
argument.
Should you be interested in further details about the advantages and costs
of European works councils I would suggest you contact those multinational
companies which have practical experience with these bodies. The EMF would
be more than willing to provide you with 18 company names and addresses.

FT  29 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: A suspicious quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D T WIGGINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest the letter from Ms Chrissie Loveday (April 23)
regarding the BS5750 certificate - which she is beginning to learn to hate.
From the commercial point of view, BS5750 seems to have spawned a whole
industry of so-called consultants and would-be advisers.
Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any published list of those
companies which have failed to maintain their standards and have been
de-listed. In fact, what started out as a sound system has turned into a
bandwagon, which is being jumped upon, purely for would-be bureaucrats - as
there is no real method to provide an audit after the gaining of a
certificate.
We are now regarding, with some suspicion, would-be suppliers which boast on
their letterhead the dreaded number. It does not guarantee either quality or
standard.

FT  29 APR 94 / Arts: The Tate muscles in on Bankside - The gallery's
audacious plan to house its modern art collection on the south bank of the
Thames should impress the trustees of the Millennium Fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tate Gallery has stolen a march over its rivals for Millennium Fund
money by announcing that it has selected the Bankside Power station, on the
south bank of the Thames opposite St Paul's Cathedral, as the home for its
new Tate Gallery of Modern Art.
The gallery is pressing ahead on the assumption that the Millennium
trustees, so impressed by the audacity of the project and the commitment of
the Tate, will select it next year as one of the half dozen or so major
construction projects which will celebrate and commemorate 2001, and
onwards. Nick Serota, director of the Tate, hopes that the Gallery of Modern
Art will open in 2000.
Dennis Stevenson, chairman of the Tate trustees, anticipates the cost of
converting the derelict power station into a museum at Pounds 80m. Current
thinking is that the Millennium Fund, using money raised from the National
Lottery, will contribute Pounds 40m (Pounds 10m for four years) and that the
Tate will make up the remainder. The Millennium Fund should have at least
Pounds 70m a year to distribute in the run up to 2001.
Bankside, the last great building designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, was
only completed in 1963 but was redundant by 1981. It covers 8 1/2 acres and
offers 6m cubic feet of potential gallery space, and with its towering brick
chimney and a roof the size of a football pitch, gives tremendous scope for
the yet to be chosen architects to convert it into one of the most exciting
new galleries in the country.
The Tate's confidence that the project will get the go-ahead must have been
strengthened by a supportive letter from Peter Brooke, national heritage
secretary and chairman of the Millennium trustees, and Peter Gummer, who
heads the lottery committee at the Arts Council, another prospective source
of funding - the little mentioned joker in the pack who will pay the running
costs of the museum.
The City of London is doing its bit by planning to build a bridge across the
Thames to link the gallery with the steps of St Paul's, giving access for
the City's 4m office workers. The owners of Bankside, Nuclear Electric, are
good friends of the Tate and are probably delighted to have a prospective
buyer for the site.
But perhaps the most powerful argument in the Tate's favour is that the
visual arts are of increasing public interest, and a gallery devoted to art
of the 20th century and beyond dovetails perfectly with the futuristic plans
for the millennium. Also some of the richest lovers of art, American and
Japanese as well as British, are committed to the modern and the
avant-garde. Dennis Stevenson believes that the existence of the gallery
will be enough to persuade Japanese financial institutions to settle in the
City rather than Frankfurt.
The Tate has been clever in getting its project up and running ahead of
rivals for lottery cash, such as the South Bank Centre and the South
Kensington museums. It has the local authority, Southwark, on its side, and
can depict the new museum as the heart of a cultural and commercial
regeneration for the south bank of the Thames, with the re-creation of
Shakespeare's Globe theatre now rising alongside; a new tube station coming
to Southwark in 1998; and a pier planned for the existing Tate, which will
become a gallery devoted to British art, to provide a river connection.
The Tate has also answered the tricky question about how to remove the vast
quantities of rusting machinery from Bankside - through the wall at the west
end. At Battersea Power Station the roof had to be removed to take out the
generators, which is a major cause of its current dereliction.
Even with the new museum the Tate will still not be able to show more than a
minority of its vast collection, but Serota believes that all the major
works will be on display at the two London outlets. The Tate is also
fortunate in that Bankside is not a listed building. This would allow
architects to put windows into its solid brick 120 foot high facade,
allowing light and river perspectives into the gallery space. As is obvious,
everyone is working on the assumption that the Tate Gallery of Modern Art
will be a millennium project. If it missed out, the reaction of London's art
world would be both apoplectic and apocalyptic.

FT  29 APR 94 / Arts: 'XN Tricities' proves better than its label - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the spring English National Ballet's fancy turns (not too lightly) to
thoughts of touring. Small-scale touring, with the company divided, so that
this week one group of dancers sets out on its regional journey, with a
quadruple bill and piano accompaniment, while next week another group, plus
orchestra and different ballets, also embarks upon a missionary round.
I think the scheme excellent. Dancers get new roles. Choreographers can make
small pieces and try their strength. Audiences see something other than
those splinters of the True Cross which they are gulled into believing are
'the classics'. Were there any coherent policy for ballet in this country,
both sections of the Royal Ballet would build upon the success of this
year's brief and small-scale Dance Bites tour and follow ENB's example.
ENB's tour started at the Wyvern Theatre in Swindon, where I saw its very
successful programme on Wednesday night. There were palate-ticklers of
course, and rightly so. Dinna Bjorn, illustrious Bournonville expert, has
made a clever version of the sextet and tarantella from last act of Napoli.
Eight dancers work like demons. The piano accompaniment is a bit thin, but
the dances are not, and I was most impressed by the men - Stephen Sherriff,
Lee Robinson, Yat Sen Chang, Glauco di Lieto - who brought a great deal of
verve to their steps. Not yet the most idiomatic Bournonville, but joyous -
and that is what the old master wanted.
The evening ended with Derek Deane's re-staging of the Paquita grand pas.
What I saw before train-time was well-reasoned, and challenged the dancers
in the right way, although Paquita's peaks are really only to be scaled by
Kirov dancers. In between these happy book-ends, two novelties. The first is
a revival of Deane's Impromptu, a duet he made in 1982 for Antoinette Sibley
and David Wall. Schubert's E flat major impromptu; a lovely dress for her,
dull tights for him; a shifting sequence of emotion; a dance language
lyrical, intense, and with beautiful manners. The piece is a small delight.
It needs, I think, artists as grand as its first cast to do it full justice.
In a debut, Josephine Jewkes and Christian Duncan sketched the outlines of
an attractive interpretation which I look forward to seeing when it has been
shaped by further performance.
And as the necessary change of mood for such an evening, a new piece by the
Italian choreographer Mauro Bigonzetti. Anything passing itself off under
the title XN Tricities has very serious problems, but in the event, the
piece is far better than its label. Bigonzetti has saddled himself with a
deeply tiresome electronic score, and some modish leather costumes - a
material about as suitable for dancing in as tin - but he has a quick eye
for the potential of distorted classicism, and for a hard-driven Forsythian
energy.
Six women, five men, confront each other, share bursts of dynamics, drive
movement off-centre and re-establish some kind of order, and the eye is
held, even as the ear rebels at the nonsense filling the air, and you wonder
what the hell is the point of two vast lenses on stage which serve to
enlarge various anatomical bits. (Nothing saucy; everything arbitrary). The
cast is excellent, tearing into the dance and coming out not only unscathed
but enhanced as artists - Yat Seng Chang, Denzil Bailey, Stephen Sherriff
and Lucy Smith notably good. It is an intriguing and by no means unworthy
addition to the repertory. The tour's programme book is notably well
designed and informative. The staging of the evening is exemplary. Other
companies please copy.
This English National Ballet programme can be seen in Newtown, Cambridge,
Barrow, Tunbridge Wells, Preston, Snape, during the next four weeks.
