FT  25 APR 94 / Lloyds may use shares option to secure bid for C&amp;G
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Bank may try to pay Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society members
in preference shares if its Pounds 1.8bn cash bid to take over the society
is blocked by the High Court in a hearing set for May 23.
Legal advisers to the two organisations believe that although the 1986
Building Societies Act was intended to prevent cash bids for societies, the
law was not drafted precisely enough to stop Lloyds making cash payments.
The 1.4m C&amp;G savers and borrowers who are eligible under the Lloyds offer
could be paid in preference shares if the bank was barred from paying cash.
It could then offer to exchange the preference shares into cash on the day
of issue.
The Treasury said yesterday that the intention of the 1986 act had been to
prevent cash bids causing 'speculative flows' of deposits. Since the Lloyds
bid was unveiled last Thursday there has been speculation as to the best
society in which to open an account in anticipation of a bid.
The Treasury said it was awaiting the outcome of the court case before
deciding whether to take any action in response to Lloyds' bid. It is
already reviewing mergers and acquisitions provisions in the 1986 act.
The act prevents a successor company to a building society paying cash to
people who have been members of a society for less than two years. The
successor company to C&amp;G under the Lloyds bid would be the C&amp;G subsidiary of
the bank.
But the act does not specifically bar the holding company of the successor
 -in this case Lloyds  - from making cash payments. Nor does it prevent the
successor company making payments in the form of shares to former members of
the society.
Although the latter option was chosen by Abbey National in its 1988
flotation, Lloyds wants to pay cash to absorb its surplus
capital. If it distributed preference shares, some recipients might choose
not to swap them for cash.
Lloyds said yesterday that it could not comment on issues involved in the
court case. The bank and C&amp;G have received strong legal guidance that the
bid is unlikely to be blocked.
Although Hansard records of the debate on the 1986 act show that ministers
wanted to prevent cash bids, legal advisers believe the court will be unable
to refer to Parliamentary intention in reaching a judgment.
If the government decided to tighten the wording of the 1986 act to prevent
cash bids for other societies, it might be able to introduce changes under
the Deregulation Bill which could be passed this autumn. But substantial
changes to the act would require fresh legislation.

FT  25 APR 94 / Delays on DTI initiatives worry industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A backlog is building up on a number of important initiatives promised by
the Department of Trade and Industry, headed by Mr Michael Heseltine. The
delays  - some of many months  - are creating uncertainty and threatening to
damage business, according to industrialists.
The longest delay  - 21 months  - is over plans to privatise the Post
Office. The Post Office's future was reviewed by the DTI in the summer of
1992 but the department is yet to decide on how it should be privatised.
Other areas affected are the domestic gas market, where deregulation plans
are now several months overdue, and the power generation market, where a
review of the nuclear industry promised for last December has yet to
materialise.
Further initiatives which appear to have stalled include plans announced
last July to privatise the Patent Office and Companies House.
The DTI was last week unable to give any indication of when further
announcements on these initiatives might be expected.
A senior official said: 'With all these reviews it is more important to get
it right than stick to an artificial timetable. It is far worse to get it
wrong and publish quickly.
'The accusation that we have been dithering is unfair. We are determined to
publish the reviews in our own time and we will not be pushed by the outside
vested interests saying 'publish now, now, now'.'
Close colleagues of Mr Heseltine in the Commons argue that it would be
'political suicide' for him to publish the conclusions of some of the
reviews so soon before next month's local elections and June's elections to
the European parliament.
'The headlines would not be worth thinking about,' said one senior
backbencher, fearful that his constituents would link Post Office
privatisation to closure of rural post offices.
According to DTI officials, many of these measures have been held up by
technicalities and the weight of work on privatisations. In the case of the
nuclear review, a decision to expand the nuclear power industry could be
threatened by legal challenges.
Fear of a backlash in the local and European elections may also have been a
factor in the delay on gas deregulation which  - according to critics  -
could lead to price increases.
The delays are creating uncertainties among investors and managers in the
industries affected. In the gas industry, where dozens of independent
companies are gearing up for the planned ending of British Gas's monopoly,
the delay is holding up investment decisions.
In the nuclear industry, where state-owned Nuclear Electric is hoping to be
privatised, there is concern that the delay in the nuclear review could
indicate that privatisation might be scrapped as too controversial.

FT  25 APR 94 / Massey Ferguson may be sold for Dollars 330m to US buyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Massey Ferguson, one of the most famous names in the world tractor industry,
is close to being sold by Varity, its US parent, for about Dollars 330m
(Pounds 223m).
The buyer, in a deal that could be announced in the next few days, is
believed to be Agco, a company based in Atlanta, Georgia, that over the past
three years has been expanding fast in the US through acquisitions of farm
equipment companies.
The expected deal would thwart a rival Dollars 350m offer from a
European-led group to acquire Massey Ferguson, which employs more than 3,500
people and has factories at Coventry in the UK and Beauvais in France.
According to an article this week in Stark's News Service, a Chicago
newsletter, Varity has obtained a cash offer of Dollars 350m from the
European group, in which Mr John Sword, former chief executive of Massey, is
said to be a leading participant. The article says Agco's Dollars 330m offer
is a mixture of cash and notes - stocks.
It is understood Agco's offer may be accepted because of its strong
relationship with Varity. Mr Sword, who left Massey last summer, would not
comment yesterday.
In November 1992, Agco paid Varity Dollars 110m for Massey's North American
distribution business and 50 per cent of its Agricredit financing business,
and early this year paid another Dollars 23m for the remainder of
Agricredit.
No comment was available from Agco, and Varity said: 'Typically we do not
comment on these types of stories.' It added that Mr Victor Rice, Varity's
chairman and chief executive, had made it no secret that a sale of the rest
of Massey would be considered if an opportunity arose.
The sale of Massey would start a new chapter in the story of a company that
in the early 1980s was synonymous with financial crisis and industrial
blight. In 1984, after heavy rationalisation and two financial
reconstructions, it emerged from five years of losses. In 1991, with all its
North American factories closed, Massey plunged to an operating loss of
Dollars 60.8m because of the global recession in farm equipment, but has
subsequently returned strongly to profit. It claims its tractors were the
best-selling make in western markets in 1992, for the 30th year running.
The sale of Massey would end Varity's involvement in heavy off-road
equipment and underline its concentration on Kelsey-Hayes automotive
products and Perkins diesel engines.
For Agco, the purchase of the rest of Massey would be its most ambitious
move yet. The company is the successor to the agricultural business of the
old Allis-Chalmers group, which in 1987 filed for protection under Chapter
11 of the US bankruptcy code.
In 1990 Agco bought Deutz-Allis from KHD of Germany, since when it has grown
substantially through acquisitions. Its sales jumped to Dollars 595.7m last
year from Dollars 314.5m in 1992, due mainly to the North American Massey
deal.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This fine capriccio by Canaletto of the Scuola di San Marco in Venice sold
for Pounds 2,201,500 at Christie's yesterday, way above its Pounds 1.5m high
estimate. It sold to the London dealer Hazlett Gooden &amp; Fox who will put it
in stock. The chances are that it will eventually go abroad. For around two
centuries it had been in the possession of the Neave family and was sold by
the executors of the late Sir Arundel Neave. When its money from the
National Lottery starts to come through next year, the National Heritage
Fund could well attempt to keep similar paintings with strong British links
in the UK.

three months

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentaria, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and Banco Santander, the three large
Spanish banks bidding to acquire the Banesto financial group reported mixed
first-quarter results, reflecting narrowing margins on ordinary banking
business.
Net interest income at Santander, the most international of Spain's banks
with more than 40 per cent of profits arising abroad, rose 14.3 per cent to
Pta64.7bn (Dollars 471.5m) against the first three months of 1993. Net
interest income fell 2.9 per cent to Pta79bn at BBV and was little changed
at Pta60.2bn at Argentaria.
Argentaria lifted first-quarter pre-tax profits by 12.1 per cent to
Pta31.7bn thanks mainly to strong income from fees and commissions and
provision recoveries and also tight overall costs.
Santander raised pre-tax profits by 9.7 per cent to Pta24.5bn and BBV posted
a first-quarter pre-tax profit of Pta29.1bn, up 3.7 per cent.
Santander said the quarter had been characterised by 'significant
instability in domestic and international financial markets and by a general
economic environment still showing signs of weakness'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN, the engineering and industrial services group, yesterday announced the
terms of its revised partial share offer for Westland investors who have
accepted its Pounds 577m hostile bid.
Although GKN increased its cash offer from 290p to 335p, it found that its
partial share alternative, which is worth 194.7p in cash and a quarter of a
new GKN share, was almost 30 per cent oversubscribed, the directors said.
The group said it would scale down applications for new GKN shares to 77.35
per cent on a pro rata basis.
The balance will be satisfied in cash or with Pounds 1 GKN loan notes.

The addition of 15 types of accident mainly involves North Sea and railway
incidents. The commission hopes the proposals will help clear up problems
with under-reporting.
While all 309 fatal accidents at work in the UK were reported last year, the
commission believes there has been significant under-reporting of injuries
that cause absences of more than three days.

The Property Misdescriptions Act, which aims to stop estate agents from
making misleading claims about properties, has resulted in two successful
prosecutions and 13 proposed prosecutions in its first year, the Office of
Fair Trading said yesterday, Vanessa Houlder writes.
The successful prosecutions were against a Norfolk estate agent, who showed
an incorrect price for a property in his window, and a West Yorkshire agent
who falsely said a property included a garage.
One proposed prosecution involves an agent who described a property as
'quiet' when it is alleged to be next to a pub, near a main dual-carriageway
and half a mile from a superstore.

FT  23 APR 94 / Hillary Clinton defends her business ethics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday defended her business ethics and her
investment practices in an unusual White House press conference called in an
attempt to dispel the continuing questions over her and President Clinton's
involvement in the Whitewater Development Corporation.
She said she had no knowledge of money passing from Madison Guaranty, a
failed Arkansas savings and loan institution, to Whitewater or to Mr
Clinton's campaign funds.
She defended her successful trading in cattle futures, saying she had been
well advised by Mr James Blair, a close friend, and lucky in her decision to
pull out of the market when she discovered she was pregnant. 'He and other
friends of mine who continued trading ended up losing money.'
Mrs Clinton also denied she had received any favourable treatment in her
trading, in which she rode a bull market in cattle futures to build an
initial Dollars 1,000 investment into nearly Dollars 100,000 (Pounds
68,490).
'There isn't any evidence that anybody gave me any favourable treatment.'
Mrs Clinton acknowledged that her earlier reluctance to answer questions
about her finances had added to public doubts, and said she now regretted
that reluctance.
She also denied that her high-rolling investment strategies contradicted her
husband's campaign rhetoric about the greed of the 1980s.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiations between Ukraine and Russia on dividing the Black Sea fleet
collapsed in acrimony yesterday and the Russian delegation stormed out of
the meeting, officials said. The two sides agreed on a formula giving
Ukraine just under 20 per cent of 833 ships making up the former Soviet
fleet. But each blamed the other for falling out over the issue of where to
base the naval forces. Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev refused to
sign the document on splitting up vessels and left Sevastopol without
telling members of his own delegation of his departure. Russia insisted it
wanted full control of Sevastopol, the fleet's current headquarters, and
wanted no Ukrainian naval presence in the Crimean peninsula, where the
majority ethnic Russian population is seeking closer ties with Moscow.
Ukraine's Defence Ministry accused Moscow of 'refusing to use common sense
and understand Ukraine's legitimate position'.

FT  23 APR 94 / As they say in Europe: Warning lights flash in Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The struggle to form a government in Italy has distracted attention from the
truth that the worst is yet to come. Just consider the situation in two
other countries. An editorial in an important paper runs: 'There is no doubt
that the next time the prime minister takes a stand on any issue he will
have to retreat.' The Englishman thinks: 'No doubt about it, Major's
finished.' The Frenchman: 'Balladur, il est fini.'
Italy's Silvio Berlusconi should take note. It was two years ago that John
Major unexpectedly won an election in the face of long odds and the opinion
polls. He is now nearly as unpopular as his government. Edouard Balladur
gained a crushing victory a year later and became the most popular man in
France. Now his ratings are in steep decline.
Balladur provides a particularly instructive example of a negative kind for
Berlusconi. He aimed to reduce the state sector, cut public spending and
hack at the diseased social undergrowth. He has been thwarted at every turn.
The latest attempt to deal with Air France marks only preliminary
skirmishing before a number of desperate battles over what Liberation calls
'the flying Louvre'. The first one was lost.
Alessandro Merli of Il Sole-24 Ore of Milan was in London to cover the 1992
election and says the recent Italian poll was a rerun of that affair.
Achille Ochetto, leader of the left, behaved just like former labour leader,
Neil Kinnock, and lost. He even said taxes might have to rise. Berlusconi
said: 'We are the party of tax cutters' and won. The election victory that
the left looked to have in the bag in the winter, withered as the days
lengthened.
Berlusconi has probably taken no notice of the obvious precedents but he
will have a hard job to avoid following them. He may choose the Major way
and suddenly find that tax rises are essential. He might even take a strong
stand on a trivial issue or two and cave in.
Or there is the minor, Balladur, way: put up policy proposals and withdraw
them as soon as those affected object. But there is also the possibility
that Berlusconi might be a new Thatcher: the economists around him make
Anglo-Saxon free-market fanatics look wet.
The only trouble is that nowhere in western Europe is Lady Thatcher seen as
the beacon she manifestly believes herself to be. Britain is more often held
up as an awful warning of the consequences of free market radicalism.
Berlusconi ensures his radical ideas are, for the moment, kept to
discussions among his backroom boys. He would not have shared an election
platform with her even though he seems to be motivated by the same
instincts.
The British reply to the antipathy their example arouses should not be the
kind of boastfulness that sometimes emanates from Conservative circles. It
should run along the lines of: 'Think where we would be if we hadn't
radically reformed. Think of those vast loss-making state industries that
have been revitalised and sold off. What if public spending had not been
kept under some kind of control through the 1980s? If trade unions had not
been reformed?'
Economic reform does not necessarily mean things work well after the right
systems have been put in place. Economic management still has to be
competent. Britain has a brilliantly reformed economy but those in charge
have not always shown a deft hand in running it.
Balladur's failures have ensured France still has a ludicrously structured
economy. There are nationalised banks which have become a dustbin for the
bag ladies of French industry; subsidised state industries which should be
closed down; public utilities which would be insolvent if they were private
entities. A minimum wage was pitched so high that mass unemployment is an
inevitable result. Yet France has a currency that is worth more than when
the markets forced it down and out of the exchange rate system, it has a
structural balance of payments surplus. Some French private sector
industries are world beaters and the economy has enjoyed a decade of low
inflation.
The lesson is that a long period of sometimes painful reform is of only
limited use if you do not know what to do afterwards. The official British
solution today is 'more change, more change' because change is what Britons
are good at. The French are good at running a system that was put in place
by the Vichy government 50 years ago and by the post-war Fourth Republic.
Anyone trying to tackle its problems today runs up against colossal vested
interests, but then it more or less works, because French officials make it
work.
So Berlusconi faces an interesting challenge. Is it worth changing an
appalling system that has served Italy quite well? And if it is changed,
will the new one be any better?

FT  23 APR 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Spare me bad news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I expect that I will sound like a man from the Stone Age or Bronze Age if I
live to Wilfred Thesiger's age - 83 - which I won't, not by a long chalk,
given my habit of glaring at people, noisy people, rude people, sometimes
almost any people, in a manner bound, according to Miss Lee, my executive
assistant, to guarantee, one day, that somebody shoots my head off.
As well as an anachronism, Thesiger is a famed traveller and romantic whose
journeyings and writings have been honoured by medals, awards and
fellowships. And here he still is, stranded, out of time, wishing that
things could be as they were in the Stone Age or Bronze Age.
Thesiger has written another book, My Kenya Days, in connection with which
he was interviewed the other day. He said he regretted that some of the
peoples among whom he had lived were culturally extinct. 'When I was among
the Rashid in southern Arabia,' he said, 'the Bedu had no contact with
western life. But two years after I left, the oil companies moved in, and
now they all have cars and money. They have adapted, but it is not the same.
There is no longer the dull ache of hunger, and this is a shame, for it
produced a fine type.'
Pity about the missing dull ache of hunger. And pity about the other things
this man from the Stone Age or Bronze Age finds regrettable in modern life.
Thesiger said he had been offered Kentucky fried chicken by the Dayak, and
that he hated cars and aeroplanes for 'robbing the world of all diversity'.
He resented virtually all the material manifestations of western
civilisation. But then he said something with which I did agree. He was
talking about television, which he considers a terrible intrusion. 'Why the
hell,' he asked, 'should you want to know there's been a massacre in Rwanda
one hour after it's happened?'
A supremely good question. Why would we want to know there's been a massacre
in Rwanda one hour after it's happened - unless it affected the gorillas,
Rwanda's most important denizens, whose safety, were it threatened by human
fighting, would trigger alarm among those concerned about stewardship of the
planet.
I thought about Thesiger's question for a long time. There is no answer  -
no reason why we should want or need to know about a massacre in Rwanda one
hour after it has happened.
There is a great deal we do not need to know. But they tell us any way. My
opinion is not a secret: in the good news/bad news debate, I stand with the
good guys - those who believe that newspapers and television emphasise bad
news at the expense of the good.
Quite soon, the world's media magnates will wake to this simple truth: bad
news is depressive, good news stimulative; bad news makes people fearful,
good news makes them happy. Bad news is bad for business. So make them
happy.
This week I scrutinised the newspapers. The same old mixture - bad news, bad
news, a spot of good news, bad news, bad news. That is not how it should be
done. Soon, I predict, the media moguls will instruct their staffs to
accentuate the positive and merely summarise the negative.
Rwanda? We do not need to know the full and horrid details, the rapes and
mutilations. Nor do we need photographs. Soon, this is what we will read,
crafted by an expert summariser: 'There has been unpleasantness in Rwanda.
But the country's famed gorillas are not affected.'
John Major? 'The prime minister took to the hustings yesterday. Things did
not go well.'
Terrorism in Northern Ireland? 'There was a loud bang in Belfast yesterday.'
Crime? 'Misbehaviour in certain areas is on the increase, said a police
spokesman, but declining in others. He said this was to be expected.'
Bosnian air-strikes? 'President Clinton said that United Nations safe havens
in Bosnia were less safe than he wanted, and that some form of action was on
the cards.'
Wrangling over the anniversary of the second world war Normandy landings?
'Spin-merchant Sir Tim Bell confirmed yesterday that Spam fry-ins were his
own mega-brainwave for celebrating D-Day's 50th anniversary, and said: 'Even
when I worked in advertising, I was still proud of my common roots. I firmly
believe that Spam fry-ins gave the allied forces a crucial edge when
readying for the contretemps in Normandy all those years ago'.'

FT  23 APR 94 / We kept the home fires burning: Frank Ledger and Howard
Sallis, instrumental in the defeat of Britain's miners 10 years ago, tell
how they kept the power stations supplied - and managed to keep it quiet.
All the skill in the world could not save the CEGB from failure if was seen
to be fighting the miners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK LEDGER and HOWARD SALLIS,
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frank Ledger was the CEGB's director of operations during the 1984-85 coal
strike. Howard Sallis was central director for industrial relations at the
Electricity Council. This is their account of events.
Ten years ago today, the officials who controlled Britain's electricity
supply met to assess the first phase of a huge emergency operation upon
which the fate of Margaret Thatcher's UK government depended - and much more
beside.
A month earlier, on March 26, Sir Walter Marshall, chairman of the Central
Electricity Generating Board, and his fellow board members had to decide
whether to commit themselves to an all-out effort to prevent striking miners
from causing power cuts throughout the land.
It was a question of the greatest delicacy. The board was determined to keep
the lights burning and knew that if the CEGB was successful the miners would
probably be defeated. But it dared not be seen publicly to take a political
position.
The first important question was whether to increase output from the big
oil-fired power stations to maximum to conserve coal stocks. Oil was then
twice as expensive as coal, so the potential cost was hundreds of millions
of pounds. But at that time no one knew how many pits would join the strike
nor how long they would stay out.
With coal stocks at an all-time high for the time of year (24m tonnes), it
might have seemed an odd time to start spending money on oil. But we knew
that maintaining electricity supplies would be a close-run thing, much
closer than was generally believed at the time.
If the strike were to consolidate and run through to the autumn, when cold
weather increased power consumption, the lights would start to go out after
about three months. The miners would then have a good chance of repeating
the victory they achieved over Edward Heath's government in 1974. He called
an election and lost after a period of extensive power cuts, a state of
emergency and a three-day week for industry.
The board had to keep quiet about its difficulties. It knew that all the
skill in the world could not save it from failure if its actions were seen
as part of the fight against the miners. Many power station workers in
mining areas had fathers, sons and brothers who were striking miners. The
slightest provocation could have brought them out on strike too.
Yet while appearing neutral on the political issues, the board knew that in
order to maintain supplies, it must make huge changes, of which the shift to
oil was only a start. Even before the strike, the board had been laying its
plans. Stocking facilities were increased and suppliers were only given
contracts if they were prepared to supply through picket lines. Arrangements
were made to fly in materials by helicopter: moving sulphuric acid by
helicopter had its difficulties.
These preparations led to some anxious debates within the board. Were they a
political act to defeat the miners or were they undertaken to enable the
board to do its statutory duty during a dispute in which it was not directly
involved? The latter view prevailed.
Then, when the strike was underway, switching to oil brought new
complications. It was done in a phased programme, ending on April 23, from
the normal 30,000 tonnes a week up to what was then thought to be the
maximum of 360,000 tonnes, saving 600,000 tonnes of coal burn.
One obvious danger was that such a big shift would drive up prices on the
international oil market. Less obvious was the possibility that the whole
national grid system could crash because of the huge flows of power from
oil-fired stations in the south for which the grid was not designed. Complex
computer studies were needed to find out whether the system could cope.
Then extremely delicate negotiations with our staff were needed to persuade
them to run the oil-fired stations full out instead of just at peak periods
as would have been normal for the time of year. At the Isle of Grain, for
example, the newest and largest of the oil stations, staff were asked to
work about 70 hours per week, almost twice their normal hours.
How could they be persuaded to take on extra work which might easily be seen
as strike-breaking? First there was the money: for some, about twice their
normal rates; but more important for many men may have been a strong moral
sense of duty to consumers - including old people and hospitals. They may
also have feared that after the strike their jobs might have been in danger
if high oil prices led to the mothballing of their station.
As the pattern of the strike became clearer, new problems emerged. The rail
unions were giving strong support to the striking miners and little coal
from working pits, particularly those in Nottinghamshire, was being
transported to the power stations. British Rail was prepared to discipline
staff but not to risk passenger services. No one wanted a national rail
strike. The answer was to turn to road transport, but this was far easier
said than done.
Hundreds of contractors were engaged. With the help of local authorities and
police, routes were arranged through quiet country lanes and villages. It
was a huge enterprise. At each of the large power stations 5,000 lorry loads
of coal a week were needed to replace 100 trains. It took time to build up
the fleets, and lorries and their drivers had to be given protection against
assault, both overnight and on journeys through picket lines.
Through the summer, the combination of high oil-fired generation and
road-borne coal supply gave us some feeling of security. About 250,000
tonnes of coal a week was then being transported by road with over 600,000
tonnes a week of coal being saved by the oil burn. This compared with a
normal requirement of the equivalent of just under 1m tonnes of coal burn a
week.
The coal stocks had fallen by 6m tonnes to 18m by the time the new
operational regimes were in place, but were falling only moderately by the
summer and in mid-summer hardly at all. However concern over winter
electricity supplies was deepening.
The strike was going on longer than we had expected and looked as though it
would last into winter. If we could not improve our supply position we would
not be able to get through the period of high electricity demand without
power cuts. A national dock strike had been called. This related to events
in steel but concerned us because much of our oil supply was dependent on
tankers. We could be affected if tug crews and berthing staff became
involved.
This made us all the more determined to improve our supply position. We were
getting on with this when, towards the end of July, a group of government
ministers, receiving monitoring reports, expressed their anxieties to
Thatcher, suggesting that stronger measures were necessary, including the
possible use of troops and the forcing of coal flows from stocks at striking
pits into stations not receiving supplies. Sir Walter Marshall promised
Thatcher that we would get through the winter without power cuts. He
believed we could do better than we were predicting. Gil Blackman, the board
member for operations, who had been directing the CEGB's response to the
crisis, then had to make sure Sir Walter's promise could be kept. But it
would be difficult.
Prodigious efforts were made to conserve coal. We had thought we were
burning as much oil as the system could bear. But could we perhaps do
better? At every coal-fired power station where it was possible to burn more
oil with the coal, we did so. This required a further massive road tanker
operation.
Four medium-sized oil-fired stations which had been closed were repaired and
brought back into service. Five large coal-fired stations not receiving coal
supplies were modified to burn oil. They could not do anything like full
load, but their help was substantial. Some elderly components from closed
oil-fired stations were hurriedly adapted.
And the large oil-fired stations managed to thunder away with some of them
at an output well beyond the normal design limit for continuous working. The
two newest stations, Grain and Littlebrook in south east England, went to
high levels of overload. We crossed our fingers that they would be able to
maintain this over the winter.
Gas turbine generators, normally used only for short bursts of power at
times of peak demand, were used for prolonged periods at as high an output
that their road-borne oil supplies allowed. This meant more road tankers and
also special repair lines for servicing the gas generators, which were
really aircraft jet engines similar to those used in Concorde or Vulcan
bombers. The Ministry of Defence helped us by providing one of those lines.
The CEGB Regions showed great inventiveness in finding new ways to burn oil.
So by mid-winter, the oil burn had increased to 600,000 tonnes a week with
oil-fired generation capacity doubled. About 1m tonnes of coal a week were
then being saved.
About a third of this oil was being supplied by pipeline from refineries
next to some of the power stations, the remainder being supplied by a
mixture of term contracts and spot purchases. The board's staff made every
effort to control the price by refusing offers at high prices, even if that
meant stopping purchases from time to time. It was a gamble but it worked.
The aim was to limit the price to Dollars 190 a tonne. We were purchasing
oil from all over Europe and the east coast of America.
There were many problems, including an arrested ship, unhelpful
interventions by Customs and Excise which threatened to surcharge oil being
imported from the Dutch Antilles, and embarrassing publicity over the use of
Soviet ships. We were buying more oil than some smaller members of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries were producing.
We further increased the transport of coal by road. The volume was doubled
by the early winter. Some 500,000 tonnes a week were being moved using 2,000
lorries with more than 1,000 loads a day arriving at some stations. Every
available lorry was used.
But this was not enough. Some power stations which supported the striking
miners were still not receiving coal supplies. We judged that it was unwise
to risk a full-scale conflict by forcing the delivery of coal to these
stations or by building up their oil burn. These stations were therefore
reserved for use during the winter peaks. At the start of the winter they
needed a total of 3.5m tonnes of coal to play that role. But they were more
than 400,000 tonnes short of this figure.
If this problem were not solved we would still have power cuts in cold
winter periods. That would improve the strikers' morale.
It was decided to try to force coal into Didcot power station. This was
ultimately achieved by prolonged persuasion and pressure after power station
staff refused to use the coal and then to maintain the equipment for
handling it.
The coal flow began on November 8 but it was not until January 20 that it
was possible to class Didcot as a normal coal-receiving station. Aberthaw
and Uskmouth in south Wales and also Brighton were turned by the same means
into stations operating normally.
By Christmas, Sir Walter was able to tell the government that we could get
through the winter and maintain supplies to the end of 1985. We were not
certain about this, but confidence was growing. And when very cold weather
occurred over two weeks in January, record levels of electricity demand were
met in full.
On January 17 the highest demand of the winter occurred. The success of the
CEGB in meeting these peaks seemed to take the stuffing out of the striking
miners and marked the begining of the end of the strike.
By March 5 it was over. The board, had kept the lights on, at a cost to the
taxpayer of more than Pounds 2bn, most from the oil burn. The oil had saved
40m tonnes of coal. At the end of the strike, power station coal stocks were
11m tonnes. Had it not been for all of the initiatives, the outcome could
have been different. The margin between Thatcher's famous victory and
ignominious failure had been extremely narrow.
Frank Ledger and Howard Sallis are joint authors of Managing the Power
Supply, an inside story of crisis management, to be published by Routledge
in October. A television documentary, The Men Who Kept the Lights On, which
is based on the book, will be broadcast tonight on BBC2 at 7.10pm.

FT  23 APR 94 / Arts: Montreal musicians - London has been playing host to
distinguished foreign orchestras and singers. Our critics report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles Dutoit and the Orchestre symphonique de Montreal rounded off their
latest European tour at the Royal Festival Hall on Wednesday night. Any
appearance here by this first-rate ensemble is an event: despite several
tours to these shores, Dutoit and the orchestra (he has been musical
director since since 1977) remain best known on this side of the Atlantic
for their superb series of Decca recordings.
Their 13-city tour took them to most European musical centres - including
the homes of their Vienna and Berlin rivals - and as far afield as Ljubljana
and Warsaw. Even though this London performance followed straight on from
two consecutive nights in Poland, the players showed no sign of fatigue.
Indeed, what sets the Montreal orchestra apart is the poise and precision of
its playing. It is not remarkable for an idiosyncratic sound, rather for
performing as one instrument, with articulation rare in such a big band.
Dutoit is a flexible but authoritative conductor. His obvious rapport with
the players was clear from the invigorating performance that opened the
evening, Stravinsky's Jeu de Cartes, a ballet score written for Balanchine.
All the acerbic wit came across with bracing clarity, but Dutoit also made
every quirky note entrancing and beautiful. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 25
in C, K. 503, was luminous, with the internal balance carefully judged. The
orchestra had an equal partner in the masterful Stephen Kovacevich, who
tempered the work's majesty with humour and pathos; only in the slow
movement did a certain emotional depth elude the players.
The orchestra was on its most familiar territory in the second half. Dutoit
conjured up a swirling, seductive performance of Debussy's Iberia, the
middle movement ('Les parfums de la nuit') sultry, the outer movements
fiery, painted with vibrant brush strokes. Ravel's La Valse is a good
orchestral showpiece - Dutoit set atmospheric pianissimos against great
surges of sound - but it seldom sounds as heady and exhilarating as it did
here.

FT  23 APR 94 / Arts: Finnish singers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a country of its size, Finland has produced more than its share of
notable singers, from Aino Ackte to Jorma Hynninen. Representatives of the
youngest generation include the soprano Karita Mattila and mezzo Monica
Groop. In what became a Finnish mini-festival at the Wigmore Hall, both gave
recitals there in the last few days.
Since Mattila burst onto the international scene a decade ago, her voice has
filled out. Her tone is now full and creamy, something on which she seems to
rely too much: there was a sameness about her opening works, a group of
Schubert's Italian Songs and a selection from Mahler's Lieder und Gesange
aus der Jugendzeit.
The rest of the programme revealed Mattila's powers better. In two Runeberg
settings of Sibelius, 'Arioso' and 'The Maiden's Tryst', she soared through
the desolate, wide-ranging lines impressively. Strauss's extraordinary Drei
Lieder der Ophelia were evocative. Best of all were Mattila's five
Rakhmaninov songs. With sensitive accompaniments from the Finnish pianist
Ilmo Ranta, she caught the distinctive mood of each, from the mystery of
Pushkin's 'Oh, never sing to me again' to the impassioned 'What wealth of
rapture'. Mattila has a fluent, idiomatic way with languages, and sang the
Rakhmaninov with a Russian glint.
Monica Groop - who last month was a touching Varvara in Covent Garden's new
Katya Kabanova - made an exciting Wigmore Hall debut on Thursday. She is a
more 'complete' artist than Mattila, more responsive to texts, and better
able to communicate them to her audience. Her deep, natural musicality
ensures beautiful phrasing. Groop has devoted time to oratorio work out of
the limelight, but her even, glowing tone makes hers one of the most
exciting young voices around today.
Groop revealed reserves of radiance in her Brahms and Strauss Lieder, but
was perhaps strongest of all in the Sibelius songs (which she has just
recorded for BIS), performed with an icy passion. We heard several of the
composer's Swedish settings, but the handful of Finnish songs - whose lines
rise and fall gently with the poetry - were most beguiling of all; she also
sang Sibelius's only English song, the noble Hymn to Thas. Accompanied by
Gustav Djupsjobacka, Groop brought the country girl of Grieg's great
Haugtussa cycle to vivid life: though she is versatile, this music is
ideally suited to Groop's temperament and musical insight.
Groop's recital was sponsored by the Union Bank of Finland.

FT  23 APR 94 / Arts: Leipzig's lyrical sound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A pair of beautifully-matched flutes opened this concert, followed by wind
chords exactly in tune and well together. It is not necessary for an
orchestra to choose a showpiece to make an impact at the beginning of a
concert and noisy music has never been the Leipzig Gewandhaus's forte.
This year the orchestra is celebrating its 250th anniversary. It is worth
stopping for a moment to consider what that means. Founded in 1743, the
'Konzertverein', as it was known in its earliest days, dates from the period
when Bach was still active in the city. Among British orchestras, there is
none that can claim a comparable tradition. London's oldest symphony
orchestra (the LSO) was founded in 1904; the Halle dates from 1858, though
it also had antecedents.
Since 1970 the post of Kapellmeister in Leipzig has been held by Kurt Masur,
who has proved a noble guardian of the tradition. It is easy to believe that
the unforced musicianship that he obtains is a way of playing that stretches
back through the orchestra's history. The sound is soft, lyrical, warm,
discreet, if short of a cutting edge from wind or brass when the whole
orchestra is playing.
Each of the three composers on the programme for the first of the Leipzig
Gewandhaus's two anniversary concerts at the Barbican either conducted the
orchestra or had close connections with it. Mendelssohn presided over a
crucial period as Kapellmeister from 1835 to 1847. Not only those first wind
chords, but also the grace of the strings made his Overture to A Midsummer
Night's Dream an ideal opening choice.
Schumann was an important influence in the same period and his widow, Clara,
continued to perform with the orchestra as a pianist until 1889. The
Barbican has already seen some notable Schumann concerts this year and so
Masur faced greater competition here. With their respective chamber
orchestras, Leppard had more buoyancy, Harnoncourt more thrust and energy.
What the Leipzig performance of the Second Symphony offered was a natural
sense of scale, of how one phrase should relate to another, one passage to
the next.
Later in the 19th century Brahms played his piano concertos and conducted
his symphonies in Leipzig. At this concert his Violin Concerto (premiere in
Leipzig 1879) was played with impressive concentration, but a less than
idiomatic range of colour by Viktoria Mullova. For the true Brahms sound one
had only to listen to the orchestra, mellow and blended as ever: the Leipzig
Gewandhaus tradition looks secure for many years yet.

FT  23 APR 94 / Arts: Windsor after the fire - William Packer finds
Alexander Creswell following in the tradition of Turner, Sandby and Piper
with his evocative watercolours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the age of the photograph, the uses of the work of art as a thing of
topographical or architectural record may often be overlooked, but the
argument remains. In matters of particular emphasis and annotation, and of
personal experience and response, the drawing or painting may take on a
selective authority which the supposedly all-seeing camera can seldom match.
There was Turner, watching from the river as the old Houses of Parliament
went up in flames: there was Paul Sandby, noting down the informal daily
life of the Windsor Castle of the later 18th century: there too, under
darker neo-romantic skies, was John Piper, seeing the Castle in wartime
through more dramatic eyes - 'you don't seem to have had much luck with the
weather, Mr Piper', remarked the King.
The great fire at Windsor Castle, late in 1992, touched a national, indeed
an universal nerve, as the image went round the world of one of the great
monuments and symbols of nationhood about to be, so it seemed, destroyed. No
doubt, in its aftermath, every single square inch of the damage has been
dutifully photographed, but how good it is to learn that an artist,
Alexander Creswell, was also called in to make more subjective, perhaps, but
no less pertinent a record.
The damaged part of the Castle, he tells us, 'had been wrapped in plastic
sheeting . . . isolated from the world . . . enshrouded. The sun filtered
through from above . . . The plastic sheeting rustled . . . pigeons flapped
around somewhere above . . . tourists gazed in . . . a band struck up in the
Quadrangle, the tunes echoing round the empty walls, distorted and remote .
. . The damage inside the Castle had created a fantasy, a ghost of a
palatial interior.' Ruins are familiar enough to all of us, but it is the
freshness of ruin and devastation that is so shocking: 'it was cold and
sepulchral in the Castle, the rubble giving off a stench of black rot.'
We see what he means. It is, of course, the documentary and circumstantial
content of these dozen or so watercolours, commissioned for the Royal
Collection, that will give them their immediate reclame, and it has to be
said that at this first level they are immediately effective and satisfying.
The mood is appropriately doom-laden and tragical, the perspectives looming
and dramatic, the significant detail  - the skeletal rafters, the isolated
malachite vase, a corner of gothic tracery, an empty frame - well-chosen and
well-observed.
But they are better than that, something more than of merely superficial
interest and indulgence. A good story, after all, can bear the bad telling:
told well, we are hardly aware of the telling at all. And Creswell does the
business very well indeed, working with a freedom yet sureness of touch, and
a simple, confident authority in the setting up of his composition, that
together mark him out as a true painter, not just a reasonably efficient
note-taker and recorder.
For it is never the image alone, and what it represents, that makes the work
of interest as art, but always the way it is done - the command of the
medium, the direct, physical engagement with surface and material, the sense
of adventure and discovery and an element of risk. Creswell's sketchbooks
even more than the full-dress paintings give us this picture of the true
artist, unselfconsciously absorbed in the subject.
There is in all this, however, something of a paradox and a word of warning.
Creswell is clearly a skilful painter, master of his chosen medium and his
favoured architectural subject-matter. That said, it may well be that so
strong and extraordinary was the experience afforded him by the devastation
of Windsor Castle, that there was nothing for it but for him to lose himself
and all his skill in the magnificent awfulness before him - which is
precisely why his Windsor work is so successful.
Is there is to the accompanying group of paintings, of great houses from
Rome to St Petersburg, something rather less of the intuitive excitement,
rather more of the mechanical and, dare I say, complacent? A few lines from
Basil Bunting's Briggflatts come to mind: 'It is time to consider how
Domenico Scarlatti/ condensed so much music into so few bars/ with never a
crabbed turn or congested cadence/ never a boast or a see-here . . .' But
the show is worth catching, the only pity that it has been on for so short a
time.

King Street, St James's, SW1, until April 28.

FT  23 APR 94 / Arts: Curtain rises on the millennium - The arts world is
queueing up to dip into the lottery financed honey-pot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, would like Pounds 45m to bring its
back stage facilities out of the Dark Ages while the Tate Gallery is
thinking more in terms of Pounds 50m for its new Museum of Modern Art. The
South Bank Centre has made a bid for a modest Pounds 40m to smarten itself
up and the museum quarter of Kensington, including the Royal Albert Hall,
could quite easily absorb Pounds 150m in its grandiose plan, designed by Sir
Norman Foster, to become the arts and educational centre of the world.
These are London's front runners for millennium money, the lottery financed
honey-pot designed to give the nation permanent reminders of 2001. Throw in
the supporters of a dance house for London, and a project for a big screen
Imax cinema at Waterloo, and it becomes obvious that there will be many
disappointed candidates.
The millennium is almost seven years away but already the contenders for its
largesse are jostling for attention. The government plans to exploit January
1 2001 to the full. It has set aside a fifth of the revenues raised by the
National Lottery for a Millennium Fund, which will both celebrate this trick
of the calendar, and leave lasting memorials for the pleasure of future
generations.
Just how impressive they will be depends on the gambling instincts of the
British public. The most cautious estimate, favoured by Peter Brooke,
secretary at the department of National Heritage and the minister
responsible for launching the Lottery, anticipates annual turnover of Pounds
1.5b, of which around 25 per cent is to be split between five good causes -
the arts, sport, heritage, charities, and the Millennium Fund. This would
leave the fund around Pounds 75m a year to distribute.
Optimists think Brooke is too conservative. They estimate that the lottery
could build up to at least Pounds 3b a year, giving the Fund over Pounds
150m. The seven Millennium Fund commissioners, who along with Brooke and
Michael Heseltine will decide how the money is spent, have now been chosen.
They are a carefully mixed group, with Lord Dalkeith based in Scotland, Sir
John Hall in the north east, Robin Dixon in Northern Ireland, and so on,
with journalist Simon Jenkins supplying the metropolitan touch. In the
summer they will issue guidelines for prospective beneficiaries. Early next
year, when the lottery comes on stream, they will announce the chosen
projects.
The commissioners plan to be independently minded and relish their freedom
from government interference. But Brooke, who chairs the fund, has admitted
to a few prejudices which might influence their thinking. For a start
millennium projects must be spread around the country. Brooke also wants
them to be limited to half a dozen, perhaps eight, major developments which
will leave a real mark on the 21st century.
The commissioners are unlikely to be too impressed by the barrage of arts
applications. As well as the London based projects, Cardiff hopes to receive
around Pounds 30m for an opera house on its revitalised Bay; Glasgow expects
that, as the recently appointed home of the planned Museum of Scottish Art,
it is in the frame for roughly the same sum; the Salford Opera House is up
and running; and there is a plan to convert the Baltic Flour Mill on the
Tyne into a museum of contemporary art for a modest Pounds 10m.
Although there will be undoubtedly be cultural beneficiaries from the fund,
the commissioners are keenly aware that their money comes from the bets of
the man in the street and they want to spread the benefits fairly. Arts
organisations may have been the first to throw their hats in the ring but
many punters will regard sport as equally in need of new facilities and will
favour Manchester's bid for a national sports arena. And what of the
villages and small towns away from the big cities: how will the buyers of
lottery tickets there benefit from the fund?
The commissioners are open to ideas. They could look kindly on a major
engineering project, a new bridge across the Forth, the Mersey, the Avon, or
the Thames. They might well want to stimulate the nation's engineers and
scientists with a millennium scholarship fund. Environmentalists are
lobbying for a new national forest, or perhaps a complete pathway round the
coast. The nation's greatest heritage site, Stonehenge, could finally
receive the protected setting its fame deserves.
There is also the idea, from the Royal Society of Arts, for a Festival 2001
which would encourage 2001 initiatives at grass roots level. The RSA was the
force behind the Great Exhibition of 1851, and the Festival of Britain a
century later, and its plan to let ordinary people achieve their ideals will
be taken seriously. The 1851 Great Exhibition gave the nation the South
Kensington museums; the 1951 show, the South Bank arts complex.
The RSA expects that the grass roots initiatives will attract money locally
and be topped up by the fund. This is also the thinking behind Covent
Garden's re-development proposal, which has been promised multi-million
pound donations from Lord Sainsbury and Vivien Duffield, and that of the
Tate Gallery. Brooke has said he will favour projects that can prove their
popularity by attracting money from supporters.
London cannot walk away with much more of the funding than its population
deserves, plus perhaps a little more as the nation's showcase, and already
some London based projects are planning life without millennium money. These
alternatives also tend to revolve around the lottery, but involve the slices
of its revenue to be distributed to the arts, by the Arts Council, and the
heritage, via the National Heritage Fund. Covent Garden and the South Bank
are eyeing the arts pot, although the belief is that the Arts Council will
look after the smaller, under Pounds 10m, development projects. The Heritage
Fund might consider the Tate, or even Albertropolis within its remit.
There is also the possibility of joint applications. The Tate Gallery should
announce this month its preferred site for its new museum, with the
abandoned Bankside power station on the Thames the front runner. But if the
vacant spot alongside the South Bank was chosen instead there could be a
joint regeneration scheme for this key site with the South Bank Centre,
stressing its importance as the first glimpse of the UK for travellers
arriving at Waterloo Station, the rail arrival point for Euro Tunnel.
The commissioners have plenty of options but not much time. Their task will
be completed at the end of 2000, when, in theory, their fifth of the
National Lottery revenue gets re-distributed among the four remaining worthy
causes. They will want to get the major projects underway next year. But,
given the national fondness for a gamble, it is quite possible that by the
late 1990s they will be receiving larger tranches of money than they
currently anticipate.

FT  23 APR 94 / Arts: Not Wilde about Lady Windermere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most welcome features of British theatre in the 1990s has been
the number of big productions of Oscar Wilde's plays. An Ideal Husband, A
Woman of No Importance, Salome, and, of course, The Importance of Being
Earnest have all been seen in the West End and on tour. Now, to complete the
set of Oscar's five main plays, the Birmingham Rep has launched a new
production of Lady Windermere's Fan, his first theatrical triumph. Philip
Prowse (who staged the RSC/West End Woman of No Importance) directs and
designs. The staging will tour, and may reach the West End.
Several of Wilde's plays deal with the mysteries of lost parents or
children; but, again, his treatment of this theme is more daring in the
early comedies. In The Importance, he keeps us in standard suspense about
Jack Worthing's birth until the end. In Lady Windermere and Woman of No
Importance, however, he lets us into the secret earlier on, for he has more
important matters than suspense on his mind: he wishes us to attend to how
these characters behave with their several secrets.
Philip Prowse, however, takes a different line. He has not only staged Lady
Windermere, he has adapted it fairly considerably. In particular, he tries
to keep the audience from knowing the mystery of Mrs Erlynne's connection to
the Windermeres until the last act. I cannot say I care for this device. The
beauty of Wilde's last act should be in the delicacy with which we see the
Windermeres and Mrs Erlynne negotiating the several problems of which we are
already aware. Here, however, everything is put off-balance by the delayed
revelation of Mrs Erlynne's identity - which makes Wilde's play a much more
conventional affair.
This staging, as always with Prowse, is strong on glamour. But the more of
Prowse's work you see, the more samey it becomes. Black, gold, and red; he
cannot keep away from this scheme, even though he dilutes it with paler
colours for the Windermeres' home.
Everyone's deportment is beautiful, which really helps the play. But Lady
Windermere's party is stony and dull, and the supporting characters wield
their witticisms not like stilettos but like bludgeons. Wilde was certainly
prepared to criticise wit and to show it discomfited - a rare feat in which
he resembles Shakespeare, Moliere, Congreve, Jane Austen and almost no one
else - but why has Prowse edited away some of the party's witty small talk?
In these conditions it is impossible for the leading five actors to present
the full dimensions of Wilde's play. Francesca Annis is nonetheless a fine
Mrs Erlynne, marvellously elegant in voice and person. She emphasises the
sinister 'other woman' effect that this character makes at first, but she
plays her big scene with Lady Windermere with surprisingly quiet eloquence;
and the different emotions that she keeps beneath her perfect social veneer
become superbly apparent in Act IV. And Frank Middlemass, as her devoted
dupe Lord Augustus, is so natural that wherever he is seems the most
convincing part of the room.
Amanda Elwes and Rupert Frazer have all the poise for the Windermeres, but
neither of them releases all the emotional intensity that is so crucial to
these characters. Simon Dutton, as Lord Darlington, makes a very persuasive
alternative suitor for Lady Windermere. But he and Windermere are so serious
that we cannot believe they would socialise with the two-dimensional dandies
around them. The dandies need more depth, and the rival lovers more wit, if
all the facets of Wilde are to fall into place. In short, this staging is
not yet fully alive on its own terms, let alone Wilde's.
At the Birmingham Rep until May 14, then on tour

FT  23 APR 94 / Arts: Pirouetting out of fashion - The ballerina seems to be
a dying breed, laments Clement Crisp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is rather like calling a private soldier a general. When a dancing girl
hits the headlines, the perkier journals invoke the word 'ballerina' - as in
'Ballerina in Royal love-nest mercy-dash'. The facts (to coin a phrase) will
reveal that the 'ballerina' is no more than young Tiffany Plinth from the
corps de ballet.
But such is the resonance of this glamour-word that it has to be used to set
the reader salivating. And, like gay and model and democratic, it is now
almost meaningless. In those curious columns in the papers which tell us of
people's birthdays every female dancer becomes a ballerina, and one, plainly
in the grip of dementia praecox, annually declares herself 'prima ballerina
assoluta'.
But 'ballerina' still has meaning, as an honourable and thrilling
identification of worth and artistry. Most ballet companies now call their
leading dancers 'Principals'. One of the reasons I love the Paris Opera is
that its first dancers are identified as etoiles and are starrily treated as
such. Not so long ago, etoiles would refuse to share choreography with
artists of lower rank in the elaborate Opera hierarchy, and I hope the
female etoiles still have their own splendid dressing-rooms. (One that
Makarova - now there was a ballerina] - used as guest at the Opera was like
a suite in a good hotel.)
Happily, there still are authentic and radiant ballerine to command our
admiration, just as, in the heyday of ballerina-dom, their ancestresses
ruled the 19th century stage in triumph, diamonds and a retinue of admirers.
Then, the trappings of Grand Dukes and myriad bouquets (concealing gems, of
course) were an extra manifestation of their identity as motive force for
the ballet of their age. The old repertory we still cling to - the Petipa
spectaculars - were hymns to the ballerina principal: without that
glittering technical and emotional presence at their heart, they lacked
focus. Today they look pointless if they are not given the same blaze of
interpretation. And such is the popularity of the classics that far too many
companies set out in these vehicles, with nice - oh, so nice - young women
dancing the leading roles, and expect the public to accept them as Daimlers
rather then the Robin Reliants they all too plainly are. It is a confidence
trick played on the public, a duck-pond pretending to be Swan Lake.
I have lately been watching two of today's most compelling ballerine,
rightful heirs of the great tradition - Ludmila Semenyaka, touring as a
guest with Scottish Ballet, and Elisabeth Platel of the Opera. Both
exemplify the idea and ideal of a ballerina. Both are products of systems
that know how to nourish this increasingly threatened breed.
With Semenyaka's dancing we see the wisdom and the noble aspirations of
Russian ballet. Exquisite physique has been refined by Petersburg training;
in her performance as Aurora we see the grace of technical means and formal
dignity that comes from rare talent enhanced by study with the greatest
ballerine of earlier generations - Semenyaka, at the height of her powers,
still consults Ulanova and Semyonova. Thus the disciplines of classicism
free the dancing body and the interpretative soul.
In Platel's art every virtue of the French style is plain: schooling that
insists upon utmost elegance of statement, upon sweetest technical mastery,
upon chic that polishes every movement, upon harmonies that are the heart of
academic dancing. There result performances with a clarity and purity which
tell of dance unalloyed and radiant, a parure of diamonds.
Both artists have colleagues no less securely and splendidly ballerine.
Training in Paris, in Petersburg and Moscow, its historical precedent and
present understanding, seems to inspire generations of grandly gifted young
women. Alas, I can think of few other worthy candidates for the ballerina
accolade, though the first among them must be the lustrous, divinely musical
Kyra Nichols with New York City Ballet.
Is the ballerina a doomed species? The box office knows that the public
still has the appetite for these stellar figures, and while the old
repertory survives - despite the attentions of Frankenstein producers and
designers - their place is secure. But the ballerina's world is shrinking,
as less and less of today's choreography challenges or justifies her.
The last choreographer to understand the ballerina was Sir Kenneth
MacMillan. Romeo and Juliet, Manon, Anastasia, Isadora all extended the
range of the three-act ballet, and hence of the ballerina's powers, and it
was significant that MacMillan's final big work, The Prince of the Pagodas,
identified the ballerina-potential of young Darcey Bussell, both on
immediate choreographic terms, and in references to Sleeping Beauty and that
classic's significance for the history of the Royal Ballet and its
erst-while ballerine, from Fonteyn onwards. That MacMillan's three-act works
are sought and staged throughout the world suggests how great is the
public's appetite for works which show a ballerina in glory.
She will survive; while ballet survives, she must survive. There is a duty
for ballet companies and their schools to make sure she survives. Not to see
the ballerina in full and tremendous cry (and step), is not to see ballet.

FT  23 APR 94 / Books: Bilious brew of theatrical passion - After reading
this 'vivisection' of the theatre Richard Eyre feels a director's life is
safer than a critic's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EYRE

<TEXT>
THE AISLE IS FULL OF NOISES by Michael Coveney Nick Hern Books Pounds 12.99,
209 pages
At a certain point in your professional life, you can be spotted in the
corner of a bookshop, engaged in a solitary vice. You cannot stop yourself.
You lift a copy of a newly published book of memoirs, and, after looking
guiltily about you, turn to the index to seek your name. You face the shame
of exclusion, or the shard of ice through the heart provoked by a slighting
mention of yourself. Mercifully, Michael Coveney's 'vivisection of live
theatre' gave me neither sensation - which may not be a recommendation to
some people.
Christopher Hampton's perspective of critics is that one should view them as
lamposts do dogs, but I have never developed such a robust diffidence; I am
even guilty of some backsliding curiosity. In the past year I have read
three books by theatre critics about their profession: either they have
developed a contagious urge to unburden themselves of their trade secrets,
or publishers have sensed that, like me, lamposts cannot resist reading
about themselves.
Irving Wardle of The Independent on Sunday has written about the noble art
of theatre criticism in a characteristically thoughtful, dogged apologia pro
sua vita; Michael Billington - The Guardian - has published a collection of
a thousand encounters with pen and pad, One Night Stands, an excellent
history of a thousand and one nights of theatrical passion; now Michael
Coveney - The Observer - has given us an enjoyable glimpse behind the front
lines into his professional (and private) habitat.
Coveney describes his book, correctly, as a geological survey. He delves
into the stratification of the theatrical landscape, deftly stopping off on
the way at his childhood, adolescence, and birth of his career. Invariably,
childhood is the most interesting part of a memoir: the writer is unformed
and uncorrupted by the desire to impress. The child is always the father of
the man and in Coveney's collecting of autographs, programmes and handbills,
acquired with the voraciousness of the train-spotter, one sees the
remorseless enthusiasm for theatre which is essential for any successful
theatre critic. Only the optimism of a true fan can sustain so many nights
of travelling in hope and arriving in disappointment.
The theatre critic's life is a solitary one. The ais1e may be full of
noises, but they seldom seem to be comradely greetings. The corps de
critiques is not a clubbable lot; they sniff at each other like dogs marking
out their territory, and Coveney's often acerbic wit is brought to bear on
his fellow critics, some of whom have given up the trade, and some he
devoutly wishes would do so: he is engagingly bilious about the absurd
pretensions of Bernard Levin, and the lofty disdain of John Gross.
I am not sure that his current colleagues will thank him for his sometimes
droll, and often acidic, observations on their idiosyncrasies (varied),
dress sense (poor) and their manners (bad), but I, at least, was grateful
for his chastisement of those who gracelessly sit on their hands during
curtain calls, or run self-advertisingly for the exits as if their trousers
were on fire.
This book is essentially a collection of good and sometimes provocative
essays with a narrative framework supplied by the calendar a 'year of only
average significance, but the same could be said of any other theatre year'.
The topics covered embrace violence in the cinema, multi-ethnic casting, the
work of Robert Lepage, the Edinburgh Festival, New York theatre, Sarajevo,
and the contested merits of the plays of David Hare and the music of Andrew
Lloyd-Webber. Coveney is spirited in his championship of a medium often
mocked by his fellow journalists, and is not afraid to fight for the serious
assessment of theatre by the press who, by reviewing less and abandoning
over-night notices, have let criticism dribble into a stream of previews,
and have diminished its power to influence by playing into the hands of the
PR claque.
The essays are laced with personal anecdotes that are often funny, but
sometimes veer rather less towards La Recherche du Temps Perdu than towards
Jennifer's Diary. I do not know how interested I am in Coveney's journey
with the RSC's chauffeur, or his jogging encounter on Hampstead Heath with
Max Stafford-Clark but I much enjoyed his description of getting drunk
during a water shortage in Saint Lucia and exposing himself unwittingly to
his motherin-law, and his encounter with Mike Leigh on another small holiday
island. He dines, starstruck, with Peter Brook, parties with real royalty at
Buckingham Palace, with showbiz royalty at Cameron Mackintosh's house and
Andrew Lloyd-Webber's stately home, and slums it in Hammersmith with
commoners like myself.
Being a theatre critic involves sitting, night after night, writing in the
dark. It is a job, like any other, with its routines, its trials, its
pleasures and its occupational hazards - getting abused by John Gale, mocked
by Ned Sherrin, and pinned against the wall by an indignant Juliet
Stevenson. Michael Coveney convincingly conveys enthusiasm for this way of
life, but I think I'll stick to directing; the worst that can happen to you
is a bad review.

OUR FATHER by Marilyn French Hamish Hamilton Pounds 14.99, 450 pages
LOST CHILDREN by Maggie Gee Flamingo Pounds 14.99, 320 pages
Relationships between fathers and daughters are at least as interesting, yet
less frequently explored, than those between mothers and daughters. This is
partly because of the long hegemony of Freudian theory, which restricted
discussion to the girl's supposed penis envy and ignored the father's
potential as a role model for daughters as well as sons.
Now Marilyn French, author of the feminist novel of the late 1970s, The
Women's Room, has plunged deep into the heart of this neglected territory
with her new novel. Our Father brings together four very different women who
gather round the deathbed of their dying parent, one of the richest and most
powerful men in the US.
The eldest daughter is unmarried, a fiftysomething economist and leading
figure in the Reagan administration. The second is a professional wife,
married three times but now husbandless and deeply in debt. The third is a
housewife; the fourth the illegitimate offspring of the dying man's Mexican
housekeeper.
It should by now be apparent that French's novel is designer fiction,
artlessly displaying a choice of female types with whom to identify. Each
woman has a different mother and a different grievance, not enough attention
from Daddy or too much of the wrong sort; inevitably, two of them were
sexually abused by the patriarch and another turns out to be a lesbian. They
sneer, feud and spring-clean the neglected mansion in which he spent his
declining years, talking tough but entirely failing to conceal the novel's
marshmallow sentimentality and moral slipperiness.
Our Father cannot quite make its mind up where it stands on wealth and
power, at one moment mocking the mores of the very rich and a moment later
fawning on the very same people. It is the author who seems to be most in
awe when someone takes a condolence call and announces improbably: 'Margaret
Thatcher, deeply concerned'.
The English novelist Maggie Gee has also put the family under the microscope
in her novel, Lost Children. Everything falls apart for Gee's protagonist,
Alma, when her teenage daughter runs away from home; Alma's reaction is to
boot out her dreary husband Paul and take a job with an estate agent in the
London suburb where she has lived all her life. She even toys, somewhat
ineptly, with the idea of taking a lover.
Like Marilyn French, Gee clearly wants her novel to be a warts-and-all
dissection of the family. We hear about Alma's childhood, her inability to
please her mother and her fear of her loud, exacting step-father. There is a
hint of sexual abuse, which emerges when Alma and Paul attend a couples
therapy session at Relate.
The novel book is written in flat, dreary prose interspersed with
quasi-philosophical ramblings which reveal that Gee, like French, has a
heart of pure caramel: 'What if we are the kind of creature we dream of
being, finding the grey defeated sister (so badly married, so beaten down) a
child again, straight and slim, doing handstands in the dandelions down the
green back garden?'
Both novels have as their theme the idea that we are all, deep down, wounded
children. 'We never stop being babies, do we?' demands a character in Our
Father. Gee's authorial voice expresses much the same sentiment: 'Myself,
yourself, my mother, my father. Still young, still potential. All the lost
children'. Having waded through this double dose of treacle, what this
grown-up reader wanted to shout was a loud 'count me out'.

ON SECRET SERVICE EAST OF CONSTANTINOPLE by Peter Hopkirk John Murray Pounds
19.99, 384 pages
Great fiction creates its own version of history. The Russian conquest of
the Ottoman fortress of Erzerum on February 16, 1916, is familiar to most of
us, not from the war histories but from the final pages of Greenmantle, and
we shall always believe that Sandy Arbuthnot had something to do with it.
John Buchan spun one of his finest tales out of the clash of four empires -
Turkish, German, Tsarist and British - in the 'Great Game' that was waged in
the Near East, far from the bloody stalemate on the Western Front,
throughout the First War. 'There is a dry wind blowing through the East . .
.' he wrote, in the words of Sir Walter Bullivant, 'And the wind is blowing
towards the Indian border.' More precisely, said Sir Walter, 'Some star is
coming out of the West. The Germans know, and that is the card with which
they are going to astonish the world.'
End of fiction, enter Peter Hopkirk, whose latest book about the Great Game
 -On Secret Service East of Constantinople - tells the true story of Kaiser
Wilhelm's extraordinary attempt, posing as a convert to Islam, to launch a
Holy War which would drive the British out of India and their Russian allies
out of the Caucasus and Central Asia. The Kaiser understood that Britain's
empire might be vulnerable; he ordered his agents to 'inflame the entire
Moslem world against this hateful, lying and unscrupulous nation.' The Great
Game between Britain and Russia had been called off in 1907, and Buchan was
to succeed Kipling in finding romance and drama in this new chapter of the
same game, this time between Germany and Britain.
The German Drang nach Osten dated back for much of the century, when it
began to be realised that the eastern territories of the fading Ottoman
empire might become 'Germany's India.' The emergence to power in
Constantinople of Enver Pasha, with his German sympathies and his own dream
of a new Turkish empire in Central Asia, caused great alarm in London and
Delhi. If the Germans could extend a 'Holy War' into Afghanistan, the threat
would become acute.
Hence the importance of the Russian cavalry charge on Erzerum: it was the
first Allied victory of the Holy War, especially welcome after the
humiliations of Gallipoli and the defeat at the siege of Kut. Greenmantle
correctly focuses on the probability that Erzerum fell as a result of the
betrayal of its defences - a theory strengthened by the testimony of TE
Lawrence (he became a friend of Buchan). The consequence was that the
Turko-German advance on Afghanistan faltered and failed, while in 1916 the
Arab Revolt broke out, with much work for the same TEL (This book
concentrates on events east of Constantinople, excluding the Levant.)
Indeed, Hopkirk's story falls into two parts. After the events above, he
turns to the bewildering intrigues in Turkestan and the Caucasus between
1916-18, the detail of which will be obscure to most of us. There is a
fascinating cast of characters. Among the Germans there were Captain Oskar
von Niedermeyer and Wilhelm Wassmuss, whose loss of the German code books
eventually led to the deciphering of the 'Zimmerman Telegram' which was
directly responsible for bringing America into the war; among their British
opposite numbers there were Captain Edward Noel (a dead ringer for Sandy),
the Highland Chieftain Major Aeneas Ranald MacDonell, and Captain Reginald
Teague-Jones, the young British spy who, inaccurately identified with the
execution of the 26 Soviet Commissars at Baku in 1918, was obliged to spend
the next 70 years of his life under an alias.
Four empires were brought low in these years - the German, the
Austro-Hungarian, the Turkish and the Russian. The Kaiser died in Dutch
exile in 1941; Enver Pasha in 1922, leading a suicidal cavalry charge
against Bolshevik machine guns; Teague-Jones in 1988, as 'Captain Sinclair',
late of MI5. It is a remarkable story.
It has to be added that Peter Hopkirk, who has made the Great Game his
special subject - this is his fifth volume on associated themes - does not
write with the spellbinding skill of an Alan Moorhead or a Jan Morris, let
alone a John Buchan. His prose is duller than the tale deserves, he eschews
set-pieces and purple passages, but the drama of these adventures in exotic
regions carries us through very happily.

JOHN BETJEMAN: LETTERS VOLUME I 1926-1951 edited by Candida Lycett Green
Methuen Pounds 20, 584 pages
The Teddy Bear was his mascot, preservation of England's green and pleasant
land with all the Victorian buildings still standing was his passion.
Contemplation of idyllic moments in town or country shattered by the
consciousness of death was his trump-card. He played it over and over again
in his poetry. But what was John Betjeman really like? With the publication
of a volume of his letters up to 1951, we have a chance to discover.
While he was engaged to Penelope Chetwode he was also paying court to
Wilhelmine (Billa) Cresswell, who married Roy Harrod. Betjeman continued to
love the latter during his engagement to the former; and after he was
married to Penelope we have many letters here in which the poet lets his
passionate feelings about other women rip. He seems to have had a poetic
licence from his friends to write to their wives in the most intimate terms.
The poems about Myfanwy and others were not pure fantasies.
There are few letters to his own wife and those are either partly or wholly
in the stage dialect of a country yokel ('Oi love yew . . .') rendering them
difficult to interpret. Why should he wish to play-act about something so
important? The tension of what was always, we gather, a stormy marriage,
increases to breaking-strain when Penelope converts to Roman Catholicism and
Betjeman, in spite of ruthless pressure from Evelyn Waugh, stands firm
within the High Anglican fold. That was in 1949.
'It was a watershed,' his daughter Candida the editor explains, 'for it saw
the beginning of JB's being able to love other women while continuing to
love my mother'. Soon afterwards he addressed a meeting of the Poetry
Society in Swindon and spoke about Tennyson. 'Hands up anyone here from
Lincolnshire?' he said. Margaret Wintringham - 'blonde, full-bodied,
beautiful and wind-blown' - put up her hand and in spite of the fact she was
a Communist (and married) she became the object of his devotion for the next
year or so. No doubt we shall learn more about Betjeman's post-watershed
crushes when Volume Two is published.
A rather different sort of watershed occurred at Oxford when he was a pupil
of CS Lewis's at Magdalen (before Lewis had been surprised by Joy). At
tutorials Betjeman mobbed Lewis up mercilessly. In the end he went too far
and got sent down. Afterwards, Lewis refused to write a testimonial for him
when he went in for a job as a schoolmaster. The slight rankled for years. A
letter to Lewis, written in 1939 when Betjeman was a mature successful
writer, attempts to excuse his behaviour on the grounds of indignation that
Lewis, who lived in one of the most beautiful buildings in Oxford, should
have been so lacking in visual sense that he failed to appreciate it. This
letter appears never to have been sent.
Such arrogance is fortunately rare. Most of the time Betjeman was an amusing
high-spirited and charming letter-writer, an energetic correspondent even
when burdened by a full-time job, or working as a book-reviewer of trashy
books, on the Daily Herald. His letters are full of jokes and ad hoc rhymes
frequently embellished by little drawings, happily reproduced in the book.
He enjoyed teasing, penning letters purporting to be from people he had
invented or real ones; and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the
spoof letter from the genuine article.
Aspects of his career may be traced in sequences of letters to individual
correspondents - his poetry in those to Jock Murray, his early broadcasts in
those to George Barnes of the BBC, his work for the Shell Guides in those to
Jack Beddington, the innovative publicity director, and to John Piper with
whom Betjeman closely collaborated on the Guides. Betjeman would take
infinite trouble over the most routine letter. One, accompanying a
manuscript returned to its author, amounts to an essay and reading-list on
poetic technique. The arrival of an envelope penned by Betjeman (he insisted
it should be pronounced ON-velope) must have given great anticipation of
pleasure to the addressee.

the Sino-British pact

EXPERIENCES OF CHINA by Percy Cradock John Murray Pounds 19.99, 276 pages
It is rare in Britain for senior civil servants to publish their memoirs. In
the past decade, Clive Ponting, a former senior defence department official,
wrote a book after he blew the whistle on the sinking of the Belgrano in the
Falklands War and fought off a government attempt to convict him under the
Official Secrets Act. Now, for reasons more to do with reputation than
conscience, a most unlikely and considerably more senior Whitehall figure
joins ranks with Ponting. He is Sir Percy Cradock, adviser to two prime
ministers on foreign affairs, head of Britain's secret intelligence
community for most of the 1980s, and former ambassador to China and East
Germany.
Sir Percy - who retired from the civil service in May 1992 - first flickered
across the consciousness of the British public in December that year when he
appeared on the BBC's Newsnight programme to denounce British policy on Hong
Kong. There he vigorously criticised Chris Patten, the colony's governor,
for embarking on confrontation with China and in so doing changing the
policy of accommodating China which he, Sir Percy, had devised a decade
earlier when he was still our ambassador at Beijing.
What brought this man from the background to the foreground of public life
and onto the nation's television screens was the accusation, published in
The Times, that British policy pre-Patten had been pusillanimous. Sir Percy
was the architect of that policy. It was his hand that guided negotiations
which culminated in 1984 with the signing of the Sino-British Joint
Declaration - a treaty in which China undertook to preserve Hong Kong's way
of life for 50 years after 1997, the year of the hand over.
Experiences of China, thinly disguised as a memoir, is his defence of that
strategy and of subsequent British policy until his retirement. As a memoir
it is almost wholly unrevealing of the author, except for his inability to
disguise a certain fussy, 'mother knows best' intolerance of those who do
not share his views. The first 158 pages concern Sir Percy's career in China
as a British diplomat during the 1960s and 1970s. Interesting to his
colleagues as they may be, they add little to our understanding of China
under either Mao or Deng that could not be found elsewhere.
It is, however, the last 100 pages for which Sir Percy will be remembered.
Until 2009, when the documents of the period will begin to become available,
this is likely to remain the only first hand account of Britain's Hong Kong
diplomacy by so central a participant. This diplomacy began in 1979 with the
trip to Beijing - when Cradock was ambassador - by Sir Murray MacLehose,
Hong Kong's then governor, where the issue of Hong Kong was first raised
formally; to the author's last official trip to the Chinese capital on the
eve of his retirement as foreign policy adviser in May 1992.
The main argument supporting this narrative is that the lease covering 98
per cent of Hong Kong's territory was due to expire on June 30 1997, making
the continuance of British rule of the remaining 2 per cent untenable.
Furthermore, Britain, which had used military power to wrest Hong Kong from
a decaying imperial China 150 years before, did not possess the power to
retain its colony in the face of resurgent and unified Communist China.
The policies pursued - characterised by 'patient private negotiation' -
produced the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, and, after the Tiananmen
massacre of June 1989, agreements to increase democracy in Hong Kong and
secure a new airport. As befits a former Cambridge law don, Sir Percy argues
his case persuasively. But in the end he fails to convince. The devil
resides in the detail and no more so than in the case of Hong Kong's
transfer to China. Sir Percy manages (to use the Foreign Office's favourite
verb) to elide the most awkward parts of the story.
In particular he avoids dealing with the uncomfortable fact that Britain
conceded to China the interpretation of the Joint Declaration as soon as it
had negotiated the treaty. This is certainly the case where Hong Kong's
political development is concerned - the weakest part of the Joint
Declaration.
Sir Percy and Governor Sir David Wilson simply accepted Peking's diktat on
what constituted 'convergence'. This amounted to doing nothing to Hong
Kong's political structure with which the Chinese might disagree. It 'was
recognised at the time that there was no point, and much danger, in
developments that would be abruptly terminated on 1 July 1997,' Sir Percy
writes.
Recognised by whom? Certainly not much of Hong Kong opinion. After the
signing of the Joint Declaration Hong Kong wanted a rapid introduction of
elective democracy. According to one knowledgeable source, the policy of
convergence was a device. As Xu Jiatun, former Communist party chief in Hong
Kong, notes in his own memoirs, in 1984 'the Chinese government resolved to
adopt the 'convergence' strategy in a bid to contain the pace of political
reform.'
Sir Percy accepted this from the outset yet, like so many of accommodations
Britain made with China at the time, it was only admitted afterwards and in
this case not until 1988. This followed one of the more shameful acts of
British colonial rule - a sham poll of local opinion to determine popular
feeling towards democracy.
Sir David Wilson, Sir Percy's leading acolyte and then governor, conducted
the poll which, because of the complexity of the questionnaire, ended up
sowing confusion rather than determining truth. A signature campaign
conducted in parallel, which collected 250,000 names in favour of the early
introduction of democracy, was rejected because it was not presented on the
correct form.
Little wonder that China got such a shock when Chris Patten arrived. Early
in his career Sir Percy developed Cradock's First Law of Diplomacy. This
held that it was not the other side you had to worry about, but your own.
His memoir is an extended elaboration of this principle in ways he could not
begin to understand.

FT  23 APR 94 / Travel: Three miles into the African sky - Nicholas
Colchester suffers as he walks to the summit of Kilimanjaro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS COLCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
February is supposed to be the dry season in Tanzania. Yet Kilimanjaro,
Africa's highest mountain, remained veiled in ominous mist as we drove
towards it out of Kenya. Only when we reached its lowest slopes did the old
volcano bare a shoulder.
We piled out of the bus and gazed up at it. The ridge of ice and black lava
seemed miles up. It was in fact three vertical miles above where we stood.
What on earth had persuaded 12 tourists that they could walk up that?
The answer was Jean-Pierre Brain, a 50-year-old French insurance executive.
In normal life, he limited himself to packing opera festivals with
middle-aged friends. Now he had coaxed 11 of them, including one Englishman,
to share his mid-life crisis and climb Kilimanjaro in style.
Dressed more like a golfer than a mountaineer, Jean-Pierre thrust his jaw at
the distant summit, as if wondering whether a two-iron would do the trick.
The mountain veiled itself again, and stayed hidden from us, bar the odd
glimpse, for the next four days.
That was on a Sunday evening. By the following Thursday night two of those
three vertical miles were below us, and our doubts had become the disbelief
of people about to mount the scaffold. It was midnight. We were being given
'early morning tea' in tents perched on a ridge of shattered rock 16,000ft
up.
The incessant rain that never falls on Kilimanjaro in February had been
replaced by the driving snow that so rarely dusts its upper slopes,
according to the notes on the Ordnance Survey map. In the ghastly light of
miners' lamps strapped to our foreheads, we pulled on every stitch of
clothing we had, and struggled, sick and white-faced, out into the night.
Our capable French tour-guide, Eric Christin, had already told us what to
expect. 'We will climb steeply and slowly for seven hours. We will stick
together behind the Tanzanian guide in one group. This will require
will-power. Some of you will vomit. If you really cannot go on, tell me and
I will send you down with a guide.'
The chain-gang set off, at a pace so slow that we joked about it at first.
We climbed disembodiedly, inching our personal circles of light up a
never-ending snow-slope of 45 degrees. The huge volcanic cone of Kilimanjaro
remained invisible above and below us.
Thin and frigid air whistled in and out of our lungs, one breath per step.
The French chit-chat - a feature of the lower slopes - died. This purgatory
continued, almost without pause, for roughly the time it takes to fly the
Atlantic.
Such a trial permits only the lowest form of thought. An auctioneer from
Dijon furnished and refurnished his extensive chateau. I murmured
'Stalingrad, twice as bad,' like a mantra, remembering between throwing up
what fun this really was.
The reward came at dawn. The lip of the crater became visible not far above
us. The huge scale of what we had climbed stretched beneath us, down to the
violet mass of Africa. The sun rose behind the science-fiction peak of
Mawenzi, Kilimanjaro's little sister. By 8am our troupe had reached the rim
of the volcano at 19,000ft.
We could gaze into the snow-filled crater, and at the surreal glaciers that
surround it. This was Stella Point - but not the top. Light-headed with
pride, altitude and lack of sleep, we all elected to climb for another hour,
trudging around the rim of the crater to the summit, Uhuru Peak, at 19,385ft
the highest point in Africa.
Of the 50 other climbers who had been attempting the separate 'tourist'
route up the mountain that night, just two stumbled with us to this true
summit. Our heartiness verged on the lunatic. Two of the party collapsed on
the return march around the crater.
But then, to our great relief, it became clear why Kilimanjaro had to be
climbed at night. The equatorial sun, grilling down on us with pure
ultra-violet, had melted the top of the mountain into a great, barely
climbable mound of white slush and black volcanic sand.
The three guides seized the weakest members of our party, and ran them down
this great, soft scree like marionettes. The rest of us staggered down in
pursuit, losing 4,000 hard-won feet in just over an hour. We reached the
highest tourist refuge, Kibo Huts, at lunchtime and collapsed on to grubby
bunks for a brief doze. But our guide was relentless. The descent had to
continue for another 10 shattering miles before we reached our camp.
After 18 hours on the march, we were barely coherent. Yet we had 'done'
Kilimanjaro. This epic day was the high-point of a deluxe assault. We had
avoided the normal, much-trodden Marangu route up the mountain and had taken
the more beautiful Machame trail. This required tents and 30 porters. The
approach march was reminiscent of Nepal.
But Kilimanjaro's succession of climates - from banana groves, through
rain-forest, through a moss-zone that would delight any Japanese
temple-gardener, through Afghanistan into Antarctica - was more striking and
rapid than in the Himalaya. This is because Kilimanjaro shoots abruptly up
out of a 3,000ft plain.
Though by no means the highest, it is one of the tallest free-standing
mountains in the world. It makes its own, relatively benign, weather; and
its own flora, including peculiar Senescant trees, which populate the upper
slopes like groups of green-haired muppets.
The experience was not cheap. Our well-organised 10-day tour cost Pounds
1,000 per person, including two days recovering in Tanzania's game-parks.
Tips to the guides and porters, plus entry fees, cost another Pounds 200.
The flight cost Pounds 500. And town-dwellers like us had to spend at least
Pounds 200 each buying cold-weather clothes, sleeping bags and so forth. The
only mountaineering equipment needed was Diamox, a pill that stops altitude
sickness.

FT  23 APR 94 / Travel: Over Oman and round the bend - Nick Haslam flies
across mountain and desert to the isolated, ancient villages at the tip of
the Gulf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK HASLAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Violently buffeted by up draughts, the Twin Otter dipped and soared crazily.
My neighbour, an Omani businessman in blue dish-dasha and white headscarf,
peered out of the window. 'There,' he said. 'There is the village where I
was born.'
Below, high bare mountains dropped down to the Arabian Gulf. Tucked under
one cliff, I could just make out small, white houses strung along a narrow
strip of beach, with boats drawn up. We were flying over Musandum, the
northern-most province of Oman, a rocky peninsula which juts out into the
Straits of Hormuz.
Separated from the rest of Oman by the United Arab Emirates, Musandum had,
until 1970, been a largely forgotten enclave. With high mountains intercut
with long deep ravines, its few villages were accessible only by sea, and
had changed little since the Middle Ages.
But when the conservative Sultan Said was deposed and his son, Sultan
Oaboos, took over, Oman was catapulted into the 20th century. A coastal road
to Musandum through the UAE was completed in 1980, and schools and a small
hospital built in the provincial capital of Khasab.
We landed on an airstrip in a deep wadi that ran down to the sea, and were
driven into Khasab, the narrow road winding between mud-brick houses. It was
Friday, and the call to prayer echoed from the mosque around the steep
mountains behind the town.
Groups of young men in dish-dashas walked hand-in-hand through palm groves
to the mosque, and women, covered from head to foot and wearing the birka, a
leather face-mask which leaves only the eyes exposed, stood gossiping in
dusty side streets.
Dominating the beach was a fine mud-brick fort, which could have come
straight from the pages of Beau Geste. It was built by the Portuguese in the
early 17th century as part of a chain of posts which controlled the trade
between India and Arabia through the Straits of Hormuz. Its cannons still
point across the bay, where graceful crescent-shaped booms, the traditional
trading and fishing boats of the Arabian Gulf, lie at anchor.
We drove that afternoon up through the wadi Khasab, snaking along the dry
riverbed at the bottom of the steep dry hillsides, and then climbed a near
perpendicular track to the summit of Jabal Al Harim, one of the highest
mountains of Musandum.
We passed through villages of simple stone houses built into the side of
cliffs, and children rushed out to wave as we passed by for few vehicles
come this way. At the pass, a group of shepherds wearing cloaks of
sheepswool, warming their hands around a fire, beckoned us to join them.
Near the fire, drying on a frame, was the skin of recently killed animal. I
asked what it was. A lynx, they said. It had been eating their sheep. They
also said there were leopards in the mountains. Below us, jagged valleys
fell away in folds and a cold wind swept up from the Arabian Gulf.
We stayed at the Khasab hotel, and that night its bar filled with Omanis.
Moharned, a building contractor, told me over a beer that this was the only
place in town where he could drink alcohol legally. 'It is better,' he said.
'This way the young peoples cannot be tempted to drink.' I nodded sagely,
knowing that Omani alcohol laws are liberal compared with those of other
countries in the Arabian Gulf.
In the morning, under a sparkling sky, we boarded a 30ft-long boom and
headed up the Khawr Ash Shamm, one of the longest fiords in Musandum, which
meanders into the mountains. The light was brilliant. Mountains ran into the
sea. As if on cue, a school of dolphins broke surface around the boat and
flying fish skittered across its wake.
A carpet had been spread under an awning, and we reclined, eating dates, and
chatted to Masood, the captain. We were going to visit his village, Nadifi,
where preparations for a wedding were being made. The village, a cluster of
white single-storey houses, stood at the top of a shallow beach.
Accessible by sea alone, it had the tranquil air that only places which have
never seen the motor car can have. We came ashore and were welcomed by
village men who were rehearsing wedding dances in the shade of an acacia
tree. Abdullah, the groom, came to greet us, and invited us into his house
for coffee.
We sat cross-legged in the cool interior, and ate oranges and hareeth, a
porridge flavoured with chicken. The wedding was two days hence, but
excitement ran through the village. Little girls, their eyes made up with
kohl, came to the doorway and peered coquettishly at us. In the courtyard,
women with handsome Semitic features were preparing food for the feast.
Abdullah told me that he had met his bride at another wedding, and that,
unusually, she was from a different tribe. They had met only two or three
times, and negotiations over the dowry had dragged on for months. Finally,
Abdullah would pay her parents 1,500 riyals (nearly Pounds 3,000) in gold
and fine clothes.
As we spoke, a delegation from the bride's village arrived in some style, in
a powerful speedboat bedecked with flags, to discuss final details of the
wedding. Reluctantly, we left them exchanging greetings, and returned down
the fiord.
Our last port of call had made its mark on the English language. Rounding
the last curve before the fiord ended in a spectacular cliff, we came to
Telegraph Island. A relay station on the first cable to link London and
Bombay, the island was manned for only five years, from 1864 to 1869. The
high number of watchmen who were driven mad by the solitude and heat during
their 18-month shifts were said to have 'gone round the bend'.
It was difficult to imagine, as we lay sun-bathing at anchor on a January
afternoon with a balmy wind blowing from the mountains, that anyone could
ever tire of such an enchanted place.
Nick Haslam travelled to Oman with Gulf Airways. Apex returns start from
Pounds 750. His trip to Musandum was organised by Khasab Tours, PO Box

FT  23 APR 94 / Travel: Golf's lizard hazard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON

<TEXT>
A funny thing happened to me on the 12th fairway at the new Windsor Golf and
Country Club, just outside Nairobi. My caddy had proudly claimed that the
course was the best in Africa. When I suggested that there were some in
South Africa that might rival it, he lashed out at me. Or so it seemed.
I saw a strange creature writhing on the ground. My caddy had reacted
instinctively to a wild animal which had fallen from a tree and wrapped
itself around my neck.
'You were lucky,' said the caddie. 'This very bad animal. If it had stung
you it would have been bad for you.'
Puzzled, and slightly alarmed, I finished the round and gave my protector an
extra tip for his heroic action. When I tried to discover the creature's
identity, I was met with laughter by Charles, the club pro. 'That,' he said,
'was a harmless chameleon.' For some reason, Africans are scared of
chameleons.
Unlike the nearby course at Muthaiga, whose fairways have been attracting
golfers since the 1930s, Windsor is almost brand new, although you would not
guess it from your first glance at the course, which threads its way through
coffee farms and forest.
On a clear day you can see the snow-capped peaks of Mount Kenya. The main
hotel / club building seems to have been constructed with a built-in
turn-of-the-century patina. The designers have made use of existing trees
rather than planting new ones. And, this being Africa, colourfully-clad
women can be seen every morning weeding out long grass from the edge of the
fairways.
British Airways Holidays' golf brochure features a seven-night trip that
includes five nights' accommodation and breakfast at the Windsor Golf and
Country Club, plus a free round of golf per day, plus two nights' full board
at the Kichwa Tembo tented camp in the Masai Mara with three game drives per
day. Cost: from Pounds 854 per person. Reservations: British Airways

FT  23 APR 94 / Property: 'If we sell we sell, if we don't we don't' - Helga
Drummond recommends that house sellers appear unconcerned when they are
dealing with potential buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HELGA DRUMMOND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Successful selling in today's property market means taking charge of your
destiny.
It is vital to capitalise on potential advantages and to meet difficulties
with a clear strategy.
Success starts by choosing an estate agent carefully. How accessible is the
office? Are the displays attractive? Does the agent employ viewing staff? If
so, do they work evenings and weekends? How knowledgeable and helpful are
the office workers? Above all, how many houses a week does the agent seem to
sell?
Attracting instructions is one thing, the real sign of competence is the
proportion of 'sold' to 'for sale' signs. It is also prudent to match the
agent to prospective purchasers.
If it is an upmarket home then it may be helpful if the agent commands a
certain eclat.
Conversely, a property likely to appeal to first time buyers of modest means
requires an agent who is approachable and supportive.
Estate agents' valuations can vary tremendously so formulate your ideas
about price in advance.
Estate agents are well used to declamations such as: 'Surely it's worth more
than that]' Rarely do they meet a client who asks them to explain how they
have arrived at their valuation, still less one who produces charts and
other comparative data as a basis for discussion.
The price must combine ambition with realism.
Buyers tend to confine searches to price bands, and if you set the price
just outside the critical range you could miss your market. So find out from
the agent about local buying behaviour.
A daring ploy is to set a reasonable asking price and then advertise it as
non-negotiable. In a market where sellers are desperately under-cutting one
another and many properties are marked 'reduced,' a non-negotiable tag
arouses curiosity which is likely to produce viewers.
Further, it alleviates prospective purchasers of the need to negotiate.
Since negotiation is stressful they may be relieved by a simple 'take it or
leave it' proposition.
It may be gratifying to see your house described as a showpiece, but it is
safer to insist that the sales literature understates the property slightly.
Overstatement can lead to disappointment.
Although your estate agent's job is to represent your interests, they only
normally make money if the house is sold. The difference to the agent on a 1
per cent commission between selling a house at Pounds 100,000 and Pounds
95,000 is only Pounds 50.
Be circumspect, therefore, about what you reveal to the estate agent about
your circumstances. Apart from the danger of such information being
disclosed to the buyer, the estate agent might also try to use it to lever
you into accepting a lower offer in order to secure the sale - particularly
if you use more than one agent.
Commissions, incidentally are often negotiable though estate agents may not
advertise the fact. Beware, however, of the agent offering a slightly lower
rate on condition that you market the house at a discount. They might be
sacrificing thousands of pounds of your money in order to help them meet
their quarterly targets.
Circumspection is equally advisable when dealing with prospective buyers.
Some buyers use the viewing as an opportunity to test the vendor's
commitment to the advertised price. Oblique questions and comments are best
ignored.
Answer overt approaches with: 'Lets leave that until later shall we.' Such a
veiled warning lowers the other party's expectations without resorting to
aggression. Avoid giving any signal which might be interpreted as an
indication of flexibility.
For instance, statements such as, 'we might leave the carpets and curtains
if we get the asking price,' suggests the existence of a fallback position.
The best stance to project is: 'If we sell, we sell. If we don't we don't'
Provided such apparent unconcern is reflected in your behaviour, it will
signal to prospective buyers that there is little room for manoeuvre and may
dissuade them from even attempting to bargain.
Try and flow with the other party: if a prospective purchaser notes that the
lounge faces north, it is better to acknowledge the fact rather than try to
convince them it catches the sun all day. Argument stimulates resistance and
suspicion whereas harmony makes the other party feel in control. They are
much more likely to make buy if they feel the decision is theirs, not yours.
Although sellers are vulnerable to last-minute demands for concessions, both
parties have grown committed to the deal. Do the purchasers really want to
begin the process of house hunting again? How much are they prepared to
sacrifice in abortive surveys and search-es?
House buying involves emotions as well as money. A seller's most potent card
is the property itself.
If someone has become attached to the idea of living in your house then you
are in a strong position indeed.
Signs of commitment are often betrayed unwittingly: they are hooked if they
give one another a congratulatory hug as they walk away, or if they return
to the property, or better still, bring relatives to see it.
The best response to a demand for concessions is a show of Thatcherite
inflexibility.
Point out that the state of repair is reflected in the asking price. If the
buyers claim that they cannot afford the house or that their researchers
indicate that it is over-priced call the bluff by telling them to look
elsewhere.
You can buttress your position by invoking your solicitor. Let it be known
that you have been advised against accepting the other party's terms. This
de-personalises the issue and reflects the other side's greed back to them.
Such an initiative puts the onus back on the other party to justify every
item of its claim. If necessary, ask to see at least two detailed estimates
for every item of work they say is required, quibble over details, seek
second opinions and so on.
The aim is to wear them down by maximising delay and uncertainty.
Simultaneously, you are warning the other party that negotiations are not
going to be easy.
The ultimate protection against a bad bargain rests in the setting of limits
and the possession of alternatives. Decide in advance the lowest price you
are prepared to accept and what you will do if you fail to realise it within
a given time.
Failure is frustrating but it also creates opportunities.
Remember, pursuit of the unattainable is at the expense of the possible.

FT  23 APR 94 / Property: Shakespeare country - On the anniversary of the
bard's birth - and his death / Gerald Cadogan explores Warwickshire, the
navel of England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today is St George's Day, in honour of England's patron saint. It is also
said by many to be the anniversary of William Shakespeare's birth - and the
day he died. The greatest playwright in the English language was born at
Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, in 1564 and spent his early years there.
By the age of 30, he was established in London and a member of the Lord
Chamberlain's troupe, the capital's leading theatre company.
From 1599, he played in London's most magnificent new playhouse of the day,
the Globe in Southwark on the south bank of the river Thames. He retired to
Stratford and died there on April 23, 1616. The town celebrates him today -
as it does every April 23 - with civic pomp and a 'floral procession' to his
grave in Holy Trinity church.
Stratford has benefited enormously from the bard; without him, there would
be little of the tourist torrent that fills its coffers. There would be no
Royal Shakespeare Company and no memorial theatre where it performs. (A
summer evening treat is boating on the river Avon, ideal recuperation after
a matinee of Richard III.)
There would be far fewer shops, hotels, boarding houses and restaurants and
the home of his wife, Anne Hathaway, would be just another delightful Tudor
cottage. Nor would property prices carry the premium they do. In Stratford,
properties cost about 10 per cent more than in the rest of Warwickshire,
says James Way of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's branch in the town. Unfortunately,
there is a shortage of those pretty cottages and of good big houses.
Warwickshire's metropolis is Birmingham, Britain's second-biggest city. It
is a confusing place to drive around, so allow plenty of time for getting
lost if you do not know it and want to hear Simon Rattle conducting the City
of Birmingham symphony orchestra in the new Symphony Hall. (Alternatively,
hear them at the University of Warwick - which is in Coventry, and charges
less.) Among Birmingham's art galleries, do not miss the Barber Institute,
which has unusual works by well-known masters.
For the sporting, there are several football teams, cricket at Edgbaston or
golf at the challenging Belfry, UK venue of the Ryder Cup clashes with the
US. Inspect cars at the National Exhibition Centre or farm animals during
the Royal Agricultural Show at Stoneleigh.
Getting around Warwickshire is easy. There is the M40 that links the county
with Oxford and London; the M42 (Birmingham's eastern/southern ring road);
and the Fosse Way, the old Roman road which runs from Leicester to
Cirencester in Gloucestershire and slices through the south-east of the
county. Indeed, with most of Warwickshire not far from a motorway, this is
the navel of England.
Houses are mostly of brick as there is so much river clay. But on the
borders with Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire - the north end of the
Cotswolds - stone buildings appear. The best early brick building is
Charlecote Park which dates to the 1550s; Shakespeare is said to have
poached there.
Among brick houses for sale is Welford Hill House in Welford-on-Avon, a tall
Georgian farmhouse in 5.5 acres on higher ground with views over the Avon
valley as it meanders south-west of Stratford towards Evesham. The house
costs around Pounds 325,000 from Sedgwick Evans, which is also selling the
Mill House in the village beside a weir on the Avon for Pounds 300,000.
Other village houses in brick are the Pond House in Burmington, near
Shipston on Stour (for Pounds 320,000 from Seccombes or KFR); and Cotswolds
House at Newbold on Stour, with a handsome late-17th/18th century front
(Pounds 235,000 from KFR).
Two old stone houses are for sale in Warmington, an attractive village set
around a large sloping green on the county border north of Banbury. Savills
offers The Dene for Pounds 285,000 and Woodcote for Pounds 295,000.
Also in stone is the 1878 Salem Baptist Chapel in Little Compton, which
comes to auction - with planning permission for conversion - at 6pm on May 4
at The Fox pub in Chipping Norton (unless sold before). Joint auctioneers
John Hunt and Tayler &amp; Fletcher suggest a price of around Pounds 35,000 to
Pounds 40,000.
Howkins &amp; Harrison offers Willow Farm at Withybrook, near Rugby (which has a
good train service to London), at Pounds 220,000, while Bentley's Farmhouse
at Maxstoke, between Coventry and Birmingham, is Pounds 295,000.
The most interesting of the three is the grade II*-listed Corley Hall, near
Coventry, for Pounds 269,000. From the early 16th century, it has 17 carved
panels - mostly heads - of that date in an upstairs room.
Near Warwick, Stone Edge at Leek Wootton is a solid, early 20th century,
Lutyens-like house designed by H. Bulkeley Cresswell. At Pounds 495,000 from
Howkins &amp; Harrison, it suits a captain of industry.
If he prefers to live in Stratford, KFR offers 78 Tiddington Road for Pounds
590,000, while Sedgwick Evans has 67 Tiddington Road for Pounds 335,000.
Outside Stratford, Clifford Hill Court, in Clifford Chambers, is now Pounds
447,000 (from Pounds 475,000) with KFR. In Lower Quinton, a charming
half-timbered house made from four cottages costs Pounds 195,000 from
Sedgwick Evans.

FT  23 APR 94 / Property: Recovery is patchy in housing market - Cadogan's
Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The March figures of the Corporate Estate Agents' property index showed much
more business than in February but little change compared with March last
year. New instructions were up 15.5 per cent on February, and gross sales
(those agreed but not completed - a good forward indicator of confidence) by
9.5 per cent.
Most important - because they provide the best indication of what is
actually happening - is that completed sales were up 5.2 per cent on
February.
But March was not so rosy when compared with March last year. New
instructions were up by 5 per cent, but gross and completed sales were both
down, by 4 and 3.8 per cent respectively.
The CEA covers about half the country's agents, and stories from others
confirm this mixed picture. Some house prices have risen when there has been
competition, but many are still coming down. The market is stabilising
through a modest recovery.
Only in London have there been marked rises at the top end of the market.
Savills Prime Central London index gained 5 per cent in the first quarter,
bringing the total increase since December 1992 to 15.7 per cent.
The rise that began with large houses in Mayfair, Belgravia and
Knightsbridge has now spread to flats in Docklands, a depressed area not
long ago.
Beyond the capital, however, buyers are refusing to bite unless prices seem
reasonable, although agents report many potential purchasers on their books.
And increases in fixed-rate mortgages may be an excuse to be yet more
choosy.
The secret for vendors is not to set a price geared to their highest
expectations - or what they paid six years ago - but to choose a fair to
generous figure.
That will attract cash-conscious buyers and produce the chance of
competition, with a selling figure above the original guide price.
How much competition will there be for one of the country's best grouse
moors? Earl Peel waits to see. Through Davis and Bowring (0524 - 271 711)
and Savills (0904 - 620 731), he is selling his large Gunnerside estate in
upper Swaledale, West Yorkshire.
On offer are 26,485 acres (including 6,580 of farmland, let and in-hand)
with shooting rights over a further, heather-covered 5,670. There are eight
cottages and a 14-bedroom house.
Swaledale is right out of the television series All Creatures Great and
Small. At the bottom, grey stone walls criss-cross the green meadows with
their stone barns. Above are the wild moors, where it was snowing only a few
days ago.
Peel has worked hard to regenerate the heather, which has been affected
since 1947 by over-grazing. The government's sheep incentives have not
helped the moors, either. Now as the sheep decline, the heather is returning
although there are still 3,000 acres where it could grow again.
Shooting is as good as in the best parts of Scotland, with a variety of
drives which can be tackled on the same day thanks to new roads through the
estate. And bags have continued to get larger, reaching 4,103 brace in 1992.
Although last year was a disaster, the 10-year average is 2,324.
The estate ranges from high moors to a small upland valley where the birds
swoop suddenly over the guns who stand beside the stream. The grouse are
laying their eggs now and the main hatching time is around May 20. Peel and
his four gamekeepers must hope for a great last season before completion
next February 2.
The price needs thought. The starting figures between Pounds 70 and Pounds
75 plus VAT for shooting a brace, (or a capital value in recent large sales
of about Pounds 2,500 a brace). Then there is the farm income (Pounds 70,762
in 1992/93) and the value of a fine pheasant shoot in the low ground - not
to mention the buildings.
Hardest to assess, though, is the quality of the shooting. How much premium
will a buyer pay for that? Expect multi-million pound offers from people
prepared to continue making the heather grow and providing a habitat that
also attracts curlews, golden plovers and black grouse.

FT  23 APR 94 / How to Spend it: Avant garde for the home - A young
furniture designer who today opens his own shop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If your house is still awash with chintz and swags, with gilded putti and
grand soft sofas this piece is not for you. This is for those who are
interested in the new, the young, the experimental, who by nature veer
towards the avant-garde.
Tom Dixon, one of our most successful young furniture designers, has decided
to open a shop of his own. Like Sir Terence Conran before him, he has found
that for a designer with strong ideas of his own, there is no substitute for
one's very own retail outlet, free from the constrictions of conventional
furniture departments and the kind of mind that thinks in terms of
three-piece suites.
Tom Dixon is one of a bright young group that started work in the early 80s
and began exploring ways of turning discarded materials into things of
beauty and usefulness.
His early curving voluptuous shapes were formed from scavenged materials.
Later he moved on to sheet metal which he fashions in the studio.
Early in his career he came to the notice of an Italian manufacturer,
Cappellini, and many of his designs are now in proper production, including
his most famous design, the S-chair (photographed below left).
Now fully established with his own studio in south London he found that many
of the people working with him in the studio had bright ideas of their own
but were stumped as to how to sell them. He started by allowing them to
develop their own designs in the studio (which gives them space and
equipment) in the evenings and at weekends.
When he saw the results he realised the next thing they needed was an
outlet. Almost nobody, he feels, is prepared to stock the kind of
innovative, not too expensive designs that the young are interested in and
that his designers make.
So today, in the livelier reaches of north Kensington, he opens his own shop
called Space. The tastes and styles of the various designers vary but they
share a common interest in exploring new materials and new ways of using
them.
For instance there is furniture made from recycled plastic, (some of it, by
Jane Atfield, featured on this page earlier in the year), there is Christina
Lamiquiz's seating made from what looks for all the world like woven metal
string and is in fact stainless steel mesh and titanium and there is Hikaru
Noguchi's extraordinary fabric-covered furniture.
She has developed some flocking techniques ('borrowing,' as Space puts it,
'from the aesthetic of the Indian restaurant') which have never before been
used on upholstery - Michael Young's lozenge-shaped seats are made from foam
and then covered in it while Tom Dixon has used it to cover some of his
established classics.
Realising that some of the prices of the furniture will be beyond the reach
of the people they would most like to reach (Tom Dixon's own famous S-shaped
chair, for instance, sells for about Pounds 900, his 'crown' for Pounds 600)
they aim to keep up a steady flow of interesting, original accessories. For
the opening today, for instance, there will be rubber bathmats, some
children's furniture by Simon Maidment, candlesticks and wall brackets by
Candice Bovill Taylor.
It ought to be a good source of interesting lighting. Tom Dixon's own
experiments with covering metal structures with tissue paper will be on
sale, in particular there will be variations on the theme of his Brancusi
lighting column and the star lantern. It will also be the London outlet for
the Cappellini range of his designs.
Space, 28 All Saints' Road, London W11. Telephone 071-727-0134. Most of the
pieces can be bought by mail-order.

FT  23 APR 94 / How to Spend it: Fashion icons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Icons may seem an unlikely subject for the attention of fashionable
collectors, made as they originally were for purely devotional reasons. But
fashionable they have become. The Greek word Eikona means an image, and the
word has come to be used to embrace all those devotional portraits that were
first made in the early days of Christianity. As Christianity spread so did
the impetus to create religious images.
It is an entirely traditional art form, with all the spare beauty of early
Italian primitive paintings. Even these days, the modern icons emerging from
the monasteries and small family ateliers in eastern Europe usually follow
the traditions strictly. As they are largely unsigned, no cult has developed
around any 'name' and they are therefore judged almost exclusively on their
intrinsic artistic merits and spiritual qualities.
In eastern Europe persuading gullible tourists to buy 'genuine old' icons
seems to be a new street-spiv sport but for those who love them and like
collecting them, London is now the centre of icon-dealing in the west.
For those who want to be sure of the provenance, Maria Andipa's gallery in
Walton Street has one of the largest collections in the world, ranging in
price from Pounds 140 to more than Pounds 100,000. All are painted in the
traditional way - tempera on a wooden panel, Pounds 140 would buy a very
small (3-4 ins square) late 19th century version or it would buy one of the
many small travelling icons made in cast-brass and that were such a potent
source of first world war miracle mythology (they were the ones that worn in
the breast pocket stopped the bullet). On the other hand, Pounds 100,000
would buy a fine museum-quality large piece, dating from the 15th or 16th
century and from a very exquisite 'school'.
For those interested in the subject, the gallery will be bringing out a
brochure on the subject towards the end of next month and Maria Andipa
herself has a learned article on the subject in the current issue of
Debrett's magazine. The gallery is small but has great charm - a small
portion is designed as an old Greek church crypt.
Fair Trade Links was founded by a group of people who, while working in
Romania, decided that setting up a proper trading relationship with Romania
and bringing its wares to the west was the best way to help it recover from
the traumas of the Ceausescu regime. For those for whom antiquity is not
essential (although for me a certain history is part of their charm) these
are excellent value.
All the icons it has to offer are modern - they are the output of
monasteries, families, church restorers and painters working today. Though
contemporary they are all painted within the strict tradition handed down
from generation to generation. Icon painting was highly dangerous in the
Ceausescu years but several of the artists went on painting as an act of
devotion and gave the icons away so as not to make a profit. In particular
the diptych, which could be shut like a book, was often carried by the
devout, being much less conspicuous than a crucifix. Some artists in the
remote monasteries who find it difficult to get hold of materials now use
oil paints but those from Bucharest are painted with tempera and gold-leaf.
Prices of the modern versions range from Pounds 80 to Pounds 200 and some
can be found at Manchester Cathedral and at the Barley Hall shop in York.
The biggest selection of all is at Fair Trade Links headquarters in St
Albans. Maria Andipa &amp; Son Icon Gallery, 162 Walton Street, London SW3. Tel:

FT  23 APR 94 / How to Spend it: Old glories as new - A company that
restores everything from cups to crowns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If by any chance you have an old master lurking about the house that could
do with a good clean, a sculpture that has been bashed about or a fine piece
of porcelain that has been spoilt by a chip, then Plowden &amp; Smith are the
people for you. Restorers to many a royal palace and personage (they have
just finished creating all the new mounts and settings for the crown jewels)
there is scarcely a precious item that they cannot tackle.
Plowden &amp; Smith specialises in repairing anything from a cracked cup to a
more than life-size statue. They love a challenge and besides restoring the
old and the bashed to the good-as-new they are also experts at producing
immaculate copies of great works of art.
The Middelham jewel, for instance, found near York about 10 years ago,
declared part of the Queen's bounty, sold for Pounds 1.4m and now residing
in York museum, left its finder feeling a bit bereft. Plowden &amp; Smith came
to the rescue with a perfect copy for a fraction of the price.
Then there are stately home owners who, strapped for cash, decide to sell a
fine original sculpture, fountain or other heirloom and ask Plowden &amp; Smith
to fill the gap with a replica. The original Warwick Vase, for instance,
bought for Warwick Castle, 8ft high and around which a conservatory was
specially built, was sold by the last Earl to the Burrell collection in
Glasgow. The conservatory then looked forlorn without its pride and glory.
Madame Tussaud, the new owner of Warwick Castle, commissioned a replica
which now fills the gap.
A visit to the workshops in Putney is like browsing through a museum. On the
day I visited there was the hat Charles I gave to the people he stayed with
on his way to his execution - wonderfully embroidered in green and pink with
a metal thread running through it. Plowden &amp; Smith were fashioning a stand
for it so it could be displayed.
So impressed was I that I consigned two well-loved Mary Potter oils of my
own to their tender care - both, they told me, needed cleaning (though I had
not realised it, so slowly did all the dirt accrue). Seeing a cleaned and an
uncleaned patch side by side showed me just what 20 years in London does to
pictures - the newly cleaned pictures have gained life and vitality and are
now protected by an invisible fine protective coating.
They will mend frames and leather cases, mother-of-pearl bowls, avant-garde
sculpture, (they are trying to get hold of human nails from a mortician for
Pfeiffer, the American artist, who uses human hair and nails in his
sculptures), metal-work, furniture. The workshop houses many different
skills - for instance a military travelling companion, from 1815 and in a
poor state of repair, needed work on the wood (from the furniture
department), on the leather (decorative department), on the lock
(metal-work), on the mother-of-pearl (also decorative department) and on the
porcelain (ceramics).
One of the remorseless bits of logic in the restoration world is that it
costs as much to restore something of little value as something expensive
because the labour and often the materials are the same. There is a minimum
charge of Pounds 50 but otherwise estimates are always given in writing
before any work is embarked upon. Estimates are largely worked out on the
basis of the time it will take to do the work.
And the strangest project? 'Without a doubt,' says Anna Plowden, 'it was to
remove the mould from the human tattoos taken off French sailors at the end
of the 19th century in the Dutch East Indies. We treated it just like
leather.'

FT  23 APR 94 / Fashion: Just never mind the quality. . . - . . . feel the
designer label. Colin McDowell calls for a return to value-for-money
clothing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MCDOWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is fun - and VAT free - to laugh at the fashion victim, dressed to the
nines in a hideously unselective mixture of the most extreme of the latest
looks. But no matter how far we consider our own mode of dress to be from
the wilder shores of such lunacy, few of us are left unaffected by label
fever.
Label chic in the modern, fashion sense started in the 1970s. Then the
Italians - the most confident show-offs and entrepreneurs in Europe - came
up with a startlingly logical solution to the problem of how to let people
know that serious money had been spent on clothing: wear fashion labels on
the outside.
A rash of embroidered flashes bearing fabled names appeared on the outside
of handbags, on the cuffs and collars of garments, and across the front of
jerseys and sweatshirts. It was vulgar, but it worked.
More refinement was to come. The next stage was subtle, insider flaunting.
Nothing as obvious as the designer's name was paraded.
This time it was simply a logo that was prominently worn.
Suddenly, shirts were awash with tigers, crocodiles and polo horses. Even
the shark found itself emblazoned on a range of golf clothing. But there
were other varieties of shark patrolling the muddier waters of the rag trade
world, producing 'rip-offs' in their millions. But not even they could kill
the lure of the symbolic tag.
Today, the label has gone underground but the logo is still flourishing  -
and seems likely to continue to do so.
In the 1970s it seemed innocent and amusing but, as always, there was a
hidden agenda. As the 1980s dawned, it became clear that a new generation of
first-time buyers in the luxury market had no concept of quality. They had
no idea of how to differentiate between good and bad items - of well-cut and
properly finished garments or those that had been thrown together. The mere
inclusion of the word 'designer' was enough. It had a name, what else could
matter?
Clever advertising made new buyers aware of the talismanic quality of a
prestigious label but they had been given no concept of the quality for
which such labels should stand. It was open season for rag trade charlatans.
Ignorance is always exploited and, as the 1980s began to boom, shrewd heads
were put together in the boardrooms of Paris and Milan. They were asking the
same question: why bother with high standards if the public fails to
appreciate them?
If, as was increasingly obvious, the public was more interested in the label
than the garment, surely the next step was clear? Advertise around the name,
make the logo desirable and cut corners on production in order to keep
profits buoyant.
And, bizarre as it now seems, they were right. In the spending bonanza of
the 1980s - which, it is often forgotten, began not with property but with
fashion - the designer became pre-eminent to such an extent that even
merchandise far removed from the world of fashion jumped on the bandwagon
and 'designer label' became the buzz phrase which released 1m credit cards.
The fashion designer stopped being the humble little artisan of the past and
became the grand signeur that he is today. Furthermore, he became so
omnipotent and so valuable to society that the word 'label' seemed to be
gilding the lily. 'Designer' on a product was enough. Designer stationery,
designer bathroom accessories, even designer refrigerators were eagerly
bought for the value of that word alone.
Never have so many people been so easily separated from their money in
pursuit of a mirage.
It could not last, of course, but the fallout has. What happened in the
1980s was that quality was swallowed by hype.
The 1990s have seen no call for its return. Even value for money has now
become a nebulous concept. Buttons that fall off at first wearing, linings
that slip and hang below jackets, polyester priced as if it were top-quality
silk . . . these faults are increasingly accepted as the norm.
The fashion industry is in disarray. Economic confusion is found at all
levels. Now is the time for consumers to exert their power. We can bring
back quality by demanding value for money. After all, we were the ones who
threw it out in the first place. We will be doing the fashion industry a
favour as well as ourselves.

FT  23 APR 94 / Fashion: Build a new look with antique clothes - What was
chic in 1910 can look wonderful in 1994. Jane Mulvagh rummages along the
rails at London's best old clothes shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It can be extremely distressing to pay Pounds 500 or more for a special
outfit only to find that it becomes a hit for the retailers and many other
people are wearing it too.
One of the fundamental roles of dress, particularly dressing-up, is that it
distinguishes you. So finding yourself just one of a crowd spoils the fun.
A way out of this trap is one-off dressing. By trawling through some of the
myriad antique clothes shops and auction room sales you can bypass
uniformity.
It is best to ferret around on a regular basis and not leave it until you
are in dire need of an outfit - that is when mistakes are made.
Your approach can be either that of the collector, who ignores high fashion,
or simply an amateur seeking to mirror current fashions with antique
originals.
This is a particularly appropriate time to try this as many period
silhouettes, textures and textiles are a la mode. Nubbly, open-work crochet
is favoured by Moschino, Christian Lacroix and John Rocha this season, so
why not buy the Edwardian original?
A cream openwork tabard, dated 1910, was sold this week at Christie's South
Kensington, London, for Pounds 187.
The slightly louche femininity afforded by bias-cut chiffon has reached cult
status - thanks to John Galliano and Valentino. For half the price you can
find 1920s and 1930s originals which are far more beguiling, the old printed
chiffons being much more subtly-hued than latterday versions.
The latest collections from Jean Paul Gaultier and many others, took us on a
National Geographic tour of the far east, particularly Tibet and Mongolia.
But why not buy a 19th century Mandarin's quilted silk jacket instead?
Pictured here are just a few pieces discovered during a single week.
You have to shop on spec, for the one-off is quickly sold.
Try to team a spectacular period piece with modern accessories - for
example, a naive, cream 1920s girl's dress with silvery platform sandals to
create the look of an ingenue - otherwise one looks more like a dusty Miss
Havisham or an extra who has wandered away from a film set.
The best haunts in London are Virginia's Antiques, The Gallery of Antique
Costume &amp; Textiles, Lunn Antiques, The Chenil Galleries, Cornucopia and the
regular costume and textile sales at Christie's.
Virginia's is an outstanding treasure trove. The eponymous owner, a 1960s
actress, is an inspiring role model and the supermodels, notably Naomi
Campbell, frequently buy from her, knowing that, in spite of the increasing
homogeneity of international fashion, they will stand out as originals.
Virginia selects period costumes but, if they are neither sexy nor winningly
pretty, no matter how historically important, she does not buy.
On a recent visit, the stock, which changes weekly, if not daily, included
two Proustian-pink gaufrage velvet 1920s opera coats, which could be updated
with silver leggings; at least half a dozen bias cut chiffon dresses which,
with the addition of a slip and laced La Goulou boots, could take you from a
lunch party to a ball; a beaded Dorothy bag, which I longed to fasten to the
belt loops of a pair of jeans as an unexpected version of the 'bum-bag'; and
a white lawn camisole which, peeping from under a strict suit for the
office, would immediately create the softer look that many working women
seek.
Prices range from Pounds 40 for a piece of silk lingerie to Pounds 1,000 for
a mussel-shell black and anemone pink, cut-velvet, fringed shawl that made
me weak at the knees with longing.
The Gallery of Antique Costume &amp; Textiles provides not only museum-bound
Victoriana but also unexpected treasures, such as a faded indigo cambric
child's dress for Pounds 40. It is particularly good on Chinoiserie: there
were at least six quilted Oriental jackets on a recent visit.
In addition, the proprietor produces a limited range of new pieces cut from
antique textiles along period lines. The choice is determined by both the
best-sellers in the shop and the whims of fashion.
Lunn Antiques is the ultimate lingerie paradise. Row after row of
immaculately ironed whites - camisoles, cami-knickers, petticoats - silk and
satin underwear and the odd pre-war riding habit, tea dance dress or 19th
century linen farmhand's smock.
Juliet Lunn's taste conjures up a wayward Thomas Hardy maiden who has
wandered into Jean Harlow's boudoir.
The Chenil Galleries, abutting the Town Hall on the Kings Road, houses three
costume stalls. Stock ranges from the frankly tatty to 1920s beaded shifts
that are destined for Oscar ceremonies. It is a favourite haunt of film
stars as well as collectors. But, unlike Virginia's or Lunn's, the service
is slapdash and surly; no effort is made to offer reassuring advice or weed
out the rags from the riches.
Cornucopia is just that - charity shop bric-a-brac alongside haute couture.
Over the years this scruffy emporium has yielded numerous couture pieces
from Balenciaga to Paquin.
It stocks endless amusing gew-gaws that perk up an old dress. Reflecting the
extremely reasonable prices (from Pounds 2 to Pounds 500), be prepared for a
real rummage, and pencil an entire afternoon into your diary. The service is
exemplary.
Christie's is auctioning an embarrassment of riches on June 21. It is an
extensive haute couture collection spanning four decades and was owned by
the late Mrs Heard de Osborne.
A score of Balenciagas, a few Givenchys, 14 Saint Laurents, one sequined
Pucci and one unworn Christian Lacroix are for sale alongside Ferragamo and
Roger Vivier shoes and various accessories.
Antique garments will stay with you, loved and complimented, for many years.
They become a shibboleth of your own look, rather than the passing,
expensive vagaries of designer fashion.

FT  23 APR 94 / Sport: England are licked into shape by Lara - Cricket / A
look back at Caribbean Tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
England may have left the West Indies yesterday vanquished 3-1 in the Test
matches, but it was a series of chasms and summits. Already two-nil down by
mid-March, England sank to their lowest ebb in Trinidad when their batting
was blitzed by a sensational spell from Curtly Ambrose, probably the best
fast bowler that has ever lived, certainly the tallest.
England responded by sending 7,000 reinforcements to yell encouragement in
Barbados, and this spurred Alec Stewart to his two centuries in the match
and England to their first win in Bridgetown for 59 years.
And then came the small matter of Brian Charles Lara. Compact and chunky,
like many old batting kings - Donald Bradman, Len Hutton, Sunil Gavaskar -
Lara is the man with the most voracious appetite for batting in world
cricket. He toyed with the England attack for close on 27 hours over the
five Tests, and could not be contained.
The wagon-wheel scorechart for his record-breaking 375 in Antigua - each
stroke represented by a thin black line - looks like a huge plate of
spaghetti. Very occasionally during this astonishing and chanceless innings,
his inside edge was beaten, but the ball missed the wicket almost as if it
was not there.
Obviously this particular feat was meant to happen. This was underlined by
the presence on the players' balcony of Sir Garfield Sobers, the man whose
record score Lara passed, ready to come on the field to embrace his heir at
the appropriate moment. England were as powerless to arrest his progress as
were the local police to restrain 1,000 invading West Indian supporters.
That is the point about West Indian cricket. It is irresistible. Ever since
they proclaimed to the 1947 England team that they were unsure of their
ability and then took the field with the three Ws (Worrell, Walcott and
Weekes) the West Indies have turned up the heat on visiting teams. A
conveyor belt ferries new fast bowlers to replace the old ones, there is no
respite in between.
Meanwhile virtuoso, free-spirited batsmen have ghosted into the team almost
unnoticed. Ninenteen-year-old Shivnarine Chanderpaul was given a fanfare
Test debut on his home patch in Guyana and has since made a 50 in each Test.
The number five, Jimmy Adams, has played eight matches and averages 61. And
Lara has attained greatness by the age of 25. Warwickshire county cricket
club have gained a useful asset this summer.
Where do they keep getting these players from? Several years ago there were
rumours that cricket was beginning to decline in the West Indies. These were
unfounded. Undoubtedly in Barbados - the traditional cricket stronghold -
basketball is taking a grip through American television. Much less cricket
is played on the beach there, and the current Test side has a conspicuous
lack of Bajans.
Elsewhere, cricket rivals Christianity as the main religion among men. On
small islands such as Grenada or Tobago, car drivers have to swerve round
street games as well as potholes and in Guyana any patch of flat land beside
a creek or river will do. Using the base of a palm tree as the wicket, two
'pelt' bowlers alternate from one end, chucking rather than bowling. There
may be 20 fielders, so you learn to stay in - if you are out you might not
have another bat for a while. Wherever there is an empty beach, there will
be a match.
If interest was flickering in other places, Lara's genius has ignited it
again. A high court case in St Vincent was postponed last Monday so that the
lawyers could watch him break the record on television.
Afterwards, an impromptu carnival materialised in Antigua with an evening of
calypso and a parade by an iron band, creating rhythms from pans and
hubcaps, and radios blared out songs idolising 'Curtly' or 'Brian'.
England have returned with the spoils from a series in the Caribbean only
once, in 1969. The one thing that exceeds the breadth of West Indies'
achievement is the expectation. 'We may have beaten you last time,' people
say, 'but now we're gonna give you a damn good lickin'.'
Confronted by the wealth of talent and the depth of passion, a young England
team has fared quite well. 'They've matured down here,' said one onlooker,
and he was right. Atherton and Stewart have become the world's best opening
partnership, Robin Smith has rediscovered his self-belief, you will not find
a more accurate bowler than Angus Fraser, and Graham Gooch will be available
for the Tests against New Zealand and South Africa this summer. All England
need is a quick bowler.
In the Caribbean, they are still wallowing in the deeds of Sobers, and his
prime was 30 years ago. Presumably Lara will now be similarly deified. Once
a hero, always a hero.
Star cricketers do not pay taxes in the majority of islands of the West
Indies, most do not need jobs once they retire. Cricket is the route to
prosperity.
In England few players receive the status they deserve. As soon as they
reach the highest echelons they become targets for ridicule. More than once
this winter a picture of the captain, Mike Atherton, has appeared in British
tabloid newspapers with a turnip superimposed on his head, but Atherton is
no vegetable and he has a willing bunch of players. Do not be surprised if
England give this summer's first visitors, New Zealand, a damn good lickin'.

FT  23 APR 94 / Sport: A World Cup of their own - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANET KELLOCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In January, Sue Brodie telephoned her friends Ramsay Jones and Sandra
Williamson to ask them out for a drink. That evening, at a pub in Leith,
Brodie sprung her surprise. The Netherlands had just announced that it could
not host the women's rugby union World Cup, scheduled for April. She
suggested that Scotland host the cup and the three of them organise it.
Brodie, Scotland's full back and the chair of the Scottish Women's Rugby
Union, Jones, Scotland team manager, and Williamson, Scotland's scrum half,
had just 90 days.
The three, with Sandra's husband George, contacted the countries which had
entered, rugby clubs around Scotland and potential sponsors.
Twelve countries agreed to compete, although Spain eventually dropped out
and was replaced by a hastily-assembled Scottish student team. Clubs offered
to host matches and use their contacts with local media to promote the
event. But sponsorship proved difficult to find. One company told Jones they
were not interested in sponsoring 'just a bunch of girls' trying to play a
man's sport.
Many of the competing teams struggled to pay for the trip. The US, Japanese
and Canadian players each had to find Pounds 1,000.
The teams were divided into four pools of three, but it quickly became clear
that they also divided into three classes, led by the US and England, who
were seeded to meet in the final.
The US started with a 111-0 win over Sweden and then beat Japan 121-0.
England faced tougher opposition. They played Scotland in a match that drew
a boisterous home crowd of more than 3,000 to Boroughmuir. Scotland produced
some of their best rugby but still lost 26-0.
The top teams have drawn surprised admiration from male spectators for their
ball handling and kicking. The accuracy of Karen Almond, England's place
kicker, against Scotland prompted flattering comparisons with male
internationalists. All the teams have shown physical commitment in the
tackle, even if not all of them have mastered the technique. At Boroughmuir,
the ferocity of the tackling by the Scottish centres drew pained gasps from
the largely male crowd.
For Brodie, Jones and Williamson the direct involvement ended after Wales
beat Scotland 8-0 in the quarter-finals last Sunday at Melrose. After the
match both teams did what rugby players everywhere do, they went to the bar,
exhausted.
Unlike most of the games in the World Cup, this had been a tense,
attritional, forwards' battle. Both sides had produced some moments of flair
and imagination but also made some stupid mistakes and decisions on the
field. While Brodie and Williamson nursed their pints and their bruises the
disappointment of defeat as players was mixed with the satisfying knowledge
that their bold plan to stage the World Cup had come off.
On Wednesday, Wales lost their semi-final 56-15 to the US while England beat
France 18-6. Tomorrow the US meet England in the final. Two weeks ago
women's rugby was a game that women should not be playing. By Wednesday
spectators were asking why men cannot produce such displays of running
rugby.

visits a Northern Ireland club looking ahead to the season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Down at the ground overlooking scenic Lough Foyle the turf squelches
underfoot. The Rising Sun cricket club in Greysteel is one of many ordinary
pub and village teams which will face a damp start to the new season this
afternoon.
'You found it under the water then?' jokes Jim Moore, the Rising Sun's
owner, at the bar later. When not pulling pints, Moore doubles up as a
left-handed all-rounder.
But the Rising Sun is no ordinary pub. And Greysteel, a parish of 3,000
people straddling the main road from Londonderry to Limavady on Ulster's
north coast, is no ordinary village.
It was here six months ago on the night of October 30 that loyalist
terrorists burst through the door just after 10pm and fired indiscriminately
on customers. They killed seven - five Roman Catholics and two protestants.
Greysteel is not one of those places where your choice of pub depends on
what side of the sectarian divide you come. The Rising Sun was and remains a
mixed bar.
One of the victims was Moore's octogenarian father, a former opening batsman
for the club. Another was a stalwart of the local pub league.
As a handful of customers discusses the idiosyncracies of the local
steak-houses and studies the card for the 2.15 at Newmarket on Ceefax, it
seems hard to believe this unremarkable red-brick building could be the
scene of such carnage.
But as Moore proudly exhibits the refurbished lounge, complete with dance
floor, cricket club meeting room and electronic door lock, it begins to sink
in. 'They were standing right here just inside the door,' says one customer
in suit and tie. Another patron with tattooed forearms points out the corner
where he and others dived for cover.
If the government's version of events is to be believed, the upsurge in
violence culminating with this attack prompted a panicky secret message from
Provisional IRA leaders three days later. The message said: 'The country
could be at the point of no return.'
That a club playing such an archetypically English game exists at all in a
village where an estimated nine out of 10 inhabitants are nationalist is, at
first glance, surprising.
Those unfamiliar with the complexities of the so-called 'troubles' might
expect all Roman Catholics to run a mile from the national sport of what the
IRA regards as an occupying power and to stick to the traditional Irish
sports of gaelic football and hurling.
In fact this largely apolitical region has enjoyed playing cricket since at
least the turn of the century. 'I could show you a picture of the Greysteel
team in 1901 with their bowler hats and things,' says one local. 'People in
this part of the country play games in any form without thinking about the
undertones or the overtones.'
From the second world war onwards, this taste for cricket was reinforced by
the strong military presence in nearby Ballykelly and Eglinton.
'In peacetime the soldiers were well accepted,' says one Greysteel resident.
'They were seen as people who helped the commercial life of the village.'
By the time the 'troubles' began in 1969, the game was entrenched. 'It is
natural for people around here to play because their fathers played with the
military men,' said one local cricketer. The present team is about
three-quarters nationalist.
That the club is preparing for the new season as busily as the rain permits
in the wake of last autumn's atrocity is a testament to the tenacity of the
province's war-weary inhabitants and a small symbol of hope for the future.
Some of the teams the Rising Sun will face in section three of the North
West League will be exclusively Protestant 'You can't live in the past,'
says Moore in explanation of the club's determination to go on.
Liam O'Hara, a lawyer and opening batsman who captained the club in its
finest hour - its 1991 North West Junior Cup victory - talks over a pint of
Guinness of the 'subtle accommodations' which sportsmen in the area are
prepared to make.
'A man who plays cricket in order to spend time away from the wife and to
drink five or six pints in the evening is not a man who is going to fight
anybody,' he says. 'There could be subtle accommodations in every area of
life if there weren't so many flag-waving politicians with vested interests.
The people who play sport in general and cricket in particular don't have
any strong political views.'
This may be true in Greysteel in 1994, but it was not always so. A history
of Waringstown cricket club, one of Northern Ireland's finest, notes that
Charles Stewart Parnell was said to have led the nationalist side in the
home rule struggle of the 1880s and 1890s 'in much the same way he had
formerly led the County Wicklow XI'.

FT  23 APR 94 / Motoring: An alpha rating for the new Vauxhall Omega
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In Britain, the Vauxhall Carlton (Opel Omega on mainland Europe) was a
worthy but under-rated car, coming somewhere in between a Sierra and a
Granada in many a business motorist's pecking order. The new Omega - the
Carlton name has been dropped - promises to put that right.
The German-built Vauxhall Omega range of saloons and estate cars (an estate
is pictured above) retain rear-wheel drive although all of them now have an
elaborate multi-link suspension once confined to the costliest Carlton GSi
and Senator CD models.
Safety and security were vital concerns. All Omegas have anti-lock brakes;
most are fitted with three-point seat belts for all five occupants, and
airbags for driver and front passenger. Remotely controlled deadlocking,
with a fuel pump, starter relay and electronic control unit immobiliser are
all standard. Buyers have a choice of three multi-valve petrol engines - a
2-litre, 136 horsepower four-cylinder, a British-made 170 horsepower
2.5-litre V6 and a 210 horsepower, 3-litre V6 - plus a 130 horsepower,
2.5-litre BMW-sourced six-cylinder turbocharged and intercooled diesel.
There are five standards of trim from the entry-level Select to the poshest
leather-seated Elite. Any Omega can have five-speed manual or four-speed
automatic transmission. Of the four Omegas I sampled very briefly in
Scotland last week, a turbo-diesel estate and 2.5-litre V6 saloon appealed
most. The diesel, with 'fly by wire' accelerator control, was almost as
smooth and silent as a BMW 525tds which has a similar engine. Its torque
(pulling power at a given engine speed) is greater than that of any other
Omega except the 3-litre and is produced at only 2,200 revolutions per
minute. For low speed flexibility and mid-range pick up, not to mention fuel
economy and distance per tankful, it would be my choice.
The 2.5-litre V6 was more refined than the 3-litre and, of course, more
urgent than the 2-litre four-cylinder or diesel. But I would rate any Omega
saloon or estate car highly as a comfortable motorway mile-eater, with a
good ride and ample agility on minor roads.
Prices range from Pounds 15,995 to Pounds 26,950.

FT  23 APR 94 / Motoring: Paths were made for walking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pedestrians outnumber motorists, a fact many drivers forget until they start
walking themselves. Then the boot really is on the other foot.
The AA's Foundation for Road Safety Research has come up with a report - the
statistics are in kilometres - that should enable Britons to walk more
safely and gives all drivers food for thought.
One example: for every 100 million kilometres walked alongside traffic, 411
pedestrians will be killed or injured, compared with only 34 car drivers
covering the same distance. Only motor cyclists (551 deaths per 100m kms)
and pedal cyclists (526) are at greater risk. And it has to be said that
quite a few motor cyclists kill or injure themselves by losing control and
running off the road without other parties being involved.
The AA Foundation report is based on a two-year study of walking patterns
and accident records in Northampton, a typical UK town with a population of
180,000 and a mix of residential, commercial and industrial districts. The
findings have been extrapolated to cover the whole of the UK.
In Britain, road casualties continue to fall. The national total of 3,819
deaths in 1993 was 10 per cent less than the year before. Pedestrian
casualties also fell - by 7 per cent. Even so, 1,250 were killed and 11,411
seriously injured in the British Isles last year, so there is plenty of room
for improvement. (To those whose eyes glaze over at the mention of road
safety, I would say this: just wait until you, or someone close to you,
becomes a road casualty.)
Tragically, child pedestrians between five and nine years of age head the
casualty league table with 897 accidents per 100m kms, well over twice the
average. From 10-15 years this falls to 855 per 100m kms. Over-65s (504 per
100m kms) are in third place. The safest pedestrians are 25-49 year olds.
Road safety campaigns have concentrated on persuading drivers not to speed
on residential roads. However, the AA Foundation discovered that
heavily-used main roads, carrying traffic through Northampton, were six
times as dangerous for pedestrians.
And walking on post-1965 housing estates was found to be safer than on older
ones because the footpaths were separated from traffic - which puts one of
my hobby horses under starter's orders.
I believe there has to be a greater separation of pedestrians and traffic
and that pedestrian crossings should be raised far enough above the road
surface to deter speeding.
When the railways were built 150 years ago, their promoters were compelled
to fence off every inch of the permanent way to protect straying livestock.
The old understanding - backed by the law - that footpaths were for people,
roads for vehicles has gone.
Now, if drivers of cars, or for that matter, 38-ton lorries, find it
convenient to mount the pavement to get round a tight corner or to park,
that is what they do. If walkers are endangered or inconvenienced, that is
just too bad. No one cares.
My local council spends large amounts of money relaying the town's
traditional brick pavements. Within weeks, they are damaged by vehicles
driving over them. True, bollards and decorative railings have been put up
here and there.
But a simple solution seems not to have occurred to the council. Whenever a
kerb is relaid, it should be made too high for vehicles to mount.
Naturally, gaps and ramps would let pedestrians, prams and wheelchairs pass
through easily - but the gaps would be too short for any vehicle.
In the busiest, double yellow-lined shopping streets, kerbside railings
would do two things; protect pedestrians by channelling them on to proper
crossings - and make illegal parking pointless for anyone except an Olympic
hurdler.
At the same time, raised pedestrian crossings would cause serious damage to
a car. That ought to deter the yobs who think it smart to roar up and down
shopping streets at 50mph (80kph) and more.
No, I have not turned into an anti-motoring correspondent. I enjoy driving,
strive to improve my roadcraft and remain committed to the socially
responsible use of cars.
Life as one knows it would be impossible without them. I admit to feeling no
guilt when driving on a free-flowing motorway at between 80 and 85mph
(129-137kph) in good weather.
I am convinced, though, that 30mph (50kph) is fast enough in built-up areas,
and much too fast outside a school when children are coming or going. And
when I walk in town I am afraid of enormous articulated lorries passing
inches away, separated from me only by a kerb hardly high enough to stub
one's toe on.
The French authorities have no scruples about preventing pavement parking or
speeding through small towns and villages.
They are lining kerbs with concrete dragon's teeth and flower troughs.
Ferociously humped pedestrian crossings are front suspension smashers for
motorists who ignore urban speed limits.
In Brittany, the 50kph (30mph) limit in one village I often drive through is
enforced by a pedestrian crossing with traffic lights, though in this case
the crossing is not elevated. Any approaching vehicle exceeding 50kph is
detected by radar and the lights go red for a couple of minutes. It is a
sensible move that really does make speeding counter-productive.

FT  23 APR 94 / Outdoors: FT Round the World Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They began the year in North America and are now
in Europe.
Arnie reports: Is the sun never going to shine again? Or is this some kind
of nuclear winter? In Switzerland we were battered by one of the worst
blizzards I have witnessed in 20 years of skiing.
But the good snow enabled us to make an assault on our record of 26 miles
for a single day's skiing, set in February in Keystone, Colorado. The staff
of Ski Scott Dunn, our hosts in Champery, joined us, all dressed in pink and
black, and together we jetted 30 miles around the Portes du Soleil.
Lucy's lesson in powder skiing from Ueli Frei, president of the Grindewald
Guides Association, proved timely, for over the next three or four days,
thigh deep powder - on and off the piste - was just about all there was.
In Villars, we made the mistake skiers dread: we skied down to a closed lift
and had to walk all the way up again. Now we are in France, I will no longer
have to struggle with Italian or German to find out when the lifts close.
Lucy can do the talking.
There is still time to win a skiing holiday for two by entering the
competition which appeared in Weekend FT on April 2 (copies available from
the FT shop, tel: 071-873 3324).

FT  23 APR 94 / Gardening: A passion for magnolias - Patricia Morison finds
a great collection up for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In England last week's hail buffeted magnolias, shredding the goblets of
pink, purple and white. Such a cruel April must seem particularly unjust to
David Clulow. In his Surrey garden, Clulow grows hundreds of magnolias -
more than you might think any sane man could want. But then, Clulow is a
collector, and when was a real collector ever entirely sane?
Clulow used to spend Pounds 500 a week in winter to heat a collection of
orchids. Then, suddenly, the passion left him. Seventeen years ago he bought
an Edwardian house, high on a wooded ridge above Redhill, in Surrey. Running
into a small valley was seven acres of neglected garden with a pond and an
Edwardian rock-garden. With zeal and at considerable cost, Clulow plunged
into the rarified world of magnolia-fanciers.
This time, fate and not fickleness has ended the magnolia era. A few years
ago, Clulow recalls, he was offered Pounds 5m for the optician's business he
had built up. He declined to sell. At Christmas 1992, the business went into
receivership. So the house, Tilgates, with nursery glasshouses packed with
exceptionally rare plants, and more than 5,000 species of trees and shrubs,
plus a National Collection of over 400 different kinds of magnolia, is on
the market.
Clulow knew nothing about gardening when he conceived the plan for an
arboretum, and says that he is still not a gardener in the usual sense:
'I've never actually planted a magnolia in my life.' There were gardeners to
do that, and Graham Rankin - later ruthlessly head-hunted for another
magnolia collection - played an important part in making the collection.
His employer was no dilettante, however, but a scientifically-minded amateur
who relished hybridising and propagating. Fiddling with little bits of plant
material in a glasshouse perhaps comes easily to someone used to fitting
contact lenses. As in an optician's business, building a scientific plant
collection needs impeccable records. Clulow keeps a computer record of his
arboretum and produces his own elaborate labels. The magnolias are tagged in
bold letters with details of their pedigrees and who collected, bred,
grafted, or gave them to him.
Magnolias have reached Tilgates from all over the world - often by the most
circuitous routes. They arrived from an island arboretum off Korea owned by
a banker, and from a magnolia nursery in Detroit; from Alabama, Oregon,
Switzerland, Japan, Cornwall and New Zealand. Sometimes they have come as
seeds, sometimes as bundles of twigs for Clulow to graft. Many varieties
grown abroad have been sent for grafting by Otto and Gretel Eisenhut,
'propagating geniuses' at Ticino, which is popular with tax-exiles and
magnolia-lovers alike.
At around Pounds 80 for even a stellata, which is easy to propagate, it is
not cheap to have a magnolia handmade in Ticino. Moreover, the real magnolia
enthusiast likes to collect his new baby in person, armed with a plant
import licence. To secure his Magnolia Atlas, which has the largest flowers
of all, Clulow flew to New Zealand and brought back a 2ft scion to graft.
Early this century, great collections of magnolias were made by landowners
content to know that it would be the next generation which enjoyed the
breathtaking glory of these trees in bloom. Today, clever grafting makes it
possible to speed things up. This is what Clulow did when he started
planting in the boom years of the mid-1980s. His magnolias are not
seed-grown but are grafted on to the appropriate rootstock to produce dwarf
plants which then flower earlier.
The grafted hybrids of Magnolia campbellii, which flowered in February, all
bore flowers in their third year. Text-books say they take up to 16 years.
Betty Jessel, planted in 1986, might have taken as long as 25 years to
flower if she had been raised from seed. So do not hang back thinking life
is too short, is Clulow's advice. Identify the magnolia you want and get it
grafted from a specialist nurseryman: buying dubious magnolias from a garden
centre is a mug's game.
Then feed your magnolias well, for enhanced performance. In the palmy days,
Tilgates' magnolias enjoyed a foliar feed every two months, and some fanatic
collectors feed their plants weekly. It is impressive to see how tall some
magnolias can grow in less than a decade. Exquisite white M. denudata, the
tree grown for 1,000 years at Chinese temples, was planted in 1988 and
stands at a respectable 16ft. Heavily scented, carmine-flowered Magnolia
sprengeri diva was planted in 1988, flowered in 1990, and is now 20ft.
Of rarities, Tilgates has no end. I have seen the variegated Turkey oak, the
Blue-Needled Limber Pine, and a kind of Japanese birch so rare that there
are only six left in the wild. But let us keep to the magnolias, some of
them extraordinary enough, like a variegated Magnolia grandiflora in the
glasshouse. I can now claim to have seen Magnolia zennei in bloom - nothing
much to look at, but it is thought to be the first time one has flowered in
a European garden. I also saw M cylindrica, a plant far rarer than it should
be, white and delectable.
Here were stellatas looking far more glamorous than those common in front
gardens. Centennial much took my fancy, with strikingly large petals
(tepals, to the experts) looking well in spite of very strong winds. Jane
Platt was the prettiest pink, Norman Gould is especially large flowered but
from a slightly sinister cause, having its seedlings watered with a poison
called colchizine.
An old prejudice of mine against purple-hued magnolias, based on
common-as-muck M. soulangeana Lennei, started to crumble. Admittedly, it was
undone less by seeing the bold petals of Star Wars and Mr Packard's striped
Smetterling (he has a German wife), than from seeing two Iolanthes either
side of a flight of steps. And who would not be won over to purple by the
charm of Caerhays Surprise, seen against a backdrop of conifers?
Serene, bred from the ubiquitous liliifora, is a vibrant pink but Vulcan is
newer and even pinker. The breeder of this particular New Zealander was not
disposed to let it go to Clulow but a gardener's wife kindly spirited away a
small piece. Not only colour and shape but scent should also come into the
choice of magnolias we make. Flushed pink Anne Rosse was perhaps the
sweetest I sniffed. But for scent to send one out of one's mind, high summer
is the time at Tilgates.
It is then that the wieseneris flower, a buff-coloured Japanese magnolia
which has been in Britain for a century but is grown only by cognoscenti. If
Clulow could take just one of his 400 magnolias to a desert island, he says
it would be a wiesener. Summer is also the time to sniff the lemon-ice scent
of the grandifloras and to look at some surprising newcomers, Brooklynensis
Grex. This is the progeny of yellow-hued acuminata crossed with purple
liliifora, some are wonderful like Yellowbird, some are yucky.
Although he hopes someone plant-minded will buy Tilgates, Clulow is
philosophical about selling up. 'Twenty years of orchids, twenty years of
magnolias, now it's time to try something new.' He plans to go to South
America and grow passion flowers, a family temptingly short of good hybrids.
All the same, there are rooted cuttings of every magnolia over in the
glasshouse, ready to move. 'No one has ever tried magnolias in Guatamala.'
Tilgates, Little Common Lane, Bletchingley, Surrey, is open daily until 6pm,
price Pounds 1. Plants sold at the nursery include magnolias priced from
around Pounds 25-Pounds 75; grafting done to order (088374-3219).

FT  23 APR 94 / Outdoors: Saving the best for last - Skiing / Late season
snowfalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the Tyrolean mountains, sexism has been swamped with snow. 'In April,' we
are told in the Ischgl visitors magazine, 'it seems as if the mountain
becomes the fair sex. Soft, round, warm, alluring, and ready for all
pranks.' But this April, the pranks will have to wait. Blizzards which swept
much of the Alps gave some resorts their biggest falls of the season. Too
late, in most cases.
The day the Swiss resort of Gstaad closed for skiing the heavens opened and
dumped half a foot of snow on the notice-board announcing that all the lifts
had shut.
The following day in nearby Villars skiers battled through thigh-deep powder
even on the piste. It always seems to snow in April, but rarely quite as
much as this. Says Patrick Messeiller, Verbier's Tourist Director: 'We had
such a hot March that winter was bound to come back in April. This is real
winter snow we are skiing on. Not a few flakes of spring snow.'
In Verbier they were caught out: they had already rolled up their sleeves to
make a start on preparations for the new large Funitel gondola which will at
last replace the antiquated Attelas 1 cable car. The fresh snowfalls
interrupted progress, but the 15 cabins, each transporting 30 skiers, will
be running next winter, helping to alleviate Verbier's lift-queues by
transporting an extra 1,650 skiers an hour.
The fresh snow brought conditions that skiers dream of in December but
simply do not bother to enjoy in spring when their minds are full of summer
activities.
Once again there are comparatively few people in the cream of the Alpine ski
areas, but there was a minor scramble to get to the snow. Andrew Dunn, of
Ski Scott Dunn, reported a flurry of bookings for Courchevel - which had two
metres of fresh snow in a week, and Zermatt. 'Conditions have been quite
astonishing,' he says. 'It bodes really well for next Easter which is much
later in 1995. People who don't bother to ski in April just don't know what
they're missing. It has snowed heavily in April for the last three or four
years.'
Also in Courchevel, FlexiSki, which was due to close last weekend stayed
open for another week or two. 'It's unbelievable,' said Neal Manuel. 'The
locals in Courchevel say they've never seen it snow so much in the spring.
It's normal to have a few days snowfall in April, but not day after day for
more than a week. It's finally getting through to people that there's still
some great skiing even this late in the season.'
But it brings hazards. In Verbier - not a good place in which to become lost
 -it was only the homing-pigeon instincts of one of our group that enabled
us to find our way through the thick mist back to our chalet.
The arrival of all this fresh snow was double-edged, as it were, for ski
shops. 'Normally at this time of year people are skiing on spring snow which
leaches out the wax from skis,' said Ian Oakman, at Verbier's Ski Service
shop.
'This kind of snow is much better for skis, and yet in the first two or
three days of new snow we had more damaged skis than at any time this
season. What happened was that when fresh snow fell on the lower slopes
where the snow had already vanished, it gave the appearance of being a good
surface. In reality it was soft snow on stony ground, so when people skied
the lower runs, they were damaging their skis.'
Either way, tour operators hope that just as people have begun to realise
that the unfashionable month of January is a good bet for skiing, more
people will now be convinced that some of the best skiing of the winter is
not in winter at all, but in spring.
For those who like their Aprils warm, there is an old Swiss saying, which
seems particularly appropriate this year: 'He who has seen three good Aprils
is already old.'
Meanwhile, just like at the end of term at boarding school, everyone is
packing their bags and heading for home. 'The end of the season,' announces
the Ski Club of Great Britain on the Tourist Office notice board in Verbier.
'Rep rides off into the sunset. Flowers, bequests, gifts and tokens of love
welcome. Back next year.'

FT  23 APR 94 / Gardening: Jump on the spring bandwagon - Why good gardens
are more than a two-month wonder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When gardeners start out, they think naturally of summer. They pile on the
roses, the mid-summer borders, and their defences against a dull July. The
summer initiative grows and, in time, it suggests new openings: has anyone
ever pre-planned a serious garden by mapping it in advance? I doubt it,
because it develops a framework after five years built on the corpses of 100
failures.
After five years on my new site, I am now spring-mad and ceasing to worry
about plantings that will continue beyond August. I have re-learned an old
lesson: good gardens are not a two-month wonder. They extend from February
to early November, with an artful emphasis on their early months.
Why did I start so short-sightedly? I began with flower beds and evergreen
hedges but I forgot to thicken the outlying boundaries with enough forms of
early prunus, winter-flowering cherry, early okame, upright umeneko and
others. I planted roses which now detest my soil, but the winter-flowering
shrubs should have gone in first.
This time, to limit my job, I told myself some of the wrong things when I
started out: that I would leave the flowering cherries to suburbia; that I
would cut out spring bedding; that magnolias would never flourish on my lime
soil; and that spring-flowering border plants were better to write about
than to grow. I planted evergreen hedges, so that the yew could develop
brown patches: I even left the bulbs until last.
Now I see my mistake. In the early years, you seldom visit other gardens:
you are too busy taming your own. Only now can I see what others have made
from the same season.
I envy older gardens their grand old trees at this time of year. I defer to
the magnolias in the Hillier Arboretum, the camellias in Richmond's Isabella
plantation, or the white-flowered Amelanchiers which Rudyard Kipling must
have planted at Batemans, the National Trust property in East Sussex near
Tunbridge Wells, where they ought still to be at their best.
I have given them five years' start by not planting spring-flowering trees
as soon as I began. I now think that they are as essential to a sense of
place as evergreens which we urge you to put in first. But I also notice how
great places cope with the bleakness of Britain's early spring by casual
under-planting and how they have two ways of coping with bulbs.
The under-planting has not exactly passed me by. We now grow wallflowers
among the summer borders and discard them after flowering. A few blocks go a
long way and, in smaller beds, I now resort to the best of all
forget-me-nots - the small, dark form called Indigo.
*something in here (HP) *
It pays to go further. In a great garden such as Sissinghurst, in Kent, you
can see the impact of early-flowering extras, grown in groups or occasional
isolation among the surrounding emptiness of spring. Sissinghurst is looking
enviable in spite of cold, wet weather.
In the White Garden, there is easy, white-flowered arabis for colour now.
and there are groups of the easy, pale pink primula Guinivere, taking up no
space but making most of the impact in the main July beds. It takes only a
bush or two of the bright pink prunus Tenella to enliven an entire section,
while someone has had the bright idea of growing a few sprigs of white
prunus Cistena in the garden's front courtyard.
I am still waiting for forget-me-nots, but these established gardens have
used enough early perennials casually among their framework to double their
season of interest. Beginners should remember to do the same.
When I started, I decided also to leave bulbs until last. After all, why
plant tulips and daffodils when you may decide to dig up their ground and
change it?
For the first time, I was ready to move forward last autumn and I added
blocks of narcissi in time for this wonderful year for the family. This
spring, almost every form has been wonderful, but my top five for
naturalisation are those with paler flowers - Geranium, Ice Follies, Barrett
Browning, Winston Churchill - and the later so-called Pheasant's Eye.
They look fine but, by delaying, I realise that I have actually lost
important ground.
What I always knew, and now remember, is that the best shows of bulbs are
colonies, not garrisons. In our great gardens, the best displays were not
planted by the thousand. They were introduced gently, given time to know
each other, and then allowed to run wild when they decided they were
friends.
These colonies take time to spread and develop, but it is vastly better to
buy a few small groups of bulbs which know how to seed themselves, and start
them off manageably as soon as you begin a new garden or gardening phase.
The big blocks can be introduced as occupying forces at any later time: the
narcissi in long grass or the modern tulips by the hundred to brighten the
flower beds.
New gardeners usually receive the same fashionable advice: begin with the
bones first. Nowadays, the bones mean firm hedges of evergreen, some arches,
perhaps a wall or even a fancy conservatory or temple if you want to spend
your way out of bleakness. We tell you to begin with yew, box, climbing
roses and the main specimen trees.
None of this advice is wrong, but I would add what experience has taught me
twice: when you start, jump on the future bandwagon of spring and never
think of your garden as a place essentially for the months from May until
October.

FT  23 APR 94 / Outdoors: Trails to be blazed - Peter Whitehead is surprised
by conditions in Norway's mountains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WHITEHEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This heat. This damned heat. Sun scorched my brow in the dazzling
wilderness. I could not go on without a drink. Through dried, cracked lips I
begged of our guide: 'Please . . . back . . . we must go back.'
'Very well,' replied Einar Raa Nilsen, the guide. 'And if you're thirsty,
drink the snow.'
I had no idea how adventurous cross-country skiing could be until this
end-of-season trek in the mountains above Voss in Norway.
Einar, who runs the ski school, had insisted I try something new and a
sparklingly sunny afternoon, plus the prospect of more comfortable boots,
persuaded me to join him on a cross-country plod.
As a downhiller, I always thought it looked so easy, so dull - just walking,
with a bit of sliding on the hills. I was mistaken: the heat, the wilderness
and my total lack of control of the wispy narrow skis fixed only at the toe
left me gasping with thirst. Walking and running on the flat or uphill was
bearable but even the gentlest downhill slope had me in a heap.
The Norwegians, by contrast, have a spring in their step: their football
team is on its way to the World Cup finals and the Winter Olympics at
Lillehammer were as good as anyone can remember.
And in the small town of Voss the locals are particularly keen to remind
visitors of the hatful of skiing medals won by its natives. They hope this
success will smarten up Norway's reputation as a serious skiing destination
and lay to rest the impression that the country is just a huge flat
snowfield only fit for cross-country.
The bare figures do little to dent this impression: Voss is only 57 metres
above sea level and the entire skiing area is below 1,000m - no altitude
problems here.
Just a glance tells you this is not the Alps: the mountains are not rugged
and hacked but gentle, moulded and rounded, seeming to go on for ever. If
this was France there would be lifts and pistes and refreshment huts
stretching out of sight.
But this is cautious Norway. Voss's ski lifts appear to be governed by tight
financial discipline and the prospects for expansion of the skiing area are
slim.
Downhillers are limited to 40kms of piste and nine lifts - one cable car,
four chair lifts and four T-bars, two of which run side-by-side.
Even so, the downhill racers' run is a tremendous challenge for skiers of
all abilities, and the giant slalom course is a treat with or without gates.
Most of the rest tends to be fairly easy.
This is the real joy of Voss: a small resort that can take beginners and
turn them into racers, ski-jumpers, cross country or Telemark skiers,
snow-boarders, or even paraglider pilots.
The atmosphere is one of refreshing youthful innocence, with the emphasis on
families and the young. Everything is on a manageable, human scale and
honesty is taken for granted. Remote huts, for example, offer shelter and
supplies to mountain trekkers who are expected - and do - leave their
payment behind.
And payments in Norway are high - four beers cost me about Pounds 15 and a
can of Coke more than Pounds 1.50, a price to dent the purses of the many
school parties from Northumberland, with which Voss has a special
relationship.
Voss the town, a little over an hour from Bergen by road or rail, stands
shivering in the fjord beside the frozen lake Vangsvatnet, its utilitarian
1950s architecture cold and unappealing.
But you warm to it on learning that Voss was flattened by German forces in
the second world war. The church (bombs bounced off its steeply pitched
roof, so the story goes) and the fairy-tale Fleischer's Hotel survive to
give a glimpse of how the town may once have looked.
Remarkably, the cost of staying in hotels such as Fleischer's or Park is
inexpensive: you would pay far more for accommodation of this elegance in
the Alps.
But while elegance was in short supply on my cross country adventure, I
still cannot wait for next season and the chance to repeat the unforgettable
experience of making fresh tracks in virgin snow and hearing the thundering
silence of soft mountains.
Peter Whitehead stayed at the Yarl Hotel. Information on Voss and other

FT  23 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Please take a seat there, sir - The training
of restaurant and hotel staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Remember Manuel, the inept waiter in BBC TV's Fawlty Towers? Just a mention
of his name in connection with any hotel was enough for people to cancel
their reservations.
But to Stuart Scher, 32, and Alan Wick, 38, 'Manuels' are a challenge. Scher
and Wick run Scher Associates, a company which in its fourth year will earn
almost Pounds 1m in fees from training front-of-house staff in the
restaurant, hotel and leisure industries. Educate staff as to how customers
should be treated, and hotel bookings increase.
Training in the catering industry has traditionally concentrated on kitchen
skills. Hotels have rigid, rather impersonal, training plans for
front-of-house staff. And for small restaurateurs, training has always posed
a problem.
Lack of human and financial resources is often exacerbated by lack of time
between meal services. The hiring of staff has usually been based on a
successful rendition of the 'three-plate trick' (asking a prospective waiter
to clear a table of three correctly) and regular admonitions on hygiene and
customer care.
Scher Associates' success in winning contracts with its wide range of
clients - from Roux Fine Dining and Sutcliffe Catering, both contract
caterers, to hotel groups such as Jarvis Hotels, Mount Charlotte Thistle and
Edwardian Hotels, to brewers Scottish and Newcastle and Tetley, plus a
string of restaurant groups including ABC Cafes, the Pelican Group,
Garfunkels and Langans - stems from the fact that they have made training
easy for their clients.
Prospective clients are, naturally, attracted by the concept of training but
invariably say they have no money. Scher has gone straight to one of the 80
government-funded Training and Enterprise Councils - its programme
'Investors in People' is aimed at improving the skills of the British
workforce - and has now become the biggest source of government training
funds to companies in the catering industry.
This allows for an initial, free, diagnosis to take place which can last
from one day for a small restaurant, to three months in the case of a
contract caterer. Then, if the personalities fit, an action plan follows.
This may begin with a training session in Scher's offices but usually takes
place in the restaurant. An integral aspect is 'training the trainer', when
a member of the restaurant's staff is chosen to ensure standards are
maintained.
But Scher has also changed its clients' - and my own - perception of the
importance of training. Invariably, the catering industry is described as a
service industry, a phrase with which Scher and Wick have little truck.
Today, according to Scher, those who look after customers in restaurants,
hotel lobbies or across the counter of a wine bar are in a sales industry.
It is at this stage that Scher and Wick's non-catering background has proved
most effective. When still in his 20s, Scher was general manager of a
400-bedroom Sheraton hotel in Arizona and Wick was winning a Queen's Award
for Export manufacturing professional audio equipment.
This commercial experience has left them with no qualms about suggesting to
one restaurateur that a small mirror be fixed to the cash register to ensure
the cashier always smiles when presenting the bill, and to taking the entire
management of a restaurant group around the studios of CNN, the TV news
station, to show the value of communicating to staff.
Perhaps, the biggest compliment to Scher's approach to training comes from
its involvement with the Aroma group of cafes, started by Michael
Zur-Szpiro, a former management consultant with the Boston Consultancy
Group.
There are now six Aromas in central London employing more than 60 staff
selling sandwiches, coffee and pastries. Customers call in spontaneously and
can, if they are not well treated, walk out just as promptly.
To ensure that they do not, Scher has devised a training checklist that is
pinned behind every door in each cafe. Against an employee's name is a
series of training modules which incorporates how a customer should be
welcomed, food hygiene and customer care procedures. Each employee is taken
regularly through the checklist and there are plans to attach incentives to
reward best performers.
Scher is aware that, apart from their own expertise and enthusiasm for the
restaurant business, a key factor in their growth is the fact that many have
considered the restaurant business a 'Cinderella industry' - one to dabble
in but not take too seriously.
The recession has changed that - as it has changed the structure of the
industry. In the UK today, there are fewer individual restaurants but more
restaurant groups, most with an annual turnover between Pounds 5m and Pounds
50m. These are able, in a way a single chef/proprietor is not, to open seven
days a week, to implement changes required under the Food Act and,
crucially, to hold down menu prices.
But, like others in the retailing industry, these businesses are continually
looking to maximise sales, to retain regular customers and to train new
staff without increasing the size of head office.
Scher's approach to the training of waiting staff enables restaurants to
achieve many of those objectives. And, as it improves restaurant service, it
might eventually make us remember Manuel not as a stereotypical hapless
waiter but, simply, as a comic character from the past.

FT  23 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A venture into white - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Drinking at a first-growth chateau can be a mite limited - all that dry red.
No wonder then that more of Bordeaux's superstars are venturing into white
wine territory.
Pavillon Blanc de Chateau Margaux was followed by Ch Mouton-Rothschild's
Aile d'Argent dry white (the second vintage, 1992, much less oaky than the
first) and now Mouton announces a close working relationship with the
Sauternes property Ch Coutet.
Not to be outdone, Ch Latour has launched its own dry white, Blanc de
Pauillac 1992, yours for Pounds 300 a dozen from Farr Vintners of London SW1
(071-828-1960). Those who cook at Pauillac's smartest addresses should be
thrilled by the chance to experiment with dishes that go with something
other than claret. Jancis Robinson
                           *       *      *
An historical success story from South Africa was the famous Constantia wine
which was loved by just about everyone before the vineyards were wiped out
by phylloxera at the end of the 19th century.
For the best part of a century the secrets of Constantia were lost, but in
1980 Klein Constantia replanted Muscadel vines with the intention of
recreating the famous wine. The first new vintage was made in 1986. The
current, 1989, is therefore the fourth.
You might be put off by the pseudo-18th century 500ml bottles, but the wine
inside is superb; a rather delicate brew considering its 15 or so degrees
with a lasting orange and peach flavour.
Klein Constantia's 'vin de Constance' is available from Averys of Bristol
(tel: 0272-214141).
The price is Pounds 10.66 a bottle, Pounds 126.20 a case. Giles MacDonogh
                           *       *      *
For top quality Sauvignon Blanc, an obvious - if apparently expensive -
candidate is Mulderbosch Sauvignon Blanc from South Africa. At Pounds 86 a
case from John Armit Wines of London W11 (071-727-6846) it is first-class
wine: full-bodied, serious, and intriguingly - but certainly not offensively
 -aromatic.
Perfectly agreeable is the Hungarian Sauvignon Blanc 1993 that is Pounds
2.99 at Safeway.
That same year has produced other fine Hungarian Sauvignons. Gyongyos Estate
enjoys wide distribution in the chains for around Pounds 3.49 and this is
the best vintage to date. Marks &amp; Spencer has another lively example at
Pounds 3.49 under the defiantly non-ethnic Deer Valley label. JR

Good news for diners from four of London's top hotels. The Causerie at
Claridge's has introduced a two-course dinner menu for Pounds 12 per person,
including VAT. A main course can be taken from the Smorgasbord or the hot
dish of the day and followed by pudding or cheese. For reservations phone
071-629-8860.
At The Dorchester there is a new menu in the Grill Room. A three-course set
lunch costs Pounds 23.50 including coffee, service and VAT and, as usual,
chef Willi Elsener will be concentrating on British food. From May 1, The
Terrace will be serving a Pounds 38 dine and dance package on Friday and
Saturday nights. Ring 071-629-8888.
The Ritz, too, is offering Friday and Saturday night dinner and dancing, to
big band sounds of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, from Pounds 33 a head. It is
also introducing a light lunch menu at the Palm Court. Prices start at
Pounds 12 per person and a glass of wine will be included in the lunch
price. Tel: 071-493-2687.
The Connaught is opening its Grill Room for dinner only on Saturdays and
Sundays. In addition to the a la carte menu a table d'hote will be served at
Pounds 35 a head plus 15 per cent service but including VAT. Tel:
071-466-7070. Jill James

More than 1,000 corkscrews from a single owner are to be auctioned at
Christie's South Kensington, London, on May 10 at 2pm. Collected over 30
years by Gianni Gachin, who died last year, the collection traces the
history of the corkscrew from the mid-18th century to the present day.
Oldest in the collection is a mid-18th century pocket folding corkscrew with
a seal bearing an effigy of Queen Anne.
The first English corkscrew ever patented, in 1795, designed by a London
clergyman called Samuel Henshall, is expected to fetch between Pounds 400
and Pounds 600. Viewing starts on May 3 at 9am. Tel: 071-321-3120/3121/3122

FT  23 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Time to think of England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today is St George's Day, when English patriots wear red roses in their
buttonholes and those who relish free food, and fungi in particular, scour
grassy verges, pastures and bosky borders in search of Tricholoma gambosum.
Known commonly as mousseron in France, and St George's mushroom in England,
this pale fungus with its strong, mealy smell and taste is supposed to be
available by now - although sometimes you have to wait another week or two
to bank on finding it.
When you get your pickings home, saute them in butter, season them with
lemon and black pepper and bathe them in reduced cream. Serve them on fluted
rounds of toast, spoon them over oeufs en cocotte, or use them as a rich
sauce (more vegetable than condiment) for pasta or to partner grilled
chicken.
With any luck, this weekend could also see the first of the season's really
tasty, outdoor-grown Jersey Royal potatoes (rather than those grown under
glass, highly-priced and low on flavour).
Today, if I can get them, I shall simply rub the Jersey Royals clean, boil
or steam them, and serve them with a celebratory rack or two of succulent
Kentish lamb or hot boiled ham cooked on the bone. It must be proper, meaty
ham, of course, with a decent covering of fat into which a smear of mustard
and toasted breadcrumbs can be pressed after cooking.
A creamily-delicate parsley sauce (laced with a few capers, perhaps) would
go well with the ham. With the lamb, I might offer red currant jelly warmed
enough to melt it, with a spoonful or two of chopped fresh mint stirred in
and left to set again.
Tomorrow, the cold cuts could be served with one of my favourite potato
salads. Slice a bulb of Florentine fennel wafer thinly and steep the raw
slivers in lemon juice and olive oil.
Just before serving, add plenty of hot, freshly-boiled and thickly-sliced
salad potatoes (Jersey Royal, La Ratte, Charlotte, BF 15 or Pink Fir Apple,
according to season), some whole black olives, and a green snowstorm of
snipped chives. Toss gently to mix and serve while the potatoes are still
warm.
After the Jerseys, it will not be long before delicious, home-grown fresh
asparagus comes on stream. Fat bunches - served with unstinting quantities
of melted butter and a sprinkling of Parmegiano-Reggiano, or olive oil and
lemon, or Hollandaise sauce - make a luxurious and ultra-simple first
course.
More affordable, and still celebratory, is the lesser-known trick of teaming
English asparagus with Jersey Royals to make a gratin.
ASPARAGUS AND POTATO GRATIN
This can make a lunch dish for three people, a first course for four or an
accompaniment to lamb, veal, chicken or poached salmon, when it will serve
up to six. The asparagus can be increased to 1lb and the potatoes reduced to
 1/2 lb.
Ingredients:  3/4 lb fresh asparagus;  3/4 lb Jersey Royal potatoes; 1/2 oz
butter plus extra to grease the dish; 1 x 200 g (7 fl oz) tub of creme
fraiche; 1 egg yolk;  1/2 oz freshly grated Parmegiano-Reggiano; 1/2 tsp
each sugar and paprika; generous 1 1/2 oz ciabatta breadcrumbs.
Wash and trim the asparagus, scraping the stalks if tough-skinned. Save the
woody bases for the stock pot. Cut the rest of the asparagus obliquely into
1 1/2 in lengths and reserve the tender tips separately from the stalks.
Rinse and rub the potatoes clean with your fingers but do not peel them. Cut
them into chunks, slice very thickly or leave whole, depending on size. Drop
the potatoes into a pan of fast-boiling salted water and cook for about 10
minutes.
Steam the asparagus over the potatoes - about eight minutes for the stalks
and four for the tender tips should cook them through, yet retain a hint of
crunch. Allow longer, or less, for very well-cooked or crisp results.
While the vegetables are cooking, melt the butter in a small frying pan. Add
the crumbs and stir continuously over low heat until coloured and crisp.
Beat the egg yolk with the sugar, paprika and a good seasoning of salt and
black pepper. Mix in the creme fraiche and about two-thirds of the crumbs.
Butter a gratin dish generously. Spread about half the cooked and mixed
vegetables across the base of the dish and spoon half the sauce over them.
Cover with the remaining vegetables, then the rest of the sauce.
Sprinkle evenly with Parmesan, then the reserved crumbs. Cover the dish with
a dome of foil, and heat through on a pre-heated baking sheet at 425'F/220'C
(gas mark 7) for 10-12 minutes. Remove the foil and cook for two-three
minutes more to crisp the top.

My scallops are being served with awesome precision. The dish is immaculate,
the service terrific. I glance at the waiter but he is carrying out his task
with so much concentration that he cannot be distracted.
The reason for this is the identity of my guest, who is watching the serving
of the scallops with such brooding intensity that I feel I have strayed into
an Aztec ceremony.
This is Marco Pierre White, the best-known, most lauded of all English chefs
 -still only 32, born in Leeds, half-Italian, beefy, tousle-haired,
charismatic and tempestuous: able to pass, in an eye-blink, from cherubic to
volcanic. Or so the folklore says. By accident or design, my guest has
attracted some of the most enviable publicity in the history of cooking.
The words used to describe him pop up all the time. Volatile. Flamboyant.
Firebrand. Enfant terrible. Profane genius. Wild man. Wild child.
Sulphurous. Rudest chef in London. The Apollo of the Aga. There have been
wives, mistresses, children, dust-ups and bust-ups.
Over the years, the image that has been created is one of danger, decadence
and theatricality. That is not bad going for a celebrity-chef, though the
decadence has been exaggerated. White says he has never tasted alcohol or
tried narcotics, and that two years ago he gave up 'smoking, gambling and
marriage'.
There are those who must imagine that to enter one of Marco White's
restaurants is to stand a good chance of being grabbed by the
chef-proprietor and flung into the street for some imagined slight or lapse
in table manners. But when I asked him how many customers he had expelled
from his restaurants in the whole of his career, the answer was only two.
We are sitting in one of White's two restaurants, The Canteen at London's
Chelsea Harbour, which has its own chef and one Michelin star. White owns a
one-third stake. Another co-owner is actor Michael Caine. White's other
establishment is The Restaurant at the Forte-managed Hyde Park Hotel,
Knightsbridge, London, where he has two Michelin stars. He won his first
Michelin star at the age of 25, his second at 27 - the youngest British
two-star chef.
Our lunch was going well. No one had been assassinated, apart from (absent)
rivals. There had been comedy to start with. Neither of us realised that the
other had arrived. White had gone to the bar, I to the table. At 1.40pm the
manager asked if I would like a newspaper to read, to help pass the time.
Three minutes later the mistake was realised, and White and I shook hands.
He looked concussed with anger. But no one was to blame, and he was soon
transferring food from his plate to mine. A large part of White's charm
derives from his candour. His working-class Yorkshire childhood lurks just
beneath the surface. I asked him where his extreme physicality and pugnacity
came from.
He said: 'I have to break everything I touch. It's just something I've
always done. Maybe it's a positive or maybe it's a negative, or maybe it's
related to my need to progress professionally. Originally my aggression
could be attributed to a lack of social skills - and shyness.
'Am I an arsehole? Some people say so. Some people rubbish me and my work,
but who are these people? You don't get two Michelin stars if you are only
an arsehole. There is more to it than that. Here is an example. One of the
things I believe in in my restaurants is value for money - affordable,
Michelin-class food. Here in The Canteen, all starters are Pounds 6.50 and
all mains Pounds 10.50. People can afford that. That's why The Canteen turns
over Pounds 70,000 a week.
'I want to achieve that sort of value for money at The Restaurant. It's too
easy to rip the customers off. A lot of that goes on. The way I'll make my
money is in the long run. The last thing I'm ever going to do is jeopardise
what I've got already.'
White trained with the best chefs in Britain - above all, with Albert Roux,
former mastermind at Le Gavroche, the first London restaurant to win three
Michelin stars. 'I am an offspring of all the great (English-based) chefs,'
says White, naming others who guided him.
'I was lucky. I appeared at the right time. I worked long hours, won my
first Michelin star, attracted a few tarts - suddenly I became Marco Pierre
White. But as a cook gets older his cooking gets simpler, and as I get older
I have become more of a recluse. I spend a lot more time in my restaurants
than I used to. I don't remember the last time I went to a nightclub, a
dinner party or an event. I only deal now with a few old friends in the
profession. I have my girlfriend, my two children - and fishing.'
Fishing looms large in a conversation with White. He hunts down macho fish:
pike, barbel, grayling, tench and trout. He says his best pike weighed 32lb.
A monster. Did he cook it? Not for the first time, a guileless little
question produced contradictory answers from the master-chef. 'Nah,' he
said. 'I never kill the fish. I couldn't kill anything. I love nature too
much - bird-watching, everything.'
Later, however, he said he liked shooting. 'The sort of customers I get,
some of them invite me to shoot. I love it. I used to be a poacher. That was
my first job. I went shooting on a private estate not long ago and this huge
cock pheasant came strutting along the ground. It would not get up. It would
not fly. So I blasted it on the ground.'
One of White's attractions is his hatred of taxi-drivers. I told him that I
shared it. 'They're fascists,' I said, 'completely rotten people, the same
the world over.'
'Yah,' agreed the chef. 'You've got it: fascists. I don't own a flashy car.
Don't actually own a car 'cause I don't even drive. But my girlfriend's got
an off-roader, the biggest you can buy, which I'm fitting out with
bumper-guards and really major spotlights in case any taxi-drivers want to
take us on.'
During lunch, White showed a flicker of temperament on only three occasions.
He was irritated that the butter on our table was softer than it should have
been, but said nothing. However, he told a waiter to go and tell someone in
the kitchen to stop banging - 'I did not come here today to listen to his
noise' - and remonstrated with another waiter for serving me cold milk with
my coffee.
'He asked for black coffee,' White told the waiter, 'but if you're going to
give him milk, make sure it's hot. Cold milk kills the flavour.' The waiter
rushed away. White said to me: 'Now he's going frantic. Bet he thinks I'm an
arsehole.'
On the strength of a single lunch, I formed the impression that Marco White
is a lot cleverer than widely realised. I suspect that people see his
Italian side, the charisma and machismo, and forget the Yorkshire half -
gall, grit, gumption.
At 3.30, I said I would pay the bill, giving him a chance to read the
six-page fax that a waiter had handed him.
'Nah,' said White. 'Forget it.'
'I'm supposed to pay,' I said. 'That's the idea. We choose the guest. The
guest chooses the restaurant. We pay the bill.'
'Nah,' growled White.
'OK,' I said. 'The food was great. No doubt I'll return in my own capacity.
Then I can pay for myself.'
'Yeah,' said the big man. 'In your own capacity. That's the bill you slip
through the FT.'
The thought had never occured to me.
'There you go,' he said, laughing loudly. 'You've found the real Marco
White.'

FT  23 APR 94 / Mix 'n' match for new drugs - The Nature of Things / A look
at how chemicals are being combined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Where will the new drugs of the 21st century come from? Biotechnology
industry propaganda might make you assume that the swift pace of genetics
research is going to cure many ills. But the source of most of today's
medicines, the long 19th and 20th century tradition of organic chemistry, is
set to produce pharmaceutical breakthroughs for the foreseeable future.
The latest chemical technique, combinatorial chemistry, will enable
researchers to generate a previously unimaginable diversity of chemical
structures, not known in nature, for testing as potential drugs.
Although pharmaceutical researchers like to talk about 'rational drug
design', most new drugs originate in the traditional hit-or-miss process of
'screening' as many chemicals as possible for pharmacological activity. Some
are synthetic compounds which industry buys in from universities, specialist
companies and other sources.
Others are naturally occurring chemicals extracted from plants and
micro-organisms.( The latter often come from soil samples which researchers
collect on holiday. For example, the two drugs used to prevent transplant
patients rejecting their new organs, cyclosporine and FK-506, originated in
mountainside dirt from Norway and Japan respectively.)
As well as screening random compounds, drug companies also test variants of
existing medicines, the molecular structures of which have been altered in
the hope of producing more powerful pharmacological activity and / or fewer
side-effects.
Even the largest companies cannot screen more than about 100,000 new
compounds a year, using conventional processes. Yet the number of potential
combinations that might lead to a useful drug is virtually limitless.
Combinatorial chemistry will enable researchers to make compounds for
screening at a rate thousands, or even millions, of times faster than
anything possible today. They will be able to test billions of new chemical
structures. Although only a tiny fraction of these will show any
pharmacological effects, the sheer scale of activity is bound to lead to
many new drugs.
Indeed combinatorial chemistry - or molecular diversity, as the technology
is also known - may turn out to be the most important new approach in
organic chemistry for many years. It has, however, received little attention
beyond a relatively narrow circle of pharmaceutical researchers, partly
because few chemists make an effort to communicate with the outside world
and partly because most science journalists see chemistry as too boring to
produce good stories.
Combinatorial chemistry represents something of a break from the traditional
philosophy of chemical synthesis, which is devoted to producing a single
pure compound in sufficient quantity - at least a milligram - for testing
and analysis.
The new idea, in contrast, is to make simultaneously the greatest possible
variety of compounds in amounts measured in nanograms (millionths of a
milligram). That is just enough to screen for biological activity - for
example with an enzyme test - using the most sensitive modern techniques.
The challenge is not so much how to make a mixture of millions of compounds
as how to 'label' each one unambiguously. Then, if it gives positive test
results, it can be identified and synthesised in much larger quantities for
further investigation and refinement.
Combinatorial chemists have invented several different methods for achieving
this. A favourite way is to attach the new compounds chemically to the
surface of microscopic plastic beads (which are similar in size to animal
cells and can be manipulated with the instruments used in cell biology). In
bulk, they look like talcum powder. Separately, inert chemical 'tagging
molecules' are linked to the beads, to record the series of reactions each
bead has undergone.
The tags are designed to be removed and decoded easily with standard
laboratory instruments. For example, Affymax of Palo Alto, California - a
leader in the new wave of start-up companies specialising in combinatorial
chemistry - builds up short tagging chains of nucleotides, the building
blocks of DNA. Pharmacopoeia, in Princeton, New Jersey, labels its beads
with simple molecules containing fluorine and / or chlorine.
The combinatorial process starts by dividing the microscopic beads between a
number of flasks - say, 20. Each undergoes a different chemical reaction, in
which the first molecular building blocks and tags are attached. Then the
beads are mixed back together and divided again into 20 vessels to undergo a
second set of reactions and tagging. By the time the process has been
carried out five times, there are 20 x 20 x 20 x 20 x 20 different chemical
combinations on the beads. That makes 3.2m new compounds, each with
distinctive tags showing which reactions it has undergone.
The reactions chosen will depend on what sort of 'chemical library' the
researchers want to create. Early work has concentrated on a relatively
simple combinatorial project: building up compounds called peptides
(miniature proteins) from different combinations of the 20 naturally
occurring amino acids. But chemists are now designing combinatorial reaction
schemes for other chemical families, including the types of small molecule
that are the mainstay of the pharmaceutical industry.
One sign of excitement is the flow of American venture capital into small
companies specialising in combinatorial chemistry. The large, established
pharmaceutical companies are also starting to exploit the technology.
Although combinatorial chemistry is already beginning to boost chemists'
confidence, it is too soon for it to have produced any proven drugs.
However, by generating billions of new compounds over the next few years,
the technology will undoubtedly throw up useful medicines that would never
have emerged through traditional screening or biotechnology.

FT  23 APR 94 / The system takes the blame, not the whites - Despatches /
Patti Waldmeir asks an ANC youth leader to explain the extraordinary
inter-racial goodwill in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So, I ask, getting straight to the point, why don't you hate whites? I am
from Detroit, and have experienced more racial hatred in five minutes in my
home town than in five years in South Africa.
Every white visitor to South Africa notices it: the extraordinary
inter-racial goodwill which has defied the logic of 350 years of racist
oppression.
Semoka Sedibe, African National Congress youth leader in the black township
of Katlehong near Johannesburg, smiles indulgently at my crude question, and
assures me: 'There is no way I can hate whites. To hate whites would be
unfair.'
How strange to invoke the notion of justice in this context, after decades
in which institutionalised injustice has been almost the sole preserve of
whites. But Semoka has foresworn the easy options of rancour and revenge;
his goal - and that of his political masters in the ANC - is reconciliation.
'The conflict in our country is not a particular race fighting against
another but it's a particular system which wants to create divisions and
tensions. Our problem has not been whites per se, our problem has been the
system which has privileged whites or has co-opted them to be the culprits
of apartheid.
'If we blame all whites, what about the blacks who have been involved in the
massacres of our people? There are black people who have in fact done worse
things than whites.'
Cynics would say that Semoka is doing no more than parrot the ANC's
long-held policy of non-racialism, its colour-blind blueprint for the future
South Africa.
But cynics would miss the point, which is that Semoka clearly believes what
he says: it is there in the body language, in the earnestness of his gaze,
manifestations of the extraordinary generosity of spirit which I have
experienced from black South Africans, again and again, in township after
township, throughout the past five years.
'We are saying that because apartheid has destroyed, let us forget the past
and begin to build anew. To minimise conflict and misunderstanding we need
to come together . . . hence emphasis was made on the government of national
unity.'
In that government, to be elected within days and scheduled to rule until
1999, white ministers from the National Party, the party of apartheid, will
share power with the ANC (and others, if they gain at least 5 per cent of
the national vote). The agreement to share power with whites was the crucial
compromise which finally persuaded the National Party to end apartheid, and
Semoka wholeheartedly supports it.
As chairperson of the ANC youth league in Katlehong (the title 'chairman' is
taboo, even for males), he is scarcely likely to deviate from the party
line, which is that power sharing is necessary to build national unity.
'Decisions will have to be reached by consensus and the National Party must
be part of that consensus,' he says. But consensus is a word whose
definition varies according to context; and in the context of a large ANC
electoral majority, it is likely to mean little.
Semoka is already preparing for that day: the National Party will have
ministers in the new government, he says; 'But they must do what the
government of national unity (ie Nelson Mandela) wants them to do.'
Indeed, Semoka suggests that the National Party is being included in the
government to allow it to make up for the wrongs committed under apartheid:
'They must assist us in solving all these problems. We will say: you have
damaged this, repair it, because you are the ones.'
Semoka expects no quick fix for the problems of the past: indeed, in spite
of all the warnings from sage political commentators about the impossibly
high expectations of black South Africans, my experience in the townships
suggests otherwise.
For months I have been asking township activists what they expect from a new
government. Again and again, the response is touchingly modest: one wants
dirt roads re-graded, another wants latrines to replace bucket toilets; no
one mentioned a house in a white suburb or the boss's Mercedes (the stuff of
white scare stories).
Once again, the ANC's message - that it offers a better life to blacks, but
that transformation cannot take place overnight - seems to have penetrated
well into the grassroots.
So, I ask Semoka, how long will you wait for the 'better life'?
'The question will be the availability of resources,' he says soberly,
'because one may say, I think within a year they (houses, electricity, etc)
must be there, but if there are no adequate resources it's a problem.'
In any case, he points out: 'Peace is the primary thing: if there can be a
creation of permanent peace as a first point, and second the question of
jobs, then we will be able to address these other issues.'
But Semoka is not sitting back and waiting for economic manna to descend
from ANC-heaven: as I enter Katlehong, women are clearing the median strip
of rubbish and planting flowers. This is an ANC youth league initiative: R1m
has been raised from local businesses for a township clean-up campaign. And
Semoka makes clear that the local community is not going to have its
development priorities set by Pretoria, even when the ANC is in charge
there. The Katlehong community will determine its own priorities - and the
ANC government must listen.
With any luck, the strength of community organisations such as the ANC youth
league in Katlehong will provide a powerful antidote to abuse of power by
central government, and help to guarantee that South Africa's future is
democratic.
For local organisations such as these can take the real credit for ending
apartheid - far more than Umkhonto we Sizwe (spear of the nation), the ANC's
inept military wing, or international strategies such as sanctions.
By mobilising people around their daily concerns - poor housing, lack of
services, violence - local civic and community groups succeeded in making
the country's black townships ungovernable.
And that dealt a fatal blow to Pretoria's authority.
Unfortunately, ungovernability seems to be surviving beyond apartheid,
nowhere more so than in the three-township complex of
Katlehong-Thokoza-Vosloorus which is Semoka's home. For the indulgence of
most township residents towards whites is not mirrored in their attitude to
other blacks, especially if they live in migrant workers' hostels and belong
to the Inkatha Freedom Party.
Here again, Semoka pleads for tolerance, drawing on the Marxist analysis
that exonerates individuals and blames the political system of apartheid for
the fighting which has plagued Katlehong. (Semoka is a member of the South
African Communist Party, like many young ANC members; but he assures me that
the time is not yet ripe for communism in South Africa).
He believes Inkatha members are merely innocent victims of a larger
state-supported force to destroy peace in the township.
'This is not a Zulu/Xhosa conflict or ANC/Inkatha conflict, it is conflict
by forces which are against peace, democracy and freedom in our country.
Throughout our struggle, we have fought gallantly to bring about the
situation we are in today and now in the era of our freedom they want to
turn the clock back. This is not going to be allowed.'
Semoka says he has never killed anyone in the fighting, but acknowledges
that the youth league has armed 'self-defence units' to protect the
community (television viewers will have seen these men shooting AK-47
assault rifles at hostels in the past few days of violence).
Still, he is adamant that peace must be made between the community and the
hostel-dwellers (who live in what amount to armed camps separate from other
residents).
Given the brutality of life in the Katlehong war zone - the hideous
atrocities committed by both sides, the appalling fear attendant on life in
a state of anarchy, the sense of total hopelessness - that is itself a
triumph of the human spirit.
But one suspects that reconciliation with rival blacks (who are viewed as
traitors to the liberation cause) could in the end prove a far larger task
for Semoka and his neighbours than learning to live with whites.

FT  23 APR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Bat men master sales drive - Club
cricket starts today. Clive Fewins visits a company that supplies the
'thwack'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sound of nearly 300 summers is upon us. Today will bring the traditional
thwack of leather against willow on 1,000 cricket grounds and village greens
up and down the country.
Britain's amateur cricketers are about to start their season and, judging
from the sales figures at one of Britain's 10 or so small batmakers a high
proportion is buying new bats.
'There seems to be an definite upturn. We have sold 40 per cent more bats
than at this time last year,' said Tony Byers, of Newbery Cricket Bats of
Robertsbridge. 'The factory is nearly empty; all the bats are in the shops,
which is exactly the way it should be at this time of year.'
Byers describes himself as the 'general factotum' of the company, which
employs three full-timers and three part-timers in a cramped but rambling
1,200 sq ft first floor workshop in a former flour mill in East Sussex.
Byers, 29, came to the company four years ago, straight from graduating at
Leicester University, where he captained the cricket first eleven.
He arrived at a two-man enterprise in a town famous for its hand-made bats.
The Newbery workshop is dwarfed by the neighbouring buildings of
Gray-Nicholls, one of the UK's largest batmakers.
In 1990, Newbery batmakers Tim Keeley and Kevin Woodgate were turning out
1,900 bats a year and just breaking even. But they had lost their mentor,
ex-Sussex cricketer and doyen of batmakers, John Newbery, who died of cancer
at 52.
Keeley and Woodgate decided to carry on in the old wooden building, but they
had no business plan and no marketing. Most of the sales were by word of
mouth, to passers-by and in large contract batches at low prices to sports
sales companies who added their own labels and a large mark-up.
They were skilled batmakers, but not salesmen. To survive they had to sell
to a cricketing world that was rapidly embracing commercial razzmatazz and
corporate sponsorship.
The first thing Byers did was to set up a limited company, with accountant
Mike Norman, the executor of Newbery's estate, as a director. Woodgate, a
family man, continued to draw a salary, but Byers and Keeley decided to
defer the majority of their salaries, paying it instead into a loan account
to help the company grow.
They negotiated a Pounds 15,000 overdraft with the National Westminster
bank, and formulated a marketing strategy, with a strong emphasis on a new
corporate style, with the company name emblazoned on its first own-brand
bats. Byers travelled to India where he negotiated terms for Indian-made
pads, batting gloves and protection equipment, which the company now sells
to shops alongside Newbery bats.
Then Byers began touring sports shops across the UK in his capacity as
salesman. He is also company book-keeper, credit controller, marketing
supremo, receptionist, typist and office boy.
Keeley, 34, and Woodgate, 38, worked long hours to increase production and
Keeley continued selecting the timber from bat willow specialists,
controlling an annual expenditure of about Pounds 50,000.
The policy seems to be working. Six months through the company's accounting
year they have sold 1,700 out of a target of 3,500 bats, 200 remain unsold
in stock.
'If we sell 3,500 we stand to make a net profit of around Pounds 15,000. Not
brilliant, but we have put a lot of money into updating the company, and on
new developments such as our new multi-balance bat handle,' said Byers.
At busy times Keeley and Woodgate are helped by Keeley's brother, Nick. The
other two part-timers work mainly on repairs and the checking and packing of
protective equipment, which accounts for 15 per cent of this year's expected
Pounds 230,000 to Pounds 250,000 turnover. Keeley and Woodgate concentrate
on the skill of hand-shaping and balancing the blades; the sprung handles
are bought in.
The pair learnt their skill from John Newbery. Both worked under him at Gray
Nicholls before he left in 1981 to form his own company. They stayed with
him and watched his enterprise, at Northiam, 10 miles from Robertsbridge, go
into liquidation. By the time the company reformed in the present building
in 1986, Keeley and Woodgate were highly experienced batmakers.
Many top professionals now use the company's bats.
'I can't say which, if any, of the England team that has just played in the
West Indies, use our bats because of commercial agreements,' Byers said.
'However we have several international cricketers among our private
clients.' (It is not unknown for cricketers to accept a sponsorship deal
from a company whose bats they do not use and stick the sponsor's logo over
the existing brand name.)
'We also have a policy of sponsoring a dozen professionals who use our
equipment. It costs us about Pounds 350 to support a player for a season in
this way. This represents a fair slice of our profits, but they are a
delightful bunch and we think it well worthwhile.'
Among the 12 are Kent captain and former England opening bat Mark Benson and
Sussex opener Neil Lenham. Lenham's association with Newbery also spawned
one of two new developments, a built-in shatterproof nylon handshield.
'Neil had broken his right index finger so many times that between us we
managed to design and produce this hand guard,' Byers said. 'Development
costs plus a little advertising cost us about Pounds 4,000. Hand guards are
not permitted in the first class game and the project is sleeping at present
but it opened an awful lot of doors.'
If the three achieve a net profit of Pounds 15,000 at the end of this year
they will be well satisfied.
'We are on target and we have just negotiated a Pounds 50,000 five-year loan
at 2 1/2 per cent above base rate under the government's small business loan
guarantee scheme that will replace our overdraft and help to smooth out
seasonal variations and build up stocks,' Byers said. 'We have also just won
a Pounds 30,000 contract to supply bats to a wholesaler in South Africa. Who
knows, we might even be able to pay ourselves back some of the money we have
lent to the company.'

FT  23 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: New issues and tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My query concerns new issues, particularly privatisations, where the payment
is made by instalments.
A friend tells me that where payment of the 'calls' occurs within 12 months
of the first payment, then indexation for capital gains tax applies to the
full payment (including the calls) from the date of the first payment.
Is this correct and, if so, where do I find the relevant legislation?
There are two distinct situations (with distinct indexation rules):
1. Where shares are issued by a company partly-paid, then calls paid before
the anniversary of their issue rank for indexation from the day of issue.
2. Where existing shares are sold on credit terms - as in privatisation
offers - the whole of the purchase price (net of discounts, etc) ranks for
indexation from the day of their acquisition.
The whole of the purchase price (net of discounts, etc) is deemed to have
been paid at the outset; if the shares are sold by the purchaser before all
the instalments actually have been paid, the outstanding instalments are
deemed to form part of the sale proceeds.
The rule which prevents calls on partly-paid shares paid after the
anniversary of their issue (or on the anniversary) from being indexed
retrospectively is in section 113 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act
1992.
The basic rule - that indexation on the whole of the acquisition cost
(regardless of whether the cash has actually been handed over) runs from the
day of acquisition - is in section 54(4)(a) of that act.
The rule that treats outstanding instalments as part of the proceeds of sale

FT  23 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Transferring investments
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A friend made some assured-tenancy business expansion scheme investments in
February and March 1989. Her total investment was Pounds 5,500. She wants to
transfer all these to me in return for a sum of money to be agreed mutually.
Can you tell me:
1. Is a special form required (eg, a stock transfer form)?
2. After which date can this be done without affecting her tax relief?
1. Yes. Stock transfer forms are obtainable from business stationers. Stamp
duty will be payable at 0.5 per cent (in multiples of 50p).
2. After the fifth anniversary of the issue of the shares (check the dates
on the share certificates), by virtue of sections 299 and 289(12)(a) of the
Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. There must be no agreement or option
before then.

FT  23 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A claim that looks a loser
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Four years ago I made a substantial, unsecured, interest-free loan to a
small private company in the UK of which I am a non-executive director but
not a shareholder.
The company has now gone into creditors' liquidation and there appears to be
no likelihood of the loan being repaid to me.
Would I succeed in claiming the amount of this loan as a deduction against
my taxable income, which consists solely of earned income (ie, salary and
bonus)?
On these brief facts, we think you would not succeed. But you should consult
your accountant for specific guidance. (Answer by Murray Johnstone Personal
Management Ltd.)

FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Top to bottom cover - Douglas Deakin
Young / 13th in a series on fee-based advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The firm of Douglas Deakin Young is no recent convert to fee-based financial
advice. DDY was founded in 1975 by George Douglas, James Deakin and Louise
Botting - now its chairman - and has always done business on a fees-only
basis. But DDY is rather different from most firms of independent financial
advisers (IFAs).
It concentrated initially on providing independent advice to the directors
and employees of large corporations. Managing director Alan Warner recalls:
'In those days, we specialised in executive financial planning, which was
extended to the shop floor when it came to redundancies.' As one example,
DDY advisers counselled 450 staff individually when Associated Newspapers
first closed the London Evening News in 1980.
Today, DDY has a glittering corporate client list which includes Argyll
Group, Courtaulds, IPC, Littlewoods, Rank Xerox and the English National
Opera. In addition, there are more than 750 private clients. Some went to
DDY through a corporate contact, others via personal recommendation.
DDY provides comprehensive financial planning and will also deal with tax
affairs. 'The one area where we are not competent is in legal matters,' says
Warner, who trained as a accountant with Touche Ross. 'Say a client was
going to the Channel Islands - we would double-check his plans with a firm
of solicitors.'
DDY's fees range from Pounds 75 to Pounds 165 an hour and private clients
are billed in advance. New clients are seen at the firm's office in London's
Piccadilly - heart of the West End - and their initial half-hour interview
is free.
Because DDY handles client money, over recent years it has laid emphasis on
developing its investment management side. It offers a choice of three
services. The discretionary service has an 0.5 per cent annual management
fee; the nominee advisory service costs 0.2 per cent a year, plus broker's
commission; and the own-name portfolio management service costs Pounds 360 a
year.
The nominee advisory service, where clients are consulted before any action
is taken, has proved to be the most popular option. All clients, no matter
the service, are contacted at least twice a year and each has a named
adviser.
'People often say that one of the things they like about us is that they are
dealing with the same person,' says Warner.
The house investment style is cautious. If Warner is using pooled vehicles,
he prefers investment trusts to unit trusts as he believes the latter have
become too expensive. 'Some clients want all equities and others want no
risk and have very large contingency funds,' says Warner.
'As with any investment, the client comes first. But if you took the average
client - in his 50s or just retired - for sums below Pounds 100,000, we will
look to have a good 60 per cent in risk-free assets. We will go up to 60 per
cent in equities if clients have more than Pounds 100,000.'
DDY has more than Pounds 100m under management and Warner believes this can
be a spring-board for further expansion. 'I would like to see our investment
management side built up, now that we have got critical mass,' he says. 'I
would like Pounds 250m under management.
'The point about funds under management is that you have got a stable
business. With a consultancy practice, business comes and goes.'
He stresses, however, there will be no rush for growth at DDY. 'In the past,
we have tried diversification into mortgages and our own business expansion
scheme, with no success.
'I believe in concentrating on what we think we are good at - which is
investment management, financial planning and redundancy counselling. This
is a very labour-intensive and personal business, and I think it is the kind
of service that is best provided by a relatively small organisation.'

FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Boost for annuities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER QUINTON, The Annuity Bureau
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's dive in the UK gilts market - about a 10 per cent drop in the
price of 20-year stocks since January 1 - might have given investors a rough
ride, but those about to retire could benefit. For sliding bond prices mean
a rise in yields. And, when yields rise, so do annuity rates.
The present trend of the high coupon, gross redemption yield of 15-year
gilts virtually forecasts how annuity rates will move over the following few
days. Annuity rates determine the income received by buyers when they
retire.
Life companies generally set their annuity rates in line with existing
yields of long-dated government stock. But life expectancy rates also
matter. Norwich Union, among others, announced new rates in January as a
result of revising its life expectancy tables. Interestingly, the changes
were not all one way.
So, where does this leave the investor with a pension fund to cash in?
First, consider if you need an income now or can afford to delay buying an
annuity. If you see a low growth, low inflation environment continuing
indefinitely, you could feel that now's as good a time as any to buy your
annuity.
You might, however, feel that the government could be forced to crank up the
economy, with a consequent rise in inflation - and, therefore, annuity
rates. You can, of course, hedge your bets by considering phased retirement
so that you buy your annuities over a period of time.
Second, you should shop round, using your open market option. This allows
you to select the best annuity rate on offer, even if it is not from the
life office running your fund.
At any one time, there can be as much as a 25 per cent difference between
the best and worst providers, which means substantial savings over the
period of your retirement if you choose the right one.
Remember, too, that different products suit different needs. Escalating
annuities are an inflation hedge. And it can be tax-efficient to use your
tax-free lump sum to buy a life annuity.

FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Your CGT allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The table shows CGT indexation allowances for March. Multiply the original
cost of the asset by the figure for the month you bought it. Subtract the
result from the proceeds of your sale; the balance is your taxable gain or
loss. Say you bought shares for Pounds 6,000 in September 1985 and sold them
in March 1994 for Pounds 13,000. Multiplying the original cost by the
September 1985 figure of 1.493 gives a total of Pounds 8,958. Subtracting
that from the Pounds 13,000 gives a capital gain of Pounds 4,042, which is
within the 1993-94 CGT allowanace of Pounds 5,800. If selling shares bought
before April 6 1982, use the March 1982 figures. The Budget decision that
indexation cannot be used to create or increase a loss for shares sold after
November 29 1993 has now been modified by arrangements for Pounds 10,000 of
transitional relief (see Investors benefit).

<TEXT>
The government's belated concession on capital gains tax indexation has some
unexpected side effects. The change in the basis of calculating relief means
that some investors will be better off than they would have been before the
Budget rule change.
Unusually, you can use up part of your annual CGT exemption in 1993-94, even
if your indexation losses in that year exceed your gains. Normally, losses
have to be offset against profits before taking account of the exemption.

FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: CGT and you - a final / Many readers

and Alan Sugden examine three aspects not highlighted before - investment
trusts, unit trusts and warrants - as well as queries on stock exchange
investments

<TEXT>
INVESTMENT TRUSTS AND UNIT TRUSTS
The main difference between these is that investment trusts (ITs) are what
is known as closed-end funds and unit trusts (UTs) are open-ended.
Investment trusts. The managers of ITs cannot create new shares to sell to
investors except when an issue of new shares is made, and they can't buy in
shares from investors. Hence the term closed-end.
If you want to buy or sell shares in an IT, you do so in the market at the
market price. This price depends on supply and demand, not the value of the
trust's underlying assets. But some ITs have a finite life; at the end of
it, they are wound up and the net proceeds distributed to the shareholders
pro rata.
The only other way out of an IT is if somebody comes along and bids
successfully for it at a price closer to the underlying value of its assets.
This has happened to several ITs in the past few years, including the Pounds
1.2bn Globe investment trust acquired by the National Coal Board pension
fund in 1990.
For CGT purposes, IT shares are treated just like any other.
Unit trusts. Unlike the IT manager, the manager of a UT is able to create
new units or cancel old ones as demand requires. Hence the expression
open-ended.
Buying and selling UTs is normally carried out through their managers at the
offer or bid prices. These are based on the value of the UT's assets.
To summarise: Investors in an IT can sell only at the market price - which
might (and often used to) be at a substantial discount to the value of the
trust's assets. Investors in a UT can get out at the underlying value, less
expenses.
UT equalisation. When you buy UT units from the manager, part of the cost is
an accrual of income called equalisation. This is paid back to you with the
next dividend; the tax voucher shows how much of the total paid is
equalisation and how much is dividend.
The equalisation is not taxed as income and, for CGT purposes, should be
deducted from the cost of the units you bought. Apart from this, units in a
UT are treated just like shares for CGT.
ITs and UTs do not have to pay CGT on transactions within their portfolio of
investments; this can give them a considerable advantage over the private
investor. A chargeable gain or an allowable loss is made only when the IT
shareholder or UT unit-holder sells.
IT and UT monthly savings schemes. In March 1989, the Inland Revenue issued
a Statement of Practice (5P 3/89) which introduced an optional alternative
basis for indexation. Under this, the cost of shares or units invested
through a monthly savings scheme during the accounting year of the IT or UT
will be aggregated and treated as if they were a single investment made in
the seventh month of that year.
Thus, on any subsequent sale, the investor will have to make only one
indexation calculation each year instead of 12.
The optional basis can be used if the investor elects to do so within two
years of the end of the tax year in which he disposes of units or shares
acquired via a monthly savings scheme, and (i) the resulting gains, together
with any other gains made in the year, exceed the CGT exemption for that
year; or (ii) the total proceeds of disposals in that year exceed twice the
annual exemption; or (iii) disposals in that year result in net losses.
Further information on ITs and UTs. For personal information, we suggest
readers write to the manager concerned. For general information, write to
the secretary of the Association of Investment Trust Companies, Park House
(6th Floor), 16 Finsbury Circus, London EC2M 7JJ; or to the secretary of the
Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, 65 Kingsway, London WC2B
6TD.
Warrants
A warrant is the right to buy a share at a certain price.
Cost apportionment. To answer several readers' queries, let us see how this
applies to an IT which issues shares and warrants in units of, say, five
shares plus one warrant.
The normal method, as shown in Table 4 of our third article (Zeneca/ICI:
Weekend FT, March 19/20), is for cost apportionment to be done on the issue
of a package containing warrants (see Table 1, Method A - Cost apportionment
on issue).
There is, however, an alternative method where warrants are issued to
acquire shares of the same class.
In this method, the warrants are treated as part of the holding of shares to
which the warrant-holders are entitled to subscribe, and cost apportionment
takes place on any disposal from that holding (See Table l, Method B - Cost
apportionment on disposal).
At least one IT uses this alternative method. The documents accompanying the
issue
of warrants should state which method to use but, if in doubt, we suggest
readers write to the IT concerned.
There are two reasons why it has become fashionable for ITs to issue shares
with warrants.
1. IT shares usually stand at a discount to net asset value.
2. The net asset value initially is less than the issue price. This is
because of issue expenses, dealing costs, and any initial charge made by the
IT (known as front-end loading). The warrant element helps to bridge the
adverse gap that otherwise would be likely between the first market value
and the issue price.
BTR warrants. Since 1988, a company called BTR has been making an annual
scrip issue of warrants to its ordinary shareholders.
BTR has confirmed that the alternative method, cost apportionment on
disposal, should be used. This saves having to make a cost apportionment
annually when further warrants are issued.
When any part of the holding (BTR shares or warrants) are sold, the investor
should make the following calculation, using the market prices on the day of
disposal:
A = Market value of shares or warrants sold.
B = Market value of remaining holding (shares and warrants).
C = Cost of entire holding indexed to date of sale.
Cost apportionment:
Shares or warrants sold = A (A+B) x C.
Remainder of holding = B (A+B) x C.
'Free' shares
Readers have asked about loyalty bonus shares in privatisation issues, and
about the free issue of 100 shares made by Abbey National to each
account-holder when it went public.
Where there was a loyalty bonus, or where investors chose to receive a
loyalty bonus rather than the vouchers offered in some issues, the value of
the bonus shares received is treated as being the market value on the date
they were issued.
British Gas, for example, offered a one for 10 loyalty bonus (to a maximum
of 500 shares) to subscribers who held their shares continuously from the
offer for sale to December 31 1989. The market value on the issue of these
loyalty shares was 234.5p apiece.
Had the subscriber chosen the alternative of vouchers to set against future
gas bills, the value of these should be deducted from the original cost of
his holding.
With Abbey National, the acquisition cost was nil. So, the treatment for CGT
is this:
1. When a shareholder who has not bought any further shares in Abbey sells
his 100, the whole of the proceeds of the sale is a chargeable gain.
2. When a shareholder who has also bought Abbey stock sells all or part of
his holding, the 100 'free' shares are added to the pool at nil cost.
Declaring losses
A reader asks: When carrying losses forward, is it necessary or mandatory to
enter the brought/forward losses in your tax return for years in which the
b/f losses are not used to offset against gains in that year?
To which the Inland Revenue replies: 'You must keep records of losses you
wish to carry forward to future tax years. Your tax office cannot agree your
losses until you have made a gain from which the loss can be deducted.'
Our advice is to show the total of losses brought forward each year -
whether or not you are going to use them in that year - for two very good
reasons.
First, doing so will help you keep track of them. Second, it will be easier
to prove them to your tax office when the time comes to use them.
Transfers between
husbands and wives
A number of readers are concerned that the Revenue might view transfers as
avoidance of tax and refuse to accept them.
As we said in our last article (March 27/28): 'The distinction between tax
avoidance and tax planning is very fine.' We would suggest the following
guidelines:
1. Ensure that the ownership of the security is transferred legally.
2 Although the date of the transfer normally is taken as the date of signing
of the stock transfer form, do not sell before the new share certificate is
received. The sale can then be made in the name of the new owner, who will
give the new share certificate to the broker, and will be paid the net
proceeds of the sale.
3. Do not agree the eventual sale before the transfer is made.
4. The new owner should hold the security for as long as possible in order
to show that the sole purpose of the transfer was not merely to avoid tax.
Rights issues - partial
sale nil-paid
When a shareholder sells some rights nil-paid to help pay for taking up the
rest, is the sale deemed to be a disposal? The 5 per cent rule, described in
our third article, applies here (see Table 2).
Enhanced scrip dividends
Readers asked for a worked example of a shareholder accepting both an
enhanced share alternative and the broker's offer to purchase the new shares
at a fixed price, free of any commission or dealing costs, for cash
settlement.
The calculation involves three share prices: the reference price (which is
the average of the best bid and offer price over a specified period); the
price on the first day of dealing; and the price offered by the broker (see
Table 3.
Indexation - making
your tax return
If your net chargeable gains amount to less than the annual exemption
without indexation, but your total proceeds from disposals in that year
exceed twice the annual exemption, ignore indexation and put a note with
your transaction details to tell the tax inspector why you have done so.
Valuing a dead
person's estate
In our first article (March 5/6), we said that an estate is valued using the
open-market value on the date of death (or, if that was not a working day,
on the last day for which prices were published before death).
One reader has pointed out that this is correct for unit trusts. For shares,
however, the executors can take the lower of the value of the portfolio on
the last working day before death and the first working day after death.
Transitional relief
on indexation
In our second article (March 12/13), we described the proposed changes to
the rules on indexation.
For disposals made on or after November 30 1993, indexation would be allowed
only to reduce or eliminate a capital gain. It would no longer be possible
to create or increase a loss by indexation. But modifications have now been
made to the Finance Bill going through parliament.
Under the modifications, individuals and trustees would be allowed to use
indexation to create or increase losses by up to Pounds 10,000 on disposals
between November 30 1993 and April 5 1995 (see table on Page VI). This would
encourage loss-taking and bed and breakfasting between now and April 5 and
could save the higher-rate taxpayer up to Pounds 4,000 in CGT.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                TABLE 1. WARRANTS ISSUED IN A 'PACKAGE'
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
METHOD A - Cost Apportionment on issue. An Investment Trust issues
shares and warrants in units of 5 shares plus 1 warrant, at a cost of
Pounds 5.00 per unit. Let us say:
        First market value of one share     = 97p
        First market value of one warrant   = 25p
        Thus First market value of one unit = 510p
Cost apportionment:
        Share   =    97p x (500/510)  = 95.1p
        Warrant =    25p x (500/510)  = 24.5p
        Unit    = (95.1p x 5) + 24.5p = 500p
METHOD B - Cost Apportionment on disposal
An Investment Trust issues shares and warrants in units of 5 shares
plus 1 warrant, at a cost of Pounds 5.00 per unit.
An investor buys 1,000 units at a cost of
Pounds 5,000. Some time later he
sells the warrants for Pounds 970 net.
 Let us say that, on the date of sale, the market prices were:
        Investment Trust shares   = 180p
        Investment Trust warrants = 100p
        Value of 5,000 shares   = 5,000 x 180p = Pounds 9,000
        Value of 1,000 warrants = 1,000 x 100p = Pounds 1,000
        Value of 5,000 units    = Pounds 10,000
Cost apportionment:
        Shares   = Pounds 5,000 x (9,000/10,000) = Pounds 4,500
        Warrants = Pounds 5,000 x (1,000/10,090) = Pounds 500
Chargeable gain on sale of 1,000 warrants:
    - Pounds 970 - (Pounds 500 indexed to date of sale)
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
           TABLE 2. RIGHTS ISSUE - PARTIAL SALE NIL PAID
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
A company makes a 1 for 3 rights issue at 80p.
Before the rights issue an investor held 30,000 shares, entitling him
to subscribe for 10,000 new shares.
He decides to sell 8,000 of his rights nil paid, to help pay for taking up
the other 2,000, and does so at 14p, realising Pounds 1,094 net of expenses.
He pays Pounds 1,600 to take up the remainder. On the first day of dealing
ex-rights, the old shares stand at 94p.
Is the sale deemed to be a disposal ? Let the proceeds of the sale of 8,000
rights = A = Pounds 1,094 and the value of his holding of the old shares
that gave rise to the rights sold, ex-rights
= B = 24,000 x 94p = Pounds 22,560
                              A Pounds  1,094
          The proportion sold = --- =            4.85%
                              B Pounds 22,560
So, as this is less than 5%, the sale is not deemed to be a disposal. For
CGT purposes, Pounds 1,094 is deducted from the cost of the original holding
indexed to the date of sale.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
               TABLE 3. ENHANCED SCRIP DIVIDENDS
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The
company declares a cash dividend of 10p per share, and offers shareholders
the alternative of an enhanced scrip dividend of 15p per share. There is
also an offer by the broker to buy the new shares. A shareholder who has a
holding of 1,000 shares, with an indexed cost of Pounds 948, decides to take
the enhanced scrip dividend and accept the broker's offer to buy his new
shares.
The reference price (the average of the best bid and offer prices over a
specified period) is 150p, the price on the first day of dealing is 152p,
and the broker's offer is 148p.
                                     15p
          Shares received = 1,000 x ---- = 100 shares
                                    150p
Income tax is based on the first day of dealing price: Net income (treated
as 20% tax paid)= 100 x 152p = Pounds 152 Gross income = Pounds 152 x 100/80
= Pounds 190 Income tax payable will depend on the shareholder's marginal
rate: Basic (25%) and lower rate (20%) taxpayers have no further liability
to tax. Nil rate taxpayers will not be entitled to reclaim 20%, as the
company has paid no ACT on the enhanced scrip dividend. Higher rate (40%)
taxpayers will be liable to an income tax payment of (40% - 20%) x Pounds
190 = Pounds 38.
Capital gains tax. The value of the 100 new shares is added to the indexed
cost of the 1000 shares already held, to make a total of 1100 shares with a
total cost of Pounds 948 + Pounds 152 = Pounds 1,100.  The cost apportioned
to the 100 shares sold = Pounds 100.  The new shares were sold for Pounds
148, so the chargeable gain is Pounds 48. Fractional entitlements. Had there
been a fractional entitlement, it would have been paid as a cash dividend at
the cash dividend rate of 10p per share. eg: had our shareholder held 1,005
shares, a cash dividend of 10p per share would have been paid to him. ie: a
cash dividend of 10p x 5 shares = 50p.

Lord Palumbo is a millionaire property developer who stepped down early this
month as chairman of the Arts Council just before details of a bitter family
feud with James Palumbo and Annabella Adams, his son and daughter from his
first marriage, became public knowledge.
They issued a writ in England's High Court against the trustees of the
Palumbo Family Settlement: their father, their Lebanese-born step-mother,
accountant Thomas Tharby and solicitor John Underwood. It claims the four
have benefited personally from their positions; have mismanaged trust
assets; and that the inclusion as beneficiaries of Palumbo's three children
by his second marriage is invalid.
The Settlement was established in 1955 by Palumbo's father, Rudolph, to hold
some of the fortune he made from developing wartime bomb sites in the City
of London. Beneficiaries are Lord Palumbo and his children. At present, it
contains about two-thirds of the Rugarth Investment Trust Ltd, the holding
company for Palumbo's property assets. The other third is owned personally
by him.
The writ has come at a difficult time for Palumbo. He is about to start a
controversial development of a key site in the City. Part of the finance is
planned to come from the Settlement - at a time when the value of the
Palumbo property assets reportedly has fallen by Pounds 30m (from Pounds 94m
to Pounds 64m) in the past year.

FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: The Palumbos - a family at war -
Trust expert Caroline Garnham explains the background to an extraordinary
court case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GARNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Palumbo family wrangle is interesting for the points of law which are
likely to emerge concerning the difficult but important role of a
director/trustee. In this case, Lord Palumbo, Thomas Tharby and John
Underwood all are directors of Rugarth and/or one or more of its
subsidiaries, as well as being trustees of the Family Settlement.
There is nothing wrong with being a director as well as a trustee. In fact,
in some cases, judges have encouraged trustees actively to use their powers
as shareholders to put their man on the board. But the role of a director
who is a trustee as well is to protect the trust assets for all the
beneficiaries and is, therefore, significantly more onerous than that of a
director alone.
A company director is under an obligation to his company as determined by
company law - but only indirectly to the shareholders of that company who
have the power to remove him. On the other hand, a trustee of a family trust
must, under trust law, take 'such care as an ordinary, prudent man would
take if he were minded to make an investment for the benefit of other people
for whom he felt morally bound to provide.'
Furthermore, where a trust owns the majority of shares in a private company
 -such as the Palumbo Family Settlement and Rugarth - the law expects the
trustees to use their position of control to make sure that the company does
not start any project which is imprudent, hazardous, or wholly unsuitable
for a trust.
This does not mean that a trustee/director cannot make mistakes. Not all
investments go up in value; some inevitably go down.
So it is not enough for the plaintiffs to show that the Palumbo assets have
fallen in value. To succeed, the plaintiffs will have to prove that the
trustees did not pay due consideration to the protection of the trust
assets; did not ask themselves if the business policy of the company was
appropriate for the trust; or did not know enough to make the necessary
decisions.
The fact that trustees asked themselves the right questions and sought
proper advice - but then, for whatever reason (which need not be disclosed
to the beneficiaries) made, in hindsight, the wrong decision - is
immaterial.
Another aspect of the claim for the Palumbo trustees is that they benefited
personally from their position.
It is a basic legal rule that trustees cannot use their position for
personal benefit, regardless of how onerous or time-consuming their duties
may be.
Any financial benefits they obtain through exercising their powers as a
trustee must be returned to the trust fund.
There are, of course, exceptions to what otherwise would be a very harsh
rule. The first is that trustees can keep any benefits they receive from a
company if they obtained their position with it because of having a
shareholding of their own, or for other reasons that were not connected with
being a trustee.
A second is if they apply to court for an order stipulating that they can
keep their director's fees, remuneration or other benefits. In some cases,
the court will permit the director/trustee some benefit - provided that it
is not excessive.
The third area of trust law upon which the Palumbo case touches is the rule
that trustees exercising powers given to them in the trust deed must do so
with due consideration to all the facts of a case and the needs and
requirements of all the beneficiaries.
In this case, the trustees added the three children of Palumbo's second
marriage as beneficiaries to the Family Settlement. But such an action is
possible only if the deed contains a power for the trustees to do this. If
not, they will have breached trust and the court will act to rectify the
position. But if the trustees do have the power, the court's only interest
is whether it has been exercised properly.
Trustees must not let themselves be bullied by a beneficiary - or anyone
else - against their better judgment, even if that beneficiary is also a
trustee.
If trustees sign everything put in front of them without considering if this
is a proper exercise of their powers, then a court can ignore the trust's
paperwork, such as appointing new beneficiaries.
To date, however, the courts have not interfered in the decisions of
trustees except in extreme or exceptional circumstances.
Given the onerous obligations imposed on them, the restrictions on
trustee/directors, and the possible adverse publicity of a High Court action
if all goes wrong, some may wonder why anyone in their right mind would
create a family trust in the first place.
In many cases, the main reason is to preserve wealth in a tax-efficient way
for future generations. It must be remembered that, because of the Family
Settlement, the Palumbo family has preserved great wealth - and that the
assets in the Settlement escaped tax completely when Rudolph Palumbo died.

FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Motorists who are driven to think
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Young and newly-qualified drivers could soon be rewarded with cheaper
insurance if they take further lessons.
The initiative comes from the Department of Transport and a group of
insurers. Extra lessons would cover areas such as driving on motorways, at
night and in poor weather, none of which is part of the present licence
test.
The move is part of several measures to improve accident rates for young
drivers - the commonly-quoted statistic is that those between 17 and 21 form
only 10 per cent of licence-holders but account for 20 per cent of
accidents.
Other measures announced already include compulsory re-testing for anyone
convicted of a motoring offence within two years of getting their licence
and a separate theory element in the driving test.
Insurers are also concerned that growing numbers of young people are driving
without insurance because they cannot afford the premiums; basic third-party
cover for a teenager can cost about Pounds 500 a year.
The industry estimates that at least one car in 10 is not insured, and the
burden of paying for accidents involving these falls on drivers who do have
cover through comprehensive premiums, and on levies to the Motor Insurers
Bureau. All drivers would benefit if younger motorists had fewer accidents
and cheaper insurance.
Full details of the government-led initiative are still being discussed but
some insurers have taken steps in the same direction already. One is General
Accident, which set up the Vantage scheme for new drivers with the British
School of Motoring.
Those who succeed in completing a Pounds 95 course are entitled to a
discount equivalent to one year's no-claims bonus on comprehensive insurance
with GA. As yet, though, such schemes are not widespread enough to encourage
significant numbers of young people to take the extra lessons.
RAC Insurance Services is lobbying insurers to take a more sympathetic
attitude to good younger drivers without insisting on extra training. It
suggests that new drivers who make no claims in their first year of driving
should be rewarded with a discount bigger than a standard one-year no-claims
bonus.
Younger drivers are often the focus of complaints about poor driving but
many experienced motorists could also benefit from further training.
Opinion surveys tend to show that the majority of drivers pride themselves
on their above-average skills. But anyone with a basic grasp of statistics
(and who has ever ventured on to a motorway) will realise that the survey
reveals little other than widespread self-delusion.
Advanced courses are not usually about skid-pan sessions or anti-hijack
techniques more appropriate to James Bond movies. The main idea is to make
drivers safer, more in control of their vehicles, and more observant in
ordinary driving conditions.
Thus, they are both less likely to cause accidents and can spot tricky
situations and erratic drivers from further away, so avoiding being the
victims of other people's poor driving.
The Institute of Advanced Motorists is the best-known arranger of advanced
driving courses and tests. Its members country-wide provide free training
leading up to the 90-minute advanced test, which costs Pounds 25. The pass
rate for those taking the course is 80 per cent. But only 60 per cent of
those confident enough to go straight for the test without the training pass
first time.
Members convicted of driving offences must tell the institute (in case they
do not, the IAM even has a team checking press cuttings for court reports).
But Ted Clements, its chief examiner, says: 'While our members certainly try
to respect the law, they are not holier than thou and they are not perfect
drivers - just safety conscious.'
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents has a very similar network
of volunteers offering training leading up to a test. And many commercial
organisations offer advanced driving courses although, of course, these will
be more expensive.
The IAM has links with one or two insurers and the RoSPA has a scheme with
Cornhill Insurance, but the rewards from taking an advanced test do not
necessarily result in cheaper insurance on the spot.
The few companies offering direct discounts may be at the more expensive end
of the market, and their discounted premiums could still be higher than
other insurers' standard levies. It is more likely to be that improved
skills help you to avoid accidents and, therefore, have an impact on your
no-claims bonus.
This is what has happened in the fleet insurance market. Increasingly,
companies insist that all those driving their cars complete an advanced
course. Experience has shown that accident rates can be cut by more than
half, leading to much-reduced premiums.
This does not necessarily work as effectively for private drivers, however;
a single non-blameworthy incident, such as a car being stolen or a
hit-and-run accident, can set their claims record back by several years.
To encourage more drivers, new and old, to take steps to improve their
driving, incentives need to be clearer and more immediate.
For further information, contact the Institute of Advanced Motorists at IAM
House, 359 Chiswick High Road, London W4 4HS (tel: 081-994 4403), or the

When Associated British Foods announces its interim results on Monday, they
are expected to show a small advance from Pounds 161m to about Pounds 167m,
before exceptional items. Investors will be looking for some indications on
plans for ABF's Pounds 500m cash pile, and clarification on the disposal
rumours surrounding Bakers Oven. Friday's agricultural feeds acquisition may
have been taken as a sign that the company plans to be more active on the
acquisition front. Meanwhile, the grocery and bread businesses are not
expected to show any great improvements. Farnell Electronics, the electronic
components group which paid Dollars 69.8m to acquire Multicomponents from
ITT in October, reports results for the year to January 31 on Monday. They
will be the first finals since Howard Poulson took over as chief executive
and pre-tax profits of between Pounds 47m and Pounds 48.5m are expected, up
from Pounds 41.6m the previous year when the figure was boosted by a Pounds
6.36m exceptional profit.
Tarmac, the UK's biggest construction and building materials group, reports
its results for 1993 on Tuesday with the markets expecting underlying
trading profits of between Pounds 50m to Pounds 53m, against about Pounds
21m the previous year. As with most construction companies to report
recently, FRS 3 provisions complicate the numbers. After goodwill
write-backs on disposals, the group is expected to report pre-tax losses of
Pounds 40m-Pounds 45m, compared with 1992's record losses of Pounds 350.3m.
When Sears, the UK's largest multiple speciality retailer, reports its
annual results on Tuesday, pre-tax profits are expected to have risen to
about Pounds 127m, up from last time's Pounds 83.5m which was struck after
net exceptional costs of Pounds 16.9m. The rise will be even more dramatic
on an FRS 3 basis, under which the group made pre-tax losses last time of
Pounds 47.8m after exceptional charges of Pounds 106.8m.
First-quarter figures on Thursday from ICI, a pure chemicals company since
the demerger from Zeneca last summer, will reflect both the company's
cost-cutting efforts and the health of the European bulk chemicals market.
Underlying trading is still tough in European chemicals with manufacturers
struggling to push through price increases.
But this will be more than made up for by the cost-cutting and the disposal
of the loss-making fibres operation in return for DuPont's acrylics
business. As a result, pre-tax profits of the chemicals businesses should
rise from last year's Pounds 63m to approaching Pounds 100m.

FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions

Domestic and General is involved mainly in the insurance of domestic
appliances. The group has been a strong performer relative to the market
over the last year.
In March, it announced interim results which reflected the steady increase
in the amount of business written. The size of the sale by three directors
is accounted-for partly by the high share price - around 1915p. But each
director retains a fair amount of stock.
Takare, the company that provides care for the elderly, appeared on this
list not long ago following a purchase of 83,000 shares by the chairman. But
the most recent transaction was undertaken following some difference of
opinion in the boardroom. Deverok Pritchard sold more than 12.4m at around
249p, and his job was changed from managing director to a non-executive
position. But he retains a stake in the company.
PizzaExpress's recent performance has been steady, and the sales recorded
earlier this month at 132p were near the most recent trading high.
The chairman, Peter Boizot, has sold 2m, which accounted for 3.7 per cent of
the company. This leaves him with more than 5.7m and he has undertaken not
to sell any more shares for at least another year.

When Keller Group mentions grouting, it has nothing to do with bathroom
tiles. The company is in the specialised business of ground engineering  -
preparing sites for construction. Its kind of grouting involves solidifying
soil by injecting cement or chemicals, using drills and high-pressure liquid
jets, and projects outside the UK account for more than 80 per cent of
sales.
This high-technology group is being floated with a market valuation of
Pounds 72.8m. A placing and intermediaries offer will raise Pounds 15.3m, to
repay borrowings and fund further overseas expansion.
Keller will become one of the first companies to use the foreign income
dividend scheme, introduced to help companies with a structural surplus
advance corporation tax problem. Under the scheme, companies can opt to pay
a dividend out of foreign income which they must remit to the UK, so in
effect avoiding paying advance corporation tax on the dividend.
A former offshoot of GKN, Keller was bought by its management for Pounds 26m
three years ago. Despite recession, Keller has increased operating profits
steadily to Pounds 6.3m on sales of Pounds 148m. It has benefited from the
German building boom, which accounted for 43 per cent of last year's sales.
The issue has been underwritten by Kleinwort Benson Securities, sponsors and
brokers to the issue. Applications for the intermediaries offer close on
Wednesday, and dealings are expected to start on May 5. Given the group's
large overseas exposure, Kleinwort could not price Keller's shares in line
with the UK construction sector, where ratings assume a great deal of
recovery. Instead, they are being offered on a prospective multiple of 13
times earnings, a discount to the market. The issue should attract solid
support.

FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: C&amp;G bid causes anguish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The C&amp;G takeover bid brought cries of anguish from my family, writes private
investor Kevin Goldstein-Jackson. Between us, we have cash in eight
different building societies - but not the C&amp;G.
To me, its branch offices always appeared much shabbier than many of its
rivals, there were queues at its counters and it did not have any cash
dispensers. Although this kept its operating costs comparatively low, I
thought it might damage the society's longer-term future. Any bidder would
have to spend a small fortune on customer services; thus, bid terms would be
modest. How wrong I was]
For more than five years, I have been looking out for societies which might
either be taken over or decide to shed their mutual status and gain a stock
market quotation, like Abbey National.
My sole success has been the 1990 merger of the Portman with the Regency &amp;
West of England society. My wife and I did get a 4 per cent bonus on our
investments, but this was limited to Pounds 100 an account. Hopefully, the
Lloyds bid for C&amp;G will attract bidders for other societies.
Our accounts with Portman, Chelsea, and Alliance &amp; Leicester are being
retained with that in mind. And we will keep deposits with the Halifax,
Woolwich and National &amp; Provincial in case they become involved in bid
activity or eventually seek a market flotation.
I am considering opening an account with Bristol &amp; West, too. In September
1993, it announced the abrupt departure of its chief executive, Tony
FitzSimons. But the chairman, Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, said the society
was 'looking for the possibility of mergers.'

FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Which is next?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those who missed out on C&amp;G want to know which society will be the next to
reward customers, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu.
In the case of Lloyds' bid for C&amp;G, the society has been operating from a
position of strength - hence its ability to negotiate more generous terms
for its members. Investors are, therefore, more likely to get a bigger
windfall by being with a stronger society than a weaker one. But there are a
far greater number of smaller societies, which increases the possibility of
their being taken over.
'There's no real telling which society might be next - it's a complete
lottery,' said Robert Villiers, building societies analyst at UBS.
Of the top 10 societies, the largest are Halifax, Woolwich and Nationwide.
These are probably too big to be taken over, Villiers feels, but they might
decide to become a bank and give investors free shares.
Of the others, Villiers says: 'Alliance &amp; Leicester, the Leeds and Bradford
&amp; Bingley have come out of the recession well enough to be takeover
targets.'
Perhaps the most plausible bid targets are the second-tier societies such as
Northern Rock, Birmingham Midshires and Portman, But a word of caution:
there is a potential catch in the C&amp;G deal, which is why it is going to
court next month with the Building Societies Association.
At issue are two questions: whether a 'third party' (in this case, Lloyds)
can make payments to a society's members, and whether the cash be
distributed to anyone who has not been an investing member of the society
for at least two years.

FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: 10 per cent bonus missed by C&amp;G
savers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bethan Hutton writes: C&amp;G savers whose money was part of the huge outflow
from building societies last month - to pre-pay fuel bills, or invest in
Peps or Pensioners Guaranteed Income Bonds - may now be kicking themselves
as they will miss the 10 per cent bonus on the amount withdrawn. If they
closed their accounts, they will lose another Pounds 500. But the situation
is unclear.
The bonuses will not be paid for more than a year, and they may be taxable
for some people. Depending on the precise circumstances, in many cases
pre-paying fuel bills will still have been more cost-effective. The
long-term tax benefits of Peps are difficult to quantify, but could outweigh
the lost bonus in the long run. Sadly, investors in PGIBs have certainly
come off badly.

Examining the implications of Lloyds' Pounds 1.8bn bid for the C&amp;G building
society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investing in a building society these days is rather like a lottery. But, in
the case of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, all 1.4m customers and staff are
winners from this week's proposed takeover by Lloyds bank, with the Pounds
1.8bn offer to be split among them.
If the takeover succeeds, it will be the first time a bank has taken over a
society. It is more usual for one of the weaker societies to be taken over
by another - a process known, politely, as a 'merger.' Only one society,
Abbey National, has turned itself into a bank and only one society, Alliance
&amp; Leicester, has acquired a bank - Girobank.
After the initial spoils are divided, the benefits should be more
competitive mortgage, and higher deposit, rates. C&amp;G will retain its name
and its own board but will shed its mutual status to become a public limited
company (plc).
The idea is that C&amp;G will continue to market its own property loans as well
as designing mortgages for Lloyds to sell in its own name. C&amp;G will continue
to tell customers seeking financial advice to see an independent adviser; it
will not be authorised to recommend Lloyds' products. In any case, Lloyds is
tied to its own life company, Black Horse, and customers seeking a mortgage
at the bank's branches will be recommended Black Horse products.
C&amp;G says there are no plans at present to introduce cash or credit cards.
On what does the
deal depend?
Since C&amp;G is owned by its members, they will have to decide whether to
accept although the unprecedently generous financial sweeteners will provide
a large incentive to agree. The vote is scheduled for this autumn; if
passed, the takeover is expected to be completed next May. But there are
also regulatory hurdles. C&amp;G and the Building Societies Commission - the
statutory regulator - are going to the High Court to see if the terms of the
takeover accord with the 1986 Building Societies Act.
Who benefits?
Sometimes, sweeteners are confined only to members of a society, but this is
not the case here - although voting members of the society stand to gain
more than others. Some members are not voting members.
Who is a member? Anyone with a mortgage or one of the society's share
accounts: Cheltenham Gold, London Share, Instant 7 and Tessa (tax-exempt
special savings account, whether maxi or flexi). Children, and those with
less than Pounds 100 in their account, are members but do not have voting
rights.
Who is a voting member? Voting investors must have been a member on December
31 1993, have at least Pounds 100 in a share account 56 days before voting
day, and have a share account on voting day. Voting borrowers must have had
a mortgage (of at least Pounds 100) on December 31 1994 and still have a
mortgage on voting day.
What about the rest? Some 60,000 savers are not members. They hold the
London Deposit, standard deposit or charity accounts.
Benefits to savers
The voting members, including trustees, will receive Pounds 500 each on
condition they were members at December 31 1993. In addition, they will
receive about 10 per cent of the balance in each of their investment and
personal deposit accounts, to a maximum of Pounds 10,000 for each.
All savers (whether members or not) are entitled to the 10 per cent payout
as long as they had the account at March 31 1994. The payment is conditional
on savers holding their accounts with the society until completion day. The
10 per cent will be calculated on the lower balance at March 31 1994, or on
the completion date.
The maximum investors can receive, therefore, is 10 per cent of their
balances on the earlier date - but they must make sure a similar amount is
in the account on completion day, too.
C&amp;G says the average balance of a voting investor at the end of last year
was Pounds 12,000, which will mean an average payment of Pounds 1,700
(including the Pounds 500). Non-member savers had a higher average balance
of Pounds 25,000 and would, therefore, receive Pounds 2,500.
Children qualify for the 10 per cent payout but not the Pounds 500, since
they are not voting members.
Benefits to borrowers
Those who have a mortgage will receive Pounds 500 for each mortgaged
property they own as long as they still hold them on completion day. This is
in addition to any amounts owing to them as an investor. Anyone with a
mortgage from one of the societies taken over by C&amp;G benefits, too.
Creditors
Holders of permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) on or before March 31
1994 are entitled to Pounds 500 (if they are a voting member) as well as 10
per cent of their holding to the Pounds 10,000 maximum. Issues are in Pounds
50,000 batches, which means anyone holding Pibs would receive a minimum of
Pounds 5,500. The price of C&amp;G Pibs has gone up, mainly because the stock
now has the backing of Lloyds. Investors in Exeter Balanced, a unit trust
investing in Pibs which has a Pounds 300,000 holding in C&amp;G Pibs, will find
that the Pounds 10,500 will be added to the fund and divided between all
unit-holders.
How will the money be
paid and is it taxable?
Savers will receive both the Pounds 500 and the 10 per cent credited to
their accounts. Where this cannot be done (for example, in the case of a
Tessa), a cheque will be sent.
Borrowers with up-to-date mortgage accounts will receive a cheque for Pounds
500 made out to those named on the account. Those in arrears will have the
Pounds 500 credited to their account.
C&amp;G expects payments to be made in the 1995/96 tax year and that the money
will be subject to capital gains (but not income) tax. This is good news for
the many savers who do not use up their annual Pounds 5,800 CGT allowance;
they will get the bonus tax-free.
When will the benefits be paid?
Customers will have to wait until the takeover is finalised before they get
the benefits.
What happens if an account-holder dies?
If a mortgage holder dies, his estate will continue to be entitled to Pounds
500 provided the account remained open on completion day. The estates of
savers who die (but still have accounts open on completion day) will receive
the 10 per cent. But estates of voting members who die before completion

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
It was Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester which made merger history in 1989 when it
took over Guardian, the then 19th largest society. For the first time,
members of a smaller society absorbed by a larger one were given cash
compensation. The bonus was good too - 5 per cent of savers' balances.
Until then, building society mergers had not involved compensation for
members of the smaller society, even though they are the leg al owners
of its reserves - the profits accumulated over the years. Abbey
National's issue of 100 free shares, worth 130p each, to members at its
flotation in July 1989 seemed to have been the catalyst for change.

FT  23 APR 94 / Markets: Simple advice that made Buffett rich - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This evening many of America's most serious investors will be watching a
baseball game in Omaha, Nebraska. Throwing the first pitch will be America's
second richest man, Warren Buffett, who has made Pounds 5.5bn by inspired
but prudent investment. The baseball game is the prelude to the annual
general meeting on Monday of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, the company Buffett
runs with his partner, Charlie Munger.
Over the last 29 years, Berkshire's asset value has risen at an average
annual rate of 23.3 per cent compound. Less successful investors scour the
chairman's annual statement for hints from the master.
Buffett is routinely scathing about ''institutional investors' - one of
those self-contradictions called an oxymoron, comparable to 'lady
mudwrestler''. His own strategy is to search for good businesses which he
can understand, run by honest and competent people, offering outstanding
long-term value and available at a very attractive price. Having tracked
down these rarities, he holds on to them for a very long time.
This year the first butt of his annual sermon is 'standard diversification
dogma' - the conventional wisdom that all investment portfolios should
contain a wide spread of different shares. He goes on to query the
usefulness of constructing portfolios using 'beta' analysis - measuring
their investment risk by the relative volatility of the individual shares or
of the whole portfolio.
Buffett does not attempt to defeat the academic theorists on their own
abstruse grounds. He uses two complementary commonsense arguments. First,
his own strategy breaks all the beta-theorists rules, but he regards himself
as a prudent investor - so maybe there is some fundamental flaw in
beta-based theory. Secondly, beta-theory produces some absurd consequences -
so maybe the theory is bunk.
His own portfolio consists of a few lumpy holdings - risky according to the
academics. But 'portfolio concentration may well decrease risk if it raises,
as it should, both the intensity with which an investor thinks about a
business and the comfort-level he must feel with its economic
characteristics before buying into it.'
He suggests that investors should stick to his knitting: limit the number of
decisions he needs to make and concentrate on getting those right: 'By
confining himself to a relatively few, easy-to-understand cases, a
reasonably intelligent, informed and diligent person can judge investment
risks with a useful degree of accuracy.
'If you are able to understand business economics and to find five to 10
sensibly-priced companies that possess important long-term competitive
advantages, conventional diversification makes no sense for you . . . In the
words of the prophet Mae West: 'Too much of a good thing can be wonderful.''
And what if you do not understand business economics but want a long-term
stake in industry? Buffett has a superficially surprising suggestion:
regular investment in an index tracking fund. The tracker gives you the
conventional wide spread, but ensures that you do not seriously undershoot
the market. A regular investment scheme, which buys more shares when the
market is low than when it is high, helps you beat the market. 'When 'dumb'
money acknowledges its limitations, it ceases to be dumb.'
                             *      *      *
Next week 3i, Britain's largest venture capital group, takes its first step
towards a stockmarket launch in late June. With shareholders' funds of
around Pounds 1.6bn, it is a plausible candidate for the FT-SE 100 share
index, and will be a giant among investment trusts. On Tuesday, nearly 100
private client stockbrokers are due at the seminar where 3i peddles its
charms.
Not that there should be much trouble whipping up interest. The group is
owned by the major banks and only a third of the equity is likely to be
sold. Professional investors will be keen buyers. The boring reason for
their enthusiasm is their desire for an appropriate 'weighting' in any FTSE
company. The interesting one is that 3i provides a unique opportunity to
invest in small growing companies, without any of the normal technical
problems. And the small company sector should benefit disproportionately
from Britain's economic recovery.
How would 3i shape up to Buffett criteria? 3i is far more diversified -
3,500 different investments - than Buffett's own portfolio. But it operates
in the part of the economy that is, almost by definition, growing over the
long term. And 3i's unusual willingness to give the companies in which it
invests the chance to grow without imposing a penal timetable keeps new
customers knocking at its door. Buffett would surely approve of its
commanding position in its own market, and of its stress on good management.
To claim that all its hundreds of employees are Buffett clones would be
stretching your credulity. But both at 3i and in Omaha, Nebraska, the
emphasis is on thinking like a businessman - not like an institutional
investor or a lady mudwrestler.
                             *      *      *
Record-breaking unit trust sales of over Pounds 1bn in March provide a
classic case of greed (for Pep tax breaks) overcoming fear of sliding share
prices.

FT  23 APR 94 / Markets: The great share-price mystery - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One sometimes feels a certain sympathy with the elderly and bewildered
Mirror Group Newspapers shareholder who at Thursday's annual meeting asked
why it was that sometimes the share price went up and at other times it went
down.
The same question can be applied to the whole stockmarket. The past week has
demonstrated the old paradox that 'good' economic news can be 'bad' stock
market news.
A string of statistics indicated that the economic recovery is
strengthening. This has been taken to mean that inflation will surge again,
the run of interest rate cuts is over and base rates will have to be up to
choke off price increases. Thus, economic recovery is 'bad' news for share
prices.
But that ignores other figures which tended to show that inflation is not
getting out of hand. Monday's producer prices numbers, which showed input
prices still falling and output prices rising at their slowest rate since
September 1992, added to the previous Friday's low inflation number, suggest
that the threat of a resurgence of inflation is not a serious one.
Even so, on Monday the Footsie fell 30.1 points, as US interest rates rose
by a quarter of a percentage point. But London has perhaps been unduly
influenced by Wall Street. The US authorities have to cope with rather more
growth than the UK, with US industrial production up at an annual rate of
7.7 per cent in the first quarter.
After another 10.2 point fall on the Footsie on Tuesday, the market fell
sharply on Wednesday with the index dropping 29.7 points. That followed the
release of average earnings figures showing a 3 1/2 per cent rise over the
year to February, a number which is a little worrying.
But there may be some truth in the official explanation that larger annual
bonuses increased earnings and the figure should not be extrapola-ted.
Another concern was the equally 'bad' news that 30,300 unemployed people
found a job in March, cutting the percentage of the workforce unemployed to
the lowest level since June 1992. By that logic, the stock market should be
thrilled by the 1,000 job losses announced this week at London International
Group, the 800 at Texas Instruments and the 450 at Babcock International.
Yet more 'bad' news came in the shape of retail sales figures for March, on
Thursday, which were 3.8 per cent up year-on-year compared to expectations
of a 2.7 per cent rise.
Although the revival in consumer spending has been a mainstay of the
economic recovery, the assumption was that this month's tax rises would have
already dampened spending in shops, which in turn would encourage an
interest rate cut.
While some stores shares managed to rise on the news, and Austin Reed which
announced an excellent profit increase on the same day jumped 22 1/2 p to
199 1/2 p, the retail sales figure was taken to mean that interest rates
would go no lower for some time yet.
After losing exactly 70 points over the first three days of the week, to go
just below the 3100 level, the market managed to turn in a 35.4 point bounce
over the last two.
It was a dose of old-fashioned bid fever that inspired the reversal.
On Thursday Lloyds Bank launched a Pounds 1.8bn agreed cash bid for
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, a deal regarded as so good for
Lloyds that its shares rose 9 per cent on the day, which alone accounted for
more than Thursday's 2.9 point rise in the Footsie.
Friday morning witnessed Inchcape's recommended Pounds 176m cash offer for
Hogg Group, the insurance broker. With the influence of a firmer Wall Street
close on Thursday night as well, the Footsie closed the week with a day's
rise of 32.5 points, leaving it a net 34.6 points lower.
With yet more bids rumoured - especially one for Lasmo, the oil group, which
has a market value approaching Pounds 1.5bn - it might be argued that
corporate investors are focusing on the value available from buying
companies at the beginning of a recovery rather than whether interest rates
will be cut by a quarter point.
Perhaps financial investors should follow their lead. Or as Andrew Bell,
economist at BZW puts it: 'The bears ought to be dipping their paws in the
honey rather than swatting at bees'.
Having said that, though, corporate news over the week has been somewhat
gloomy. Both Babcock and LIG announced the need for chunks of investors'
money if they are to restructure themselves.
Both sets of shareholders may get a sense of having seen all this before.
Babcock, the engineering contractor, has been through all sorts of turmoil
since being taken over by FKI in the late 1980s and demerged again. LIG's
recent history seems to have been nothing but rationalisation costs and a
rights issue in 1991.
While both groups' problems have been well known for a while, the
announcements this week - a Pounds 79m, four-for-seven rights issue, losses
and job cuts at Babcock and a restructuring charge at LIG likely almost to
eliminate Pounds 120m of net assets requiring a substantial equity injection
 -show that even economic recovery is not sufficient to rescue some parts of
industry.
Lloyds Bank's move makes up for all that. The creation of the fourth largest
mortgage lender in the UK should enliven the mortgage market.
And Lloyds may have shown investors a new way of making money. The Pounds
500 minimum payment to more than 1m C &amp; G voting members might spawn a new
investment game. Pick a few building societies likely to be taken over, open
an account with each, and wait for the money to roll in.
It would, at least, be simpler than trying to understand why share prices
sometimes go up and other times go down.

FT  23 APR 94 / Markets: Fed casts a dark shadow over sunny profits - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first quarter reporting season is in full swing, and judging by the
results released so far, US corporate earnings continued to improve during
the first three months of this year.
Yet, the stock market, which should be delighted by the steady growth in
profitability, is anything but: in several notable cases (Motorola,
Chrysler, Caterpillar), an impressive first quarter earnings report has
prompted heavy selling of shares. The indifferent reaction of investors to
good results lately has not been confined to a few big name stocks. Company
earnings were mostly strong this week, yet over the first four trading days
the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost a net 9 points.
It seems that these days, there is no pleasing anyone on Wall Street.
There is some logic behind the market's capricious behaviour, however. The
stock market is always going to struggle to make headway in a week that
opens with an interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve - especially
if the timing of the rate increase (which lifted the Fed funds rate, the
rate at which banks borrow from each other, from 3.5 per cent to 3.75 per
cent) catches investors by surprise. It was the second monetary policy
tightening within a month, and the third such move since early February.
Apart from the fact that higher interest rates tend to make equities look
less attractive compared to fixed-income investments, investors' main worry
about higher interest rates is that, after a time-lag, the higher cost of
borrowing will start to slow the pace of economic and corporate earnings
growth, probably by the third or fourth quarter of this year. So, while the
current earnings picture may be bright, investors feel that the outlook for
earnings is darkening almost daily. As is always the case with stock market
investing, the future is more important than the present.
Thus, Chrysler reported record first quarter profits on Tuesday that
exceeded analysts' expectations, but the car maker's share price dropped
Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 48 1/2 in heavy trading. It also explains why
shares in Caterpillar fell Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 103 1/2 on Wednesday
after the agricultural equipment manufacturer posted equally impressive
quarterly earnings.
Investors also fear that the Fed is not yet done tightening its monetary
screws. The central bank appears determined to prevent the expanding economy
from sparking a resurgence in inflation, and three rate increases of a
quarter-point each are unlikely to be enough to satisfy the Fed's
anti-inflationary desires. If the Fed does move again soon, analysts expect
it will be before the next meeting of its policy-making Open Market
Committee, which is scheduled for May 17.
Moreover, some market watchers are warning that the next time it raises
rates, the Fed might not be satisfied with just putting up the fed funds
rate again. The more important discount rate (the rate at which banks borrow
money from the Fed), which has not moved since July 1992, could go up from 3
per cent to 3.5 per cent. That would certainly hammer home the message that
the Fed is vigilant against inflation, but it might also inflict a
hammer-blow to the stock market's already fragile confidence.
Against this background, many analysts on Wall Street are now saying that
the current stock market 'correction' has further to go. The Dow has already
fallen 8 per cent from its January 31 high of 3,978.36, and the average
forecast for the size of the correction has been around 10 per cent, which
would ultimately take the Dow down to around 3,580.
Yet, with more rate increases expected around the corner and concern about
future earnings deepening, those forecasts are being revised, and the
majority of analysts are now predicting that the Dow will drop to between
3,400 and 3,200 before the final stage of the correction is completed.
That the Dow is not already careering toward those lows has something to do
IBM, which this week managed to buck the prevailing trend and release a set
of quarterly results that was received rapturously by the stock market.
IBM shares, which have languished for so long as investors waited for 'Big
Blue' to shake off its blues, jumped Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 58 3/8 after
the company reported a profit of Dollars 392m for the first three months of
the year. Although comparisons with the same quarter's earnings a year ago
were complicated by various special items, the market was clearly delighted
with the figures. The sharp rise in IBM shares helped power a 54-point rally
by the Dow, and ended a string of four consecutive losing days for the
market.

FT  23 APR 94 / Markets: Crucible caught in debt vice - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Crucible has had a ticklish problem over the past couple of years.
The City has been uncomfortable with the level of its borrowings, which are
equal to two-thirds of its net assets, but investors have been reluctant to
support the obvious solution - a rights issue.
During the 1980s, Morgan Crucible served up dollops of new shares to fund
acquisitions and, after rights issues in 1990 and 1991, institutions felt
they had had enough.
For some time Morgan Crucible has been suggesting another solution - the
sale of its Holt Lloyd car care subsidiary - and last week it hinted that a
deal was close. The delay in consummating a deal has proved rather fortunate
since Holt Lloyd has staged a very strong recovery pushing up its potential
price. Last year its profits jumped from Pounds 4.1m to a new peak of Pounds
7.7m on sales of Pounds 99m, prompting some analysts to predict a sale price
of around Pounds 80m.
That would cut gearing to about 30 per cent and finally dispel the rights
issue cloud hanging over the shares.
Beneath the cloud the picture is of a company which has come through the
recession pretty well and, thanks to the acquisitions of the last few years,
is well-placed to prosper in the 1990s.
The rights issues of 1990 and 1991 provided the funds to buy market share in
its core businesses and have left Morgan Crucible the world leader in carbon
brushes - used in electric motors - ceramic fibre and the eponymous
crucibles, and a number of technical ceramic products. Indeed it is now so
dominant in many of its markets in the US and Europe that it would be
precluded from making further acquisitions by anti-trust regulations.
Instead it is concentrating on rationalising the dozens of plants it
inherited, which are scattered around the world. In carbon it is cutting
back the number of plants in the US, and in Europe concentrating production
on the two countries where its costs are lowest - the UK and Hungary.
Bruce Farmer, chief executive, believes such restructuring and improvements
in its manufacturing processes could increased margins from just over 10 per
cent to 14 per cent within two to three years.
At the same time, after several years of weak product prices, some increases
are starting to stick, much to the relief of those smaller rivals which have
survived the recession. As a result, some analysts are predicting that group
profits will rise by almost a third over the next two years helped by a
strong economic background in the Americas and east Asia which provide half
its sales.
But what of the longer term prospects? Some of the group's products, notably
carbon brushes and crucibles, are in distinctly mature markets, at least in
the developed world. But it has good exposure to less advanced economies in
South America, the former eastern bloc and China where demand for its most
basic products is likely to grow strongly over the next few years. Having
set up a greenfield thermal ceramics plant in China six years ago and bought
a stake in one of its largest carbon brush factories, the group is about to
take a controlling interest in a speciality chemicals business. In Russia,
it is still negotiating for the return of its St Petersburg plant which it
abandoned in 1923.
Morgan Crucible has also proved adept at developing new uses for ceramics -
for example in artificial hip joints and safety air bags in cars - and
calculates that 18 per cent of 1993 profits came from products it did not
have three years ago.
Two years of cash outflow were also reversed in 1993, thanks partly to
tighter control of working capital, with a strong inflow recorded in the
first half. That in itself helped to revitalise the share price which has
outperformed the market by almost 20 per cent over the past six months.
After rising 8 per cent to Pounds 66m last year analysts' conservative
profit forecasts range up to around Pounds 73m for 1994. That puts the
shares on around 17 times prospective earnings - a healthy premium to the
market as a whole - and at this level new buyers would have to treat them as
a long-term investment.

Finance - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse in interest rates has created a Catch 22 situation for
pensioners: few who need to rely on investment income can afford to adopt
the most sensible long-term strategy. Over the long term, equities have held
up well against inflation, but many investors need a high income at once.
The spring issue of the FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance, to be
published with next Friday's paper and repeated with Saturday's, considers
some sources of immediate income. The survey section of the Review focuses
on high street investment.

The Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index (capital gains version) was
virtually unchanged over the week to Thursday April 21. Over the same period
the FT-A-All Share index fell by 1 per cent. So far this year smaller

FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Pensioners may escape tax - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pensioners who face an unexpected tax demand because the Inland Revenue has
only recently found out about their state pension, may soon be able to get
out of paying some or all of the tax.
Sir Anthony Battishill, chairman of the board of Inland Revenue, told MPs on
Wednesday that the extra-statutory concession allowing tax to be waived in
cases of official error is to be extended to such cases.
Under the concession, tax can be wholly or partly waived where the Revenue
has failed to make timely use of information supplied by the taxpayer or the
taxpayer's employer.
All the tax can be waived for taxpayers with a gross income of Pounds 15,500
or less. Above this limit, a proportion of the tax is waived on a sliding
scale according to income. With gross income of more than Pounds 40,000,
none of the tax is waived.

London International Group, the Durex condoms and Marigold gloves company,
announced plans to restructure and refinance. The shares fell further this
week when it revealed that its net assets would be virtually eliminated by
'very substantial' restructuring charges. The sale of its ColourCare

Emerging stockmarkets had a rough first quarter, with an aggregate fall of
nearly 15 per cent, according to the IFC index. The biggest falls have
generally been in Asia, notably Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. But
the pattern is patchy: in Europe, for example, Turkey has plunged 55 per
cent, while Hungary is 28 per cent higher. Most of the larger markets have
been hit by the global interest rates worries. It is the more obscure
markets, such as Columbia, that have starred.

FT  23 APR 94 / Long View: Fighting for dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News again. Paddy Linaker, managing director of the M &amp; G unit trust group,
has sprung to their defence, alarmed at suggestions that the Treasury might
be considering anti-dividend measures as a result of its review of
government policies on savings and investment flows. The City must stand up
and fight for high payouts, said Linaker this week.
Political worries apart, he ought to be quite pleased at how the dividend
flows are improving. Payouts by UK listed companies stood still for three
years up to 1993, with a final blow (for pension funds, charities and
holders of personal equity plans, at least) from the reduction in
reclaimable dividend tax imposed in the March 1993 Budget. But over the past
year dividends have risen by 6 per cent, by 2 1/2 per cent in the first
quarter of 1994 alone, and hopes in the City extend as far as annual growth
of 10 per cent in the next year or two.
Dividends are important to financial institutions in the UK. Pension funds
were badly affected by last year's tax problem, because actuaries normally
value them on the basis of their current income and its expected growth. So
although the market value of pension funds rose by an average 29 per cent
the actuarial values may not have improved at all. As for unit trusts,
groups such as Linaker's rely heavily on selling funds that offer healthily
growing income. But the dividend of the average UK equity income unit trust
dropped by more than 10 per cent last year.
This week's rise in gilt-edged yields to 8 per cent provides a further
reminder of the challenge to equity income funds. In a low inflation
environment fixed interest investments will become more attractive.
Certainly, there needs to be a prospect of strong dividend growth to justify
the current ratio of nearly 2.2 between long-term gilt yields and the
average income from equities.
Inflation down to about 2.5 per cent certainly provides no excuse for big
dividend rises. Profits are strongly up, but it had been expected that
finance directors might be keen to rebuild their companies' dividend cover
before embarking on large increases: cover was about 2.5 times on average in
the mid-1980s when payouts were surging, but is now about 1.6 times.
Moreover, companies no longer suffer from the takeover fears that motivated
much of the generosity to shareholders at the end of the 1980s when annual
dividend growth reached 15-20 per cent. So why are the corporate purse
strings being loosened? Is it because executive directors are so loaded up
these days with stock options?
Maybe, but it is also apparent that British companies are feeling well off,
having moved back into financial surplus and refinanced their excessive debt
burden. In fact, argues an interesting research study from Barclays de Zoete
Wedd, low inflation has raised the quality of company earnings; there is no
longer a big gap between historical cost and profits. So companies can
reduce their payout ratios without fear of overdistribution - that is, of
the erosion of the real capital base of the company.
However, high dividends do not always please. Look at the case of Glaxo,
which has increased its payout by 57 per cent over the past two years but
which has suffered a share price drop of 44 per cent relative to the
All-Share Index over that period. If higher current dividends reflect
deteriorating future growth prospects, as they do at Glaxo, which cannot see
a way of investing its enormous cash flow profitably, a derating will take
place.
Growth, dividends and share prices are therefore linked in a complex way. If
more dividends now mean less in the future, the stock market is not going to
be pleased. The political debate, meanwhile, is focused on the relatively
low level of capital investment in the UK.
At one level the politicians want to see more investment because this will
raise output and create jobs. But the government has another agenda: pressed
for revenue, it will be tempted to increase the taxes on the corporate
sector over the next few years. This is partly because corporate incomes
have been rising at 15 per cent year-on-year against 4 per cent for personal
incomes. It is also because, in the context of a general election due in
1996 or 1997, companies do not have votes.
The change to dividend tax has already raised money, but rather
thoughtlessly, because it has undermined the Conservative philosophy of the
1980s that tax should have a neutral impact on whether profits are retained
or distributed. In fact, for dividends paid after April 5 this year and
received by a 40 per cent taxpayer, the total tax paid on the underlying
company profits will be 66 1/2 per cent against 33 per cent if the profits
were retained.
A justification for high payouts can be that they facilitate the recycling
of resources from wealthy, established companies with surplus revenues, such
as Glaxo, to rapidly expanding industries where investment needs are high.
Plainly, tax interferes with this process of redistribution via
shareholders.
The dividend tax change will be worth Pounds 1bn a year, so institutional
investors are worried that the Treasury might use its savings review as a
smokescreen to justify further moves in the same direction, with the tax
credit falling to 15 or even 10 per cent. The motive would be to raise
revenue, but the excuse would be that excessive distributions should be
discouraged.
The circuitous excuse given by Norman Lamont last time was that companies
would be helped by the change because their cash flow would benefit through
the partial switch from advance corporation tax (paid early with the
dividends) to mainstream tax (paid later). As it happens, companies are no
longer short of cash.
Linaker may see it differently, but companies just might find it politically
prudent to keep their dividend rises modest this year.

FT  23 APR 94 / A family blown by the winds of change: Lucia van der Post
expected a jolly party when her large South African family called for a
reunion. But the country's imminent elections infiltrated every conversation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dear relations,' said the letter early last year, 'we come from a large,
old-established South African family with a rich history yet many of us do
not know each other. Let us have a reunion.'
That was how it began. We, (husband, two children, one girlfriend and I) did
not hesitate - we knew we had to go. What we did not know then, as we
planned what we imagined would be a jolly family outing, was what
extraordinary times we would witness.
South Africa is in all our bones, in our hearts and in our minds, even
though England is now our home. I come from an old Afrikaner family - my
grandmother's family was there almost from the beginning, her mother was one
of only two survivors of a massacre of the Liebenberg Trek.
A great-grandfather fought at the battle of Boomplatz in 1848, two of my
father's uncles were killed at Jagersfontein, my grandfather wrote two of
the first novels that ever appeared in Afrikaans, had a law practice that
spanned from the Orange River to the Limpopo, was the last chairman of the
executive of the last parliament of the old Orange Free State and had 15
children. The chance to explore our history and renew these links was
irresistible.
Our first stop is Johannesburg and a weekend with a cousin. A distinguished
lawyer, he gave three years of his junior barrister's life to defending
Nelson Mandela, Braam Fischer and others in the Rivonia treason trials.
He has had, on the day we arrive, to evict some squatters who are illegally
occupying other people's property. They refuse to be tried by him because he
is 'white' and sit sulking in their cells. 'Justice,' he retorts, 'doesn't
have a colour. It has a quality.' But still they will not come.
He lives, like most of white Johannesburg, behind electronic gates with
surveillance lights and security alarms. We escape with some of his friends
and children to his farm in the high veldt where we sit, like the old
Afrikaners we are, chatting round the fire long into the night.
The election, of course, is never out of anybody's mind. 'Listen,' says one
of the cousins. 'What most of this country doesn't seem to realise is that
we are going into this election without a proper constitution. Most of the
whites are so relieved to have the moral burden of apartheid lifted that
they can't see beyond election day.
'Everybody thinks Chief Buthelezi is an obstinate old fellow but we may all
end up being grateful to him - he at least is holding out for a more federal
constitution.'
I am interested in how they will vote and most, it seems, will vote DP
(Democratic Party). 'They are wimps,' says one of the younger members of the
group, 'but at least their heart is in the right place.'
Another is adamant that in spite of it being the best tactical way to vote
(it being most likely to offer anything like a decent opposition to the ANC)
he could never vote National Party. 'For 30 years they have been playing a
devious game,' he tells me.
'They always had an end-game in mind. They knew this day would come and they
plotted and planned so that they and the ANC could stitch up the future of
the country between them. They have shopped the legitimate interests of all
the other groups for the sake of their own relationship with the ANC.'
One of the young cousins' wives, who works with a group dedicated to
restoring land removed from tribes when the homelands were established,
tells me quietly that she is going to vote ANC. 'For me,' she says, 'it is
an emotional thing. All through my youth they were banned and now that at
last they have a legal voice I must support them.'
It isn't long before we all begin to feel a sense of heightened awareness,
of what it is like to live life on the edge. This is far from depressing. At
the dinner tables and round the braaivleis, round lawns and on the beach,
the chat is endless, the debate furious, the anecdotes rich. Every day
happenings big and small reveal the complexity of the issues being thrashed
out.
When we reach the Drakensberg mountain resort, where 140 or so members of
the van der Post kith and kin are to gather, we can hardly wait to hear the
individual stories, to find out how they all really feel.
We are all saddened that my father, Sir Laurens van der Post, the elder of
the tribe, is prevented from coming but Ella, his only surviving sibling, a
younger sister, now 86, is to be family story-teller-in-chief.
On the first evening as I join the gathering I hear a relation (one of the
many surgeons in the group) say: 'Listen, six months ago I was very liberal.
Now I'm a fascist.' I hold my breath. In the event all goes well. There
turns out to be a remarkable consensus among the group.
'Since the minute we first set foot in Africa,' says a professor of music,
'this day was waiting for us. It had to come. We all know that and most of
us welcome it. But we feel it is being rushed through, that it is such a
quick birth.'
Her sister is ruefully honest about the day her son brought home the Indian
girlfriend he was to marry. 'Oh, he was always very radical - refused to
fight in the army, used to send his savings to African charities and then he
asked if he could bring an Indian girlfriend to his sister's 21st birthday
party.
'I said no and he didn't push it. He just bided his time. Then one day her
father rang up and Pierre, my husband, answered. Her father said: 'I think
we should stop this thing right now.' But Pierre replied: 'I think they need
all the love and support they can get.'
'The voice at the other end then said: 'If that's the way you feel then we
will go along with it.' The next day my son brought the girlfriend home and
this beautiful, educated, composed girl stood at the door and introduced
herself. I took to her at once. But it is still hard that people find it so
'interesting'. I wish they could just be happy about it.'
In so large a family where so many members are lawyers, doctors, professors,
it is inevitable that debate about the constitution rages. It is, it seems,
little understood that this so-called constitution is merely an interim
constitution. It is 200 pages long, few people have read it and there is
general despondency about the South African press which seems never to have
examined it properly.
Seldom, is the consensus, has the press had such a serious job to do and
failed so lamentably to do it.
'It is not through malice, either,' says one. 'They mean well. They have
simply been carried away by western liberal pressure for an election - any
old election, so long as we can say one man, one vote, they think democracy
will have been served. Never mind that scarcely anybody knows what they are
voting for.'
'Do you realise,' says a cousin, 'that the incoming government is free to
re-write the interim constitution anyway it wants? Do you realise, too, (and
I had not until a few weeks ago) that we are not voting for a specific
representative as in western-style democracies. When we vote, say NP, the NP
will allocate the seat to one of its members. This means the allegiance of
that member is almost certain to be to the party, the source of his power,
not to his constituency.'
Another cousin, who was a member of the Wiehan commission whose report laid
the foundations for the big changes in labour relations law which began the
opening-up process and whose commitment to change pre-dates de Klerk's
'conversion' by many years, is also deeply perturbed.
'Most of this group here (our family at the reunion) will vote pragmatically
 -that is to say, they recognise that what is needed for any sort of
democracy to function is the strongest possible opposition to the ANC and
so, I can be almost sure, that most will vote NP.
'The difficulty is that history tells us that democracies function best in
homogeneous societies. Here in South Africa where we have a multiplicity of
tribes and cultures and languages, a federal system would be the best
guarantee of peace and proper democracy. The seeds of conflict are built-in
to the interim constitution as it stands - it gives too much power to a
single group and neglects the interests of all the others.'
The sense of dismay and unease is everywhere. It seems widely acknowledged
that originally de Klerk promised the country a federal constitution, on
very similar lines to the Swiss one, which would cater for different
cultural entities, but was forced to abandon it by the ANC.
The lawyers in the family (and there are many) tell me that most of the
South African judiciary is deeply perturbed by the lack of a proper Bill of
Rights.
'All my life,' says one, 'I have never thought I could live anywhere else.
This is where I belong . . . but when the National Negotiating Committee
threw out the Bill of Rights without even reading it - a Bill of Rights that
had been drawn up by the most distinguished legal minds in the country -
then I said to my children, OK, now I give you permission to leave.'
Even so, few can begin to contemplate living anywhere else. 'We Afrikaners,'
they tell me, 'have nowhere else to go. We can't go following our money
around the world the way some of the British immigrants have done.'
But mostly they do not even want to. 'I would miss everything about South
Africa from the country itself to the different peoples, the complexities,
the richness of everyday life.'
But life, they know, is changing fast - we are reminded just how fast by the
presence of a cousin, a Rhodes scholar and legendary rugby player for Oxford
and South Africa. When he went with a delegation to Dacca to try and
establish a dialogue with the then-banned ANC, he was declared a traitor to
his country by de Klerk, lost government contracts for his architectural
practice and was shunned by friends. Today he is a hero.
For the young, affirmative action is already beginning to change the old
certainties. The effect of sanctions and worries about the future have meant
that there has been a deep recession. A young architect has almost no work;
a recent graduate cannot get a job; a chemical engineer has had it made
quite clear to him that the managing director's chair will have to have a
black man's name on it.
On the day we come down from our mountain resort we see on the evening news
that there has been more bloody violence on the streets of Johannesburg.
We stay at a hotel on our way down from the Drakensberg and the Indian
manager says that all he longs for is peace. 'Few of us are guiltless; we
all have cause to search our consciences. But I and my children, we feel
passionately that we are South Africans. We don't want to leave.'
You cannot be in the country long without sensing the deep longing for peace
everywhere. The signs of the peace dove are on car windows, the motorway pay
check-outs all wish one 'a peaceful 1994'. A Zulu driver whom we talk to in
KwaZulu tells us that he will not vote. 'How can I vote?' he says. 'I know
so little about what I am voting for. But I just wish the bloodshed would
stop.'
Everywhere we go we ask people how they see the future, how they are going
to vote. 'Oh, I don't want to grow much older,' says the baggage worker at
Durban airport. 'I am afraid for the future. Things are not better. They are
getting worse. Everybody blames somebody else. I just want people to stop
blaming the past. I want them to start from now, from today.'
His words echo the words from Chief Gatsha Buthelezi's great speech made two
weeks after Nelson Mandela was released from prison: 'We must all begin by
forgiving one another for the mistakes we have made and it must be not an
intellectual forgiveness but an absolute forgiveness from the heart.'
And that in turn reminds me of the Sotho-Tswana myth recounted by a cousin
who is a professor of Political Science at Stellenbosch University. It tells
of the two wounded soldiers who come round after a battle to find that they,
who are from opposite sides, are the only two left alive - one cannot see
and one cannot walk.
Without each other, neither will survive. This, as he sees it, is the
parable for South Africa today. All the parties need each other. All are
wounded. All have something different to offer and to give.
But with each day's news comes the sense of an impending tragedy. A State of
Emergency is declared in KwaZulu-Natal alone. The irony of Nelson Mandela
and the ANC, who themselves suffered under the draconian rules of an earlier
State of Emergency, imposing one on their Zulu countrymen is almost
unendurable.
We all agree that the violence is terrible but nobody seems to spell out the
full import of this state of emergency. From now on if a policeman sees a
man walking down a road carrying a hoe and decides to arrest him he can do
so, without any explanation or court procedure.
On our last day, as we wait for our flight, my daughter and I walk up and
down the Durban beach front. Here, in my youth, only white children played.
('Can you imagine,' said a coloured woman to me once, 'the challenge it is
to help your children grow up without bitterness when all your life you are
having to tell them that no, that sea, that swimming-pool, that
tennis-court, that fine house, is not for you.')
Today there are Easter Bunny Competitions, surfing competitions, families of
every colour, caste and creed, swimming, surfing, sunning, doing what people
the world over do on beaches.
But there is one difference - at intervals along the beach there are voter
education booths where impeccably impartial information is handed out. They
are manned by whites and Indian and Africans, working together, race at last
seemingly irrelevant.
We can see that the impetus for the election to go ahead is almost
irresistible. Even those who believe it to be undemocratic see no way out.
As we leave I am haunted by the fact that I know that a last grim battle is
being fought - the prize, if it can even now at this late hour still be
snatched, is democracy.
The omens are not good. The world is so relieved to be rid of apartheid that
it seems to care little about the new tyrannies that are rising up daily.
Above all, who weeps for the 600 people, almost all black, who were alive
when I arrived in the country and who now lie dead?

FT  23 APR 94 / Bonn bullish on German economy: Rexrodt believes growth may
outstrip government's expectations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
German economic growth may outstrip the government's earlier expectations of
a maximum 1.5 per cent this year, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister,
claimed yesterday.
Results from the first quarter alone ensured gross domestic product would
certainly expand by 1 per cent for the year as a whole, Mr Rexrodt told a
press conference. Several industrial sectors reported better-than-expected
sales, and export orders rose a real 12 per cent over the past three months.
But he cautioned that growth would not automatically mean more jobs, and the
average number of unemployed would remain about 3.9m, close to the post-war
high reached in January.
His outlook was markedly more optimistic than the latest forecasts from a
number of economic institutes and other organisations. The Federation of
German Industry said this week that the chances of a strong recovery
remained limited.
The minister's forecasts for unemployment also conflicted with economists'
estimates that the jobless total would climb to 4.5m by the end of the year
and continue rising. But the minister, apparently intent on painting a
bright picture ahead of next month's state and local elections, shrugged off
their figures.
'Our growth forecasts were greeted with considerable scepticism by the
opposition and others at the beginning of the year,' Mr Rexrodt said. 'In
the meantime it is becoming ever more obvious that our expectations were
well founded.'
The chemical and automotive industries had reported the best results, he
claimed. Construction, steel and engineering industry also showed signs of
growth while prospects for the textile and electrical industries showed
little improvement.
The minister's bullish mood was partly supported by trade figures published
yesterday which showed visible exports rose 6 per cent in February, while
imports increased more than 7 per cent.
According to Mr Rexrodt, economic growth in east Germany was still being
driven by construction, which he expected would raise output by 15 per cent
this year. Judy Dempsey adds from Berlin: The governing Christian Democratic
Union is clawing back ground in the latest opinion poll carried out by Ipos,
the Mannheim-based social research institute. But the Free Democrats, its
coalition partner, may not reach the 5 per cent required to enter parliament
in October's federal elections.
The CDU increased its share of the vote by 7 percentage points to 39 per
cent in western Germany, and by two 2 percentage points to 24 per cent in
the east, compared with an Ipos poll taken last December.
The FDP dipped by one 1 percentage point to 4 per cent in the west, and by 3
percentage points to 3 per cent in the east.
Support for the opposition Social Democratic party slipped in both the east
and the west.

FT  23 APR 94 / Mandela woos old financial enemies: Johannesburg brokers
applaud ANC president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The faces of the affluent white males in the glass-enclosed trading floor of
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange yesterday looked as relieved as if the
Springbok rugby team had just scored a try.
Bemused expressions became smiles as they broke into applause when Mr Nelson
Mandela, president of the African National Congress, ended his maiden speech
to the exchange.
Mr Mandela at times struggled to make himself heard over the chants of
'Amandla' (power) coming from the black office workers and cleaners who had
gathered in the large atrium outside to celebrate the presence of their
leader. When he had finished, one broker voiced the feelings of most of the
gathered businessmen. 'He was quite impressive, wasn't he?'
The financial community might have been forgiven for fearing the worst from
Mr Mandela. 'A casino', the ANC used to sniff dismissively about the
institution not so long ago. Policy documents repeatedly called for 'state
intervention and regulation' and highlighted the need to 'rationalise and
restructure the financial sector'.
But Mr Mandela came across as a technocrat pledging greater co-operation
between government and the private sector. 'The stock exchange,' he said
without a trace of irony, 'has an important role in the reconstruction and
development of our country.'
Stressing his faith in 'sound market principles', Mr Mandela was at pains to
emphasise the 'critical role of business in building our economy'. He cited
the ANC's proposed Reconstruction and Development Programme, worth R39bn
(Pounds 7.27bn) over five years, which will fund black development projects,
as an example of government trying to set a framework to help business.
It may have taken four years of hard lobbying by the local and international
business community, but Mr Mandela's speech was taken by nervous businessmen
as final proof that the ANC seems to have learned that the local stock
market, the 11th biggest in the world by capitalisation, will have to play a
key role in developing a healthy economy and setting the tone for potential
foreign investors.
Demonstrating the ANC's new-found sensitivity to market sentiment, Mr
Mandela was at pains to reassure dealers about the election itself next
week, dismissing the 'prophets of doom' who suggested that blacks would run
riot in celebration afterwards. Instead, he suggested, the prospect of a
legitimate, democratic government would 'bring the stability needed for
international investment'. His farewell waves to black workers showed he
still knew who his natural political constituency was, but his audience was
reassured. As another broker put it: 'I would be surprised if anyone here
voted for him, but I'm a lot more relaxed about him being president.'
And as Mr Mandela walked away clutching a memento of his first encounter
with unchained capitalism - a set of gold cufflinks embossed with the JSE
logo - the real reward for his visit was evident on the floor.
Following his talk, the market began to rise on a healthy mix of foreign and
domestic buying, and the industrial index finished the day 22 points up at
5,985.

FT  23 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Mortgage lending
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hard on the heels of Lloyds Bank's bid for the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester comes
another piece of bad news for the building societies. March statistics show
a net outflow of retail funds nearly as high as the record of Pounds 673m
posted for September 1986. Still, it would be wrong to exaggerate the
squeeze facing the societies. The Lloyds/C&amp;G merger will not actually happen
until mid-1995. Had it not been for withdrawals for early payment of fuel
bills, the March figures would have looked very different. There is less
incentive for savers to desert building societies now the equity market tone
is uncertain.
The prospect of a long list of early casualties from a mortgage price war
thus looks remote. The societies have ample room to meet mortgage demand
through a combination of wholesale funding, interest credited to sav-ings
accounts and repayments of existing loans. This has allowed them to win back
share from the banks this year, albeit from a low base in 1993.
The stock market's reaction to the Lloyds deal in marking down Abbey
National by a further 3 per cent yesterday also looks distinctly overdone.
Competition for mortgage lending is undoubtedly strong, but the original
attraction for many banks was the abnormally high margins on offer. Their
enthusiasm could wane as quickly as it arose if these margins come under too
much pressure.

FT  23 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Inchcape
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market turned up its nose at Inchcape's planned acquisition of Hogg
Group, knocking 2 per cent off its shares. But that seems a grudging
response to a neatly-turned deal. Admittedly, the purchase marks a departure
for Inchcape, which has been averse to buying public companies in the past.
There are still worries about the depths of Hogg's trading problems and the
acquisition is unlikely to contribute to Inchcape's earnings this year. At
40 times estimated earnings, Inchcape is paying a full price. Writing off
goodwill will knock more than Pounds 150m off Inchcape's shareholders'
funds, lifting gearing to 50 per cent.
But Hogg is unlikely to prove a pig in a poke. The consideration is a
relatively modest 1.35 times Hogg's brokerage income and there is scope to
restore operating margins. Hogg forms a geographic fit with Inchcape's own
Bain Clarkson. Benefits should also derive from sheer economies of scale.
The merger may eventually give Bain Hogg Clarkson the strength to vault into
the top tier of insurance brokers. Its partial flotation within the next two
years will enable it to use paper to fund the next leap forward, which will
be useful given the goodwill costs involved in buying asset-free businesses.
From where Inchcape started, the deal makes strategic sense. Given Bain
Clarkson's modest size, Inchcape either had to get bigger or get out of
insurance broking. The merger and flotation may enable it to do both.

FT  23 APR 94 / The Lex Column: UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite yesterday's 32 point rise, the London equity market still looks
range-bound. Having dipped sharply at the start of the week in response to
the latest Federal Reserve tightening, it recovered at the end as the US
bond market rallied. Equities thus still seem tied to the bond markets. With
the results reporting season largely over, there is less corporate news to
go on. There does not even seem to be a great deal of mileage any more in
hoping for a base rate cut. The money markets are discounting a rise in
rates later in the year. Without solid evidence that the recovery is
faltering, a cut seems unlikely. Even if it happened the market would
probably assume that no more reductions were in the offing, which is hardly
a recipe for higher share prices.
The Fed's action on Monday shows it is not in the business of knee-jerk
reactions to individual indicators. But the debate progresses about the
extent of the rate rises that will be needed to reach what it calls a
neutral stance for policy. Bonds, and therefore equities too, could have
some nervous moments next week given the steady flow of US economic
indicators, culminating in Thursday's first-quarter GDP report.
The encouraging aspect is that with each rise in US rates, the shock to the
markets becomes less. Equities might be able to move back into higher
territory if bond markets stage a sustained recovery once the US tightening
is perceived to be over. The question investors will still have to ask is
whether share prices that move in response to bond markets really do reflect
fundamental earnings and dividend prospects.

FT  23 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Littlechild's lecture
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was always clear that the regional electricity companies would be unable
to hang on to the excess profits from their distribution businesses for
ever. What surprised the market yesterday was the speed with which the
electricity regulator currently envisages clawing back those earnings. On
its own, the proposed annual price cut of 3 to 4 per cent after inflation
would have seemed soft: the Recs should have little difficulty achieving
cost reductions of that order. It is the rumoured 10 to 20 per cent cut to
start the ball rolling that hit share prices. If this turns out to be the
eventual price control regime, a further fall in the shares would be
justified.
But Professor Stephen Littlechild's letter is, of course, only an opening
shot. The companies are muttering about taking the issue to the Monopolies
Commission if he does not back down. The threat is probably not idle given
the new hard line being taken by institutional investors over what they see
as excessive interference in privatised utilities. Having set a precedent by
encouraging water companies to stand up to Ofwat, they can be expected to
put spine in the Recs too.
The MMC is unlikely to give the Recs much more favourable treatment than
their regulator. Prof Littlechild's estimated cost of capital of 6 per cent
in real terms looks about right. But that is not the point. The question is
rather whether Prof Littlechild can be pressed into giving ground before
going to the MMC. If his willingness to compromise with the generators
earlier this year is any guide, the chances of a partial retreat must be
high.

FT  23 APR 94 / Clinton nominations to Fed may tilt balance to 'inflation
doves'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday put a Democratic stamp on the US Federal
Reserve by nominating two pragmatic academic economists to fill vacancies on
its seven-member board of governors.
Mr Alan Blinder, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers,
was named as successor to Mr David Mullins as vice-chairman. Ms Janet
Yellen, an economist at the University of California, was selected for the
governorship recently vacated by Mr Wayne Angell.
If confirmed by the Senate, Mr Blinder and Ms Yellen will be the first
Democratic appointees to the Fed's board since the Carter presidency. Mr
Blinder is regarded as a possible successor to Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed
chairman, whose second term expires in March 1996.
The nominations come at a critical juncture for US monetary policy. Led by
Mr Greenspan, a Reagan appointee, the Fed is tightening monetary policy for
the first time in five years in an attempt to prevent rapid economic growth
putting upward pressure on inflation. This week the Fed signalled its third
increase in short-term interest rates in less than 10 weeks.
Senior Clinton officials have publicly supported the Fed but are privately
worried it may be tightening policy too aggressively.
By selecting Mr Blinder and Ms Yellen, academics in the Keynesian tradition,
Mr Clinton is likely to tilt the balance of power within the Fed towards
'inflation doves' - policymakers who put more emphasis on creating jobs than
on further reductions in inflation.
Mr Clinton said Mr Blinder, a former Princeton economist and Business Week
columnist, had been 'an economic conscience within my administration'.
Mr Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street
investment house, said the nominees were unlikely to affect the thrust of
Fed policy in the short term.
The recent work of Ms Yellen, a former colleague of Ms Laura Tyson, the
chief White House economist, on the economics of gang behaviour might be
helpful in the Fed's handling of financial markets, Mr Roach said.

market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US blue-chip stocks dipped yesterday after the bond market failed to sustain
an early move upwards, but secondary indices improved, writes Frank McGurty
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 3.86 lower at 3,648.68, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 1.10 to 447.63 in moderately
active trading.
However, the American SE composite gained 2.18 to 433.31, and the Nasdaq
composite added 3.82 to 722.56.
Stocks opened on a positive note, riding on momentum carried over from the
previous session's powerful rally. Early on, bonds were holding steady and
the flood of corporate results buffeting the market over the week slowed
considerably.
With no economic news to influence sentiment, Treasuries began to ebb by
mid-morning, after the market tested resistance levels and failed to break
through.
President Bill Clinton's appointment of Mr Alan Binder and Ms Janet Yellen
to fill two vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board was widely expected and
had little impact, even though there was some concern that they would dilute
its vigilance in fighting inflation.
Stocks mirrored the modest slump in bonds. Near midday, however, they moved
closer to their opening values in a convictionless updrift, briefly crossing
into positive territory before slipping again in the final hour.
Cyclical stocks were mixed, with International Paper down Dollars 1 at
Dollars 61 and 3M off Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 47 3/8 . Alcoa, up Dollars 1
at Dollars 67 3/4 , helped compensate for their losses. Elsewhere, Sears
gave back Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 46 1/2 after gaining ground on an
encouraging earnings report the previous session.
There were a few results out yesterday to inspire activity. Mobil gained
Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 78 3/8 . Its estimated first-quarter net income of
Dollars 1.31 a share, against Dollars 1.19 a year ago, beat expectations.
Texaco was Dollars 1 1/8 higher at Dollars 65. Kellogg was well ahead of
analysts' estimates, posting net income of 81 cents, against a consensus
forecast of 76 cents. But the share price flagged Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 51
1/2 in spite of an upgrading by NatWest Securities.
In the computer sector, Unisys dropped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 11 5/8 after
disclosing that its worldwide orders were down in the last quarter.
On the Nasdaq, biotechnology stocks improved after Amgen, the sector's
bellwether, told analysts that its 1994 earnings projections were too
conservative. The issue jumped Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 42, while Chiron
climbed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 59 5/8 and Biogen added Dollars 2 3/4 to
Dollars 35 3/4.
Canada
Toronto stocks ended steady in moderate trading. The TSE 300 composite index
slipped just 0.06 to 4,167.16 for a loss of about 73 on the week.
Advances led declines 417 to 389 and volume fell to 52.6m from 70.1m
yesterday. Trading value was CDollars 609.3m compared with CDollars 859.0m.
Eight of the 14 stocks groups rose and one was unchanged. Energy stocks
gained 1.48 per cent, consumer products, industrial products and mining also
rose, and banking and gold stocks fell 1 per cent and 1.75 per cent
respectively.
Brazil
Sao Paulo shares jumped 10.6 per cent in moderate trading, boosted by a
technically driven buying spree on blue chips after prices dropped for seven
sessions in a row. The Bovespa index closed 1,365 higher at 14,203 on
turnover of Crz264.1bn.

FT  23 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Roussel-Uclaf outperforms as
Paris climbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Responses to Wall Street's overnight recovery varied in their enthusiasm,
writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS recorded its first rise in four sessions, but the 2 per cent gain was
mainly technical: it was the last day of the account, and the buying impetus
came from futures and bonds.
The CAC-40 index closed up 43.22 at 2,135.17, 1 per cent down on the week.
Turnover of FFr5bn was higher than the recent average. Roussel-Uclaf, the
pharmaceuticals group, outperformed the market with a rise of FFr34, or 6
per cent to FFr630, helped by positive analysts' recommendations following a
25 per cent increase in first-quarter income announced on Thursday.
Mr Mark Tracey, of Goldman Sachs, commented that the results highlighted the
company's strong pharmaceutical growth, significant benefits arising from
restructuring and scope for expansion.
Elf Sanofi added FFr24 to FFr995: it announced that it would make a 4-for-1
share split on June 1, and change its name to Sanofi.
MADRID had a complete change of mood as the Bank of Spain cut 25 basis
points off the repo rate. Interest rate-sensitive and US-influenced stocks
starred as the general index recovered 7.84 to 318.96, virtually flat on the
week.
Turnover soared from Pta19.7bn to Pta33bn. Sevillana led a strong utilities
sector and rose Pta35 or 5.5 per cent at Pta666. Telefonica added Pta65 at
Pta1,760 while in banks, BBV climbed Pta95 to Pta3,205. The more likely
contenders in the Banesto auction, Argentaria and Santander, were less
lively, while Banesto itself fell Pta22 to Pta778.
FRANKFURT was braked by the chemicals sector, itself weakened by
profit-taking and toxic dumping rumours. The Dax index rose 16.95 to
2,213.92 for a 0.6 per cent gain on the week as BASF fell DM4 to DM317.80
and Hoechst DM4.50 to DM337.50.
Turnover rose from DM10.4bn to DM11.6bn. Other cyclicals were mixed, Siemens
rising DM7.80 to DM734.80 ahead of next week's results and Daimler up DM10
at DM883.50. But Volkswagen and Mannesmann down on profit-taking by DM4 to
DM548.50 and DM7 to DM476.50 respectively.
Financials and other defensive stocks gave the market some impetus with
Allianz DM60 up at DM2630, Deutsche Bank DM15.50 at DM781 and retailers
better again.
Mr Hans Peter Wodniok at Flemings in Frankfurt said that there was more
pragmatic approach to the Schneider property debacle after Mr Hilmar Kopper,
Deutsche Bank's chairman, said the bank would be holding the properties on
which it had lent money. Retailers, he said, originally responded to a
rumour that Kaufhof would pay a special dividend - although Karstadt did
best in the end with a rise of DM24.50 to DM618.
AMSTERDAM ended with the AEX index 3.70 higher at 419.11 but down 1.4 per
cent on the week, mainly because of the rise in US interest rates. Royal
Dutch rose Fl 3.80 to Fl 206.60 and Nedlloyd Fl 5.00 to Fl 80.70 following
satisfactory results earlier this week.
ZURICH ended 2.9 per cent down on the week as further weakness in Roche
pulled the market back from its best levels. The SMI index finished 6.3
higher at 2,787.9. Roche certificates, under profit-taking pressure after
figures earlier in the week, fell another SFr50 to SFr6,850.
The textile machine makers Saurer and Rieter gained strongly. Saurer bearers
rose SFr100 to SFr2,950 and Rieter bearers by SFr60 to SFr1,660 after Saurer
said it had placed its Rieter holding in a trust management company.
MILAN rebounded on economic figures suggesting that recovery was under way.
The Comit index rose 10.47 to 777.28, down 3 per cent on the week.
UBS, which had adopted an overweight position on Italy since November,
recommended a cut to a neutral weighting. It said the euphoria which drove
the Italian market after the general election had now subsided.
Fiat climbed L241 or 3.8 per cent to L6,635 on growing optimism about its
pending results. Olivetti followed suit, rising L106 to L2,900, and
Montedison put on L54 to L1,132.
Benetton rose L1,436 or 5.6 per cent to L27,150 and Pirelli put on L84 to
L3,015 after results from both groups. James Capel downgraded the Benetton
stock, saying that it did not have the same scope for profits growth as some
of the industrial companies.
Ciga fell L38 or 3.2 per cent to L1,169 as the bid by ITT Sheraton looked on
the brink of collapse after the recent unexpected surge in Ciga's share
price.
ISTANBUL fell a further 4.9 per cent although late buying helped it recover
from session lows. The composite index ended off 955.05 at 18,473.26 for a
week's loss of 18.2 per cent.

FT  23 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises for first
time in four days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The overnight rise on Wall Street, the yen's decline against the dollar and
the settlement of the political row lifted the Nikkei index for the first
time in four trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 average rose by 165.03 to 19,964.39 after a high of 20,071.51 and a
low of 19,833.27. Arbitrage buying and purchases by overseas investors
featured in the morning session but, later, profit-taking by corporations
and dealers eroded some of the gains.
Investors were relieved by the agreement reached on Thursday night within
the ruling coalition over a common platform. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign
minister, will be elected as prime minister in the lower house next Monday,
and parliamentary budget talks are expected to resume around May 9, after
the Golden Week holidays.
However, many market participants were worried about the supply and demand
situation, and large-lot selling by institutional investors and corporations
around the 20,000 level.
Volume totalled 300m shares against 246m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks rose 8.30 to 1,615.80 and the Nikkei 300 rose 1.80 to 295.63.
Advances led declines by 687 to 305 with 184 unchanged.
In London, the ISDE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.02 to 1,317.78.
Arbitrage buying supported financial stocks. Industrial Bank of Japan rose
Y20 to Y3,190 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank gained Y40 to Y1,940. Nomura
Securities rose Y30 to Y2,310 and Nikko Securities gained Y10 to Y1,240.
Material stocks, bought as laggards, were also higher. Showa Shell Sekiyu
rose Y30 to Y1,430 and Hitachi Chemcial gained Y30 to Y1,120.
Retailers, which announced weak annual profits earlier this week, declined.
Daiei fell Y30 to Y1,720.
The OSE average rose 68.60 to 22,152.03 on volume of 32.1m shares.
Roundup
The rise on Wall Street provided the impetus for the region's advances.
HONG KONG recovered most of Thursday's losses helped by strength on Wall
Street. The Hang Seng index put on 222.26 or 2.5 per cent to 9,156.85, a
week's decline of 4 per cent.
Turnover was HKDollars 5.35bn.
The market remained unsettled, traders said, and a rise in local interest
rates next week had not been ruled out.
Japanese investors were seen as purchasers of bank stocks: HSBC Holdings
jumped HKDollars 3 to HKDollars 88, and Hang Seng Bank rose HKDollars 2 to
HKDollars 52.
SINGAPORE was also pulled ahead by the US, while institutional buying was
seen in Singapore Press Holdings ahead of the release of its interim
results.
The Straits Times Industrial index added 34.30 or 1.5 per cent to 2,265.59,
for a week's improvement of 2 per cent.
Singapore Press rose 20 cents to SDollars 14.60.
TAIWAN was propelled 1.7 per cent higher on news of an easing of foreign
equity investment curbs and looser liquidity.
The weighted index rose 95.56 to 5,837.03, a 4.4 per cent rise on the week,
as turnover escalated to TDollars 82.34bn from TDollars 58.8bn.
Papers led the gains on expected pulp and paper price rises, with Taiwan
Paper up 7 per cent, the daily limit, to TDollars 27.40.
MANILA ended higher, but off the day's peak, as investors took profits and
oil issues retreated on poor drilling reports The composite index, 30 points
higher at midday, finished 11.05 higher at 2,788.16, a 0.7 per cent rise on
the week.
BANGKOK gave up its best levels as concern about a cabinet reshuffle
surfaced but the SET index still finished 13.58 higher at 1,293.64 in heavy
turnover of Bt9.6bn. The market rose 1.2 per cent over the week.
SEOUL firmed in thin trade on foreign buying in Kepco, which added Won800 to
Won26,200 and boosted some primary blue chips.
The composite index added 2.88 to 884.85, marginally lower over the week.
KUALA LUMPUR improved on retail buying of second-line issues, and the
composite index added 9.96 to 1,038.87.
Overall volume was 289m shares.

FT  23 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Australia depressed by inflation fears
in US - Contradictions in the equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is one overriding issue in the Australian stock market at present.
Should it mimic the trend set in US equities? Or can it decouple from the US
market, at least in the short term, and reflect the smaller nation's own
economic dynamics?
So far, there has been little sign that the latter, arguably more rational
course, is being taken. The Australian All-Ordinaries index, which peaked at
2,340.60 on February 3, fell steadily after the US Federal Reserve raised
interest rates the following day.
It stabilised in early March, but tumbled even more sharply after the Fed's
second interest rate rise on March 22. At the beginning of April, when US
shares rallied following their earlier sharp sell-off, Australian stocks
followed suit. Finally, when US rates edged higher again on April 18, the
Australian market suffered another setback.
By the close of business yesterday, the All Ordinaries index stood at
2,042.5, some 150 points below the level seen at the beginning of March.
In short, over the past three months, interest rate increases in the US and
the domino effect on bond and equity prices could be blamed fairly for a
near-13 per cent fall in the Australian stockmarket. True, there may have
been a few subsidiary factors: this week, for example, uncertainty over the
gold price, and problems with a number of Papua New Guinea mining projects
led to a general weakness in gold shares.
But for the most part, Australian analysts have no doubt that Wall Street is
leading the way: 'Australian financial markets continue to be shaped by
inflation fears generated within the US,' concluded economists at Challenge
Bank this week, for example.
In theory, this is perverse. While the Australian economy grew strongly in
the fourth quarter of 1993, pushing the annual growth rate to 4 per cent,
there is no sign of capacity constraints being reached. On the labour front,
unemployment is stuck in double figures, and wage inflation, running at
about 3 per cent, is not a serious concern. It is true that the weakness in
business investment could pose problems in the long term, but for the
immediate future, the manufacturing sector is thought to have plenty of
spare capacity.
As the Reserve Bank of Australia commented in its monthly bulletin published
this week: 'Australia's underlying inflation remains around 2 per cent and
the prospects for another year of low inflation during 1994 appear good at
this stage.'
Surplus capacity, the RBA added, 'was serving to dampen upward price and
wage pressures and a stronger exchange rate winding back some of the earlier
potential for prices to rise'.
Comments by Mr Bernie Fraser, the RBA governor, have tended to support the
notion that Australian interest rates do not need to rise in the short term.
'Developments which are fundamentally at odds with holding inflation at
around 2-3 per cent over a run of years will bring forth an appropriate
monetary policy response,' he remarked in a keynote speech at the end of
March. Noting the 3 per cent rate of wage inflation, and trend productivity
growth of about 2 per cent, he suggested that 'these figures do not pose a
serious threat to inflation at this time'.
So why the slavish adherence to Wall Street? Some analysts believe that the
domestic markets are simply anticipating an inevitable feed-through effect
from the US in the medium term, and know that interest rates are more likely
to go up than down. 'I buy the Reserve Bank's argument,' says an economist
at Bain &amp; Co in Sydney. 'But perhaps the easiest way to view it, is that
Australia is about six to nine months behind the US. Markets are just very
forward-looking.'
The second answer is that a significant portion of the money which supports
the Australian equity market emanates from overseas, and some traders detect
different behaviour for foreign, as opposed to domestic, investors. 'Most of
the local institutions have cash to spend,' says one equities dealer at ANZ
McCaughan in Sydney. 'The selling pressure has mainly been from overseas
redemptions. It's hard to tell where that comes from, but the majority is
probably the US.'
Either way, with all the transoceanic stock-watching, Australia's impending
federal budget for the 1994/5 fiscal year has been largely overlooked. The
package is due to be handed down on May 10.
For the stockmarket, this may never be a major event. Although some analysts
believe investors will pay more attention to the budget details in a few
weeks' time, the government's repeated affirmation of its deficit reduction
strategy, and the known strength of the economy should soothe most nerves.
Meanwhile, the flow of new issues has eased: McIntosh Securities estimates
that the market will be asked to absorb around ADollars 6bn-worth of new
offerings in the six months to June compared with ADollars 9.6bn in the
previous half-year.
So the prevailing opinion among local analysts is for a fairly calm period
ahead. There is a general conviction that the worst of the correction is
over, although a few cautious pundits warn that the All Ordinaries index
could reach the 1,900s.

FT  23 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nervousness subsided in the recently volatile equity derivatives and the
June FT-SE contract traded in a narrow range, writes Christine Buckley.
But one broker's head of derivatives warned that the confident performance
may just be a bear market bounce.
June traded at a premium to cash for most of the session, marking an
intraday high of 3,154 although its close at 3,140 trailed the fair-value
premium by about a couple of points.
Volume was subdued at 11,352 contracts while options activity was dull at
29,058 lots.

FT  23 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market stages strong
end-account rally - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK shares ended the week and the account in sparkling form as a powerful
performance by US stocks and bonds on Thursday evening and the emergence of
yet more takeover activity injected some much-needed confidence into the
market.
Even a lack-lustre opening performance by Wall Street yesterday failed to
discourage London.
Also helping the equity market regain its poise was a firm gilt-edged
market, where long-dated issues closed with gains of around  3/4 of a point
after money supply and lending figures for March.
Hard on the heels of the Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn merger with Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester came news of a Pounds 177m takeover of Hogg Group, the insurance
broker, by Inchcape. A bid for Hogg had been widely expected after HSBC, the
banking group, acquired a 6 per cent stake some weeks ago. Inchcape was one
several potential bidders for Hogg and looked to have won control after
buying HSBC's stake.
The FT-SE 100 index, which came under severe pressure for much of the week,
rebounded strongly, closing a net 32.5 up at 3,133.7 and reducing the fall
on the five-day period to 34.6.
The market's second-tier stocks, comprising the FT-SE Mid 250 index, were
much more restrained with the index closing only a modest 7.0 higher at
3,789.5 in spite of some hefty two-way activity.
The London market has been hit by two big blows this week. First, the move
by the US Federal Reserve to increase its Fed Funds rate by a further
quarter of a point, and second, by evidence of strong economic growth which
is seen by the market as reducing the chances of any early cut in UK rates.
The main catalyst for yesterday's upsurge in London and throughout Europe
came from the US where the Dow Jones jumped 53 points or some 1.5 per cent
in the wake of a strong rally after excellent results from IBM, the computer
giant.
There was, however, some disappointment at the level of turnover in the
market given that sentiment was much improved following the big jump in US
markets and the latest bid news.
Turnover in London yesterday reached 816.2m shares but with the FT-SE 100
stocks only accounting for 317.1m shares, or 39 per cent of total business.
Electricity stocks, on the other hand, were badly affected by news that the
electricity industry regulator had sent out letters to the heads of all the
recs outlining what were said to be stringent and severe initial proposals
on pricing due to take effect next year.
Oil shares, among the market's best performers over the past couple of
weeks, made rapid progress in the wake of rising crude oil prices. The
majors responded to good results from Amoco, the US company, but the
market's attention remained firmly on exploration company Lasmo where there
was renewed takeover speculation and further big activity.
Much of this was carried via the inter-dealer broker screens which guarantee
anonymity to both buyer and seller of the shares and are widely utilised in
stake-building and takeover situations.
Marketmakers, although relieved at the market's resilience this week, said
they were not entirely convinced that the UK equity market's recent
correction had run its course. 'The market feels comfortable at this level
but becomes unhappy above 3,155 on the FT-SE 100; we remain at the mercy of
Wall Street.'

FT  23 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: ICI firm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Previous strength on Wall Street helped ICI experience a sharp gain ahead of
first-quarter figures on Thursday. The shares were restrained in early
trading as NatWest Securities stressed its negative view.
However, they closed 24 1/2 higher at 829p with analysts expecting a profit
of between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m on Thursday against a figure of Pounds
74m - restated for the demerger of Zeneca. There was some assistance from
Kleinwort Benson which has moved its recommendation to hold from sell.
There was no surprise that Hogg Group, the insurance group, finally
attracted a bid but there was surprise at the identity of the bidder.
The market had expected an offer to come from HSBC, the far eastern bank
whose shares had been marked down accordingly. In the event, the offer was
launched by Inchcape, the general trader, which then bought HSBC's 6.1 per
cent stake in Hogg at 257 1/2 p a share. Inchcape shares slipped 9 to 552p
on news of the Pounds 176.6m recommended cash offer at 255p a share. HSBC
rebounded almost 20 initially but settled 10 higher at 733p and Hogg, which
had risen from 133p at the start of the month, gained a further 23 to 257p.
Talk that Allied Lyons had lined up buyers for some of its food businesses
was again heard. Dalgety, off a penny at 445p, was being mooted as the most
likely purchaser of the ingredients business, while Associated British Foods
was being fingered as a candidate for the cake and biscuit business. The
shares bounced 17 to 598p, enhanced by a Pounds 35m agricultural business
deal, and ahead of figures on Monday. Allied Lyons rose 5 to 590p.
Reports that the deal to buy the Italian Ciga hotel chain was on the brink
of collapse, helped Forte shares advance 4 to 241p. The UK group had been
outbid for Ciga by ITT Sheraton, but was unlikely to return to the fray,
according to leisure analysts.
Among construction stocks Alfred McAlpine was strong, up 9 to 262p. The
company has been granted planning permission to build 3,330 homes and a
commercial development in Cambridgeshire. Elsewhere, Tarmac closed 7 higher
at 185p, ahead of results on Tuesday.
Eurotunnel fell 22 to 448p as reports circulated that its debt was trading
at a lower level.
The banking sector was still absorbing Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn takeover
of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society. Lloyds continued its rise, up
12 to 597p on turnover of 10m. Abbey National, one of the biggest mortgage
lenders, was worst hit by the probable increase in competition, dropping 14
1/2 to 432p; Credit Lyonnais Laing downgraded its 1996 forecast 28 per cent
to Pounds 871m. Other big mortgage lenders affected were Royal Bank of
Scotland, down 8 to 388p, and TSB, down 4 to 214p. There was also heavy
trade in Barclays, up 7 to 516p, and NatWest, down 3 1/2 to 442p.
The fortunes of TI shares improved after the engineering group held a
presentation on its aerospace subsidiary Dowty to analysts and institutions.
TI's price moved ahead 7 to 425p on trade of 1m shares.
Cazenove was said to have been behind the strong performance of BT whose
shares rose 8 1/2 to 391p. The partly paid added 7 1/2 at 272p.
The oil majors gave a robust performance in response to a surge in the price
of Brent crude and stronger than expected first-quarter figures from US
counterparts. BP improved 9 to 385 1/2 p and Shell Transport 14 to 725p.
Vodafone, badly affected at the start of the week by the forthcoming launch
of Hutchison Telecom's Orange mobile telephone system, continued to rally.
NatWest Securities and Hoare Govett led the recovery which drove Vodafone up
10 more to 522p yesterday after good turnover of 5.5m shares.
The insurance sector was pulled back by concerns over a television programme
scheduled for this weekend and expected to raise questions over asbestosis.
General Accident fell 12 to 594p and Commercial Union tumbled 14 to 574p,
while Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance slipped 5 to 259p and 3 to 329p
respectively.

FT  23 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo interest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Takeover speculation continued to surround Lasmo with analysts pointing to
Atlantic Richfield as a likely bidder. The speculation prompted heavy
turnover with the ordinary shares trading 15m, the new 'nil paid' seeing
volume of 13m and active volume in traded options. The shares closed 2 up at
147p.
Mr Simon Flowers, oil analyst with NatWest, argued that the re-rating had
been driven by the recent rights issue but the rights issue had 'forced the
market to have a major review of Lasmo as an investment'. Both Elf and
British Gas have been targeted as potential predators but both are believed
to be preoccupied with their own concerns.

FT  23 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs hit by Offer price hint
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices among the regional electricity companies beat a hasty retreat
yesterday after details of the regulator's initial intentions over the
review of electricity pricing leaked into the market. Analysts said the tone
and detail of the opening exchange, contained in a letter between Offer and
the Recs, came as a shock to the market. 'We expected a brisk opening from
Offer, but not to the extent of detailing prices,' said one leading utility
broker.
According to analysts who had seen the letter, Offer's opening
recommendation on prices would mean a 15 per cent price cut in distribution
charges, plus an annual rise of around 2 per cent below the rate of
inflation. Some in the market believe Offer's eventual position will be far
harsher than the initial stance and bodes ill for the sector. Others were
more sanguine and suggested that Offer would stick to its initial position,
at which level the Recs would still manage dividend growth in excess of 5
per cent a year.
Among those worst hit, Midlands slumped 27 to 606p, Yorkshire 22 to 587p and
South West 23 to 595p. The two recs included in the FT-SE 100, Eastern,
616p, and Southern, 601p, fell 14 and 16 respectively.

FT  23 APR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar firmer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar finished firmer yesterday on foreign exchanges ahead of the
weekend G7 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in Washington,
writes Philip Gawith.
Trading was mostly range-bound as dealers closed positions in order to
protect themselves against political comment emerging from the meeting which
could move the market.
Speculation about the possibility of some dollar supportive package emerging
from the G7 helped the US currency close in London at DM1.6947 from
DM1.6882. It was marginally firmer against the yen, closing at Y103.650 from
Y103.545.
The D-Mark closed unchanged at FFr3.427 against the French franc, but fell
to L956.7 from L958.4 against the Italian lira. The Spanish peseta firmed
after the central bank cut its key lending rate to 7.75 per cent from 8 per
cent, finishing at Pta81.37 from Pta81.44 against the D-Mark.
Although G7 meetings seldom produce any comment on currencies, markets were
slightly nervous on account of rumours throughout the week of concerted
central bank intervention to support the dollar against the yen. Recovery in
the US treasury market also lent support to the US currency.
Increasingly, though, the market is taking the view that if the dollar
breaches the key support level of Y102.50, then it is likely to fall below
Y100. Mr Mark Geddes, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets,
commented: 'I am sure the downside is going to be tested again.'
There was little response to the announcement of two economists, Mr Alan
Blinder and Ms Janet Yellen, to fill the vacancies on the board of the US
Federal Reserve. The nominations were expected.
German call money rose to 5.20/5.30 per cent, from 4.90/5.00 per cent
earlier, when the Bundesbank announced it was selling 5.30 per cent treasury
bills to put a floor on interest rates.
Analysts said the Bundesbank's action was a reminder to the market not to
overreach itself in terms of its interest rate expectations. Although the
central bank allowed the repo rate to fall by 12 basis points this week to
5.58 per cent, it now seems likely to return to a path of slow and steady
cuts.
In the futures market the June euromark contract closed three basis points
firmer at 94.75.
In the UK a stronger than expected M4 lending figure for March gave the
pound a small fillip, but it finished the day a pfennig lower at DM2.517
from DM2.527. It also finished more than a cent down against the dollar, at
Dollars 1.4853 from Dollars 1.4969.
Sterling futures had a slightly better day, with the June contract finishing
four basis points higher at 94.63. The market mood, however, remains very
bearish, with the December contract discounting three month money at 6.10
per cent at the end of the year. This involves interest rates rising nearly
1 percentage point from current levels.
Although a string of strong economic data has put a firm dampener on hopes
of a near-term rate cut, analysts believe the chance of rates rising soon is
also slight.
In the money markets the Bank of England comfortably dispatched a Pounds
1.1bn shortage.

FT  23 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Squeeze
stirs coffee futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearby positions in the London Commodity Exchange coffee futures market were
highly volatile this week as a supply squeeze distorted values.
The prompt May position climbed Dollars 131 to Dollars 1,625 a tonne at one
point, dragging July, the second month, up Dollars 99 to a five-year high of
Dollars 1,545.
With most short positions thought to have been covered the market went off
the boil and the first two contracts closed yesterday at Dollars 1,554 and
Dollars 1,472 respectively. But with strong domestic demand limiting
Brazilian export availability and Indonesia's harvest delayed by bad weather
dealers did not rule out a renewal of strong upward pressure as further
'in-the-money' call (buying) options were operated.
Coffee prices had taken a knock at the start of the week, following the
Brazilian government's announcement of plans to sell 2.4m bags (60kg each)
of stockpiled beans on the domestic market in this financial year. The
impact of the announcement was short-lived, however, as fierce protests from
growers raised doubts about the plan being carried through.
Monday saw the LCE cocoa market's last, despairing attempt to break through
the ceiling of its recent Pounds 900-Pounds 920 a tonne trading range (for
the July delivery position). When that failed the patience of the US
investment funds' ran out and the ensuing flight of cash from the market
left the July price languishing a few days later in the low Pounds 970s. At
yesterday's close the price stood at Pounds 880 a tonne, down Pounds 21 on
the week.
'This shake-out will probably be a good thing for the market in the long
run,' one trader told the Reuter news agency, 'but it could mean losing
another Pounds 15 or so first.'
Gold and platinum prices extended their recent retreats this week after the
Inkatha Freedom Party's decision to participate in next week's South African
elections eased fears that civil unrest could disrupt production of the two
metals. News of a tighter US short-term interest rate policy, which would to
help the bond market, was another depressant for the London gold price,
which yesterday afternoon was fixed at Dollars 369.65 a troy ounce, the
lowest for nearly six months. By the close it had lost another 15 cents.
What news there was in the aluminium market this week appeared to be bullish
 -International Primary Aluminium Institute figures confirmed that the
multilateral scheme to cut excess production was bearing fruit; and at a
Brussels meeting participants in the scheme agreed informally to examine
ways of extending it to include big producers like Brazil, the Gulf states
and Venezuela. But the mood of the market remained bearish.
After slipping below Dollars 1,300 a tonne on Monday, the three months price
drifted to Dollars 1,275 before finding support. At yesterday's close it
stood at Dollars 1,284.50 a tonne, down Dollars 22.25 overall.
Having failed in two attempted rallies the three months copper price broke
through the bottom of its recent trading range on Thursday. But after
bottoming at Dollars 1,877 the price was lifted by Chinese buying and heavy
short-covering to end the week at Dollars 1,913.75 a tonne, up Dollars
31.25. Yesterday's Dollars 29.25 rise was aided by news of another big fall
in LME warehouse stocks.
Zinc had been the LME's biggest loser until a Dollars 9 bounce yesterday -
in spite of a big LME stocks rise - trimmed the three months price's fall to
Dollars 16.75, at Dollars 931.50 a tonne.

FT  23 APR 94 / International Company News: UAP seeks FFr3bn new capital
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union des Assurances de Paris, the French insurance group which is in the
process of being privatised, is to raise about FFr3bn (Dollars 508m) in new
capital, the French eco-
nomics ministry said yesterday,
The capital increase, which could take place at the same time as the group's
privatisation, is expected to take the form of an issue of equity with
warrants.
Mr Jacques Friedmann, the chairman of the insurance group, has previously
said he was seeking to raise new capital to help finance investment plans
and to compensate for recent deals, such as last year's purchase of the
international interests of Victoire, the French insurer.
The pre-placement phase of the privatisation of UAP was launched earlier
this month. During this period, investors can make non-binding reservations
for sale in the company.
Shares worth SKr2.6bn (Dollars 329.1m) in Skanska, Scandinavia's biggest
construction group, have been placed with Swedish and international
institutional investors by Protorp, a Swedish investment company, writes
Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm.

FT  23 APR 94 / International Company News: Exxon and Mobil lifted by
marketing activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Exxon and Mobil, the two biggest US energy groups, more than offset lower
earnings from exploration and production in the first quarter with higher
profits in their refining and marketing activities. Non-operating items,
though, led Exxon to report a 2 per cent drop in net income from a year
before, while Mobil reported a 9 per cent increase.
Exxon's results were hampered by corporate and financing expenses of Dollars
270m, some Dollars 90m higher than a year before. The increase was due
primarily to foreign exchange fluctuations, the company said.
The depressed crude oil price, which was Dollars 4 below its level of a year
before, led to a fall in upstream exploration and production income outside
the US fell 12 per cent, to Dollars 590m. US upstream earnings, though, were
buoyed by higher natural gas prices and lower operating costs, and rose 7
per cent, to Dollars 245m.
The lower oil price supported margins in downstream refining and marketing
businesses, leading to earnings in the US of Dollars 39m, up from Dollars
21m a year before, and overseas of Dollars 349m, up from Dollars 277m.
Exxon's chemicals business reported improved results, thanks to higher
volumes and better margins. Earnings were Dollars 149m, up 21 per cent.
After the foreign exchange adjustments, though, Exxon reported net income
for the period of Dollars 1.16bn, or 92 cents a share, down from Dollars
1.185bn, or 94 cents a share, the year before.
Mobil, meanwhile, benefited from lower financing costs, which dropped
Dollars 35m to Dollars 73m, and a Dollars 12m fall in corporate and other
central expenses. These factors were largely behind the Dollars 45m rise in
after-tax profits during the period, to Dollars 535m. Earnings per share
rose 12 cents to Dollars 1.31.
Earnings from Mobil's operations grew only slightly from a year before, with
upstream income falling Dollars 98m, to Dollars 335m, and downstream
earnings rising Dollars 102m, to Dollars 236m.

FT  23 APR 94 / International Company News: Banesto bidders fear the wild
card - The contestants will place their offers on Monday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Emilio Botin and Mr Emilio Ybarra - respectively the heads of Banco
Santander and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya - interrupted their family holidays at
Christmas to hurry to the wood-panelled inner sanctum of the Bank of Spain.
Their meeting with central bank officials was the starting pistol for a
series of rapidly unfolding developments that by next week will have changed
the face of Spanish banking and created a group that will rank among the
biggest banks in Europe.
Mr Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain, told the two bank
presidents that Banesto, the most traditional and fourth largest of Spain's
financial institutions, was on the point of bank-ruptcy and asked for their
help.
On December 28, Mr Rojo sacked Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's mercurial chairman,
and appointed a team of BBV officials to reorganise the institution and put
it up for sale. The rescue by the Bank of Spain and the rest of the domestic
financial community absorbed some Dollars 4m in one of the biggest bank
support operations ever mounted,
On Monday, just before the Madrid market closes at five in the afternoon, Mr
Botin and Mr Ybarra, will each send an emissary to the central bank with a
sealed bid to acquire Banesto. For the two men, and Spanish banking as a
whole, it will be a heady moment, the culmination of a momentous poker game.
There is likely to be up to Pta240bn (Dollars 1.7bn) on the table.
The cash bids are for 73.5 per cent of the reconstituted Banesto equity
following a Pta180bn injection of capital as part the bank's rescue. Such
bids represent a pricing of Pta500-Pta550 for Banesto shares against the
Pta750 at which they change hands currently in the Madrid stock market.
Neither Mr Botin nor Mr Ybarra are gamblers but both know enough about high
stake games to fear the wild card in the pack.
This is the third potential buyer in Monday's auction, Mr Francisco Luzon, a
former senior BBV executive who now runs Argentaria, the
partially-privatised state-controlled banking corporation.
Price and only price, the Bank of Spain insists, will be the factor that
will decide who wins Banesto.
Because of this the eight member panel which will examine the bids is
expected to announce the winner soon after they are delivered.
Unless the government, fearing a political controversy, dissuades him, Mr
Luzon is believed ready to dig deep into Argentaria's pockets in order to
obtain Banesto.
'The price of Banesto is a different one for the different banks,' Mr Luzon
said recently in an unguarded moment.
Argentaria, which has a comparatively small retail network, is anxious to
own Banesto's extensive branch empire while Santander covets its small town
outlets.
BBV has demonstrated its management depth as Banesto's caretaker and is
determined to consolidate itself as the leading Spanish bank.
Whichever bank takes over Banesto will become the indisputable reference
point for banking in Spain.
With Banesto on board, any one of the three will become by far the biggest
domestic bank in terms of assets, loans, deposits, bank branches and funds
under management.
However, Banesto will sorely test its buyer.
The acquisition of Banesto will weaken the capital ratios of the winning
bank. According to IBCA, the London-based credit rating agency, a
consolidation of Banesto at December 31 last year would have brought down
Argentaria's return on assets to 0.40 from 0.74, BBV's to 0.44 from 0.80 and
Santander's to 0.42 from 0.97.
IBCA warned that it would consider downgrading whichever bank acquires
Banesto. A succession of brokers have in the meantime switched their equity
recommendations for the bidding banks to hold, and in some cases, to sell.
Mr Luis Abril, one of the 10 officials seconded by BBV to run Banesto, says
a 'huge management effort' will be required by whoever manages to win
Banesto.
The caretaker team, Mr Abril says, is 'handing over a bank that has been put
together again and has a reasonable quality of assets'.
The caretaker team projects that Banesto could be returning pre-tax profits
of Pta8.6bn-Pta16bn by 1996 with strong growth thereafter.
Some analysts believe these estimates to be too conservative.
'It is now a very clean bank, cleaner perhaps than some of those bidding for
it,' says Mr Jose Sevilla of Madrid brokers FG.

FT  23 APR 94 / International Company News: ITT hopes to salvage takeover of
Ciga chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ITT Sheraton of the US is believed be hoping that its deal to buy Ciga, the
Italian luxury hotel chain, can be salvaged, in spite of indications that it
faced collapse.
ITT is thought to be hoping that its threat to withdraw from the deal will
lead to a drop in Ciga's soaring share price, allowing the chain's creditor
banks to deliver a majority of shares to the US group.
ITT announced last Thursday that it had recalled all its staff from the 35
Ciga hotels, where they had been preparing the way for the takeover.
The announcement followed a sharp rise in the Ciga share price, which
threatened to increase substantially the L900bn (Dollars 532m) ITT agreed to
pay for the chain earlier this year.
The share price rise resulted from the unexpected success of a L983bn rights
issue, launched on March 17, which had been widely expected to be poorly
subscribed, as it was priced at L1,000. ITT's offer was the equivalent of
L740 a share.
The failure of the rights issue would have allowed Ciga's 22 creditor banks,
led by Mediobanca, to take on the shares and sell them to ITT. However,
since the rights issue, Ciga's shares have been trading at above L1,000.
Ciga's creditor banks were yesterday reported to be discussing the
unexpected outcome of the rights issue with Mediobanca.
Ciga is likely next week to declare the rights issue a resounding success.
The group could raise at least L670bn, and may even sell the outstanding
280m shares at an auction in 10 days, if the Ciga share price does not drop.
Continued enthusiasm for Ciga shares could scupper the ITT deal. It is
understood that ITT has no contractual obligation to go ahead with the deal
unless the creditor banks can deliver the majority of the shares.

FT  23 APR 94 / International Company News: Japanese bank to cut dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, one of Japan's 11 commercial banks, is to cut its
dividend for the first time in 33 years following heavy loan write-offs
which threaten to push pre-tax profits sharply lower.
The bank, based in the northern island of Hokkaido, is reducing its annual
dividend by Y1 to Y6 per share. Since a dividend cut by a Japanese bank is
almost unprecedented, the move confirms stock market speculation about the
extent of the loan problems at Hokkaido.
The bank has revised its earnings forecast for the year ended March 1994 and
now expects pre-tax profits of Y6bn (Dollars 55m), down 68 per cent on
1992-93. Hokkaido is to write down its loan book by about Y120bn.
Hokkaido aggressively expanded its loan portfolio during the economic spree
of the late 1980s, along with other Japanese banks. The bank held Y400.4bn,
or 5.4 per cent of its loans, in non-performing loans at the end of
September, 1993.
The bank said the figure had risen to Y500bn by March this year. Some of its
larger clients include Kabuto Decom, a resort development company, and a
number of non-bank financial institutions which face mounting debts.
Japanese financial authorities, reluctant to allow banks to write off
non-performing loans, have recently changed their stance, urging banks to
clean up their balance sheets.
The bank plans to record Y19bn of losses from selling bad property loans to
buyers, including the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, established by
banks to buy off non-performing loans. The bank said it would take a further
two years to reduce the level of problem loans to manageable levels.
Hokkaido is to suspend bonus payments to board members. Mr Hiroshi Yamauchi,
president, will retire to become chairman and take responsibility for the
bank's financial problems. Mr Sadamasa Kawatani, vice-president, will become
president.

FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: Le Creuset profits fall to Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Le Creuset, the London-listed houseware manufacturer, blamed high interest
rates and recession in France for a 16 per cent decline in profits.
The company, which makes cast iron pans, saw pre-tax profits fall from
Pounds 3.57m to Pounds 3m in the year to December 31.
Nevertheless, strong sales in the UK and North America helped turnover
increase by 7.2 per cent to Pounds 40.7m (Pounds 38m).
Mr Paul van Zuydam, chairman, said the houseware sector had seen volumes
decline by more than 10 per cent in France, home of Le Creuset's
manufacturing plants, and around 5 per cent elsewhere. The company had
withstood the worst of the downturn, but its export business had been
adversely affected by 'punitive interest rates' and the strong French franc.
It was, however, boosted by strengthening demand for its Screwpull brand,
the corkscrew range acquired for Pounds 7m three years ago.
This now accounts for more than 15 per cent of turnover.
The company has also diversified successfully into the barbecue business.
Last year it acquired Wolo, the German distributor of Weber grills, for
Pounds 1m.
Expansion into such markets had reduced the impact of recession elsewhere in
Europe and provided scope for further acquisitions, according to Mr van
Zuydam.
He hinted that future purchases could be funded with a rights issue -
diluting his current 73 per cent holding.
Buoyant prospects, he added, justified an increased annual dividend of
FFr0.44 per share, up from FFr0.43 last time.
Earnings per share fell from 15p to 13.4p.

<TEXT>
Welpac, a hardware and gardening products maker, yesterday announced a
reduction in losses for the year ended January 31 1994 and announced a
Pounds 2.7m cash raising plan to expand.
Losses before interest on continuing activities were reduced from Pounds
2.11m to Pounds 0.27m and at the pre-tax level the deficit was Pounds 0.98m
compared with Pounds 2.98m. The losses were caused by problems at Harwood
Hardware and at Anderson and Firmin.
Turnover rose by 18.7 per cent to Pounds 19.7m reflecting the core business
and Harwood acquired in March 1992. Gross margin on continuing operations
rose from 25.4 per cent to 30.6 per cent
The placing and open offer is at 25p per share. Holders registered on April
13 may subscribe for shares on the basis of 17 new shares for 40 held.
There is again no dividend. The loss per share was 3.5p.

FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: Baillie Nippon share issue
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baillie Gifford Shin Nippon, an investment trust specialising in smaller
Japanese companies, is seeking between Pounds 20m and Pounds 40m new capital
through a conversion share issue, writes Bethan Hutton.
The issue will be by way of a placing and open offer to existing share and
warrant holders, rather than a full public offer. After conversion, new
warrants with a longer life than existing warrants will be attached to the
new ordinary shares.
Demand for Japanese investment trusts is currently strong so shares in Shin
Nippon are trading at a premium to net asset value. This makes a new issue
relatively attractive.

FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: Manager of Harrods resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Bolliger, managing director of Harrods department store in London's
Knightsbridge for two and a half years, has resigned after its owners the
Fayeds tried to persuade him to move to head the Kurt Geiger shoe chain.
Harrods said Mr Bolliger, 49, resigned earlier this week 'for personal
reasons'. It confirmed he had been offered the position of managing director
of the shoe chain with branches in Harrods, Bond Street and House of Fraser
stores.
He had turned this down and was now thought to be preparing to return to his
native Switzerland.
The company would not say why he had been asked to move to Kurt Geiger,
other than that his previous experience with Bally, the Swiss shoe company,
made him well-suited for the position.
There was speculation that the Fayeds, who recently floated off the House of
Fraser chain for Pounds 413m, were considering floating Kurt Geiger and
asked Mr Bolliger to prepare the company for this.
But analysts suggested that a move from running one of the world's most
prestigious department stores to running the shoe chain was effectively a
demotion. Mr Bolliger was not available for comment.

FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: Inchcape makes agreed Pounds 176.6m bid for
Hogg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inchcape, the motor distributor and services company, yesterday announced a
Pounds 176.6m bid for Hogg Group, which it hopes to merge with its own
insurance broking subsidiary, Bain Clarkson.
Hogg Group's board has recommended the cash offer which, if it goes ahead,
will create the seventh largest insurance broker in the world.
Shareholders' approval for the deal is expected, especially following the
decision by HSBC to sell its 6 per cent stake in Hogg yesterday afternoon.
HSBC, along with Inchcape, had been one of the groups to show interest in
Hogg in recent weeks, whose share price fell sharply earlier this year
following a profits warning.
The deal, the biggest in the insurance broking sector since the
Chicago-based Aon Group, acquired Frank B Hall for some Dollars 475m (Pounds
325.3m) in July 1992, has followed extensive speculation about consolidation
among a range of medium-sized UK insurance broking groups which are under
growing pressure from larger rivals.
Mr Charles Mackay, chief executive, said Inchcape had been seeking to
increase the size of its broking activities through an acquisition for more
than a year. It expected to seek a stock market listing for the new entity
within the next two years.
The group will, through this merger, take a big step towards achieving its
strategic aim of creating a leading company in another of its core
businesses, said Mr Mackay.
Bain Clarkson had been highly profitable in recent years, but if it was
'unable to move from the middle ground' it would be 'squeezed by cost
competition.'
Mr Anthony Howland Jackson, Hogg's chairman, said he was 'delighted' with
the offer, which would make the enlarged company a market leader in UK
commercial broking.
Mr Howland Jackson, who once worked with Bain Clarkson, will become chairman
of the new group, with Bain's chairman, Mr Simon Arnold, taking the role of
deputy chairman. Bain's chief executive Mr Ron Forrest, who recently joined
from Alexander &amp; Alexander, will take over as chief executive of the new
group once the offer becomes unconditional.
Bain Clarkson's strength in the UK, Europe, the Far East and south-east Asia
compliments Hogg's strength in North America, Australasia, Africa and Latin
America. In the UK, Hogg is well known in the market for its expertise in
the credit and political risk areas.
Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, advised Inchcape. Hogg, which was
advised by NM Rothschild &amp; Sons, expects to write to its shareholders before
the end of next week. The deal values Hogg ordinary shares at 255p.

FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: Swiss land a hammer blow on Zantac / A look
at the threat to Glaxo's best-selling ulcer treatment drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like Muhammed Ali near the end of his career, the world's best selling drug
Zantac is beginning to feel the blows raining down on it.
The latest opponent for Zantac's manufacturer Glaxo comes from Ciba, the
Swiss drug company which has landed a blow far heavier and more potent than
any before it.
Industry experts and investment analysts are coming to terms with the
possibility that Zantac's reign could be coming to an end more quickly than
any had forecast.
For Ciba appears to be neatly sidestepping the patent defences on Zantac
that looked as if they would protect it from competition until 2002.
The stakes are immense.
Ulcer treatment Zantac is easily the world's best-selling drug. Its annual
sales of Dollars 3.5bn are the equivalent of more than two-thirds the entire
UK National Health Service drugs bill. It accounts for more than 40 per cent
of Glaxo's sales and probably a higher proportion of its profits.
Ciba's move represents 'the worst possible scenario for Glaxo and profoundly
alters the outlook for the company,' said analyst Mr Peter Laing, from
stockbroker Salomon.
'In the past, the introduction of a generic version of a drug has cut sales
by 50 per cent in 18 months.' (Generics are unbranded versions of drugs once
protected by patents.)
Mr Laing forecasts that Zantac's annual sales will fall from Pounds 2.4bn
next year to Pounds 1.4bn two years later. Glaxo's shares have already
fallen by 16 per cent since Ciba's original announcement on March 22.
Yet such challenges are not new to Glaxo. The sheer size of Zantac's market
has already attracted many challengers.
In the early 1990s, Canadian generics companies attacked the patent on
Zantac, arguing that it was too similar to an older version of the drug to
warrant a separate patent. Judges have so far preferred Glaxo's argument
that the earlier version, which has never been commercialised, had been
improved upon.
Last year, scientists showed that bacteria are involved in causing ulcers.
Because bacteria are vulnerable to antibiotics Zantac might not be needed at
all. But only a proportion of ulcer patients turn out to be susceptible to
antibiotic treatment and diagnosis of who might be amenable to the new
treatments is still tricky.
Next month, SmithKline Beecham's ulcer drug Tagamet loses patent protection
in the US. There will be perhaps 10 manufacturers producing unbranded
versions of the product and it seems likely that some US doctors will be
prepared to switch from Zantac to generic Tagamet on cost grounds.
Swedish company Astra has a newer ulcer drug, Losec, that is taking market
share from Zantac.
Nonetheless, the marketing power behind Zantac and its efficacy continue to
drive sales: it brought in 15 per cent more revenue in 1993 than 1992.
Two factors make Ciba uniquely dangerous for Zantac. Firstly, it is avoiding
patent protection by making the older form of the drug, and secondly its
hand has been revealed with only a little over a year to go until
commercialisation.
Even sources close to Glaxo acknowledge that the company's position is now
'very weak'. Neither the patent courts nor regulatory authorities seem
likely to come to its defence.
Mr Mark Turner, a partner of specialist healthcare law firm Denton Hall,
says that a patent defence might work if Ciba's production process involved
the newer form either as an impurity or as an intermediate step. It does
neither, insists Ciba.
Glaxo is understandably quiet about what action it might take. Insiders say
that it is exploring every legal avenue in its search for a defence. But it
now seems likely that the company is also devoting its energies to coping
with what seems likely to be cut-price competition for its main product
starting next year. It is a threat that dwarfs anything it has faced
previously.

FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: Cattle's chairman goes with Pounds 0.4m
pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roy Waudby, the 65 year old outgoing chairman of Cattle's, has been
well-rewarded for his 40 year stint at the company. The consumer credit
group revealed yesterday that he is being paid Pounds 400,000 as
compensation for loss of office, on December 31.
Mr Waudby, the highest paid director, also received a final salary and bonus
cheque of Pounds 157,789, up 17 per cent from Pounds 135,330 in 1992. This
compared with the 16 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 15.84m.
According to Mr Edward Cran, managing director, the board had an
understanding that the age of retirement was 65, but it appears that this
was not a legal requirement.
The board was unanimous that Mr Waudby should resign when he hit 65 last
year, but 'he chose to hide behind his three year contract'.
Fortunately for the company, Mr Arthur Milburn, a director for 20 years who
recently reached the same age, agreed to resign unrewarded.
Mr Cran admitted 'it was an expensive difference of opinion', but he said
the 65 year limit was now written 'in tablets of stone'.

held at 0.55p for a 1.1p total. Net asset value amounted to 77.9p (60.8p)
per share.
The directors said they were concerned that in recent years the company's
share price had consistently represented a substantial discount to net asset
value.
Accordingly, a resolution would be put to shareholders on or before December
31 2000 for a members' voluntary liquidation involving a distribution to
shareholders following realisation. That decision was subject to any change
in circumstances or alternative proposal being received, they said.

FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: J Bibby sells feeds business to AB Foods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J Bibby &amp; Sons, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday called off the
proposed flotation of four of its businesses in favour of a Pounds 35m sale
of the agricultural feeds operation to Associated British Foods.
Shareholders will still receive the promised spin-off dividend of 2p, as
well as a previously uncertain interim pay-out of 1p. Last year, the group
paid a 2p interim.
Barlow Rand, the South African company which owns 79 per cent of Bibby, has
waived its entitlement to the special dividend.
The decision to call off the flotation means that Bibby's profits this year
will be hit by the absence of the agricultural business, a substantial
provision for the three operations it will retain, and the Pounds 2.5m costs
of the abortive float. Charges to restructure the paper products, laboratory
and electro-optics businesses are expected to run into several millions of
pounds. The special dividend will cost a further Pounds 600,000.
The effects of the provisions and profits loss are likely to be partially
offset by interest savings of at least Pounds 1m this year. Mr Richard
Mansell-Jones, chairman, said the group had also significantly reduced
trading losses in Spain, where Bibby owns the Caterpillar dealer Finanzauto.
He said the loss on the disposal would be Pounds 12.1m, against more than
Pounds 35m had the four businesses been floated. The sale to ABF will net
Bibby about Pounds 31.75m, after a pension payment of Pounds 3.25m.
Bibby, which built up substantial debt following the ill-fated Pounds 82m
Spanish acquisition in 1992, expects gearing to fall from 70 per cent to 55
per cent after the sale.

FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: Reed Executive back in black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased demand for office workers last year underpinned a return to
profits at Reed Executive, Britain's largest employment agency.
Shares in the company climbed 13p to 135p yesterday after the company
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 665,000 in the 53 weeks to January 2,
compared with a Pounds 7.3m loss last time.
Mr Alec Reed, chairman, said the improvement had been fuelled by a 33 per
cent increase in recruitment of permanent white-collar staff, while demand
for temporary staff rose by a quarter.
At the operating level, the recovery transformed a Pounds 3.4m loss into a
Pounds 1.19m profit, of which Pounds 842,000 was generated in the second
half.
Mr Reed said the figures were also buoyed by a sharp reduction in property
write-downs at the group's 130 office locations.
Surplus property costs - incurred mostly on office space above Reed's
recruitment centres - led to exceptional charges of Pounds 524,000 last
year, compared with Pounds 3.9m in 1992.
Turnover, meanwhile, rose from Pounds 82.3m to Pounds 89.8m.
Earnings per share came out at 0.2p, against losses of 11.2p, and
shareholders will receive a 1p dividend - their first in three years.
Mr Reed, whose family control 60 per cent of the company, also announced
that his son James had been appointed operations director, with
responsibility for 100 offices.

FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: Peugeot Talbot runs into Pounds 8.7m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peugeot Talbot, the UK subsidiary of PSA Peugeot Citroen, the French
carmaker, suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.7m last year compared with a
profit of Pounds 10.2m in 1992.
The company's profitability declined steeply during the deep recession in
the UK car market with pre-tax profits collapsing from a peak of Pounds 123m
in 1989.
It said it had been hit last year by a 50.2 per cent fall in exports to
26,353 as a result of depressed demand in continental European markets.
Its financial performance had also suffered from the impact of the
devaluation of the pound against the French franc, which had raised the cost
of imported components and had increased its selling costs. Exchange rate
losses last year totalled Pounds 14m, the company said.
Peugeot increased its new car registrations in the UK, however, by 15.1 per
cent to 142,714, which helped to raise turnover by 7.7 per cent to Pounds
1.64bn.
As a result of the sharp fall in exports, production at its assembly plant
at Ryton, Coventry declined by 15 per cent to 72,868 against 85,728 a year
earlier. Output peaked at 116,505 in 1990.
The company was forced to cut its workforce and reduce production at Ryton
to only one model last year, the 306 small family car, as falling sales in
west Europe ended UK output of the Peugeot 405. The French carmaker decided
to concentrate production of the 405 at one of its main assembly plants at
Sochaux in eastern France.
The Ryton plant worked at only 65 per cent of capacity in 1993 and
production is currently about 1,600 a week compared with full capacity of
2,600 a week. The Peugeot Talbot workforce was cut by 5.7 per cent last year
to 5,889 at the year end.
The PSA Peugeot Citroen group suffered a net loss last year of FFr1.4bn
(Pounds 160m).

FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: A different future for Renfrew - Babcock
decision to axe 420 jobs provokes Scottish despondency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement this week of 420 job cuts at Babcock International's
Renfrew plant has provoked despondency in Scotland that the remains of the
country's base in heavy engineering is disappearing before people's eyes.
The Babcock boiler plant is one of the few remaining examples of the type of
heavy industry on which Scotland built its prosperity in the late 19th and
early 20th centuries. It is the type of plant which Mr Ian Lang, Scottish
secretary, must have had in mind when he said recently that manufacturing
was 'riveted into the Scottish soul.'
For years, the plant was the centre of Babcock's problem-strewn energy
division. But under its new strategy, outlined on Thursday by Mr John
Parker, chief executive, and Mr Nick Salmon, managing director, Renfrew
could account for only 5 per cent of group business by 1996-97 - as its
role, and that of Babcock's energy division, is reduced.
The plant, which occupies a 134 acre site in this industrial town to the
west of Glasgow, was opened in 1897 by the then Babcock &amp; Wilcox, whose
British arm eventually became bigger than its US counterpart.
As recently as 1984 it was employing some 5,000 people, but the story since
then has been one of repeated cuts as Babcock's order book both from the UK
and abroad weakened. By 1986 the plant's labour force had been cut to only
2,570 employees; by the end of the following year it was down to about
1,600.
Last year, in what the workforce understood was a final retrenchment that
would see the plant through the next five years, the labour force was cut by
a further 25 per cent to 1,150. Now another 420 jobs are to go, of which 230
are those of manual workers.
Mr John Quigley, an official of the AEEU engineering union, calls the scale
of the latest cutback 'quite devastating. It puts a question mark over the
viability of the whole site. I don't see how there can be enough work coming
through to meet the overheads of the non-manufacturing side of the operation
here.'
Mr Quigley says the steady stream of government orders used to underpin
Babcock and make it easier to lodge competitive bids for overseas contracts.
'That has now gone, and foreign countries now want to manufacture the lower
technology parts themselves - the work which generated the most employment
here.'
Like other union representatives and local Labour MPs Mr Quigley puts the
blame squarely on the government's energy policy, 'or the lack of it.'
Mr Jim Stevens, a lecturer at the Fraser of Allander Institute at
Strathclyde University, agrees, saying that since the mid-1980s 'the
symbiotic relationship between the electricity generators and the power
generation industry has been destroyed.'
The job cuts at Renfrew were part of a big announcement by Babcock
International on Thursday setting out the future strategy for the
engineering contracting and materials handling company. It included a
four-for-seven rights issue, priced at 27p per share to raise about Pounds
78.6m.
Mr Salmon stresses that the Renfrew plant and the division does have a
future. The 160-strong Technology Centre at the site is unaffected by the
cuts and Babcock still wants to participate in big power plant projects
worldwide.
But it will be a different future - one that recognises, as Mr Salmon puts
it, that 'two thirds of the market is on the other side of the world' and
that, to be an effective player in the Far East, Babcock has to recognise
that much of the region's power equipment needs will be manufactured
locally.
As if to emphasise this point, the division yesterday said it had won a
technology and design contract for two new coal-fired power station boilers
to be built at Ligang in China by the Wuhan Boiler Works. It will bring
about 50,000 man-hours of design work to Babcock Energy, but at its Crawley
base.
The order was the first since a partnership deal was signed with Wuhan last
year to enhance Babcock's ability to win coal-fired boiler contracts in
China and give it access to low cost manufacturing capacity.
Far from destroying Renfrew, Mr Salmon says the cuts will reduce the plant's
capacity to a sustainable core. The more volatile proportion of its work,
new plant business, will fall as a proportion of the total, and other
non-profitable work will be cut out.
Babcock now sees its energy division falling from a historical level of more
than 40 per cent of group sales to about 25 per cent over the next three
years, as the balance of the group shifts towards the materials handling and
process divisions - and towards Asia.
The energy division, and Renfrew, now has three ways forward, says Mr
Salmon: it could go it alone, be sold, or form a joint venture, possibly
with a boilermaker whose technology and marketing strengths complemented
those of Babcock. Whichever way it goes, Babcock's first priority is to get
it into shape.

FT  23 APR 94 / Building Societies - Shifting ground: Increased likelihood
of further bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'for sale' signs have yet to be hoisted outside the headquarters of the
UK's larger building societies, but it is already clear that the Lloyds Bank
offer for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, has increased the
prospects that such signs will appear.
In particular, if the way is cleared in the High Court for cash to be handed
out without restriction to a society's members and savers, then banks, life
insurers and other financial services organisations which have been eyeing
societies will be more inclined to make an offer.
The new interest in valuations and purchasing was summed up by the reaction
to comments from Mr Charles Toner, managing director of the retail division
at Abbey National, the former building society which became a bank in 1988.
Regardless of his protestations that there was nothing happening and that
the banking group had been saying for some time that it could well be
interested in acquiring a building society, his remarks fuelled speculation
about which society would be next, and with whom.
'It's a lottery,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at
stockbrokers UBS. 'There are two sorts of societies which are likely to be
approached: aggressive, excellent performers, and the 'also rans' which
might be acquired by a potential partner with a view to asset stripping.'
Before the Lloyds/C&amp;G deal put the spotlight on the idea of a society being
acquired by another financial services organisation, attention had been
focused on which societies might simply convert into becoming banks as Abbey
National did in 1989.
Inevitably, this highlighted the future plans of the very largest societies,
such as Halifax, Nationwide, Woolwich and Alliance &amp; Leicester, which
provide a full range of financial services rather than fitting easily into
another organisation's structure.
Such societies would be extremely expensive to acquire, even for cash rich
groups. Putting a value of Pounds 1.8bn on C&amp;G, the sixth largest society,
has led other societies to estimate their own worth, and the prices rise
sharply. It is not easy to see who would have the billions of spare cash
that would be needed to raise even the slightest flicker of interest at
Halifax.
So the very largest societies might well not suit a UK-based financial
services operation as an acquisition.
The picture might be different, however, for any US, Japanese or European
bank which might be interested in acquiring UK distribution and would be
content to leave the existing management considerable autonomy. That is a
point that has not been lost within the societies sector.
However, in terms of a joint operation with a UK financial services group,
it is the slightly smaller - though still substantial - societies which seem
likely to be at the top of lists of prospects being drawn up by merchant
bankers and other advisers.
Within this category, there are both the well-performing, clearly branded
societies and also those which can see that as the competition intensifies
further, their own future looks bleaker, perhaps because their scale does
not allow them to offer products as competitive as they will need to be, or
simply because their geographical spread is too limited.
While it would take a very long time for a society to fall into serious
trouble - and at that point the need to guarantee its deposits might well
make it too expensive - years of genteel decline might not appeal to
management.
They might not appeal either to members. One of the threads running through
societies' responses to the Lloyds and C&amp;G deal is that the conventional
charge that societies' boards are unaccountable because they do not have to
put any offer to their members and their members cannot be targeted
directly, no longer applies.
More than one senior figure can envisage that a bank or insurance group
which found its approach to a society blocked by the board, might simply let
it be known publicly that it wanted to buy the society, and wait for the
members to insist they be given the chance to make a decision on it.
None of the successful though slightly smaller societies in the top twenty
is admitting to having any offers yet in the wake of Thursday's
announcement. They believe, however, that if the deal is cleared by the High
Court in a judgment probably next month, then that will open the way much
more clearly and could lead to an upturn in approaches to them.
'Like all societies now, we will be revisiting our strategic plan,' Mr Ken
Culley, chief executive of Portman Building Society, said yesterday.
Another attractive prospect might be Birmingham Midshires, which has been
gaining size through acquiring mortgage books. Mr Mike Jackson, the chief
executive, says that he does not see the society as being other than a lead
partner in a merger or joint operation. But the current climate in the
sector is such that one of the phrases most in use is 'never say 'never''.
While some senior executives believe that their members will have new
temptations to cash in their membership of a mutual for a lump sum, they
believe also that not all investors will want to lose their continuing
rights.
Mr John Burke, chief executive of Bristol &amp; West Building Society, said
there was no need to rush into immediate change, and that the society needed
to carry out some research on what its customers wanted.
Particularly at a time of low interest rates, building societies tend to
appeal to investors who want safety first rather than high returns.
However, in the new landscape, where some investors can see others getting
'windfall' benefits, some senior executives believe they may have to remind
their members about the advantages of continuing mutuality.
One slight difficulty with this is that some of the more obvious benefits
investors see in remaining with a society rather than a bank relate to
questions of risk rather than of their role in the running of the
institution: a plc that simil-arly specialised in retail savings and
residential mortgages might be equally attractive.
Perhaps the most realistic note was struck by the senior executive who
discussed how, though the benefit of membership of a society had been newly
given tangible - indeed cash - form, members could still be induced not to
lose sight of the longer term.
If faced with an unwelcome approach, he said, 'I would say to them that if I
wanted to crystallise shareholder value I wouldn't want to do it now. I
would tell the members that when we eventually pay out, they will be in a
better position to get a bigger payment.'

FT  23 APR 94 / Shake-up at Ford: Five step up in reshuffled management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not only processes and systems which have gone into Ford's
cocktail-shaker to create the new 'global' Ford - involved, too, is a
far-reaching management shake-up.
Under the restructuring a new post is created of president of the global
operating body, Ford Automotive Operations (FAO). It is being filled by Mr
Ed Hagenlocker, until now in charge of Ford's North American automotive
operations, who will report directly to Mr Alex Trotman, chairman.
Below Mr Hagenlocker is a tier of four key managers, three heading up the
main operating activities of FAO and the fourth Mr Albert Caspers, the new
chairman of Ford of Europe. Australian Mr Jacques Nasser, chairman of Ford
of Europe for the past 16 months, becomes FAO's group vice president for
product development.
Its marketing and sales operations are to be headed by Mr Robert Rewey, who
currently has a similar role in North American operations. Manufacturing
operations are to be overseen by Mr Robert Transou, a 32-year veteran of
Ford who for the past three years has been general manager of powertrain
operations.
Mr Caspers becomes the fourth manager of the group, as Mr Nasser's successor
at Ford of Europe.
The five vehicle programme centres (VPCs) are to be headed by
vice-presidents Mr Richard Parry-Jones, who will head up the Europe-based
small front wheel drive programme; Mr James Donaldson (large front wheel
drive cars), Mr Kenneth Kohrs (rear wheel drive cars), Mr James Englehart
(personal use trucks) and Mr William Clay Ford Jr (commercial use trucks).
Of the five VPCs, four are located in North America. However, Mr Trotman and
his colleagues insist that this does not imply an emasculation of Ford's
engineering and research and development presence in Europe.
Mr Parry-Jones's VPC, although described as 'small' cars, in fact embraces
vehicles up to and including cars like the Mondeo - seen as medium-sized
almost everywhere outside North America - and likely to account for about
one half of Ford's global sales.
The appointment of the 36-year-old Mr William Clay Ford Jr, to head the
commercial trucks VPC gives a strong career boost to one of only two Ford
family members still playing a substantive operating role within the group.
Ford's financial services operations are being run by Mr Edsel Ford II. Both
are great grandsons of Henry Ford.

FT  23 APR 94 / Shake-up at Ford: Europe to handle smaller-sized cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford has chosen to locate only one of its planned five global vehicle
programme centres in Europe. However, the US carmaker insists that European
technical staffs are being given responsibility for one of the group's main
growth sectors.
Ford's announcement that it is embarking on the most radical organisational
shake-up in its 91-year history, means that the traditionally independent
Ford of Europe is to be merged with the carmaker's North American operations
into a single operating unit, Ford Automotive Operations with its
headquarters in Dearborn, near Detroit.
However, the European vehicle programme centre (VPC) will take on the
worldwide responsibility, for the design, development and engineering of all
of the Ford group's small and medium-sized frontwheel drive cars.
These include the Fiesta, Escort and Mondeo in Europe and the Escort
(different to the European model) and Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique in North
America. Ford imports into the US the Ford Aspire, a small car, from Kia,
the South Korean carmaker.
These are the world's highest volume car segments and Ford expects large
growth in this sector as it expands its share of emerging markets. Ford said
crucial decisions on the locations of the VPCs had been based on which part
of its organisation had the greater experience and expertise.
'Europe has demonstrated the best capability in designing and producing
small/medium cars and engines as well as manual transmissions. North America
has the greater experience base in larger cars, trucks and higher
displacement engines and automatic transmissions,' the group said.
Under the Ford reorganisation each vehicle programme centre will have
worldwide responsibility for the design, development and engineering of the
vehicles assigned to it.
An important step in the creation of global operations will mean
responsibility for the manufacturing plants around the world will fall to
the relevant vehicle programme centre. This will mean that Ford's
small-medium car plants in the US will be managed from Europe, for example.
This is likely only to happen in practice, as Ford manages to introduce more
common products around the world, but the pattern has been set by its recent
project to develop a world car in the shape of the Mondeo family car,
launched in Europe early last year.
The European vehicle programme centre will take on responsibility for the
Genk plant in Belgium that produces the Mondeo, plants in Kansas in the US
and in Cuautitlan, Mexico, which produce the North American versions.
It does admit that under the new global structure 'product development
management in the new organisation will obviously want to explore how the
European-based vehicle programme centre can operate most effectively.'
This delicate task will fall most immediately to Mr Richard Parry-Jones,
previously Ford of Europe's chief engineer for vehicle engineering. He now
becomes vice-president of the global small and medium frontwheel drive
vehicle programme centre, and the only one of the five vehicle programme
centre vice-presidents, who will be based in Europe.
Ford's most ambitious attempt to develop a world car, the Dollars 6bn Mondeo
programme, was led by Ford of Europe, and under the new structure the
European VPC would lead the effort to develop a single world car programme
to replace Ford's two separate Escorts.
'The timing on this is fantastic,' said Mr Jacques Nasser, who is leaving
chairman of Ford of Europe to become group vice-president for global product
development. 'This gives us the opportunity to put together a world
programme for the Escort and to have one platform for that vehicle
throughout the world.'
This begs the question as to how Mazda, Ford's 25 per cent owned Japanese
affiliate would be integrated into such a global programme. Ford's present
North American Escort was essentially engineered by Mazda and derived from
the Mazda 323 small family car.

FT  23 APR 94 / Building Societies - Shifting ground: Rival banks could top
Lloyds' offer in auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's retail banks are all likely to reconsider their attitude to taking
over societies as a result of the Lloyds' move.
But has Lloyds done enough to ensure that another bank does not simply top
its offer for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester?
Such a move could be attractive either for a large UK bank or an overseas
bank wanting to enter the UK market.
There is nothing to stop one doing so because C&amp;G is mutually-owned, and an
auction is not constrained by the Takeover Panel.
The attraction of bidding for C&amp;G is that the society is known as one of the
best-managed of medium-sized societies, with a very low ratio of costs to
income and careful risk management controls on residential mortgage lending.
If the court case due for May to establish whether a third party such as a
bank can pay bonuses to a society's members goes in Lloyds favour, this
would not only open up other societies but C&amp;G itself to potential
counter-bids.
However, there are several difficulties for any bank considering trying to
top Lloyds' offer:
Lloyds is probably the only UK bank with enough spare capital to make a
Pounds 1.8bn bid in cash. Lloyds has shown that it can pay up to Pounds 940m
in goodwill from its capital without even having its debt ratings lowered by
ratings agencies.
Another bank would probably have to top the bid by using its own shares to
pay C&amp;G members. Although JP Morgan, C&amp;G's adviser, did not preclude such an
offer in the bid process, this would be less attractive to C&amp;G members.
In a move designed to prevent rival bids, C&amp;G's board has agreed not to put
any other offer to members for an undisclosed period. Mr Brian Pitman,
Lloyds' chief executive, says this means it 'would not be easy for anyone
else to participate'.
Without a recommendation from C&amp;G's board, it would be very hard for a rival
bid to succeed.
The voting requirements to gain approval are so stiff that a strong
recommendation not to accept an offer could almost certainly prevent it.
C&amp;G's board chose Lloyds because it was happy not only with the price it was
offered, but the promises it was given on management independence. Another
bank would probably have to match such guarantees to be considered.
C&amp;G directors also believe that a higher price paid to its members might
rebound because the new owner would have to raise mortgage rates or reduce
savings rates in order to raise margins to recoup the money it had just paid
out.

FT  23 APR 94 / Building Societies - Shifting ground: Support grows for Bank
of England regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Treasury ministers and senior officials are supporting proposals to transfer
supervision of big building societies to the Bank of England. The move has
been among ideas mooted in a government review of society legislation.
A decision on the transfer of responsibilities for big societies from the
Building Societies Commission to the Bank of England has been given added
urgency by Lloyds Bank's proposed Pounds 1.8bn acquisition of the Cheltenham
and Gloucester Building Society.
That deal has highlighted the increasing similarity between the activities
of big building societies and those of the clearing banks.
Government officials expect more society takeovers and feel it would be far
more efficient for one supervisor, probably the Bank of England, to decide
whether depositors' interests would be best served by a takeover.
'There is a strong logic for financial institutions to be regulated
according to their functions rather than their corporate structure', a
senior Whitehall official said.
Banks increasingly regard the bigger societies ranging from the Bradford and
Bingley with Pounds 14bn of assets to the Halifax with Pounds 67bn, as their
competitors.
Small societies, friendly societies and credit unions would remain the
responsibility of the Building Societies Commission.
Mr John Watts, chairman of the Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee,
said Lloyds' proposed takeover raised the question of whether banks should
be regulated separately from building societies. The committee's inquiry
into regulation may recommend that there should be one regulator for banks
and big building societies.
At present, the Commission supervises 6,000 mutual societies - or
institutions owned by their borrowing and lending members - most of them
tiny. The Bank of England is responsible for banks, which have a corporate
status.
Bank of England and Treasury officials believe there are too many building
societies and are convinced that the most promising route for securing
rationalisation is to allow banks to buy the weaker societies.
The Treasury may put pressure on the Building Societies Commission not to
put unnecessary obstacles in the way of bank acquisitions of societies.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, called for the regulatory
system to be overhauled. 'We need a proper framework to govern mergers
between banks and building societies to ensure competition and consumer
protection.'

FT  23 APR 94 / Shake-up at Ford: Senior managers face a gruelling eight
months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A team of 27 senior Ford executives faces a testing period during the next
eight months, as they try to supervise one of Ford's most drastic upheavals.
By January 1 Ford plans to have merged its European and North American
automotive operations into a single operating unit, Ford Automotive
Operations.
The team of top managers led by Mr Ed Hagenlocker will not only supervise
the transition but also continue to run the company's day-by-day business,
an operation that last year had a turnover of Dollars 92bn selling 5.96m
vehicles.
Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and chief executive, says the small
automotive top management team will 'establish general policy and worldwide
strategy, but all other decision making will be pushed deep into the
operations.'
Ford intends to reduce its committee structure to simplify and speed up
decision-making. The restructuring was aimed at 'achieving the lowest
possible coefficient of bureaucratic drag,' said Mr Trotman.
It remains to be seen how deep will be the shock waves the reorganisation
sets off through the ranks of Ford staff around the world.
Mr Trotman warned: 'We are not simply changing the lines on an organisation
chart. This is entirely about the processes that we use as we go about
business around the world. As we simplify those processes, there clearly
will be a need for fewer salaried people at today's business levels.'
The number of jobs losses has not yet been quantified, but the world's
second largest carmaker is hopeful that the cuts will be achieved through
natural wastage and early retirement.
The first task is one of communicating the scale of the changes envisaged.
The company's 340 top managers have been briefed in person and 1,350 middle
managers have heard the message by television. Now in the next two weeks Mr
Trotman is planning to meet all the group's senior, and middle management in
Europe and in North America.
'We're not kidding ourselves by thinking this will be a walk in the park.
Some people will find themselves in new jobs, others will be assigned
different work in their old jobs.' The global reorganisation will be
disruptive and costly.
Mr Jacques Nasser, the new group vice-president for product development,
says that Ford has 'a very international group of managers, probably more
than any other world automotive company, but this is the tip of the iceberg
compared with what we need now to optimise this change.
'The home market concept has gone. In design, sales and marketing,
purchasing or engineering the number of people we will be allocating across
borders will multiply by a significant factor.'

FT  23 APR 94 / When write is wrong: Louise Kehoe explains why Apple's
Newton has disappointed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We believe that Newton will be seen as the defining technology of the
digital age,' John Sculley, former chairman and chief executive of Apple
Computer, said last August, as he unveiled the hand-held electronic
'personal digital assistant' shortly before leaving the company.
It is an event that Michael Spindler, Sculley's successor as chief
executive, would prefer to forget - along with the many other occasions when
the 'previous administration' raised expectations of Newton.
In particular, he may not like to recall that, according to Sculley, Newton
would be the centrepiece of Apple's strategy 'to play a leading role in a
Dollars 3.5 trillion market, by the end of the century, for a new class of
consumer products' blending computer and communications technologies with
entertainment and information services.
Far from leading a technology revolution, Newton has achieved mediocre sales
and attracted a backlash of ridicule for Apple. Sculley had promised that
Newton would 'read' handwritten notes and enable users to send and receive
messages. But the software was unreliable and the communications
capabilities limited.
'Retail sales of Newton have been disappointing,' Spindler finally
acknowledged a week ago. He blamed poor salesmanship, however, rather than
Apple technology. In January, Apple said 75,000 Newtons had been shipped.
The company refuses to give an update, but estimates put the figure at less
than 100,000 - nowhere near the number it hoped to sell.
The departure this week of Gaston Bastiaens, head of Apple's Personal
Interactive Electronics (PIE) division, which is responsible for Newton, has
created uncertainty about the future of Apple's consumer electronics
efforts. Bastiaens, who spent more than 20 years at Philips before joining
Apple, is 'setting up his own business activities', Apple said. He was not
available for comment.
The division has been temporarily placed under the control of chief
financial officer Joseph Graziano, which indicates that the division's
finances are coming under closer scrutiny as Apple struggles to remain
profitable.
The second quarter results, reported this week, illustrate its problems.
While revenues were up 5 per cent on the same quarter last year at Dollars
2.08bn, net profits were down 84 per cent at Dollars 17.4m.
Gross margins have fallen from 38.5 per cent of revenues in the second
quarter of 1993 to 24 per cent in the latest quarter. The drop reflects the
big price cuts Apple made over the past year as it has battled to maintain
its share of the personal computer market.
New 'Power Macintosh' desktop computers, introduced in March, are selling
well and producing higher profit margins, the company said. But two problems
remain: the unprofitable PIE and business systems divisions.
Apple Business Systems is responsible for Apple's 'server' products,
powerful computers linked to PC networks. On Monday, it will introduce a new
generation of servers, hoping for a surge of pent-up demand which should
make ABS profitable.
In the PIE division, by contrast, there is little prospect for a turnround
in the short term. With Newton sales 'disappointing', the division's
activities may be curtailed. Spindler insists, however, that Newton remains
an important part of Apple's strategy.
'Apple will not walk away from Newton,' says Tim Bajarin of Creative
Strategies International, a market research group, but he believes Apple's
mistake was to launch the hand-held computer before the technology was
reliable. 'Newton came out a good 12 months before it should have,' he says.
Although Apple last month introduced a second version, which corrects some
of the original shortcomings, 'first impressions count for a lot'.
Pete Snell, marketing manager of MobilSoft, a software company that has
developed spreadsheet and calculation programs to run on Newton, says Apple
set unrealistic expectations for Newton. 'Apple's vision of Newton as a
consumer product was wrong. We think that it has the potential to become a
fantastic business productivity tool, but Apple seems to have missed the
point from the beginning.'
Others criticise Apple for putting too much emphasis on Newton's handwriting
recognition. 'They made it the 'silver bullet' of the product, and when it
didn't work that threw the whole concept into doubt,' says Glenn Smith,
president of Saltire Software, another Newton software developer.
While Newton has not set tills ringing in computer stores, Apple claims some
success in selling to businesses. Later this year, it is expected to
introduce a tablet-sized version aimed at business users. The product could
be saved if it is 'repositioned' as a useful, if less exciting, business
tool.
Yet a fundamental problem remains. Sculley may have overblown the potential
of Newton, but he was prescient in statements about the convergence of
computer, communications and consumer electronics technologies. With dozens
of other companies targeting the emerging market for multimedia
communications, such as interactive television, Apple lacks a strategy on
how to address these new opportunities. Newton, it is now clear, will not
give Apple the leadership role it craves in the emerging digital consumer
electronics market.

FT  23 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Labour market efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES MACLEOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article about the EU 'A fortress would be no defence' (April 15)
Martin Wolf states: 'Unemployment has been rising cycle by cycle over the
last two decades.'
But this is not true in the UK, as seasonally adjusted unemployment peaked
in the last economic cycle at 3,116,400 in the second quarter of 1986, while
in this cycle it peaked at 2,962,600 in January 1993.
The fact that unemployment has peaked at a lower level in this cycle in the
UK but is continuing to rise cycle by cycle elsewhere in the EU is most
interesting.
It indicates that changes in the British labour market over the last decade
mean that the UK labour market is working more efficiently relative to the
EU labour market than it used to do.
It must also strongly suggest that, if we adopt the practice used elsewhere
in the EU, such as the Social Chapter, unemployment will increase.

Sir, We who were fortunate enough to observe from a safe distance Sir Peter
Masefield's remarkable business career must welcome his enthusiastic
endorsement of the Super Concorde project (Letters, April 21) as a reliable
confirmation of your own sober assessment. Res ipsa loquitur, indeed]
There seems no limit to the extent to which such imaginative and far-sighted
men are prepared to plunder the public purse. It is hard to see exactly how
the human condition might be improved by, say, Mr Rupert Murdoch's being
able to get here in half the time. Rather, such considerations make a better
case for a new production run of that splendid classic, the Handley Page
HP42 - a move with which Sir Peter, I warrant, would find himself equally
happy, and all at so much less expense to the rest of us.

FT  23 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Low marks for college quality
standard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CHRISSIE LOVEDAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest your article 'Britain: an audit society in the
making' (April 21). I am a lecturer in a college which recently acquired the
wonderful BS 5750 certificate. I enjoy my work as a provider of education. I
enjoy well-prepared lectures and, most of all, the response of my students.
I like to think I am good at my job. Unfortunately, I hate paperwork (except
for that connected with the real job).
As a course manager, I am required to keep a course file. This contains in
excess of 20 sections of information, used exclusively by the auditors. I
failed my audit on a number of occasions:
Failure to have the register in the file (I was actually taking the class
and was complying with the rule to have it with me).
Failure to have the course number on the appropriate sheet (it was on the
next page, I failed to copy it over; it took a large form filled in by the
auditor to tell me this).
Minutes written on the 'old form' (the one I had been given, as we were
using them up before starting on the new ones).
Other failures were similarly trivial. The standardised design of forms does
not allow for any course to be different and failure to include forms which
are often not even applicable results in still more forms from the auditors.
The consequence of this auditing is to produce unprecedented stress levels
in a profession which demands dedication. Teaching quality must diminish if
paperwork takes precedence. . .but so what?
It seems that no-one is interested in the actual teaching. The solution
seems to be to have a breakdown or take early retirement (if possible). It
all makes room for more administrators, business managers and the like.
Obviously more important than the lowly teaching staff, actually delivering
the goods.

FT  23 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: US example shows how to align
executive pay with shareholder interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON PATTERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The issue of executive pay raised by BP's recent annual meeting
(Management, April 15) goes beyond the immediate and emotive subject of the
satisfactory renewal of a share option scheme. In the US, where executive
pay generates equal controversy, there is a recognition that companies can,
with careful planning, succeed in meeting investors' demands to align
executive and shareholder interests.
This works where the performance measures used to determine incentive awards
at the end of the period are the same ones used by executives to make
critical business decisions, such as capital allocation, as well as being
the key indicators tracked by analysts when they are making share-price
recommendations. In other words, the company and its investors clearly
understand what drives shareholder value and efforts in that direction are
appropriately rewarded. This way, shareholders see that incentives focus
executives on the right things and executives are offered an opportunity to
share in the wealth they create. I suspect companies which find themselves
some way, but not all of the way, down this road will have a difficult
relationship with their shareholders until these measures are identified,
and are clearly spelt out.
It is interesting to note that, if you were fortunate enough to invest in
companies that manage their assets in this way and insist that remuneration
of the decision-makers is highly sensitive to company share price, your
portfolio would have significantly outperformed the stock market in recent
years. Shareholders might wish to bear this in mind when the next AGM comes
around.

FT  23 APR 94 / A suitable case for treatment: As world finance ministers
gather in Washington, Peter Norman detects unease at the IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finance ministers from around the world have been braving Washington's high
pollen count this week as they prepare for one of their twice-yearly
gatherings to take stock of the global economy.
When the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank
get under way with a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven
big industrial countries tomorrow, there will be much accentuation of the
positive.
The IMF, in its latest World Economic Outlook, has already forecast a
strengthening of world activity and trade this year and next that may lift
world output growth to 3.7 per cent next year or close to the annual average
since 1970.
The Fund has been quick to attribute signs of improvement to measures taken
since its policy-making Interim Committee, representing all IMF members,
adopted a 'declaration on co-operation for sustained global expansion'
exactly one year ago.
But while there is little doubt that lower interest rates in Europe, action
to boost economic growth in Japan, market-oriented reforms in the developing
world and the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks hold out hope of a better future, it does not require
much digging to find misgivings among policymakers about trends in the world
economy and their own role.
The sense of malaise is especially pronounced in the industrial countries.
The problems start at the top with weak political leadership. Japan and
Italy have been going through extended political upheavals, while the
leaders of the US, Britain, Germany and now France have been enfeebled by
allegations of scandal, internal party divisions, the disappointment of
voters' expectations and persistent unemployment.
The reality of the much-trumpeted new world order seems to be an increased
focus on domestic policy issues and a tendency to bilateral disputes and
settlements, as exemplified by US-Japanese differences over trade. The
recession of the early 1990s taught nations to put their own houses in order
to achieve growth. The G7 economies, comprising the US, UK, Japan, Germany,
France, Italy and Canada, may converge in terms of growth next year if
Germany and Japan can pull out of recession. But that will entail further
divergence of monetary policies, with US short-term interest rates set to
continue moving upwards while those in Europe may have further to fall.
It will be the job of the financial markets to adjust to these changes. When
the G7 finance ministers meet for the third time in as many months tomorrow,
part of their discussions will focus on recent turbulence in financial
markets and the role played by derivatives, the complex financial
instruments at the centre of much speculative activity. But the ministers'
scope for effective action is small in the face of movements of funds that
are huge and often appear perverse. Governments have been powerless to
influence the big event in the world economy so far this year - the rise in
long-term interest rates.
The jump of about 1 1/4 percentage points in long-term bond yields since the
US Federal Reserve started to raise interest rates in February has
demonstrated the capacity of financial markets to ride roughshod over
economic policy objectives. Ironically, one reason for the Fed's initial
tightening was to prevent the sharp rise in long-term borrowing costs that
has taken place.
A general debate over whether the markets are the servants or masters of
policymakers is sure to grow as banking and monetary authorities intensify
their investigations into derivatives. But regulators and policymakers seem
doomed to lag behind financial innovation, supported as these are by
sophisticated computing power and cheap and readily available
telecommunications.
The power of the financial markets is just one aspect of a broader trend.
The industrialised countries are experiencing a slow but steady diminution
in their global status and influence. Modern knowledge-based industries are
not tied to natural resources or geographical areas: they can and do migrate
easily. While the established industrial countries have been preoccupied by
recession and rising unemployment in recent years, new rivals have been
emerging.
According to IMF figures, growth in the developing countries, excluding
former communist states making the difficult transition to market-based
economies, has only once fallen below 4 per cent in the past eight years. It
dropped to 3.7 per cent in 1990. By contrast, growth in the industrial world
has only once risen above 4 per cent in the same period when it reached 4.4
per cent in 1988.
This divergence of performance is set to continue, according to the World
Bank. It has forecast average annual growth of 4.8 per cent in the
developing world over the next 10 years against yearly growth averaging 2.7
per cent in high-income countries.
In a reversal of previous roles, developing nations are emerging as the
world's free traders. They have also
started to contribute resources to initiatives designed to improve the
world's economic welfare. According to Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing
director, 20 developing countries contributed to the enhanced structural
adjustment facility (ESAF) when the special fund, which lends money at
subsidised interest rates to low-income countries, was relaunched by the IMF
in February.
Against this background of geo-political change, there are two institutions
that the industrialised nations continue to dominate: the IMF and World
Bank. Together the G7 countries control just under 50 per cent of the votes
in the IMF and the US alone can block any constitutional changes in the
Fund.
At first glance, the Fund has never been more influential. It is either
developing or negotiating economic reform programmes with about 70
countries. All propagate the orthodoxies of market-oriented policies, low
inflation and sound fiscal strategy that underpin the economic programmes of
the big industrial nations.
But in the IMF there is a sense of unease not unlike that among economic
policymakers in the industrial countries. The unease has crystallised around
the risky venture to grant Russia a further Dollars 1.5bn in financial
support. The G7 pressured the Fund to negotiate the loan, which was approved
unanimously on Wednesday by the IMF board. It has been granted on conditions
that appear lax to many developing nations that have been forced to borrow
from the Fund in the past.
The G7 has pushed the IMF into the biggest gamble in its 50-year history. Mr
Camdessus has in effect staked the IMF's reputation and credibility on the
ability of a Russian government in which reformers are absent to reform the
economy after many false starts.
If Russia fulfils its part of the bargain and enacts the reform needed to
put its economy on the path of growth and low inflation, the IMF and its
industrial country masters will be able to congratulate themselves. If not,
the IMF could join its client as a suitable case for treatment, and the
industrial nations will have suffered further erosion of their position in
the world economy.

FT  23 APR 94 / Almost the real thing: Brands look increasingly vulnerable
to competition from own-label products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, DIANE SUMMERS and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has not been a good week for grocery brands in the UK. On Monday
Sainsbury, the nation's biggest food retailer, launched its own version of
Coca-Cola, cheekily close to the real thing in appearance but roughly half
the price. On the same day, the House of Commons rejected pleas from branded
manufacturers to outlaw look-alike products of precisely the kind appearing
on Sainsbury's shelves. The result was a blizzard of free publicity which
Coca-Cola needed like a hole in the head; and sure enough, by the end of the
week, trade rumour had it that Sainsbury was selling more of its own version
of Coke than it was of the original.
Behind the hype lie some serious issues. In recent months, the war between
brands and own-label products in the UK has become increasingly vicious, and
increasingly based on price. According to the market researchers Nielsen,
the rate of inflation for own-label products last year averaged 1 percentage
point less than for equivalent brands. But from July onwards the pace hotted
up, so that by the year end the gap had stretched to 5 per cent. Meanwhile,
Nielsen says, own-label sales grew 3.5 per cent faster than the grocery
market as a whole.
A decade or two ago, this would have seemed perfectly obvious. Own-label was
supposed to be cheap and nasty, a mere substitute for those too poor to
afford the brand. These days, it is if anything the reverse. An analysis by
another market research firm, AGB, shows that buyers of own-label are most
heavily represented among the affluent middle class, living in the south of
England and shunning commercial television. Though most own-label products
are still a lot cheaper, not all are. Own-label kitchen towels have over
half the market, and the most expensive of them cost more than the brands.
This fits the pattern displayed by the retailers themselves. A really cheap
down-market chain like Kwik Save sells very little own-label. Further
up-market, Sainsbury sells more own-label than it does brands. Further
up-market again, Marks and Spencer sells own-label and nothing else.
Despite their new-found emphasis on price, the retailers have been careful
not to sacrifice their quality image. It is worth recalling that Sainsbury
has had an own-label cola on its shelves for years. But it was a relatively
poor-quality product, not worth pushing heavily. It now has a better
version, supplied by Cott Beverages of Canada. At an introductory 59p per
two-litre bottle, compared with 105p for Coca-Cola, the new Sainsbury Coke
is ferociously competitive on price. Of equal importance, though, is the
fact that it also tastes almost exactly like the real thing.
For the branded manufacturers, this combination of aggressive pricing and
high quality is the worst of both worlds. Their fight with the retailers,
after all, is not an equal one. Retailers do not have to carry the same
costs as the manufacturers do, especially in advertising and promotion. Mr
David Webster, deputy chairman of Argyll (owner of Safeway UK) is on record
as saying retailers can sell own-label products 15 per cent cheaper than
brands and still make the same cash return.
The fact that the manufacturers this week failed to stop the retailers
selling their products in look-alike packages gives the knife an extra
twist. The head of one big retailer, reflecting on the uncanny resemblance
between a leading brand of shampoo and his own version of it, privately
expresses astonishment that he is allowed to get away with it. This week's
vote in the Commons ensures he can still do so. As a result, every time the
branded manufacturer advertises his own product, he is giving a free ride to
an own-label competitor.
However, the contest may not stay so one-sided for ever. In forcing down
own-label prices, the retailers are playing a dangerous game. In an
international context, the industry giants like Sainsbury and Tesco are
high-cost, capital-intensive operations, which need high profit margins to
make their sums work. The more they educate their up-market customers to
expect lower prices, the more they risk opening the door to real cut-price
retailers like Aldi of Germany or Netto of Sweden.
No such thing, Sainsbury and Tesco would reply. They are safeguarded, they
say, precisely by the expectation of quality which they have so
painstakingly built up over the years. It is one thing for foreign
cost-cutters to set up their stalls in the UK. It is quite another for them
to lay their hands on the kind of quality own-label produce which the
British retailers have made their speciality.
Maybe so. But it is worth reflecting that, while the British retailers have
been educating their customers on the virtues of own-label, they have also
been educating their suppliers. If a manufacturer like Cott can make cola
for Sainsbury, it can do it for anyone else. Indeed, trade rumour has it
that Cott is talking to at least one other UK retailer already.
The same point can be illustrated in detergents, traditionally a market in
which own-label played little part. The UK is a battleground between two
giants of consumer branding, Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble. The most hotly
contested area is concentrated powders, which in five years have come from
nowhere to take half the market.
But own-label has grabbed a much bigger share of the concentrates market -
some 15 per cent - than it has of detergents overall. This implies that the
specialist manufacturers which supply the retailers, such as Albright &amp;
Wilson of the UK and Tensia of Belgium, are at the leading edge of
technology. Again, if they can manufacture for Sainsbury and Tesco, they can
doubtless make detergents to the same specifications for anyone else.
For both branded manufacturers and retailers, the danger should not be
exaggerated. In some product categories, the share held by own-label is
still low: chocolate, soap and pet food, for instance. Vulnerability to
own-label may be inherent in the product, or in the technology used to make
it. According to AGB, most of the top own-label products in the UK are also
big own-label products in France and Germany.
But in almost every category, brands have given up ground over the past
decade. If anything, the process may be speeding up. It is telling that the
discount chain Kwik Save, which has traditionally shunned own-label, entered
the market for the first time last year and now reports it to be the
fastest-growing part of its business. In the long run, the chief
beneficiaries of all this may turn out to be the manufacturers of own-label
produce; besides, of course, the customers themselves.

FT  23 APR 94 / Men in the News: Duo hits the high notes - Andrew Longhurst
and Brian Pitman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 17-year-old in the photograph of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's mortgage
accounts department in 1950 looks like any building society clerk, in tie
and woollen jacket. Brian Pitman had just left school, choosing a career in
banking, rather than one playing the trombone.
This week, the unexceptional youth who turned into the most admired British
banker of his generation, capped his career by bidding Pounds 1.8bn to
absorb his old employer into Lloyds Bank. He had been offered the deal by
Andrew Long hurst, who had transformed C&amp;G into the society Pitman coveted.
The bid on Thursday came unexpectedly, a year before 62-year-old Pitman may
retire, confounding speculation that he might tarnish his record by wasting
cash on the wrong target. That concern was left behind as Lloyds' shares
rose 11 per cent to close at 597p yesterday.
The bid proved the danger of underestimating a man whose Gloucestershire
accent and talent for explaining finance in simple terms - he recently
compared UK and New Zealand inflation in terms of lamb prices - conceal a
formidable capacity for strategic thought.
Lloyds has made a series of moves - such as pulling out of retail banking
overseas, and holding on to third world debt while it rose in price - which
others envy.
A new generation has been pushed to the helm of the UK's other big banks as
shareholders have demanded performance to match Lloyds' profits record. Yet
Barclays' Martin Taylor and National Westminster's Derek Wanless have to
show they can match Pitman.
The Lloyds' boss attributes a year spent working in continental Europe in
his early 20s and another in the US later for helping him to develop
analytical skills. 'I was surrounded by strategic thinking in US banks at a
time when British ones did not even have budgets, and did not disclose
profits,' he says.
As chief executive, he brought a business-like ethic to a bureaucratic bank
which had been indifferently managed. He shed Lloyds' poor operations, and
cut costs. He was helped by a natural curiosity about numbers: he is
happiest when explaining a chart of financial ratios to analysts.
But beyond making some good big decisions, he displayed the sheer doggedness
needed to change a big bank. A conversation with Pitman always includes a
lengthy rumination on his latest topic of interest. He had talked for more
than year about how to respond to low inflation before the C&amp;G bid.
'He is very tenacious, and when he gets an idea in his head he goes on and
on about it until we're worn down, and we just have to accept it,' says one
Lloyds executive. Although he enjoys a debate, his natural confidence means
he can appear patronising even to chief executives of other banks.
As befits a career banker, his pastimes remain resolutely ordinary. This
weekend, he starts his annual golf holiday with his wife Barbara, who is
ladies captain of their local golf club in Weybridge, Surrey. He retains his
interest in music, nurtured from his youth playing trombone with a school
friend.
When he returns, the succession question will still be unsettled. The lack
of an obvious heir-apparent after the departure of Michael Hepher, the
former chief executive of Lloyds Abbey Life, the bank's life insurance arm,
to British Telecom, has already led to one postponement of his retirement.
Some bank executives doubt whether he will depart next year, the date
originally set by Lloyds' board. None of the bank's senior directors has
emerged as his heir-apparent, one reason why Andrew Longhurst has been
suggested as a possibility as a result of the C&amp;G bid this week.
Longhurst, who at 54 could be too old to succeed even if he were considered
a serious contender, has some of the iconoclasm of Pitman. He also has some
of the vision, creating a group which manages to sell more mortgages and
savings accounts through fewer branches than any other medium-sized UK
society.
Longhurst was appointed chief executive of C&amp;G in 1982, a year before
Pitman's accession at Lloyds. He has more formal education than Pitman,
holding a mathematics and statistics degree. But he has pursued a similar
crusade, preaching ideas of 'shareholder value' even in a mutually-owned
group.
He can be charming, achieving an easy informality with outsiders to the
gossipy and enclosed world of building societies. But he has made little
secret of his intellectual disdain for the world that he may now leave
behind.
At the C&amp;G's last annual results, he was discussing the quality of the
buffet refreshments when it was suggested that the topic should turn to the
industry. 'Oh, I don't know,' replied the head of the UK's sixth-largest
society, 'cheese straws are more interesting than societies.'
Other society chief executives were already speculating privately yesterday
as to whether two domineering personalities would clash after the merger.
C&amp;G set conditions for being bought, including a bar on Lloyds selling
products to C&amp;G members, which could eventually lead to friction.
'Both he (Longhurst) and Brian Pitman are very strong personalities. It will
be interesting to see how they get on,' said one society chief executive
tartly. An obvious motive for Longhurst to forge a good relationship with
Pitman would be to increase his chances of being appointed his successor.
Longhurst denies there is even a faint prospect of him becoming chief
executive of Lloyds, and the bank's executives dismiss the idea. As the
retirement of C&amp;G's former mortgage clerk looms, his place in British
banking seems increasingly hard to fill.

FT  23 APR 94 / Conjuror creates illusion of profit: Richard Waters unravels
the phantom trading scheme at a US investment bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
He was the model bond trader. Joseph Jett appeared to be making huge profits
for the US investment bank Kidder Peabody - and he was taking hardly any
risks.
It wasn't as though no one was keeping an eye on him. His activities were
scrutinised as recently as last September by auditors inside the company.
They found nothing suspicious. The paperwork created by the large number of
trades he generated was difficult to keep up with. But that appeared to be a
minor administrative problem.
Behind this facade of normality, the 36-year-old Jett was pulling off one of
Wall Street's more unusual financial schemes, Kidder says now. It didn't
involve rigging prices or insider dealing - the kind of skulduggery with
which the financial markets are more commonly associated. Instead, Jett was
busy creating the illusion that he was making big trading profits (see
accompanying article). The deception earned him a bonus of Dollars 9m last
year.
To borrow from Bonfire of the Vanities, Tom Wolfe's book about a New York
bond trader in the 'Roaring Eighties': Jett had turned himself into a
'Master of the Universe'.
How could one trader conjure up Dollars 350m of profits over three years
before the phantom scheme was discovered? And how could he do it while
working for a subsidiary of General Electric, a group which prides itself on
its strong management and tight controls?
It may not be as difficult as it sounds. In the powerhouse of Wall Street,
the biggest earners in the financial markets, the traders whose annual
bonuses are the stuff of legend, are looked on with awe. They stand out
among the armies of footsoldiers who populate New York's vast trading
floors, the mortals who are all looking for the chance to join the big
league.
Contemplating Jett's rise, Jack Welch, the chairman of GE, muses: 'One of
the overriding things you see here is the enormous impact of the 'star'
system . . . a strong, successful personality may have more influence than
they should'.
Such titans of finance often deal in arcane financial instruments that few
outsiders understand, and pursue esoteric strategies whose risks are
difficult to predict. Wielding great influence and shrouded in mystique, it
is hardly surprising if they are seldom challenged.
Joseph Jett was one of the footsoldiers when he turned up for work on
Kidder's bond trading floor in July 1991. At 33, his chances of making it to
the big time appeared to be retreating fast. He had already spent two years
as a bond trader at Morgan Stanley, and another two at First Boston, the
investment banks. 'Unremarkable', is the verdict of a previous employer.
Morgan Stanley dispensed with him during one of the periodic exercises most
US firms undertake to weed out unproductive traders. Two years later, First
Boston did the same. It wasn't that he was losing money: he just wasn't
making enough.
This lacklustre background may have fed Jett's determination to succeed a
third time around. Certainly, he had shown determination and ambition in the
past. Born and raised in the small town of Wickliffe, in the mid-western
state of Ohio, Jett's intellect had taken him to two of the US's top
academic institutions, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he
studied chemical engineering, and the Harvard Business School, where he
studied for an MBA.
In addition, he was one of only a small band of black traders in a business
dominated by whites. The determination of the outsider trying to make his
mark is evident from reports of his strong will, his drive to make money,
even if he wasn't very successful.
So if Jett was looking for the big time in 1991, he could hardly have
strayed into a more receptive environment. Kidder had its own reasons to be
ambitious.
Since it was bought by General Electric in 1986, the firm had made losses in
three years and a modest profit in only one. GE had paid Dollars 600m for 80
per cent of the firm, and then been forced to pump in an extra Dollars 550m
as a buttress against bad loans and high-yielding low-quality junk bonds.
Welch was becoming impatient: he was reported to be trying to sell Kidder -
which almost happened in 1992 when Kidder's rival, Primerica, was interested
in buying the firm.
Kidder had other problems apart from lack of profitability. Just months
after being bought by GE, it was caught in the centre of an insider trading
scandal. Martin Siegel, its star takeover adviser, was implicated by the
convicted insider-trader Ivan Boesky, and in turn pointed the finger at a
senior Kidder trader. By the late 1980s, the sight of men being led from
trading rooms in handcuffs had become one ofthe most powerful images of Wall
Street's decade of greed.
Other investment bankers walked out in 1989, after Welch tried to exert more
control of the wayward bank by installing Michael Carpenter, a GE executive,
as chief executive. The long-time chairman was ejected. Kidder was now among
the least successful investment banks on Wall Street.
Bond trading offered a way back to prominence. It was one business Kidder
knew something about, having developed a highly regarded mortgage-backed
securities operation in the 1980s. And in 1991, it was bent on using this
prowess to become a top bond house.
The drive was well-timed. The US bond markets soared in 1992 and 1993, and
mortgage-backed securities became one of the most lucrative areas of the
financial markets.
Kidder began making big profits - and paying big bonuses. Mike Vranos, a
31-year-old described as the firm's 'boy wonder', led the charge. Numbered
among Wall Streets' top 10 traders in 1992 by Financial World magazine,
Vranos's bonus for the year was estimated at between Dollars 10m-Dollars
15m.
Jett, the junior trader who had failed to make his mark, was carried to the
top on the same tide. Just two years after joining the firm, Jett was named
a managing director - a powerful position on Wall Street - and made head of
Kidder's government bond desk.
To all appearances, he was generating spectacular profits. Even now,
Carpenter says: 'We were flying the aeroplane with a compass and a tacometer
and an altimeter, all of which said everything was normal.' The problem was,
the readings on the instruments gave no indication that the aircraft was out
of control.
For Kidder and GE, some troubling questions remain. How did the loophole
exploited by Jett arise, and why did Kidder's normal controls prove
inadequate at exposing it earlier? Perhaps even more important, why did the
firm's senior managers omit to ask more questions about the trading strategy
of a man who appeared single-handedly to be generating close to 20 per cent
of the firm's profits last year?
Edward Cerullo, the head of Kidder's bond operations and Jett's immediate
manager, 'did have a grasp on the trading strategy and the profits did not
seem inconsistent with that', insists Carpenter. Cerullo has been found
wanting before: two years ago, he was censured and fined Dollars 5,000 by
the National Association of Securities Dealers for failing to supervise a
Kidder bond trader who reported false profits. Cerullo remains at Kidder as
head of the bond department though six junior traders and administrative
staff have been suspended while Kidder investigates the fake profits scheme.
Jett has been fired by Kidder and could not be reached for comment at his
home in Manhattan.
For the rest of Wall Street, the questions raised by Kidder's embarrassing
troubles are equally discomforting. How many other Masters of the Universe
have ridden rough-shod over slack controls?
Jett's fake profits were uncovered only when Kidder's administrative staff
became swamped by the tens of thousands of trades he had generated. If he
had operated on a more discreet scale, the scheme might have taken longer to
emerge.
Other US investment banks spent last week insisting that it couldn't happen
to them - while busily reviewing their own systems of controls, just to be
sure.

FT  23 APR 94 / Tearing a strip off the firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Joseph Jett, according to Kidder Peabody, exploited a loophole in the firm's
accounting system to pull off his coup, writes Richard Waters.
He traded what are known as 'stripped bonds' (or 'strips'). These are
created by buying regular bonds (usually ones issued by the US government)
and splitting them up into their component parts. The parts  - the coupons
which give the right to interest payments at some time in the future, and
the portion which represents the principal repayment when a bond matures -
are then sold separately.
Under some market conditions, these parts are worth more than the whole.
Strange as it may sound, many traders on Wall Street make a good living by
'stripping' bonds in this way. Under different market conditions, they can
also make money by buying up the pieces and turning them back into whole
bonds again.
For procedural purposes, only the US Federal Reserve, the central bank, can
strip or reconstitute government bonds. So traders sell whole bonds to the
Fed, and buy back 'strips' in their place - or vice versa.
Jett's scheme enabled him to report a profit from the recreation of whole
bonds out of the component pieces. In reality, Kidder says, the wholes he
was creating were not worth more than the sum of the parts, and the profit
was only an illusion.
The scheme worked like this: Jett would enter what is known as a forward
sale in Kidder's books. This showed that he was going to sell strips to the
Fed at some date in the future. At the same time, he would enter a forward
purchase, showing that on the same date he would buy back a whole bond from
the Fed. The process allowed him to book an immediate profit.
The loophole Jett had found lay in the way stripped bonds were valued in
Kidder's accounts.
The components of a stripped bond are traded at less than their face value.
For instance, a coupon which gives the right to a payment of Dollars 100 in
six months might only be worth Dollars 96 now. The other Dollars 4 is
effectively an interest payment, compensating the holder for lending the US
government Dollars 96 for six months. As the payment date approaches, the
stripped bond rises in value, until it reaches Dollars 100 - the amount of
cash that the coupon holder is guaranteed to receive at the end of the six
months.
Jett's forward trades showed what he was going to receive from selling the
component parts in the future. In the example above, the trade might show
that he would receive Dollars 98 in three months. Since this was higher than
the Dollars 96 at which the coupon currently traded, Kidder's accounting
system allowed him to book an immediate profit of Dollars 2.
As the trade date drew closer, of course, the profit shown in Kidder's books
gradually evaporated. So Jett entered more (and bigger) trades. He had to
sustain the book profits he had already reported, and create new 'profits'
as well.
In the end, says Michael Carpenter, Kidder's chief executive, there were
'tens of thousands of trades . . . the actual amounts were in the billions
of dollars at that point'. As Kidder's staff struggled to reconcile these
large volumes of transactions, the penny finally dropped.

FT  23 APR 94 / Leading Article: No joy for UK interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Will Mr Kenneth Clarke cut the UK base rate of interest in the near future?
He is unlikely to do so. More important, there no longer appears to be a
case for his doing so. Only a marked weakening of the economy, following the
tax increases that have come into effect this month, or a substantial
strengthening of the currency, consequent upon declining interest rates on
the Continent, would justify such a cut.
The International Monetary Fund warns strongly against any such move. 'In
the period ahead,' suggests the latest World Economic Outlook, 'inflation is
expected to remain within the authorities' target range of 1 to 4 per cent,
although recent wage settlements raise the risk that inflation may have
bottomed out and financial market developments suggest some increase in
uncertainty about inflation prospects. Further monetary easing should await
firm evidence that inflation is well on course toward the medium-term
objective of 1 to 2 1/2 per cent.'
On balance, the varied economic data that have appeared this week give
further support to the IMF's case. Only a chancellor prepared to cast aside
a far from credible medium-term target for inflation could justify
expansionary moves. Mr Clarke must hear little voices telling him to be
precisely such a chancellor. Perhaps one of those voices even comes from
within himself. But he is severely constrained by the government's earlier
commitments, by the increasingly outspoken views of the Bank of England, by
the vigilance of gilt market investors and, let it also be said, by his own
good sense.
The data on retail sales were perhaps the most striking of those released in
the course of the week. With a 0.8 per cent increase between February and
March and a 1.1 per cent rise between the last quarter of 1993 and the first
of 1994, British consumers seem to be doing their usual stuff.
Gloomy survey
This buoyancy comes in the teeth of a poll from Gallup for the European
Commission, showing consumer financial confidence close to an all time low,
and a rather gloomy survey of retail sales from the Confederation of British
Industry. These may mean that retail sales will stop growing once the tax
increases come into effect. But when the year-on-year increase in the
officially estimated volume of retail sales has been as much as 3.8 per
cent, it would be foolish to assume this in advance of the facts.
Further support for the view that the recovery is proceeding came with the
data on unemployment, the seasonally adjusted level of which fell 30,000 in
the month to March 10 and 211,000 over the year, to 2,723,000. Admittedly,
this decline does not appear to reflect comparable increases in employment.
Revised estimates show that total employment rose only 104,000 between its
trough in March 1993 and the end of that year. Moreover, there was a decline
of 40,000 in full-time employment, offset by a rise of 144,000 in part-time
employment. The total number of hours worked in the economy has probably
continued to fall.
Disturbing jump
The tricky question for monetary policy is whether the labour market is
tightening. What looks like the crucial piece of evidence comes from figures
for earnings, which rose on an underlying basis by 3 1/2 per cent in the
latest 12 months, up from a low of 3 per cent last year. In the hitherto
subdued services sector the underlying annual increase was 3 1/4 per cent,
up from a low last year of 2 1/4 per cent. Still more disturbing was the
jump of 2.4 per cent in February alone. This, it is argued, reflects one-off
payments. But it is not a development that the government can readily
ignore.
For all that, the inflation data are not so bad. Producer output prices, for
example, rose only 0.1 per cent in March and 2.7 per cent over the previous
year. But even this is not securely within the inflation target that the
government hopes to achieve by the end of the parliament. Moreover, the
figures for broad money (sterling M4) over the past six months show a modest
acceleration, to an annual rate of 7 per cent.
Where does all this leave the chancellor? Mr Clarke has no good reason to
change monetary policy, in either direction. This is particularly true when,
as the IMF suggests in its characteristically oblique way, rates of interest
on medium-term gilts have jumped from a low of 6.1 per cent in early June to
more than 7.8 per cent this week. This relatively large jump indicates that
the UK will suffer for years, maybe for decades, from its deserved
reputation for monetary irresponsibility.
Interest rates would presumably rise if inflation started to turn sharply
upwards or growth were to accelerate strongly. They would presumably fall
only if short-term rates of interest were to decline substantially on the
Continent or evidence were to accumulate that the tax increases were biting
deeply into consumer demand. None of these seems imminent. In the meantime,
monetary policy is likely to be put on hold, as it certainly should be.

FT  23 APR 94 / High-flyer alights on ScotRail: Chris Green tells James
Buxton about the challenges and pitfalls of running Scotland's trains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chris Green, one of British Rail's high-flyers, sometimes looks like a
caged lion.
Until the end of last month he was managing director of BR's flagship
InterCity, a profitable, vertically integrated business with a turnover of
nearly Pounds 900m a year.
Now he is director of Scot-Rail, which operates passenger trains in
Scotland. Its expenditure this year is likely to be only about Pounds 320m -
he has direct control of only a third of it.
Mr Green chose to go to Scot-Rail, which he had managed successfully in the
early 1980s, when it became clear last year that his job at InterCity would
disappear with the dismantling of British Rail.
He makes no secret of his sadness at the break-up of InterCity or of his
doubts about the wisdom of the new railway structure, which will be based on
contracts between more than 50 companies. He still wants to be involved in
running trains.
ScotRail is one of the largest of the new train-operating companies, and the
government has designated it to be one of the first to be franchised. Mr
Green hopes late next year to win the franchise for a management-employee
buy-out team.
However, he has far fewer levers under his control than he did when he ran
ScotRail in the 1980s. The company operates and maintains the trains, but
track and signalling are in the hands of Railtrack. British Rail
Infrastucture Services (Bris) maintains the infrastructure, while trains are
leased from a state-owned company.
So far the contracts are only phrased in generic terms. They will be closely
defined in the coming months as the shadow franchise takes shape.
The most crucial contract is with Railtrack, to which Scot-Rail is being
asked to pay annual track-access charges of Pounds 175m. 'So far there is
less transparency than under the old system because we don't know what we're
paying for,' says Mr Green. 'But we are gradually defining our relationship
with Railtrack and getting this year's bill down.'
He fears that Railtrack will not vary its track-access charges to reflect
fluctuations in business caused by the state of the economy. 'We need to be
able to share a sudden drop in our income with Railtrack through variable
track-access charges. But we are afraid that Railtrack will ignore us and
press on with infrastructure projects that would be delayed under a unitary
system,' he says.
After payments to Railtrack, and for leasing trains and renting the big
stations, only about Pounds 100m of ScotRail's costs are left directly open
to Mr Green's management.
That is about the same as the income ScotRail gets from fares - the rest
being subsidies from the director of rail franchising and payments from
Strathclyde region's passenger transport executive for running trains in the
greater Glasgow area. Strathclyde is disputing the payments with Railtrack
because Railtrack's charges are not itemised.
Most of the Pounds 100m under Mr Green's control are staff and materials
costs. He sees only limited scope for making efficiency savings. But he has
hopes of boosting revenues in the medium term by stepping up the frequency
of services between Edinburgh and Glasgow from every 30 minutes to every
quarter of an hour, and trying to lengthen the tourist season in the
Highlands.
Mr Green says the attraction of ScotRail is 'the chance to focus at a level
of detail that was never possible before. We will be very close to our
staff, which is only 4,000 people; and we will be dramatically closer to the
customer, and that will show. Staff will respond and customer service will
improve. That part is going to be great fun to manage'.
He tells of an incident last week when signalling and information systems on
the lines outside Glasgow's Queen Street station suffered a severe power
failure.
Senior ScotRail executives, who previously would have dealt with the fault,
could only advise Railtrack and Bris - which was frustrating. But instead
they made exceptional efforts to help stranded passengers get to their
destinations.
'The good news that incident tells about the new system,' says Mr Green, 'is
the total focus that senior staff were able to devote to the customer. The
bad news is that three lots of people were making every decision. I do worry
about the complexity of what we are trying to do.'

FT  23 APR 94 / Hurd tells Tories to unite over Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday appealed to Conservative
MPs to put aside deep divisions about Europe before the elections for the
European parliament.
Mr Hurd, who chairs a committee drawing up the Conservative manifesto for
the June 9 elections, said the party must show 'conviction and unity' to the
voters.
He said the manifesto, which the party is expected to publish next month,
would offer a 'positive and distinctive' approach based on the strength of
the member states.
Mr Hurd told West Oxfordshire Conservatives that there was 'a strong and
healthy instinct' among Tory MPs 'not to scratch at the old wounds but to
look to the future'.
He said: 'Building on the economic recovery which becomes clearer every day,
we must show that conviction and that unity to the voters.'
Mr David Hunt, the pro-European employment secretary, was among several
cabinet ministers yesterday who warned that a Labour victory in the
elections would lead to more European Union intervention in the UK.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, told party workers in London that he was
'confident' about the future. 'If the polls were to be believed, I would
have lost the last general election,' he said.

FT  23 APR 94 / Leyland Daf celebrates return to profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 1,070 workers at Birmingham-based Leyland Daf Vans were given a day off
yesterday to celebrate the company's spectacular re-emergence from
receivership as a profitable company expecting to make more than 10,000 vans
this year.
The company, created out of the crash of the Anglo-Dutch Daf trucks giant
last year, reported making a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.6m on a turnover of
Pounds 79.6m in its first, truncated, financial year between last April and
December 31.
Jubilant managers yesterday relaunched the company with the new name and
logo of LDV, to help distance it from its troubled past.
Mr Allan Amey, its chief executive, little dreamed last spring, while
tramping the corridors of sceptical potential investors for his management
buy-out plan, that within a year he would be running Britain's biggest
UK-owned vehicle manufacturer.
Yet thanks to BMW of Germany's takeover of Rover Group last month, that is
what LDV, housed at Washwood Heath near Birmingham, has become.
Profits are expected to grow substantially this year. Turnover is expected
to reach about Pounds 150m.
'The performance says two things,' said Mr Allan Amey, chief executive.
'Inherently the vans business is profitable, and it was profitable both as
part of Rover (formerly British Leyland) and, later, as part of Daf.'
Managers of LDV, several of whom, including Mr Amey, had been with the
company for years before the Daf debacle, had long been annoyed that the van
business's underlying profitability had been swamped, in the public eye at
least, by the rising tide of the Daf group's indebted-ness.
Not surprisingly, therefore, the management buy-out team has derived
considerable satisfaction from reporting the performance to its main equity
investor, the 3i venture capital group, and finance providers Royal Bank of
Scotland and United Dominions Trust, which between them made possible the
Pounds 40m buy-out.
The first-year performance, said Mr Amey, exceeded the target of the
company's three-year business plan.
Professor Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff
Business School, said LDV's brief track record was 'one of the most dramatic
and successful recoveries in Britain's post-war history'.
In March 1993, during the receivership, LDV's share of the UK panel van
market slipped to 6 per cent. Its workforce was cut by more than a half, to
just over 900.
In the first quarter of this year its market share has almost doubled, to
11.3 per cent.
The plant is producing at a rate of 250 a week, up from 200 in the immediate
aftermath of the receivership, and Mr Amey said it should be up to 300 a
week by the middle of this year. Break-even, said Mr Amey, was 9,000 a year
and falling. That is still far behind market leader Ford, but LDV has no
intention of seeking head-on confrontation.
LDV's strategy is focused heavily on 'tailor-made' vans, using its Special
Vehicle Op-erations to build vehicles specifically adapted for operators in
a way not possible on volume assembly lines. The Post Office, electricity
companies and the Automobile Association come high on the list.
Some 75 per cent of all output now goes through Special Vehicle Operations.
LDV has added about 100 employees, taking the workforce to 1,070, prompted
mainly by strong growth in output of the Land Rover Discovery for which LDV
presses panels. Pressings accounted for Pounds 10m of the turnover.
Productivity increases will restrict workforce growth. Mr Amey's main
concern has been to firmly secure LDV's position the UK marketplace. But
contained within last year's turnover figure is Pounds 2.5m in export sales
 -a small sum, but marking the stirrings of a revival in Continental sales.
'When we developed the business plan we didn't know what would happen to our
European customers,' said Mr Amey. 'But once we got back up and running last
year a lot of Continental dealers who had been selling both trucks and vans
found they were missing the vans. So we're starting to sell again - so far
in Spain, France, Belgium and Holland.'
Mr Amey said there was no 'grand strategy' for mainland Europe but predicted
'a clear potential to do 4,000 or 5,000 vans a year there. It could provide
20 to 30 per cent of our volume'.
Priorities include strengthening the business for the medium term, requiring
a Pounds 30m new-products programme, the first results of which will be seen
in 1995. Some Pounds 8m has already been committed. Mr Amey said this could
be funded from LDV's earnings. But still missing is precisely what will
happen in the long-term, when LDV must face total renewal, rather than
updating, of its product range.
Mr Amey does not rule out the possibility that when a new generation of
product does appear - current modernisation is expected to take LDV to the
turn of the century - it will be the result of a partnership.
'We're going to look at a number of options, and probably spend the next 18
to 24 months evaluating them,' he said.
Actual sales in the eight-month year totalled 7,000 - enough to generate
substantial business for LDV's 110 dealers. About half of these are truck
dealerships with the remainder Rover Group car dealers.
Mr Amey sees no particular need for more dealers. However, he acknowledged
some 'massaging' of standards was required 'so that a constant level of
performance is achieved across the network'.

FT  23 APR 94 / Ex-Swans workers awarded payouts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions representing 300 Swan Hunter shipyard workers, who lost their jobs
last July when the company went into receivership, have won compensation
from a Newcastle upon Tyne industrial tribunal of between Pounds 250,000 and
Pounds 750,000 depending on further litigation.
The full order, which is nearer Pounds 1m, is not realisable because the
company is in receivership.
Mr Stefan Cross, of Brian Thompson and Partners, the solicitors representing
the GMB general union at the tribunal, said that other cases against the
Department of Employment were to be heard. They will challenge the way the
department made payments from a redundancy scheme.
Five unions launched claims on behalf of some 1,400 workers who lost their
jobs at the company. More than 1,000 unfair dismissal cases remain
outstanding and a further 400 claims against the employment department are
being pursued.
The Swan Hunter cases are typical of recent big receiverships, such as those
at Leyland Daf and Ferranti, where employees have been dismissed at short
notice in contravention of legal requirements that workers be given 90 days
notice of redundancy.

FT  23 APR 94 / DTI warned on digital TV use
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time Warner, the US media group, yesterday warned the British government
that no other country in the world was considering the early introduction of
digital television on terrestrial transmitters.
The warning came from Mr Tom McGrath, president of Time Warner International
Broadcasting, after a meeting on the issue at the Department of Trade and
Industry.
The DTI is finalising its decision on digital television and whether the
launch of a conventional analogue Channel 5 would limit the introduction of
digital services.
Time Warner is a member of a consortium interested in the Channel 5
franchise. The other members are Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, and
MAI, the broadcasting and financial services group which controls Meridian
Broadcasting, the south of England ITV company.
At least one other group, led by NBC, the US network company, wants to have
the chance to bid for a Channel 5 licence.
The Independent Television Commission has made clear it would like to decide
next month to go ahead and advertise a fifth national channel, but needs to
be sure that the DTI will make the necessary frequencies available.
Time Warner believes digital services in the foreseeable future will develop
on cable and satellite rather than on land-based transmitters because of the
difficulty of having to rebroad-cast existing channels on digital.
The company cites the example of Germany where new local analogue television
licences are now being awarded.

FT  23 APR 94 / Portillo talks up his manifesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday warned the
Conservatives to heed Britain's 'quiet majority' before the local and
European elections.
Speaking to Conservatives in Fife, Mr Portillo urged the party to ignore
'the clamour of vociferous minorities', and listen to 'the still, small
voice' of its natural supporters.
In a speech flagged as a personal political manifesto, Mr Portillo dwelt
heavily on rightwing icons such as personal responsibility, self-improvement
and law and order.
Mr Portillo's tone was less sharp than his hard-hitting attack three months
ago on the 'new British disease' of undermining institutions such as the
monarchy and parliament.
Yet the speech was seen at Westminster as the next step in his campaign to
secure the rightwing nomination in any Conservative leadership election.
Few of Mr Portillo's supporters think he could win the leadership at an
early attempt by overhauling front-runners Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor,
and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
But solid rightwing support could put Mr Portillo on track for the
leadership in the next parliament, after a spell in a more senior cabinet
role.
Mr Portillo said the quiet majority looked to the Conservatives for secure
defences, law and order, sound public finances, low inflation and economic
policies that encouraged investment and job creation.
He said Britain had much of which to be proud, including its export to the
rest of the world of a free-market economic agenda of de-regulation,
competition, privatisation, tariff reduction, and free trade.
He said the quiet majority was 'dismayed' by aspects of modern Britain such
as handouts to people capable of work and young offenders being sent on
sailing cruises.
'In a world turned upside down, they ask where is the encouragement for
self-reliance, where is the punishment for wrong-doing, where is the
incentive to achieve?' he said.
'They look to the Conservative party to articulate their point of view, and
through its policies and legislation to validate their way of life and
underpin their belief.'

FT  23 APR 94 / Irish firepower keeps IRA on the run: Michael Cassell
witnesses a hunt for guns in the gorse on the republic's side of the border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lt Col Michael Lucey, commanding officer of the Irish army's 29th Infantry
Battalion, casts a professional eye across a remote County Monaghan
hillside. The gorse bushes might conceal a rabbit warren or an AK47 rifle.
Beyond a line of police officers beating the undergrowth in search of
concealed weaponry lies the River Blackwater and the border with Northern
Ireland; an ill-defined, 282-mile-long line on the map, the only land
boundary the UK shares with a foreign state.
Monaghan thrusts far north, close to the same latitude as Belfast, leaving
three of Northern Ireland's six counties to close in around it. Its
geography puts it in the front line of UK-Irish efforts to stop the IRA
waging war in the north from safe refuges in the south.
Lt Col Lucey's career has taken him to the Lebanon, Cyprus and Egypt, far
from the muddy fields which stretch away to Figanny Bridge and Killyfaragh.
Shouting to be heard above the noise of an Alouette helicopter hovering
overhead, he reckons the IRA is no match for Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian
Lebanese faction.
UK security forces on the other side of the woods see things differently,
given the deaths and injuries inflicted upon Royal Ulster Constabulary and
army personnel by the world's most technically advanced terrorists.
Even so, security forces on both sides of the border say their relationship
is better than ever and that their combined onslaught means the IRA is under
intense pressure. This week's joint operation in the UK and the Irish
Republic, intended to strike at the heart of IRA finances, represented a
striking public example of the partnership in action.
Yet it is not free of new disagreements or old suspicions. Privately, Garda
(Irish police) criticise the British for manning easily targeted, permanent
border checkpoints which they say are provocative and disruptive, while the
British still hint that the Irish are more enthusiastic about uncovering
weapons than apprehending their fellow countrymen.
But while some UK politicians demand more direct communication links - the
UK army has to go through the Garda to talk to Irish army officers - forces
on the ground claim they have few complaints about operational arrangements.
The Irish anti-terrorism effort, whatever the perception in some quarters,
is extensive, expensive - Irish taxpayers pay more per capita than those in
Britain - and appears increasingly successful.
Nobody would claim that 200 open border crossings and millions of acres of
countryside which seamlessly stitch together two nation states could ever be
rid of terrorist traffic. But Garda assistant commissioner Ned O'Dea, who is
responsible for the national surveillance unit which targets terrorists,
says there are no budget constraints: 'What we need, we get.'
What he gets includes 1,000 police officers stationed along the border,
1,400 troops acting as back-up to the civil power and a Garda emergency
response unit armed with Uzi machine guns, Heckler and Koch rifles and
pump-action shotguns. Special Branch officers and undercover agents complete
the set-up.
Constant patrols, spot checks and searches last year around the republic
yielded more than 500 firearms, nearly 27,000 rounds of ammunition and
almost 4,000lbs of explosives. Together, says Mr O'Dea, 'they add up to a
lot of lives saved'.
There is no room for complacency, however, with the Garda yet to locate
hundreds of rifles and machine guns along with rocket launchers, missiles,
revolvers, ammunition, detonators and explosives all known to have been
shipped into the republic nearly a decade ago.
Though Garda and army personnel have been killed by the IRA, the Irish
accept that the security forces to the north face a much greater threat. Mr
O'Dea says: 'If a body lies on our side of the border we can simply walk up
to it; if it's on the other side they fly over it and round it and only go
in under heavy protection; it could be booby-trapped.'
Neither do the Irish confront a border-area population that regards the
security forces as legitimate enemy targets. Not that the people of Monaghan
queue up to help the Garda.
Chief Supt Tom Curran says: 'A great many people around here have no time at
all for the IRA and want to see them defeated. But fear of reprisals on
family members north or south of the border means they won't tip us off.'
But there is a conviction the fight is being won and Mr O'Dea and Lt Col
Lucey look forward to the day when the IRA has no hiding place left and both
men can resume normal duties.

A former senior defence official who took thousands of pounds in
'backhanders' over armaments contracts was jailed for a year yesterday at
Southwark Crown Court.
Mr Trevelyan, of Rowley Regis, West Midlands - who headed the Ministry of
Defence's light armoured engineering systems - was convicted of four counts
of corruption involving a total of Pounds 8,652 and one charge of attempted
corruption, which could have netted him a further Pounds 28,580.
Mr David Oliver, of Camberley, Surrey, managing director of defence agents
Imvec, was fined Pounds 4,000 after being found guilty of corruptly paying
Mr Trevelyan, a close friend, Pounds 2,000 for a report on armoured
vehicles.

FT  23 APR 94 / Heseltine considers insolvency sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The head of the government's Insolvency Service has been asked to draw up
plans for contracting out the bulk of the agency's work in handling
bankruptcies and compulsory liquidations, John Willman writes.
The main union in the agency believes that up to 1,200 of its 1,800 staff
will go. A consultants' report by Stoy Hayward, the accountants, said last
year that it was 'unclear' whether contracting out would yield significant
savings or improve value for money.
A further report from Stoy Hayward is due in July on the cost of privatising
the work. The final decision on privatisation is expected to follow.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has asked Mr Peter
Joyce, chief executive of the Insolvency Service, to draw up contingency
plans to 'downsize' the agency. This will involve contracting out clerical
and administrative work, under measures in the de-regulation bill now before
parliament.
The Insolvency Service's main offices are in London, Croydon, Birmingham,
Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester.

FT  23 APR 94 / Bank lending surges ahead of expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong private-sector lending figures published yesterday provide evidence
that companies are beginning to take on more debt.
Bank of England data showed that lending by banks and building societies to
the private sector - M4 lending - was a seasonally adjusted Pounds 3.3bn
last month. This was well ahead of expectations of Pounds 1.5bn and compares
with a revised figure of Pounds 1.2bn in February.
This took the year-on-year growth rate of M4 lending, which is a good
indicator of consumer and company confidence, to 3.5 per cent from 3.0 per
cent in the year to February.
The broad money supply measure, M4, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 per cent
last month compared with the previous month, slightly below the growth rate
in February but in line with expectations. It was up 5.9 per cent in the
year to March, unchanged from February's rate.
Separate figures yesterday from the British Bankers' Association showed a
large increase in lending by the UK's main banks in March.
Lending by the nine banking groups - which covers only a proportion of the
overall M4 bank and building society sector - rose a seasonally adjusted
Pounds 3.05bn, the largest rise for four years, and compares with a rise of
Pounds 935m in February.
After substantial repayment of corporate debt in recent months, there were
signs of renewed borrowing by manufacturers. Banks lent Pounds 386m to
manufacturing industry in March after repayments of Pounds 890m in the
previous two months.
The construction sector, however, continued to repay debt and the demand for
consumer credit remained very weak.
The BBA's figures also showed that Pounds 1.86bn of the increase was due to
lending to the financial sector, in particular to building societies and
securities dealers.
'Although lending in March was strong, it followed two months of very modest
rises,' said Lord Inchyra, director-general of the BBA. 'Consequently, when
we look at the figures over the quarter as a whole, there is little
difference from the fourth quarter of last year.'
Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'A strong
lending number this month obviously adds weight to the evidence arguing
against interest rate cuts.
'But the extent to which this month's lending figure was due to finance
companies suggests that M4 lending will not remain at this relatively high
level.'
The BBA said that banks' mortgage lending seemed to be slowing down, but
that this possibly reflected some loss of market share rather than declining
activity in the housing market.
Analysts said that the weak personal borrowing figures, along with other
recent evidence of falling consumer confidence, contradicted buoyant
official retail sales data.

FT  23 APR 94 / Hangover after champagne and chips: Alan Cane and Stewart
Dalby discuss the factors behind Texas Instruments' pull-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Texas Instruments executives broke out the champagne in Bedford only last
month as they unveiled a superchip which they believed would give them a
lead in the race to supply components for the nascent multi-media
revolution.
Today there is only disappointment and sadness after Thursday's announcement
that the US company - which has been in Bedford for 38 years and is its
largest manufacturing employer - is pulling out with the eventual loss of
800 jobs. All that will remain in Bedford will be a low-technology power
transistor plant, employing some 200 people, which Texas hopes to sell
wholly or in part.
'The decision is devastating. Mention Bedford and Texas Instruments was the
company that came to mind,' said Mr Philip Hendry, Conservative leader of
Bedfordshire County Council, speaking for all shades of political opinion.
In spite of the undoubted quality of much of the work at Bedford, the
facility's fate was sealed by:
The age and inflexibility of the Manton Lane factory.
The unco-ordinated way the facility has developed - every kind of business
in which Texas is involved is represented, each with its own management
infrastructure. It has never been selected as a centre of excellence for a
main product line.
Investment decisions in the late 1980s when Italy triumphed over other
European countries as the site for the US company's principal European
semiconductor plant.
Texas Instruments is one of the world's oldest electronics companies
specialising in semiconductors, calculators, small computers and software.
But profitability in recent years has been depressed by the company's delay
in moving to more advanced methods of semiconductor production and by an
uneconomic European structure, with business units duplicated in each
country.
Bedford is the principal victim of the company's moves to rationalise its
European organisation. Mr Norman Neureiter, a senior Texas executive
seconded to Bedford to assist what the company describes as a 'phased
withdrawal over two years', said yesterday it was clear as early as 1980
that European operations would have to be restructured.
The company has followed a shared investment strategy, seeking government
grants and forming joint ventures where possible to help defray the huge
costs of keeping up to date with technology.
In the late 1980s, the company decided to concentrate production of
semiconductor memory, one of Texas's principal product lines, at Avezzano in
Italy. A factory has been built there at an eventual cost of Dollars 1.5bn,
of which the Italian government is contributing some Dollars 700m through
regional aid.
Simpler chips are manufactured in volume at Freising, Germany, while chips
for special applications in telecommunications, automobile and computer
markets are manufactured in Nice, France.
Texas's UK software business is located at Ashford, near London's Heathrow
airport where it employs some 300 software specialists.
Texas published its best quarterly results as it announced the withdrawal
from Bedford - evidence, Mr Neureiter said, that the company's shared
investment strategy and assault on costs was working.

FT  23 APR 94 / NatWest 'defrauded in sugar ship deal'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An Italian businessman defrauded the Leeds branch of National Westminster
Bank out of more than Pounds 1m in a complex international swindle spanning
three continents, Leeds Crown Court heard yesterday.
Mr Carlo Caresana, from Genoa, used a fake shipload of sugar to dupe the
bank into paying him Dollars 1.771m, said Mr Robert Smith QC, prosecuting.
The fraud was made possible by his intimate knowledge of shipping and
international trade and by taking advantage of banking procedures.
Mr Caresana denies charges of theft, obtaining property by deception,
procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception and four counts
of using a false instrument with intent. The alleged fraud took place in
1990 between March and June and involved companies in Brazil and Saudi
Arabia and banks in London, Leeds, Frankfurt and Prague.
Mr Caresana offered to supply sugar to a Saudi company. Having agreed terms
he found the name of a genuine ship taking sugar from Brazil to the Middle
East and pretended the consignment was coming with that ship, Mr Smith said.
He forged a complete set of shipping documents to support a letter of credit
to persuade NatWest to issue a bill of exchange, Mr Smith said.
The case, expected to last three months, continues.

FT  23 APR 94 / Warning over land price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sharply rising land prices caused by shortages of land where people most
want to live are inhibiting the housing market recovery and stoking
inflationary pressures in the economy, says a survey of more than 450
housebuilders.
The survey, published yesterday by the Housebuilders Federation, found that
more than a third of those questioned last month reported that land prices
had increased by more than 10 per cent since the beginning of this year.
Another 22 per cent reported increases of between 6 per cent and 10 per
cent. In all, three-quarters of builders said that land prices had increased
during the three months.
Mr John Stewart, editor of the federation's housing market report, said:
'The impact of land price increases, coupled with constraints on the supply
of land for housing, pose a threat to recovery and may well be the early
signs of another inflationary cycle in the housing market.'
The federation has blamed restrictive planning policies by central and local
government for creating a shortage of good sites, forcing up the price of
land as the housing market recovers.
Mr David Wilson, chairman of builders Wilson Bowden, said that land prices
nationally had risen by about a fifth and by up to half in parts of
south-east England. The federation's survey said more than 90 per cent of
builders in south-east England and 95 per cent in London had reported price
rises since the start of this year.
More than 80 per cent of builders nationally expect house prices to rise
over the next 12 months. More than half expect annual increases of under 5
per cent; more than a quarter forecast rises of between 5 per cent and 10
per cent. Just under three-quarters expect the number of homes sold to
increase this year.
Mr Stewart said: 'Recovery in the housing market has been sustained over the
first three months of this year. At this stage it appears April's tax
increases have had little effect on the market.'
Builders could face serious difficulties if land price rises continue to
outstrip growth in house prices. Halifax Building Society says the average
price of homes rose by 2.6 per cent to Pounds 63,122 during the 12 months to
the end of March.

FT  23 APR 94 / Societies hit by Pounds 653m saving outflow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The withdrawal of savings from building societies last month once again led
to a near-record net outflow in retail funds - with Pounds 653m taken from
societies.
At the same time, demand for mortgages rose sharply, providing further
evidence of recovery in the housing market, but highlighting the need for
societies to attract retail savings to fund lending.
Figures released by the Building Societies Association yesterday showed net
new commitments in March totalling Pounds 3.7bn, against Pounds 2.9bn the
previous month. Net advances were Pounds 960m against Pounds 652m in
February.
The fifth consecutive net monthly outflow was the highest since September
1986 when investors withdrew money for the TSB flotation.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association,
attributed the net outflows to a succession of one-off factors such as the
rush to pay fuel bills before the imposition of value added tax at the start
of this month.
More ominously for societies, there were signs of the continuing popularity
of other forms of savings which yield higher returns. Sales of unit trusts
are reported to have hit a record of more than Pounds 1bn.
Mr Coles said a similar outflow was unlikely in April, and emphasised that
interest automatically credited to accounts continued to increase balances
held by societies.
'Although societies remain mindful of the very competitive nature of the
savings market, there is no prospect of temporary pressures on retail
funding necessitating higher mortgage rates,' he said.
Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at stockbrokers UBS, argued that
such a move could not be discounted. He expected a net inflow of funds in
April, but if this failed to occur 'societies will have run out of one-off
excuses'.
Societies' increased lending was achieved partly at the expense of banks,
according to figures published by the British Bankers Association. Banks'
mortgage lending rose by Pounds 596m in March compared with Pounds 669m in
February.

FT  23 APR 94 / Palestine rivals agree to halt internecine war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The two main Palestinian militant factions in the Gaza Strip yesterday
agreed to end violent attacks on each other and to set up a committee to
resolve differences.
The unexpected co-operation deal between the Fatah Hawks, loyal to PLO
chairman Yassir Arafat, and the military wing of the Hamas Islamic extremist
movement, which has repeatedly condemned Israeli-PLO peace efforts, improves
Mr Arafat's chances of imposing his authority in the Gaza Strip when the
Israeli army pulls out - possibly next month.
If completed and adhered to, the agreement, and a similar one that may be
taking shape in the West Bank could simplify the task of the 9,000
Palestinian policemen who are supposed to take over responsibility for
internal security in the Gaza and Jericho areas when the Israelis leave.
The deal was negotiated in secret over the past few weeks, with a key role
being played by some of Mr Arafat's aides who were recently allowed by the
Israelis to return to Gaza after several years in exile.
It provides for an end to internecine violence, a commitment to
co-operation, and a one-month amnesty for Palestinians who collaborate with
the Israeli authorities to renounce such co-operation without fear of
revenge. Palestinian militants have killed hundreds of alleged collaborators
in more than six years of the Intifada (uprising).
PLO officials in Gaza said yesterday that the agreement had been reached
with the approval of top officials on both sides, presumably including Mr
Arafat.
Earlier this week, the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, acting on early
reports of the agreement, had issued a warning to Mr Arafat not to sanction
a deal whereby the PLO would turn a blind eye to continued Hamas attacks on
Israeli targets.
In the past three weeks, Hamas militants have killed 13 Israelis. One victim
of the last of these, Shahar Simani, a soldier, was buried yesterday. In
response, the Israeli army has rounded up more than 300 suspected Hamas
activists and supporters in the occupied territories, in an effort to
destroy the Hamas infrastructure.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
For nearly half a century since it was founded in 1945, Japan's socialist
party fought in opposition for policies which they considered crucial in
building their ideal of a better Japanese society.
But a brief eight months in power has forced the Social Democratic party of
Japan to write off, one by one, many of the principles for which it had so
resolutely stood all those years in opposition.
Yesterday's endorsement by the SDP of the government policy agreement was
just the latest humiliating climbdown for the party.
While the vague wording of the agreement leaves the socialists some room for
manoeuvre, there is no doubt in the public mind that the SDP has reneged on
many key election promises.
'It was a statement of complete surrender,' Mr Minoru Morita, a political
commentator, said of the final agreement on taxation and defence that were
wrenched from the party early yesterday. 'Have they lost all pride?' he
asked.
Having fought vigorously against the country's 3 per cent consumption tax
when it was introduced five years ago, the SDP has now agreed that indirect
taxes would eventually be raised.
The party's policy of strictly adhering to Japan's pacifist constitution has
been undermined by the agreement that in the face of North Korea's nuclear
threat, Japan would 'prepare contingency plans under close co-operation with
the United States, South Korea and, if necessary, other Asian countries.'
The latest turnround follows the SDP's capitulation last year on the opening
of Japan's rice market, a move the party had vigorously opposed.
The party's record of giving in to the right wing of the coalition gives
credence to the view that the SDP today is 'like the snow that clings to the
bottom of the clog. No matter what happens it will not let go,' as one SDP
diet member lamented.
The latest sacrifice of principle to pragmatism will have divisive
repercussions in the SDP which itself is a motley grouping of politicians
ranging from extreme left-wing to moderate liberal.
Already Ms Manae Kubota, head of the Economic Planning Agency and an SDP
member, has criticised yesterday's agreement and expressed concern that it
might 'have a bad effect on the economy.' She said that her party may have
'jumped the gun' by agreeing to the tax changes.
If such differences continue to surface within the party it could lead to a
split, with many socialists being drawn closer to the rest of the coalition
and the more hardline leftist members returning to opposition.

FT  23 APR 94 / Hata pledges rapid end to trade row: Coalition chooses new
leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tsutomu Hata, nominated by Japan's ruling coalition yesterday as its
candidate for prime minister, pledged to forge ahead with economic
deregulation and to resolve the trade dispute with the US.
Mr Hata, who admitted to trembling with apprehension on accepting his
selection, said Japan should settle the US trade row before the Group of
Seven summit of industrialised countries in July.
His government's first job was to get rapid agreement on the current year's
budget. It was to have come into effect on April 1 but has been delayed for
the past month by a parliamentary row over the personal finances of Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, who resigned as prime minister as a result, and then by
the power struggle which followed.
By June, Mr Hata aims to produce a package of market opening measures and
issue plans for a permanent reduction in income tax, keenly awaited by the
US, to be funded by a rise in indirect taxes.
In a meeting with Mr William Perry, the visiting US defence secretary, Mr
Hata, in his current capacity as foreign minister, confirmed that he would
work closely with Washington to keep up the pressure on North Korea to open
suspected nuclear weapons sites to international inspection.
Mr Hata's nomination was made possible by an early morning policy accord
between the main parties in the ruling coalition, in which the Social
Democratic party, the alliance's largest member, lifted objections to a rise
in indirect taxation and a firm line on North Korea. The compromise was met
with dismay by the SDP's left wing, suggesting that the new government could
be stormy, like the last one.
Japanese business organisations greeted the end of the leadership row with
relief, but gave Mr Hata a surprisingly lukewarm welcome, reflecting his
image as a competent operator seen as unlikely to break new ground.
The nomination was 'appropriate', said Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the
Keidanren business federation, who hoped Mr Hata would take a strong
initiative in completing political and economic reform. Mr Takeshi Nagano,
president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation, said Mr Hata was a
'natural' choice, as long as the coalition maintains its current framework.
Mr Hata is to be confirmed as Japan's new leader by parliamentary vote on
Monday, when he is assured of a comfortable majority over the main rival
candidate, Mr Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal Democratic
party.
Soon afterwards, Mr Hata aims to select the new cabinet, thought to be
similar to the present line-up, and make his first policy speech to
parliament the following day.
The struggle over the leadership and a joint policy platform has intensified
a split between the right and left wings of the coalition and provoked a
fresh round of defections from the LDP. However, Mr Hata maintained
yesterday that the debates had been 'meaningful' and helped clear the ground
for tax reform.

FT  23 APR 94 / South Africa 'holding 100' in pre-election crackdown
</HEADLINE>

More than 100 people are being held under a pre-election security crackdown,
some without access to lawyers or family, South African human rights
officials said yesterday.
Senior police and army officers, speaking at a press conference held under
the auspices of the country's Independent Electoral Commission, yesterday
outlined measures designed to ensure security during next week's election,
but declined to elaborate on pre-emptive arrests that have already taken
place.
'I don't think it is necessary that people should know (how many) at this
stage,' said one security force officer. 'But to put your mind at ease, it
is more than 10.'
Monitors and foreign observers say that more than 100 people have been
detained under South African security acts.
Mr Patrick Kelly, national director of the country's Human Rights
Commission, an independent South African organisation, said: 'We are
concerned about this increasing denial of human rights.'
Judge Johan Kriegler, chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission, who
took part in yesterday's press briefing, said he could provide no
information about the arrests.
The IEC is overseeing the electoral process and is responsible for
determining whether next week's poll is 'free and fair'.
Professor Jacob Ruiter, spokesman for the European Union monitors, said: 'I
have no comment. We are here only as observers.'
According to human rights monitors, at least 100 people are being held under
the Public Safety Act imposed on Natal and in several magisterial districts
around Johannesburg.
An additional unknown number of detainees are also being held under the
notorious Section 29 of the Internal Security Act.

FT  23 APR 94 / Indonesian workers turn on Chinese businessmen: Anger over
low wages has led to ethnic riots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET

<DATELINE>
   MEDAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesian soldiers with semi-automatic weapons stood guard over factories
outside the north Sumatran town of Medan yesterday following a week of wage
strikes and demonstrations which degenerated into rioting against the ethnic
Chinese minority.
The government has restored order to Indonesia's fourth largest industrial
centre by sending in troops, and by yesterday many factories and shops were
operating normally.
But evidence of the violence that has disrupted industry and worried both
Indonesian and foreign investors is visible on the busy road between Medan
and the port of Belawan. The windows of dozens of Chinese-owned shops and
factories have been smashed and boarded up. Government buildings were left
unscathed.
In the most serious incident, an ethnic Chinese factory-owner was killed by
the rioters last week.
The ethnic Chinese account for only about 3 per cent of Indonesia's 188m
people - although they are particularly numerous in Medan - but they
dominate industry and commerce and are often envied by their local
employees.
Among the many damaged buildings are a food factory, a bank and a small
photographic shop. 'We are still worried but we hope it's all over,' said
one ethnic Chinese woman at the counter of a motor-cycle repair shop. In the
violence about 150 shops and factories were reported damaged and several
cars were set on fire; lawyers say at least 47 people are being detained.
The dispute began when workers in Medan demonstrated in support of their
demands for steep pay rises. The legal minimum wage in the city is 3,100
rupiah (Dollars 1.45) a day but employers often pay below the minimum. Some
of the workers say they want Rp7,000.
A 25-year-old woman working as a cleaner in one of Medan's gleaming,
Chinese-owned shopping malls - which sell everything from jewellery to golf
clubs - said she was paid Rp2,400 per day, with no benefits and no paid
holiday, and would be content with the legal minimum; she asked to remain
anonymous.
Indonesia's influential armed forces have accused the independent Indonesian
Welfare Labour Union of fomenting violence and vandalism, linked it to the
banned communist movement and threatened to arrest its leaders; the rival,
government-backed All Indonesia Workers Union denounced the strikes.
The gap between rich and poor in Indonesia's fast-growing economy is one of
the most sensitive topics in the country's politics. Whereas many Medan
labourers live in shacks near the factories, the wealthier Chinese have
become more ostentatious in recent years, building large, neo-classical
houses and buying expensive cars.
Only days ago, a senior official of Indonesia's ruling Golkar party
criticised Mr Liem Sioe Liong, the ethnic Chinese tycoon who is close to
President Suharto, for spending Dollars 650,000 on a lavish party in
Singapore to celebrate his 50th wedding anniversary. The money would have
been better spent on the poor, he said.
The hard-working ethnic Chinese face a dilemma in Indonesia: if they invest
abroad - in China for example - they are accused of disloyalty to their
adopted home; but if they invest too much in Indonesia, they are accused of
seeking too large a share of domestic business at the expense of the locals.
As in other south-east Asian countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and the
Philippines, the ethnic Chinese businessmen of Indonesia have been vital
contributors to economic growth.
The Indonesian economy is growing at more than 6 per cent a year. Workers in
Medan know there are plenty of unemployed and underemployed Indonesians who
could take their jobs, but they have seen the new houses and shops springing
up in their town in the last few years and they want their share of
Indonesia's newfound wealth.
'The people above us have got richer,' said the shopping mall cleaner,
clutching a cheap plastic handbag. 'But where's the progress for labourers?'

FT  23 APR 94 / Victory for the coalition's pragmatists: There are plenty
more tremors to come in the continuing realignment of Japanese politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The storms of the past fortnight have blown fresh air into the fusty
backrooms of Japanese politics.
For the first time in many years, the Japanese electorate has been treated
to the sight of political leaders having a highly publicised debate on two
of the most fundamental matters for any nation state, tax and foreign
affairs.
'It has been truly healthy and refreshing. We do not often see much press
coverage given to policy cleavages. It has been educational for the public
and for politicians themselves,' says Mr Takashi Inoguchi, professor of
politics at Tokyo University.
This contrasts with the days of the Liberal Democratic party, which until it
was ousted last summer held power for 38 years, when ideological differences
were mostly suppressed to present a stable - but in the end fossilised -
public image.
An accord among senior coalition officials on policy matters came in the
early hours of yesterday thanks to a last-minute compromise by the Social
Democratic party on a proposed rise in indirect taxation. That brings an end
to the power struggle started by the resignation of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa as
prime minister and opens the way for Mr Tsutomu Hata, his deputy, to take
over after adoption by parliament on Monday.
The resurgence of policy debate in Japanese politics is all the more
striking because it appeared notably absent in the first moves of the
post-Hosokawa power struggle.
Initially, the coalition started to split roughly between the SDP-led left,
and the right led by Mr Ichiro Ozawa, backroom strategist of the influential
Japan Renewal party.
In the first week after Mr Hosokawa's resignation, each camp schemed to
attract defectors from the LDP, in the hope of forming the cores of rival
coalitions. It was, remarked some analysts, reminiscent of the old-style LDP
factional battles in which Mr Ozawa specialised in his years with that
party.
At one moment, it looked as if the right would succeed in a Machiavellian
ploy to woo Mr Michio Watanabe, a 70-year-old LDP faction leader, to bring
his supporters to the Ozawa camp, in return for the leadership. In the
event, Mr Watanabe failed to attract anything like enough defectors to
guarantee a majority for the Ozawa camp.
Mr Watanabe's fading chances proved to both halves of the coalition that
neither of them could win enough seats in parliament to dominate the other.
Pragmatically, they gave up trying to outmanoeuvre each other and instead
settled down last weekend to discuss how to work together again, with a
JRP-inspired joint policy platform.
Both Mr Ozawa and Mr Hata felt that this kind of advance accord was needed
to defuse the rows which paralysed the Hosokawa administration. The SDP,
however, faced an unwelcome proposition. It had to accept the JRP-led right
wing's foreign and tax policy to stay in power, at the risk of offending its
already dwindling electorate. That meant being drawn into the centre-right,
so abandoning party tradition.
It is no surprise that it took 27 coalition meetings in the past 15 days to
persuade the socialists to accept terms. Mr Ozawa was in a tough mood,
hoping to provoke splits among LDP and socialist members all the way along
the line, recalls one coalition official.
To make it harder, coalition members were breaking new ground. Very few
Japanese governments have ever attempted to hammer out a common policy
before taking office, preferring instead to make policy case by case, says
Mr Jesper Koll, chief economist at SG Warburg Securities in Toyko.
The nearest recent precedent is the policy pact struck last July by the
members of the Hosokawa coalition, before taking office. Yet that was vague
by comparison with yesterday's accords.
In theory, this painstakingly constructed policy accord should make Mr
Hata's government more stable than Mr Hosokawa's, even though the new
cabinet line-ups will be similar to the fractious old one.
'This is a victory for the pragmatists in the coalition ..So Mr Hata may
surprise us with a more efficient government, that wants to promote change
and still co-operate with the bureaucracy,' says Mr Koll.
Yet in practice, this change of government is only a step in the continuing
realignment of Japanese politics, caused by the gradual break-up of the
traditional parties of government and opposition, the LDP and SDP. The
general trend appears to be towards the formation of two or three loose
groupings, the coalition's left and right plus the LDP, but not all the
players have yet decided which of the new-look teams they want to join.
The SDP may soon split as a result of its leaders' decision to cave in to Mr
Ozawa's forces. The opportunity for the extreme left, up to a fifth of its
members of parliament, to leave could be the cabinet decision on a permanent
cut in income tax and a rise in indirect taxation, required in June, in time
for the Group of Seven summit in Naples, the following month. 'The tax issue
is not resolved. It's simply consensus by ambiguity,' says Mr Inoguchi.
The LDP, by contrast, appears to be eroding rather than breaking up, now
that Mr Watanabe has returned to the fold. Nevertheless, the post-Hosokawa
storm has flushed out 13 defectors, 12 of whom have formed two small
pro-coalition parties.
As a result, a record 11 parties are now represented in parliament, most of
them too small to hold the balance of power. Japan's unstable political
landscape can expect plenty more tremors before it settles into a more
permanent shape.

FT  23 APR 94 / Galapagos forest fires threaten giant tortoises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An eleven-day-old forest fire on the Galapagos Islands has destroyed 6,000
hectares of the area's unique eco-system and is now threatening hundreds of
the giant Galapagos tortoises.
Adverse climatic conditions on the island of Isabela are impeding efforts by
poorly equipped fire fighters, while heavy machinery is having difficulty in
the rough volcanic terrain.
In addition, efforts at isolating the fire by cutting trails through the
brush are failing due to highly combustible vegetation that is carried by
the wind. Experts say a vast network of roots allowed the fire to spread
beneath the trails.
President Sixto Duran Ballen declared a state of emergency over Isabela
island, the largest and most populated in the archipelago, which was
declared world natural patrimony by Unesco. He called on the international
community to support the fire fighting efforts with specialised equipment
and technical advisers.
Though experts from the US and Canada have already arrived, the urgently
needed hydroplanes won't be sent by their respective governments until the
team of forestry technicians presents its report in a few days.
Meanwhile, rescue workers are preparing to evacuate hundreds of giant
tortoises, each of which can weigh up to 350 pounds. If the tortoises are
not evacuated on time, experts say, one of the various breeds inhabitating
the islands could become extinct.
Mr Alfredo Carrasco, secretary general of the Charles Darwin Foundation,
discarded volcanic activity as the likely cause of the fire, and suggested
that hunters may not have properly extinguished a campfire.

FT  23 APR 94 / China's MFN status under renewed threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A consensus has begun to emerge in Congress and in the Clinton
Administration that the president will be forced to revoke China's Most
Favoured Nation trade status unless Beijing makes further attempts to
improve human rights.
With six weeks left before President Clinton must make that determination,
House and Senate leaders this week were summoned to the White House to give
advice. Senator George Mitchell, majority leader and a longtime advocate of
the MFN/human rights linkage, said there had not yet been sufficient moves
by Beijing.
Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the international trade subcommittee, has
been trying to forge a consensus in favour of delinking trade and human
rights, but even he said the president would be unable to avoid revoking
China's MFN, if it refuses to take modest steps.
These include: grants of medical parole for political prisoners with serious
health problems; clearing up remaining cases of Chinese citizens denied the
right of emigration; make progress towards a pact to give the International
Red Cross access to Chinese prisons; enforce the bilateral agreement
prohibiting exports of goods produced with forced labour; and end jamming of
Voice of America.
Fearing even these moves will not be met, some Democrats are searching for
tools other than MFN to display their displeasure. One possibility,
mentioned by Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi of California, is a partial
revocation, affecting goods from the state sector. Republicans, however,
might insist the president lacks the statutory authority to lower some
tariffs but not others. Even if Congress would agree, determining the source
of many products come could become a bureaucratic nightmare.
There is talk too of renewing MFN but at the same time targeting China for
Super 301 action, when the president lists the nations with the most
egregious trade barriers in October.
Beijing still has shown no sign of co-operation. Ms Wu Yi, Chinese trade
minister who has been travelling around the country making deals, has been
delivering a tough message. 'China is not so frightened of revocation of
MFN. China's sky will not collapse,' she said.
In Los Angeles last week, US companies signed 11 contracts for Chinese
projects worth Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 870m) and another 134 letters of intent
worth billions more. Ms Wu said a MFN withdrawal would cost the US 300,000
jobs and the 'huge potential loss of the Chinese market.'

Private aid agencies reacted bitterly yesterday to a decision to slash the

an enormous scale,' AP reports from Nairobi.
'We are appalled at the hypocrisy of the international community,' said Abiy
Hailu of Christian Aid, a London-based charity.
The UN Security Council, powerless to stop tribal warfare in the country,
decided on Thursday to reduce the peacekeeping force in the capital, Kigali,
to 270 security guards and military observers.

<TEXT>
The introduction of fair labour standards into future international trade
agreements should be based on the fundamental principles of the
International Labour Organisation.
This was the main message from the ILO's director general, Mr Michel
Hansenne, in a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the ILO's
Declaration of Philadephia which set out the principles of the organisation.
He called for a 'multilateral approach' by governments, employers and
workers 'to improve respect for workers' rights and promote social progress
everywhere.'
Mr Hansenne said it would be 'tragic if the debate over social clauses in
trade agreements should degenerate into acrimonious allegations of social
dumping from one side and disguised protectionism from the other.' He added
that many countries had already adopted ILO human rights conventions.

FT  23 APR 94 / Rwanda peace talks offer a ray of hope: George Graham cites
the example of Uganda's successful demobilisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In bloodied and war-torn Rwanda, a down-payment of Dollars 30m (Pounds 20m)
that offered a chance of some demilitarisation, and at least a hope of
heading off the last month's descent into chaos, seems like the most
tantalising of missed bargains.
But with peace talks now scheduled again for today there may, perhaps, be a
second chance for a programme prepared by the World Bank and United Nations
agencies to demobilise soldiers from both sides of the Rwandan conflict and
return them to civilian life.
'The World Bank and its partners were that far away from preventing all that
has happened from happening,' says Mr Nat Colletta, a social scientist in
the World Bank's poverty and human resources division who designed the
programme.
If the claim seems ambitious when set against Rwanda's implacable ethnic
conflicts, it must be measured against the success already achieved with a
similar programme in Uganda - a country also no stranger to strife.
At a cost of Dollars 24m, the Bank provided cash payments of just over
Dollars 700 a person to resettle some 23,000 discharged soldiers, along with
about 50,000 dependents, from Uganda's National Resistance Army.
Although the payments were unusual for the Bank, they fitted into the desire
of the international financial institutions to reduce the developing
countries' level of military spending, which in Uganda's case amounted to 38
per cent of total government spending.
While Bank byelaws prevent it from getting involved directly with the army,
it was able to step in at the point of discharge with assistance to the
demobilised soldiers.
While some officials argued within the Bank against singling out veterans to
benefit from the payments, the programme's designers were able to argue
successfully that the former soldiers and their dependants were, in fact, a
vulnerable population group suffering from the effects of economic
transition.
The programme provided for veterans to be transported back to their home
districts, with some supervision from district veterans officers and the
provision of social services, including medical care.
More than two thirds of the demobilised soldiers chose to go back to farming
 -relatively feasible in land-rich Uganda - and the programme is so far
showing considerable success.
Mr Colletta notes that only 50 cases of crime have been reported among
discharged soldiers, far less than the overall crime rate in Uganda.
Rwanda, however, presents much more intractable problems - beginning with
the political will necessary to implement a demobilisation programme.
In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Movement was the
clear victor after years of conflict, and expressly asked the World Bank for
help with demobilisation.
In Rwanda, by contrast, rival factions are still vying for power; at the
same time as the Bank was negotiating with the finance ministry on the
demobilisation of the army, Rwanda's president was arming the youth militia.
Even if the will were there, the implementation of an accord would be more
difficult in Rwanda, which has the highest density of population in
sub-Saharan Africa.
A return of soldiers to farming would have been difficult, so the Bank was
seeking to design a largely urban resettlement programme.
In addition, local administrative structures are far more deficient than in
Uganda, so the programme would have had to depend much more on
non-governmental organisations for implementation and supervision.
Nevertheless, Mr Colletta believes the potential is there for imaginatively
designed transitional programmes to lessen the tinder that sparks so easily
into conflict.
'We overestimate how much it would take to get these soldiers to put down
their arms. We also underestimate how bloody tired some of these soldiers
are of fighting,' he concludes.

FT  23 APR 94 / Canada farm exports at risk
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration yesterday stepped up its war of words with Canada
over bilateral farm trade by outlining proposed curbs on Canadian wheat,
flour and barley under Article 28 of Gatt.
But the measures will not take effect for 90 days, leaving the door open for
further talks to resolve the disputes.
Article 28 allows a country to impose new trade restrictions in cases where
existing duties are considered too low to provide adequate protection for
domestic producers.
But it also permits the target country to seek compensation through tariff
increases of its own.
Canada has threatened to retaliate against a range of US products, including
chicken, wine, Bourbon whiskey, canned fruit and mushrooms. US agriculture
secretary Mike Espy said that if the negotiations with Canada fail, a quota
will be imposed on Canadian imports from July 1. Imports above the quote
will be subject to punitive tariffs. The quotas will be subject to
negotiation.
The immediate cause of the friction is a surge in Canadian exports of durum
wheat, used mainly for pasta, which US farmers claim is disrupting their
domestic price-support programmes. But the Clinton administration has also
linked the grain dispute to complaints about Canada's supply-management
system, which protects poultry, egg and dairy producers from foreign
competition.

FT  23 APR 94 / US seeks tougher Haiti sanctions: White House succumbs to
pressure on refugee repatriation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The US administration yesterday shifted its policy towards Haiti, succumbing
to a barrage of criticism from Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the country's
exiled president, as well as from members of Congress and human rights
activists.
The White House said the US would press for tighter trade sanctions against
the military regime which ousted Mr Aristide in 1991, including a United
Nations embargo on everything except food and humanitarian aid. Although
sanctions have been imposed by the UN on fuel and arms, many countries,
including the US, continue to trade with Haiti.
At the same time the US Coast Guard took a boatload of 411 Haitian refugees
it had picked up from a sinking vessel in the Caribbean to Miami, in an
apparent reversal of the US policy of returning them to their country - a
practice which President Bill Clinton condemned during the 1992 presidential
election but which he continued once he took office.
Coast Guard officers said the order came from Washington, but White House
officials said that the decision was a special case, because the sinking
Haitian boat was so close to the US shore.
Criticism of Mr Clinton's policy towards Haiti has reached a new intensity
this week.
Mr Aristide himself denounced the US's approach as 'a cynical joke,'
complaining that Mr Clinton lacked the political will to carry out half of
what he promised.
Meanwhile, six members of Congress from Mr Clinton's own Democratic party,
including Congressman Kweisi Mfume, chairman of the congressional black
caucus, and Congressman Ron Dellums, chairman of the House of
Representatives armed services committee, were arrested after a sit-in in
front of the White House.
Other senior Democrats such as Congressman David Obey, chairman of the House
appropriations committee, have said they see little alternative to invasion
as a way of bringing Haiti back from chaos.
Although many senior administration officials are frustrated at the
difficulties of dealing with Mr Aristide, who is understandably nervous
about returning to Haiti, they acknowledge that they have no choice.
'He's the duly elected president of the country and we'll continue to work
with him,' said Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary.

<TEXT>
The introduction of fair labour standards into future international trade
agreements should be based on the fundamental principles of the
International Labour Organisation.
This was the main message from the ILO's director general, Mr Michel
Hansenne, in a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the ILO's
Declaration of Philadephia which set out the principles of the organisation.
He called for a 'multilateral approach' by governments, employers and
workers 'to improve respect for workers' rights and promote social progress
everywhere.'
Mr Hansenne said it would be 'tragic if the debate over social clauses in
trade agreements should degenerate into acrimonious allegations of social
dumping from one side and disguised protectionism from the other.'
He added that many countries had already adopted ILO human rights
conventions on freedom of association, the right of workers to organise and
to bargain collectively and the prohibition of slave labour.
'All countries, regardless of their level of development have the capacity
to observe these principles if they have the political will to do so,' he
added. Although the ILO is 'not a trade organisation and has no mandate to
regulate trade,' he said the ILO would co-operate with the new World Trade
Organisation or other bodies in preparing a social clause linked to trade.

The Caribbean Community (Caricom) and its two largest members have asked to
be listed as eligible for membership of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, while they continue seeking arrangements for special access which
will protect their US and Canadian markets against competition from Mexico
exports, writes Canute James in Kingston.
Caribbean trade officials have said, however, that it is unlikely that the
three Nafta signatories will show any early interest in Caricom's desire,
and that of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, to be considered a part of the
free trade area. More immediate attention will be on the larger markets in
Latin America, the trade officials said.
Trinidad and Tobago has already satisfied some conditions for Nafta entry,
having already implemented wide economic reforms, said Mr Ken Valley, the
country's trade and industry minister.

FT  23 APR 94 / City where the dead are lucky: UN aid group describes the
'living hell' of Gorazde

<TEXT>
Even as Nato diplomats in Brussels mapped out plans to step up the use of
air power over Gorazde, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
said its premises in the city was coming under artillery fire.
To judge from the picture painted by UNHCR, the 'living hell' of Gorazde
amounted to the greatest concentration of civilian suffering in a single
space seen during two years of war in Bosnia.
UNHCR volunteers in the enclave said they had lost contact with the town
hospital, where about 30 people have been killed and all surgical equipment
destroyed in artillery attacks by Serb forces, who say the building is being
used for military purposes.
The building was shrouded in smoke and the upper storeys largely ruined, but
people were still sheltering in the basement, according to UNHCR officials.
In the latest attacks, the UNHCR building took several hits from shells, and
three people were killed by a shell that landed nearby.
At least 97 people were killed on Thursday - the highest casualty figure for
a single day - bringing the known casualties in this month's battle for
Gorazde to 535 dead and 1,740 injured, according to a UNHCR statement.
In an unusual move, the UN agency made public the full text of a message
received yesterday morning from an Irish doctor in the town, Dr Mary
McLaughlin. It reads in part: 'Greetings from a city where only the dead are
lucky. The last two days have been a living hell. . . Both residents and
refugees are crowded into crumbling buildings waiting for the next shell.
When it hits, many are killed as there are such crowds in each building.
'The wounded lie for hours in the debris as it is suicidal to try to bring
them to the hospital. One UNHCR local worker said he could hear the cries of
the wounded in the houses in his journey to our cellar yesterday. (In the
hospital) shells batter down the walls and machine gun fire rakes the wards.
. . The Serb excuse for targeting it is that it is a military institution.
I've been in all parts of the hospital 100 times in the last month and can
assure the outside world that it's a lie.
'The dead are hastily buried at night by covering them with a thin layer of
sand. If it ever gets hot here, there will be epidemics. . . '
A convoy of 147 UN soldiers and medical personnel destined for Gorazde was
ordered to remain in Rogatica, a Serb-held town nearby, after Serb women
blocked its route.

The French economy contracted by 1 per cent in 1993, indicating the

had put the contraction of gross domestic product at 0.7 per cent. Officials
at the French Economics Ministry, however, said there was no need to adjust
forecasts of 1.4 per cent growth this year and claimed that economic
activity in the first quarter had been stronger than expected. Exports have
remained buoyant and consumer demand had strengthened over the past few
months, they said.

Mr Lee Hoi-chang, South Korean prime minister, resigned yesterday and was
immediately replaced by his deputy, Mr Lee Yung-dug. The unexpected
resignation revealed a rift in the leadership of South Korea's civilian
government, currently under pressure from the row with communist North Korea
over Pyongyang's alleged development of nuclear arms. The outgoing Mr Lee,
who took office last December, caused a political stir on Thursday when he
said he wanted to increase his control over state affairs. News reports said
Mr Lee had been at odds with some of his cabinet members over national
policies. He is the second prime minister to resign since Mr Kim Young-sam
came to power in February 1993 as the first civilian president in more than
three decades of military-dominated politics.

<TEXT>
European Union industry ministers agreed yesterday to prolong the EU's steel
rescue plan if the industry could come up with 19m tonnes of capacity cuts,
Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said. But questions remained
about whether an Italian aid proposal to help a group of plants in the
Brescia region shut down 5m tonnes of capacity complied with EU subsidy
rules. Mr Van Miert said he assured ministers the Commission would monitor
the aid strictly. The ministers will discuss the industry's restructuring
efforts again in either June or September. The European Commission worked
out a deal with steel companies last month to give them until next autumn to
make capacity cuts and qualify for a rescue plan involving financial aid to
cover some 50,000 job losses. The plan also includes import restrictions on
steel from the former Czechoslovakia and loans to finance closures. Mr Van
Miert said ministers discussed complaints that Germany's Saarstahl steel
plant was still producing steel, despite declaring bankruptcy.

Ireland has moved a step closer to abandoning its traditional policy of
military neutrality by announcing that it is prepared to consider sending
troops to help UN efforts in eastern Bosnia. Mr Dick Spring, foreign
minister, told reporters yesterday that the Irish government was prepared
'to consider any request' from the UN for the sending of troops to Bosnia.
Last year Dublin was a leading proponent of 'safe areas' for isolated Moslem
pockets in Bosnia. Ireland has no troops at present in the former
Yugoslavia, but it has more than 1,000 of its 12,000-strong defence forces
serving overseas on UN peacekeeping missions, most of them in southern
Lebanon. In a significant departure from traditional policy, a decision was
taken last year to send Irish troops in logistical operations under UN
command to Somalia on a 'peace-enforcement' - as opposed to a 'peacekeeping'
 -mission.

Ukraine is refusing to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Mr Valery
Shmarov, deputy prime minister, told a meeting of the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna yesterday. Dismissing suggestions by the
agency and western governments that the plant was unsafe, Mr Shmarov
insisted Ukraine would keep the plant going even after five other nuclear
reactors now under construction were commissioned.
Ukrainian officials say their country cannot afford to buy oil, gas or coal,
and that 15 per cent of the government's annual budget has gone towards
cleaning up the contamination from Chernobyl since the 1986 accident, when
one of its reactors exploded and released a cloud of radioactive dust into
the atmosphere and Europe. Officials discussed the findings of an IAEA
team's inspection of Chernobyl at the beginning of March during which
several safety deficiencies were detected at the plant's two reactors, both
of which were due to be decommissioned this year.
Ukraine's hard line at the two-day meeting called by the IAEA to try to find
a solution to the Chernobyl problem effectively leaves western governments
without an alternative. The plan had been to offer western help in
completing other reactors in exchange for closing down Chernobyl.

FT  23 APR 94 / Battle begins for the Other Europe: Eurosceptics aim to
infiltrate the Strasbourg parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
They met in the Salon de la Paix, in a sumptuous Parisian hotel, but they
came to do battle, writes John Ridding in Paris.
Their enemy is the Europe of Maastricht, and their cause is the Europe of
Nations, a political movement formed to fight in June's European elections.
They are a surprising mixture of bedfellows. Sir James Goldsmith - Jimmy to
his French friends - is at the heart of the struggle. Having discarded dawn
raids for environmental concerns, the former international financier is to
stand as a candidate on the list put forward by L'Autre Europe, a French
party formed to campaign in the European Parliament elections.
Sir James is second on the Other Europe's list for France's European polls.
Above him is the founder of the party, Mr Philippe de Villiers - a viscount,
a member of parliament and the suave French champion of the anti-Maastricht
cause. Number three is Mr Charles de Gaulle, grandson of the general, and an
existing member of the European Parliament. 'My grandfather would never have
stood for Maastricht,' he says. 'He would have fought to prevent the
disappearance of France.'
Seated around them yesterday were Eurosceptics from 10 European countries;
Mr Bill Cash, the Tory MP, and Lord Stoddart the Labour peer, rubbed
shoulders with Maastricht dissidents of the left and right of the political
spectrum from Scandinavia, Austria, Germany and Spain.
To launch their movement the representatives put their name to the
Declaration of Paris - a tract condemning what the signatories see as a
dangerous trend to centralisation. Their aim is to infiltrate the European
Parliament in Strasbourg, undermine the Maastricht treaty, and prevent the
'asphyxiation of Europe'.
'This debate transcends left and right,' declares Sir James. 'It is about
the fight against a federal Europe and building a proper, democratic Europe.
History shows that excesses of the centralisation of power unleash a
reaction of centrifugal forces.'
But are Sir James and his allies not tilting at windmills? Has the principle
of subsidiarity not pulled the rug from beneath their nationalist feet?
'Subsidiarity has been so abused that it has become deeply polluted as an
ideal. It should not be about determining the size and shape of cucumbers,'
he replies. As for the windmills: 'Whether it is quixotic or not, I won't
change one word of what I believe.'
Despite being dismissed in France by the ruling RPR-UDF coalition and the
opposition Socialist party, Sir James and Mr de Villiers are confident of
support.
Sir James says an audience of 1,200 showed up at Angers to hear the views of
L'Autre Europe; 2,000 came to Nantes.
'We will win a substantial vote,' says Mr de Villiers. How substantial, he
is reluctant to predict.
'It is at the end of the fair that one counts the cowpats,' he says, citing
a rural French proverb.

FT  23 APR 94 / Swiss clean up rules on dirty money: Complacency has given
way to concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Switzerland's private bankers have long tended to have a smug attitude to
questions about accepting dirty money.
'We have always been extremely careful about who we will accept,' one Geneva
banker said recently. They say that even in the bad old days, when the
famous anonymous numbered accounts were permitted, they always checked their
clients' credentials thoroughly.
These claims ring rather hollow in the light of the latest case of dirty
money - a Dollars 150m (Pounds 102.7m) account at Union Bank of Switzerland
in Zurich held openly in the name of Mrs Sheila Miriam Arana de Nasser, wife
and partner of a suspected big-league Colombian drug dealer.
Swiss bankers now admit lamely that their screening of clients was perhaps
not quite as rigorous in the 1970s - when this particular account was opened
 -and before as it is today. 'We were not as sensitive to money laundering
then,' Mr Stephan Haeringer, a UBS director, conceded last week.
But bankers were surprised that UBS was the one caught out. Switzerland's
largest bank is renowned for its careful scrutiny of potential customers. In
the late 1980s, for example, UBS alone among the three large Swiss universal
banks managed to steer clear of Robert Maxwell, Polly Peck, Olympia &amp; York,
Omni and other big corporate groups that subsequently collapsed. It was also
the first Swiss bank to refer the deposits of foreign politicians to the
executive board.
The problem, Swiss bankers say, is one of Altlasten, a German word
describing old deposits of toxic waste. All the well-established banks have
accounts like that of Mrs Arana that were opened years before screening was
tightened. And like concentrations of toxic waste, these accounts can
explode at any time without warning.
The Swiss Federal Banking Commission's 1992 guidelines to bankers provide no
fewer than 30 pointers to help them detect whether or not money is being
laundered. But all of them have to do with transactions - withdrawals,
purchase of drafts, transfers or excessive cash movements.
If, as in the Arana case, the account lies virtually dormant for several
years, it is more difficult for the bank's internal auditors to detect a
problem.
The commission acknowledged the difficulty, saying that 'it is not the
banks' responsibility to investigate systematically all customer
transactions for a possible connection to criminal activities'.
That said, UBS's local competitors still have trouble understanding this
case. They say that now banks have put customer accounts on computer files,
it is not difficult to isolate all the Altlasten from, say, Colombia or
Sicily for a special audit. Also, bankers say they now scan the newspapers
for scandals and criminal activities out of fear that some of those involved
are among their clients.
But the prevailing view among Swiss bankers remains rather fatalistic - that
a banking centre like Switzerland which specialises in attracting investment
funds from rich individuals will inevitably also attract criminals.
'They have to place their money somewhere and they prefer to do it in the
biggest and most efficient financial centres,' a Swiss Bankers' Association
spokesman stressed.
The Swiss doubt that they need further legislation to combat criminal money.
In the past four years they have put in place what they believe is one of
the best prevention and prosecution systems in the world.
Money laundering has become a criminal offence, which allows the Swiss
police to co-operate fully with their foreign counterparts.
Bankers are obliged to know the real owners of all their accounts and are
forbidden from accepting criminal money. Acceptance of such money through
negligence is also punishable.
Later this year two additional legal reforms will complete the package, one
permitting bankers to denounce suspected criminal clients to the police and
the other making membership in a criminal organisation a criminal offence.
This will enable the Swiss authorities to co-operate with Italy in Mafia
investigations.
The one consolation arising from the latest case is that it showed that the
Swiss, who often turned a blind eye to financial crime in the past, are now
willing to move quickly when suspicions are raised.
Once the facts were known, the authorities froze the bank account and
arrested Mrs Arana at her home near Geneva.
The Banking Commission and the Bankers' Association have already launched
investigations of UBS's conduct, and the bank has suspended a vice-president
responsible for the account.
The Swiss, at least, believe that the message to both banks and money
launderers is clear.

FT  23 APR 94 / Spain cuts benchmark rate: Economic Watch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of Spain yesterday cut its benchmark interest rate to 7.75 per
cent, from 8 per cent, at its regular seven-to-thirteen day repurchase
tender. The central bank satisfied 93 per cent of the Pta4,590bn (Pounds
22.7bn) in bids, allocating Pta4,280bn. The tender coincided with the expiry
of Pta3,020bn in repurchase agreements, and represents a net injection of
about Pta1,260bn in liquidity. Spain's Bankinter followed the central bank
announcement by trimming its prime lending rate to 7.75 per cent. Analysts
said the recent strength of the peseta against the German mark and the US
dollar, together with the absence of fresh inflationary pressures, allowed
room for the third reduction in two months. AP, Madrid
Italy's retail sales index rose 5.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1993
from a year earlier, the state statistical institute, Istat, said yesterday.
Italian industrial output climbed 0.7 per cent for the first two months of
1994 compared with the same period in 1993.

<TEXT>
Australian politicians yesterday rushed to rebuff comments made by Mr Conrad
Black, the Canadian newspaper publisher, to a Senate committee which is
looking into foreign ownership of the Australian print media. Mr Bob Hawke,
the former Australian prime minister, told the inquiry that claims by Mr
Black that he (Mr Hawke) had offered to report on the activities of his
successor, Mr Paul Keating, were a 'total, grotesque misrepresentation'. Mr
Hawke said that a senior executive in Mr Black's newspaper empire had asked
whether Mr Hawke would be interested in keeping the company informed about
happenings in Australian politics. The executive had never pursued the
offer, Mr Hawke said. His account contrasted sharply with Mr Black's, who
told the inquiry on Thursday that Mr Hawke had offered to act as his 'eyes
and ears' in Canberra, in return for a fee.

FT  23 APR 94 / Bid for C&amp;G sharpens banks' interest in building societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's big high street banks said yesterday said that Lloyds' Pounds
1.8bn cash bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society had sharpened
their interest in taking over societies in order to win more of the
mortgages market.
Both Abbey National and TSB Group said they would like to acquire societies.
Other banks are watching to see if the High Court allows Lloyds to pay cash
to C&amp;G savers and borrowers.
Lloyds' agreed bid for C&amp;G, the sixth largest UK society with assets of
Pounds 17.7bn, was announced on Thursday and could lead to intensified
competition in the mortgage market as well as a restructuring of financial
services. BAT Industries, which owns insurers Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star,
is understood to have been the most serious contender for C&amp;G, apart from
Lloyds.
Mr Peter Ellwood, TSB chief executive, said his bank, which advanced Pounds
1bn in mortgage lending last year, would be interested in acquiring a
building society provided it fitted properly with the bank's branch
structure.
Mr Ellwood said he believed that Lloyds' bid, under which C&amp;G's 1.4m members
would receive payments of between Pounds 500 and Pounds 10,000 each, would
'trigger more changes in the industry' which would improve products sold to
UK mortgage customers.
Mr Charles Toner, managing director of Abbey National's retail division,
said the bank had made clear for some time that it was interested in buying
a society if the potential barriers to an acquisition were cleared.
'We would be interested in watching how it develops. There is more than a
year to go, and it could face a few hiccups on the way,' said Mr Toner.
The legality of Lloyds' offer will be tested in the High Court next month.
If the offer is cleared, C&amp;G members will be able to decide in November if
they want to accept. Cash payments would be made in the second quarter of
1995.
The declarations came as figures were published showing further evidence of
recovery in the housing market. Net loans to customers by building societies
returned to the levels of last summer at Pounds 960m for the month of March.
Societies' net new commitments to lend reached Pounds 3.7bn in March, the
highest level since October 1991. But for the fifth month running, societies
suffered a net outflow of personal savings as investors withdrew deposits.
The increasing difficulty societies have faced in attracting retail funds
from savers is one reason why they have lobbied for an increase in the legal
limit on the amounts they can raise in wholesale funds. As part of the
resulting government review, Treasury ministers and senior officials are
supporting proposals to transfer supervision of big building societies to
the Bank of England.

FT  23 APR 94 / Sex complaint forces resignations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three male foreign-exchange dealers have resigned from the London branch of
Goldman Sachs, the blue-chip US investment bank, following complaints of
sexual harassment by a female colleague.
Sources at the bank said the dealers were asked to leave after their
secretary complained to a superior that they had made distasteful
suggestions when she had asked their advice on how to go about getting a
promotion.
A spokesman for the bank declined to comment on the circumstances of the
men's departure but said the bank had a strict policy on conduct which it
expected its employees to follow.
Individuals who were repeatedly seen to breach this code would be asked to
do 'the appropriate thing', he said.
The high proportion of men on trading floors has tended to expose women,
especially support staff, to sexual discrimination and harassment in the
past. However, Goldman's action reflects a growing intolerance among senior
management towards this kind of behaviour.
In line with US working practices, many banks in the City regularly remind
staff that sexual harassment will not be tolerated. Some firms even go so
far as to give examples of what constitutes sexual harassment, such as
remarks like 'Oh honey, you look nice today'.
Some have also set up telephone hotlines so that employees can anonymously
register their complaints, which will then be investigated.
In spite of this progress, women working in the City say the 'glass ceiling'
impeding their promotion still exists.

FT  23 APR 94 / Tough approach by Offer could cut power prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Domestic electricity prices could rise by significantly less than feared
next year following indications by Offer, the industry regulator, that it
will take a tough approach in reviewing the regional power companies' highly
profitable distribution businesses.
Some regional electricity companies said privately last night they would
consider calling in the Monopolies and Mergers Commission if Professor
Stephen Littlechild, Offer director-general, sticks to the policies he has
indicated he favours in a confidential letter to them.
Analysts say his policies could lead to prices, excluding tax, falling by up
to 7 per cent from next April. This would go a considerable way towards
alleviating the 9.5 per cent rise which will result from the increase in the
rate of value added tax, scheduled to rise from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent
at the same time.
Further price falls are likely. Prof Littlechild indicated that he expects
distribution prices, which account for about a quarter of the final cost of
electricity, to rise by 3 to 4 percentage points below the rate of inflation
in future.
Securities houses warned that if Prof Littlechild does not compromise, the
companies could suffer a fall in earnings per share of up to 30 per cent in
the year from next April, when the price controls are due to take effect.
Shares in the regional electricity companies fell sharply yesterday after
details of Prof Littlechild's letter leaked out. East Midlands Electricity,
based in Nottingham, fell 27p to 571p, Bristol-based Sweb declined 23p to
595p and Yorkshire Electricity fell 22p to 587p.
Several electricity company chief executives said Prof Littlechild's letter
was merely an opening shot. 'It is not that much worse than we expected,'
said one. 'He is bound to be open to compromise.'
However, recent criticism of the regulatory system will encourage Prof
Littlechild to adopt a settlement that will be seen as harsh on the
companies.
Negotiations on the distribution price review, promised by the government
when the industry was privatised four years ago, have already been under way
for several months, and are due for completion in July. Companies could
challenge the outcome at the MMC before next April.
In his letter, Prof Littlechild has suggested an appropriate rate of return
on assets should be about 6 per cent. The companies' main concern is his
suggestion that the assets could be calculated on market capitalisation
shortly after privatisation, not on the cost of replacing current assets.
Prof Littlechild indicated he will change the way prices are regulated.
Existing controls relate maximum allowed revenue to volumes of power sold.
Prof Littlechild has suggested that the revised formula should also be
influenced by customer numbers and a fixed cost element.

FT  23 APR 94 / Nato air strike ultimatum to Serbs: Gorazde ceasefire agreed
as allies threaten bombing raids from midnight tonight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, GEORGE GRAHAM and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, WASHINGTON, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nato yesterday warned the Bosnian Serbs it would bomb their forces unless
they stopped shelling the enclave of Gorazde immediately and withdrew from
the city today.
The threat appeared to draw a swift response from Belgrade, where Serb
leaders and UN officials announced a ceasefire agreement late last night
which a UN spokesman said met the terms of the Nato ultimatum.
Envoys from the Nato defence alliance meeting in Brussels demanded an
immediate ceasefire in Gorazde, withdrawal of all Serb forces from a 3km
exclusion zone by midnight GMT tonight, and access to the city for
peacekeepers and medical workers. If these demands were not met, air attacks
could start against any Serb military targets within 20km of the city.
The Serbs were also threatened with bombing runs unless they withdrew heavy
guns from 20km around Gorazde by early Wednesday.
Nato stopped short of issuing similar ultimatums for four other
UN-designated 'safe areas', although a senior diplomat said they would do so
if 'there are attacks or clear threats of attack'.
In Belgrade, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia said the UN and Bosnian
Serbs had reached 'full agreement' on a ceasefire and the normalisation of
relations between the two sides.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, senior UN official in former Yugoslavia, described the
talks as 'positive' with respect to 'the urgency of the crisis we face in
Gorazde'. He said Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, had agreed
to an immediate ceasefire which was due to come into force at noon local
time today.
No details of the ceasefire agreement - one of many this week - were
immediately available, and it is uncertain whether Bosnian Serb forces will
comply. Shelling resumed in Gorazde last night after an early evening lull.
Nato's threats are the toughest warning the alliance has issued to the
Bosnian Serbs. They underline a sense of urgency over conditions in Gorazde,
where more than 500 people have been killed and 1,700 wounded in a Serb
offensive. Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said: 'Half-measures
will not do. The alliance has decided to take resolute action. The situation
demands action.'
In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the Bosnian Serbs 'should not
doubt' Nato's willingness to act. 'This decision provides Nato forces with
broader authority to respond to Bosnian Serb attacks.'
Mr Clinton contradicted reports that his administration was reconsidering
its refusal to send ground troops to Bosnia before the completion of a peace
agreement, and also said that extending bombing raids into Serbia 'would not
be appropriate at this time'.
But Mr William Perry, defence secretary, said any air strikes resulting from
the ultimatum should be 'vigorous. . . That means in quantity of airplanes
sent over and in diversity of targets'.
Targets for bombing would be defined by the alliance in consultation with
Unprofor, the UN protection force in Bosnia, according to a Nato statement.
This indicated the alliance had secured greater freedom of action than
before in choosing where to attack.

FFr5.3bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Credit Agricole, the French banking group, yesterday confirmed it had
maintained net profits at FFr5.34bn (Dollars 905m) in 1993 against FFr5.23bn
in 1992 in spite of the pressures on the banking industry.
Mr Lucien Douroux, chairman, had previously indicated that the bank would
make static profits for 1993.
He said the group hoped this year to maintain its position and to be able to
reduce the level of write-downs on its non-performing loans.
Credit Agricole saw net banking income rise by 6.2 per cent to FFr69bn last
year from FFr64.9bn in 1992. It succeeded in freezing operating costs at
FFr37.1bn and increased operating profits by 14 per cent to FFr28.5bn from
FFr25bn over the same period.

Vienna International Airport (VIA) group yesterday rep-orted lower profits
for 1993 but said that it would maintain its dividend at 8 per cent.
Group pre-tax profit was Sch540.9m (Dollars 45.3m) - down from Sch554.3m in
1992 - on turnover of Sch3.1bn. Passenger traffic rose by 5.3 per cent to
7.2m.
'Ruinous price and competition wars and the beginning of the liberalisation
phase in air traffic' had adversely affected the results, the company said.
However, it added that strong growth was expected this year.
VIA is 27 per cent private and the government is expected to sell at least
half of its 36.5 per cent stake this year. The city of Vienna and the
province of Lower Austria each have 18.25 per cent stakes.
Austrian Airlines posted a loss of Sch737m after tax last year, in spite of
a slight increase in traffic and steps taken to reduce costs and increase
revenues.
The number of passengers carried rose by 1.8 per cent compared with the
previous year to just above 3m. Air freight increased by 5.6 per cent.
But flight revenues fell by 1.4 per cent to Sch9bn, and total income was
down 1 per cent to Sch10.9bn.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Nedlloyd sees return to profit
this year

<TEXT>
Nedlloyd, the Dutch-based shipping and road haulage group, said it expected
to post a profit this year for the first time since 1991, helped by a
further recovery at its ocean-shipping line.
Ocean-shipping recovered strongly last year, enabling the group to
compensate for losses in its European road haulage business.
Net losses in 1993 nearly doubled to Fl 12m (Dollars 59m) from Fl 58m in
1992. However, if non-recurring items such as restructuring costs and
extraordinary gains are excluded, the underlying trend shows a narrowing of
group losses to Fl 50m from Fl 73m the year before.
'The turnround is well under way,' Mr Leo Berndsen, chairman, said.
He said the company, which has not paid a dividend since 1989, would resume
payments to shareholders as soon as it was 'responsible' to do so.
In shipping, Nedlloyd benefited from higher cargo volumes, particularly on
its services between Europe and Asia-Pacific. Operating results in shipping
swung into a profit of Fl 39m from a loss of Fl 2m in 1992.
In road haulage, the company was hit by the creation of the European single
market in early 1993, which reduced demand for its customs services at
European borders, and by the recession in Germany. The road sector suffered
an operating loss of Fl 4m last year, compared with a Fl 19m profit in 1992.
Nedlloyd managed to reduce interest-bearing debt by nearly Fl 300m in 1993,
putting it on target to reach its goal of a total Fl 500m reduction by late
1995. This, in turn, has led the company to end its attempts to sell off
Neddrill, its profitable offshore drilling subsidiary, Mr Berndsen said.
He announced that Nedlloyd would launch quarterly corporate reporting
starting in May. Until now the company has published half-year and full-year
figures.

<TEXT>
Benetton, the Italian clothing group, again defied the worldwide recession,
increasing net consolidated profits last year by a further 12.6 per cent to
L208bn (Dollars 86m), compared with L185bn in 1992.
The company backed up an optimistic statement by proposing a 10 per cent
increase in the dividend, to L385 a share from L350.
Benetton said it had experienced strong growth in sales in the US and
Caribbean, where revenue increased by 19 per cent, in the east Asia (83 per
cent growth) and the Middle East (up 51 per cent).
Overall consolidated sales in the 120 countries where Benetton is now
established rose to L2,751bn, against L2,512bn in 1992.
Operating profits increased 14 per cent to L408bn, while an additional 75m
pieces of clothing were manufactured worldwide. Benetton said there had been
a further cut in operating costs, due to continuing rationalisation of
production, including the integration of Benetton's Italian manufacturers
into the group.
The group drew attention to the performance of its shares in 1993, during
which the market capitalisation of Benetton nearly doubled to L4,345bn from
L2,278bn, while the principal Milan stock market index increased by 35.6 per
cent.
Over the last year, Benetton has been keen to widen the international spread
of its shareholder register. At the beginning of this month, the group
announced plans for a bond issue and a placing of 19m new shares overseas.

<TEXT>
North Korea yesterday offered the outside world a look at key evidence in a
row over its alleged secret atomic bomb project, inviting United Nations
experts to watch while its main nuclear reactor is refuelled, Reuter reports
from Vienna.
Mr David Kyd, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) spokesman, said
inspection of the Yongbyon reactor's exhausted fuel core was vital to try to
clear up allegations that Pyongyang was developing nuclear weapons.
He said the UN agency responded positively to the new North Korean offer
and, provided other elements of a fresh IAEA inspection could be agreed, an
expert mission would leave for Yongbyon next week.
The presence of inspectors was necessary 'in order to verify that there has
been no diversion of nuclear materials,' he added.
Mr Kim Il-sung, the North Korean leader, earlier this week strongly denied
that his country possessed, was producing or planned to make nuclear
weapons.
But Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said yesterday before leaving
Seoul for Tokyo that Washington was certain a secret nuclear arms project
was under way, adding that inspection of the spent reactor core was
imperative.
In its response to the new offer, the IAEA set out the measures it would
require to take during the removal of the spent fuel and additional steps at
nuclear facilities in order to verify that no uranium had been spirited
away.
The uranium fuel rods in the Yongbyon reactor, which was started up in 1986,
are almost exhausted and must be replaced in the next few weeks.

FT  22 APR 94 / Australian securities suit filed against Spalvins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian Securities Commission yesterday filed a suit against Mr John
Spalvins, who built up the Adelaide Steamship group in the 1980s, as well as
four other former directors of the company and Deloitte Haskins &amp;
Sells/Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu, the former auditors of the group.
The ASC, acting on behalf of the Adsteam group, is demanding that ADollars
340m (USDollars 246m) be repaid to the company - an amount which it claims
is equivalent to 'improperly paid dividends and interest'. The suit is a
civil action, and while claiming that the defendants breached their
fiduciary duties or were negligent, does not allege any criminal behaviour.
In the action, filed in the Federal Court in Adelaide, the ASC maintained
that the former directors and auditors caused Adsteam's profit for 1990 to
be overstated by at least ADollars 518m in the accounts.
The accounts, to year-end of June 1990, and certified in the following
October as 'true and fair' by the directors and auditors, said that the
company had 'achieved its 14th consecutive record profit for ADollars
220.3m, notwithstanding high interest rates and the difficult economic
climate in Australia'. Yet, as the ASC notes, a month later the company's
share price had dropped to 35 cents - compared with ADollars 3.53 when the
results were announced - and Adsteam entered into an arrangement with its
bankers.
Since then, management of Adsteam has changed and attempts have been made to
restructure the group. However, the company has continued to struggle with
its heavy debt levels, which still stood at ADollars 1.7bn last November.
Attributable losses over the three years to end-June 1993 have totalled
close to ADollars 2bn.
The ASC alleges that, when reporting the ADollars 220.3m profit, directors
and auditors failed properly to account for various loans and inter-company
transactions.
The watchdog goes on to claim that the former directors authorised ADollars
228m to be paid in interim and final dividends in relation to the 1990
financial year, in breach of their fiduciary duties and provisions of the
state's companies code.
The ASC added that it was 'in no way' criticising the present directors or
the group's current business activities. If the action is successful and
damages are awarded, the money will flow back to Adsteam.

FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (17): A certain hubbub around the ministry -
Population trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Egypt is to host the third United Nations conference for population and
development next September.
Seven thousand experts will be there - and Egypt will be flaunting its
achievement of reducing growth in the birth rate, among its 61m people
squeezed into only 4.5 per cent of the country's area, from 3 per cent a
year in 1985 to a 1993 rate of 2.3 per cent.
A certain hubbub has been generated around the new Population Ministry,
created after President Hosni Mubarak's cabinet reshuffle last October.
Egypt has made impressive gains in population control over the past 10
years, largely as a result of an effective advertising campaign.
The crude birth rate has dropped from 39.9 per 1,000 in 1985 to 29.2 per
1,000 in 1993, while the crude death rate has dropped from 9.4 per thousand
in 1985 to 7.4 in 1993.
The fertility rate has fallen to an average 3.9 births per woman, from 5.3
births in 1980. About 47 per cent of couples use some form of contraception
 -almost twice the figure recorded six years ago.
Nearly 30 per cent of these use intra-uterine devices (IUDs) - mostly
supplied by the US Agency for International Development. Thirteen per cent
use the pill and the remainder use traditional methods and condoms  - the
least popular form of control. (Unhappily, several years ago a consignment
of condoms donated by the US found its way into the market place where they
were sold as children's balloons.)
However, these gains are now levelling out. The next phase, during which the
birth rate should stay the same and the death rate should drop, is going to
be more difficult.
Dr Maher Mahram, the population minister, uses the analogy of going on a
diet to lose weight.
'If you want to lose weight, it is easy at first. Once you have lost it,
keeping the weight off is the difficult part.'
Meanwhile some critics suggest that the hubbub might be kalam fadi - empty
talk. 'President Mubarak mentions population in every speech he makes but
there is no clear commitment from the cabinet,' says Dr Barbara Ibrahim,
senior representative for the west and north Africa regions at the
International Population Council.
'More than half of them do not think that population is a problem. They are
products of the socialist era and see development as the best contraception.
But unless they limit family size, there won't be any development,' she
says.
The issue has been 'ghetto-ised' she claims, with the creation of the
ministry.
The key to further progress lies with improvements in living standards and
education - over which the ministry has no control.
The World Bank estimates that 20-25 per cent of the population lives on a
total monthly income of less than Dollars 35. Almost one in four children
under the age of five is malnourished. 36 per cent of the male population is
illiterate; 48 per cent of females are illiterate.
Furthermore, attitudes among men - particularly in the rural areas of Upper
Egypt - need to be altered. The latest Egypt Demographic and Health Survey
shows that 40 per cent of men feel they should have the primary role in
decisions about childbearing (a figure disputed by Mr Robin Lee at the Marie
Stopes clinic in Shoubra, a Cairo suburb, who claims that it is more like 80
per cent). Only 27 per cent of couples in Upper Egypt use contraception and
the average number of children per household is six. In rural areas,
children are still regarded as cheap labour; it is no surprise that the
highest fertility rates are found where socio-economic indicators are
lowest.
These issues are deeply entrenched. A more recent one is the rise in Islamic
fundamentalism. Dr Mahran denies that this has become a serious problem. The
Grand Mufti, Egypt's highest authority on Islamic jurisprudence, has
declared that family planning does not contradict the teachings of Allah.
But some imams have been preaching against it in the local mosques.
According to Dr Ibrahim, studies show that some doctors serving in
government clinics are being recruited by Islamic militants who see family
planning as a western plot. The physicians are making no more than a general
protest against the government in denying contraceptive advice, she says,
rather than exercising some deeply held religious conviction. 'It has just
become a convenient whipping boy.'
More subtly, women surveyed at the Marie Stopes clinic were found to be
reacting to advertising in a manner opposite from that intended. When shown
two scenes, one with a woman relaxing and painting her finger nails, the
other a mother of five rushing about doing the housework, they saw the
harried housewife as their preferred role model.
For these attitudes to change, the ministry needs a much larger budget than
it has; Dr Mahran complains about his lack of resources.
Perhaps September's conference will give the issue sufficient prestige to
ensure renewed political will to succeed.

FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (18): Plans look pretty good on paper - The
'new communities'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scale of Egypt's population problem is awesome. By the government's own
reckoning, 98 per cent of the country's 61m population live in just 4 per
cent of its area - along the Nile valley and in the Delta.
But the rich farmland in the Nile Valley is fast being destroyed. From the
train window going north to Alexandria or south to Luxor, it is easy to see
how new breeze-block houses and signs of urban development are eroding the
land on which the mass of the population depend for survival.
Many of the so-called sweet water canals are stagnant and polluted, blocked
by construction as Cairo and other cities spread outwards. In some districts
of Cairo, itself choked by its 12m population - four times the size of 30
years ago - the population density is now 29,000 per square kilometre.
According to the ministry of new communities, Egypt's population has risen
from some 11m in 1900, to 44m in 1981, to 61m today. It will be 70m by 2000
if the growth continues at the present rate of 2.3 per cent a year. (Even if
the growth rate were reduced to 2 per cent, that still means more than a
million extra mouths to feed every year.)
For many years the government has had an overall plan to spread development
over the country as a whole, to take pressure off the Nile Valley and the
Delta. For this purpose the country has been divided into six areas: the
full length of both sides of the Suez canal; the northern coast from
Alexandria westwards; the entire western desert bordered by Libya to the
west and Sudan to the south; the full length of the Red Sea coast; the Sinai
peninsula, and the Aswan High Dam area.
The plan looks good on paper, but it is too enormous an undertaking - with
Egypt's limited funds - to meet immediate needs. For the last 15 years the
emphasis has been on building new desert cities partly supported by land
reclaimed for agriculture. But it is a desperate race against time.
The government well knows how urgent the demographic problem is; it
symbolically acknowledged as much in last October's cabinet reshuffle, when
the present ministry for new communities emerged in its own right.
The government's plan to spread the population is divided into three
'generations' of new desert communities (see map). The first consists of
seven new cities - with a hard core of four, where many industries have
already been started in response to government incentives.
The four most advanced cities are 10th of Ramadan (named after the date in
the Islamic calendar when Egypt launched the successful attack, in October
1973, against the Israelis entrenched behind the Bar Lev line on the eastern
bank of the Suez Canal). Sadat City; 6th of October city; and New Borg Al
Arab.
10th of Ramadan city is about 55 kilometres east of Cairo on the road to
Ismailiya and the Canal zone. Covering an area of about 48 sq kms, it has a
target population of 500,000 people. About 100,000 (37,000 workers and their
families) are already installed. The ministry claims there are 535 factories
in operation, with an annual output of about Dollars 850m.
Sadat City, off the Cairo-Alexandria road, is spread over a similar area and
has the same target population. Its present population is about 29,000
workers and their families. The city's 96 factories have an annual output of
less than Dollars 200m.
6th of October City is intended to be the western anchor of a new east-west
growth corridor in the greater Cairo region - and to relieve growing
population density away from the Pyramids Plateau, west of Cairo. It also
has a target population of 500,000, but it still only has about100,000. New
Borg Al Arab, some 60 kms from Alexandria, has a similar target and actual
population figures as the previous three; it has an actual annual output of
some Dollars 180m.
Established industries - food-processing, pharmaceutical industries,
consumer durables and electronics - include many joint ventures with foreign
companies which have responded to the government's offer of a 10-year tax
holiday, cheap land and new infrastructure. The prospect of employment has
attracted abundant skilled labour. All four cities produce about Dollars
1.3bn worth of goods a year, exported to other Arab states.
The other three 'first generation' cities are smaller in scope. 15th of May
city, east of the heavy industrial area of Helwan, has a target of 250,000
inhabitants and covers an area of some 27 sq kms. New Damietta, on the north
coast, has a similar target population but is less advanced. New Salhya, in
the eastern part of the Delta, is planned as a centre for agro-industries
and service industries with a population of about 70,000.
The second generation of cities, El Obour, Badr, New Nobaria, and New Beni
Suef/New El Menya are less advanced, although construction has started. The
third generation of cities is either at the detailed studies phase, or basic
infrastructure is being provided.
A feature of all the established new cities is relative freedom from the air
pollution which characterises Cairo, and the relative cleanliness of the
streets. But - to western eyes at least, both in Sadat City three years ago
and in 10th of Ramadan today - there are endemic problems of poor
maintenance and low quality public services. Landscaping is basic.
Maintenance is simply shoddy. It is a question of priorities - of how much
can be achieved, given Egypt's limited resources.
Up to the end of last year some Dollars 3bn had been invested in industrial
projects in the first generation cities. They employed some 170,000 people.
Not the least of the problems facing their successful development is the
question mark over the government's sustained willingness to appoint the
right people to oversee the programme and leave them alone to get on with
it.
The ministry for new communities shows all the signs of a new bureaucracy
getting itself comfortably installed in a makeshift ministry building.
Priority seems to have been given to the quality of the wood panelling on
the upper ministerial floor and to the long lines of individual petitioners
awaiting the attention of the minister, Mr Mohamed Suleiman.
Traditional Egyptian bureaucratic methods do not bode well for the future of
the new cities. If a visitor to the ministry fails to spot, in the derelict
lobby, the small lift reserved for direct access to the ministerial floor,
he may find himself on one of the 'lesser' floors, where presumed staff
wander round chatting or sit reading newspapers. It would seem that real
work is left to a small number of dedicated - and very harassed-looking -
staff on the top floor.

FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (15): Quick on its feet and full of women -
The Alexandria Businessmen's Association
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Alexandria Businessmen's Association is really a misnomer, writes Robin
Allen.
First, it is as much a private sector development agency as an association.
Second, it has so many women members that it intends soon to rename itself
the Alexandria Business Association.
But what sets it apart from more conventional business groups is the role it
plays in fostering large numbers of small and micro-size private sector
businesses.
It started in 1978: a business committee under the umbrella of the official
chamber of commerce, with which all companies have to register.
But while there are about 130,000 members of the chamber, the ABA has only
280 members: big enough to be representative and influential; small enough
to be quick on its feet.
ABA has six main aims: to improve understanding and promote contacts between
private and public sectors; to promote trade and investment contacts with
private sectors abroad; to safeguard the interests of Alexandria's private
sector and evaluate macro and micro economic issues for local companies; to
improve the city's economic and business climate; to improve community
services for social reasons by providing new hospitals, schools and
community centres and renovating those which need it; and to help the local
private sector with start-up and working capital.
It is the existence and the success of these last two which mark ABA from
more conventional groups.
Mr Kemal Sid Ahmed, vice-president, says that in a city such as Alexandria
the bigger businessmen have to have - and want to have - a sense of service
to the community if the role of the private sector is to be understood and
accepted.
Individual gifts and donations for private sector community or social
organisations are tax deductible for up to only 7 per cent of a company's
net profits. Donations to the public sector are 100 per cent tax deductible.
But the thrust of the ABA's efforts to the private sector is through the
small and micro enterprise development projects.
ABA is a non-profit making group. But its investments in small and very
small businesses are managed on commercial, free-market principles: small
businesses, including simple artisan workshops, are scrutinised first for
their viability. Loans have to be repaid on time and in full.
In fact, ABA acts as an investment bank to cottage industries. 'Micro' is
defined as a workshop employing up to five workers; 'small' is between five
and 15 workers. The programme is managed partly with the US Agency for
International Development (USAID), which has provided Dollars 10m for
running capital for small businessmen selected by ABA.
In the last four years, ABA has disbursed EPounds 49m (Dollars 14.5m), and
claims to have created 20,000 jobs by increasing productivity. The prompt
repayment rate, Mr Sid Ahmed says, is a healthy 98.7 per cent; there are
very few delinquent borrowers, and those few are thereafter barred from any
further involvement with ABA's lending programme.
Given that about 1,000 applications are processed a month, this rate says
something for the efficiency of ABA's three-man evaluating team. It is
something no commercial bank in Egypt - certainly no public sector bank -
could possibly match.
Parallel with its loan activity, ABA has set up community centres
encouraging local people to maintain Alexandria's homogeneity. It also has a
research studies centre attracting speakers from all levels of government
and business. The association is now discussing with USAID a proposal for a
management institute* in Alexandria for middle and senior management. This
could ultimately be linked to US business schools offering nine-month
courses to Alexandria's younger business managers.

FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (14): Vivid history underfoot - A look at
Alexandria's entrepreneurial flair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The city of Alexandria is restaking its claim to be recognised as a business
centre of primary importance - particularly for the private sector - after
years of playing second fiddle to Cairo.
Its business community never deserved the position of relative obscurity
which has dogged it for the last 35 years, since the late President Nasser's
brand of socialism, which meant wholesale nationalisation, effectively
choked off the entrepreneurial flair of Alexandria's people.
It has the largest port in Africa, capable of handling the biggest
containers. Through this passes 80 per cent of Egypt's foreign trade. Winds
blowing year round from the Mediterranean ensure pollution-free air - a
great relief after Cairo. Alexandria has good road and rail connections to
Cairo and the Canal Zone.
A 1,000-acre free-zone at Amyria, 25 kms south-west of Alexandria on the
road to the new city of Borg El-Arab, offers 10-year renewable tax holidays
to investors. Five-year tax holidays are also on offer to investors in some
areas on-shore.
Alexandria should have an international airport worthy of the name, but the
air force is reported to be reluctant to give up any of its military
facilities to more profitable commercial traffic. At present, regular
flights to Europe are limited to Athens and Frankfurt, and to Jeddah and
Kuwait in the Middle East. Sooner or later - more likely, later, given the
central government's ponderous decision-making process  - Alexandria will
get the airport its business community deserves.
It is a far easier city than Cairo to move around in, except in the
July-August holiday season, when its population increases by 2m-3m, mostly
tourists from Egypt itself and from other Arab countries. In its latest
heyday (in the 19th century and early part of the 20th), Greeks, Italians,
French, Austro-Hungarians and British flocked here in their thousands to
live.
That all ended in the 1950s. 'We took far too long to throw you British
out,' says Mrs Amal Hamdi, the government's information under-secretary for
Alexandria and Lower Egypt, smiling. Now western visitors, including
British, are gradually coming back in hundreds rather than thousands, drawn
by the city's extraordinary historical legacy rather than by the city
beaches.
Recent sun-and-sea tourism development is the only distressing feature of
the city and its coastline. For some 10 kms either side of the old city
centre at Saad Zaghloul square, facing the eastern harbour, the authorities
seem to have abandoned all restraint in allowing construction of hideous
sea-front apartment blocks, devoid of any attempt at landscaping.
The result is one gaunt breeze-block and cement high-rise after another  - a
visual mixture of dilapidated war-torn Beirut, Tashkent after the 1965
earthquake and Naples ribbon development at its most shabby. Cement
pill-boxes on one area of the beach (an area several kilometres long)
masquerade as beach-huts. There is neither a tree nor a flower in sight.
There is, as there has to be, an economic reason for the shattered
appearance of many buildings and the lack of maintenance in many parts of
the city. Since President Nasser imposed rent controls in the 1950s, no
landlord has been willing to spend more than the bare essentials on upkeep.
And since they sold plots to property developers, many Alexandrians are no
longer as poor as they were.
In any case, this strip development is an aberration. The British regret
their soul-destroying 1960s high-rise architecture; Alexandrians shrug off
the mistakes of the past in favour of Mediterranean skies and making money.
They do so with a measure of success and a sense of humour.
Fifteen of the city's most prominent businessmen are also honorary consuls,
and enjoy the extra status their diplomatic positions give them. This, too,
does no harm when it comes to selling Alexandria abroad; they are all
members not only of the official chamber of commerce, but also of the highly
efficient and successful Alexandria Businessmen's Association (ABA: see
article opposite).
As in the rest of Egypt, the local economy is relatively depressed. High
interest rates and the government's tight monetary policy have restricted
corporate growth. But several western companies have set up packaging and
assembly plants, taking advantage of the local pool of cheap, skilled
labour. Braun of Germany has a joint-venture assembly plant for its electric
razors; Unilever is in partnership with the local Fine Foods, packaging tea
and instant foods. The owner of Fine Foods, Mr Mohamed El-Rachid, does
official duties as the honorary consul for Mexico. Another prominent figure,
Mr Mustafa El-Naggar, whose meat import business includes a company in
Eastbourne, England, does the honours for Norway, while his nephew looks
after official Danish interests.
Alexandria's business community is led by entrepreneurs whose multilingual
talents reflect the cosmopolitan years of the 19th and early 20th centuries.
These business leaders are less interested in grandiose plans to privatise
debt-ridden public-sector companies than in encouraging the small - and very
small - companies which give Alexandria its commercial impetus. They have
the advantage that Alexandria has, so far at least, been untouched by the
violence of Islamic activists which has marked Cairo and upper Egypt.
Communities in Alexandria are homogeneous enough for militant outsiders (or
anyone doing anything out of the ordinary) to be quickly spotted by
residents themselves - even before the police, who are regarded as rather
efficient, might be called in.
Visitors with a sense of history have the bonus of knowing that wherever
they put their feet, they are almost certainly standing on a
thousand-year-old underground tunnel or catacomb, which could date from the
Ptolemaic period of Alexander the Great's successors after 330 BC. Wherever
you go, well-hidden for the most part in the general clutter of buildings,
are relics of the city's Ptolemaic, Byzantine, Graeco-Roman, Arab and
Turkish pasts.
There are also many reminders from the last century, reflecting the regimes
of Mehmet Ali and his descendants. Antique shops, 100 year-old Greek and
French pastry shops and cafes (some with splendid art nouveau murals), and
the faded but still resplendent Cecil Hotel are all going concerns.
But a visitor would be well advised to make sure that his feet are on solid
ground. Freak accidents seem to be an important source of inspiration for
local archaeologists. The best known Graeco-Roman catacombs at Kom El
Shogafa were found by chance in 1900, when a donkey disappeared through the
earth into an unknown shaft. In the 1960s a young woman, coming out of a
cinema with her newly married husband, vanished through the pavement in the
central Hurriya Street, the Bond Street of Alexandria.
More recently, an employee of the Russian consulate, nosing around a
subterranean passage, is reputed to have stumbled across a crowned head
inside a crystal sarcophagus in a cavern, also below Hurriya street. Neither
was ever seen again. You might call it the Byzantine version of a joint
venture.

FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (16): The British still come - Violence has
damaged earnings from tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a tent encampment just outside Aswan, where soldiers from Cairo do
seven-day stints guarding the city against the fundamentalist Gama'a
Islamiyya. Its members have targeted Egypt's Dollars 3bn tourism industry
which, since 1988, has outstripped oil as the country's main source of
foreign exchange.
A little further down the airport road is the construction site of a tourism
catering school.
Given the effect of the militants' campaign, which has reduced arrivals from
3.2m in 1992 to 2.5m last year and income down from Dollars 2.1bn to Dollars
1.3bn in the same period, one might wonder why they bother with the catering
school.
Both the tent encampment and the construction site represent elements of the
government's campaign to crush the activists and revive an industry which
employs, directly or indirectly, 5m of Egypt's 61m population and is seen as
the simplest route to creating further employment quickly.
Mr Mamdouh Beltagui, the tourism minister, believes that the international
reaction to the deaths of at least three tourists, a bomb at the pyramids,
another outside the Egyptian museum in Cairo and attacks on cruise ships and
tourist buses in Upper Egypt, has been overdone - particularly by the
western press - to devastating effect.
Occupancy rates in Cairo are just 53.5 per cent at best. In Aswan, whose
economy is 60 per cent reliant on tourism, the rates this year are just 35
per cent.
Luxor, which is almost 100 per cent reliant on the industry via tours of the
Valley of the Kings, Tutankhamen's tomb and the Karnak and Luxor temples, is
empty and tense with only 38 per cent occupancy . . . and that only with
discounts of up to 50 per cent on hotel rooms.
Rates at Hurghada and Sharm el Sheikh, the new Red Sea/Sinai resorts which
cater for the sun, sea and sand market, are doing rather better: they are up
to 55 per cent so far this year, against a 1993 average of 27 per cent and
43 per cent respectively .
There is little physical or political cover for the militants in the desert,
so it is no surprise that the resorts escaped the militants' campaign.
Moreover, tour operators have been successful in marketing Sinai as a
distinct destination, breaking any association between these resorts and the
rest of Egypt.
But it is less clear why Luxor, predominantly reliant on cruise ships which
now rarely ply the Nile from Cairo via Assiut, has been spared .
Apart from the government's ferocious clampdown on the fundamentalists -
thousands have been rounded up and many lives have been lost among the
police and suspects - one explanation is that any terrorist would be torn
limb from limb if he was caught in the town by local business people who
depend on the daily flows of visiting cruise passengers.
Egypt's archaeological heritage, contained primarily in Luxor, Cairo, Aswan
and Abu Simbal, is where its long-term future lies.
'People only come to Egypt because it's an ancient civilisation,' says Mr
Adel Akladios, general manager for American Express which has a large
tourism business in Cairo.
For the moment, 'It has become a delay destination, but not a cancellation
decision.'
This is nothing new. Egypt became a serious 'delay' destination after the
1985 Achille Lauro hi-jacking and riots by Cairo security police in 1986.
The industry had barely recovered when it was hit by the Gulf War.
'It will take another one or two years before things are under control,'
says Mr Akladios. 'Someone gets killed in Washington every five minutes but
that doesn't get talked about. Tourists are targets in other countries. But
Europeans have a gut fear of Islamic fundamentalism. If it's Islamic they
think it's bloodthirsty. It's something they just don't understand.'
He believes visitors will get used to the idea that 'Egypt is no longer 100
per cent safe. They will know that all they have to do is avoid places like
Assiut,' the poverty stricken town which has long been the fundamentalists'
stronghold .
Mr Akladios says the British have been the most sanguine and have continued
to come in large numbers. 'They are used to living with the IRA.'
The biggest drop has been among high-spending Americans, together with
Scandinavians, the French, the Germans, Italians and Spaniards.
Gulf tourism, which accounts for 45 per cent of the market, has been largely
maintained. Egypt has embarked on an aggressive marketing campaign - having
never in the past felt the need to advertise its obvious treasures.
Burson Marsteller, the world's biggest public relations company, has been
hired. Saatchi and Saatchi has also been taken on. A budget of Dollars 42m a
year has been approved for advertising and Mr Beltagui, who took over from
Mr Fouad Sultan last October and has considerable political clout, appears
frequently on the world's television screens.
The success of this campaign is seen as crucial, not just to the fortunes of
hoteliers and cruise ship operators, but to the general economy. One in 15
jobs already depends on tourism and it is seen as the best hope for creating
many more.

FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (11): Battle of wits develops - Hard
bargaining between Suez Canal users
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An intriguing battle of wits is developing as more participants vie for the
cheapest way to transport crude oil - and natural gas later on - from Gulf
states to European markets.
In the end the result will be dictated by the market, traders and end
buyers, rather than by intermediaries such as Arab Petroleum Pipelines
Company (Sumed) and the Suez Canal Authority (SCA). But these two, Sumed and
the SCA, will be at the centre of any hard bargaining if they are not to
lose their respective market shares.
New entrants on to the regional oil and gas scene could include an expanded
Israeli-managed Eilat-Ashquelon oil pipeline (Tipline), if and when the Arab
boycott on Israel is lifted. Tipline has a capacity of 900,000 b/d. (Iran
owns 50 per cent of Tipline, from a deal going back to the days of the
Shah.)
Another potential competitor for transporting crude would be a revived
Trans-Arabian pipeline (the old Tapline), which had a capacity of 500,000
b/d before it was closed in the Arab-Israel war of June 1967. It has
remained closed ever since.
US oil contractors are reported to have already discussed the feasibility
and costs of restoring the line from the Jordan section, 50 kms east of
Mafraq, where the line divides into two. One spur goes through Syria to
Sidon in Lebanon; the other passes through Israel north of the occupied West
Bank to Haifa on the Mediterranean. Reviving or expanding these two lines
would seriously affect both Sumed and SCA.
Sumed is 50 per cent owned by Egypt. Fifteen per cent each is held by Abu
Dhabi (through Abu Dhabi National Oil Company), Saudi Arabia (through Saudi
Aramco), and Kuwait (via three state-owned companies). The remaining 5 per
cent is held by Qatar through Qatar General Petroleum Corporation (QGPC).
The 320-km pipeline started transporting crude in January 1977 from Ain
Sukhna, on the Red Sea, to Sidi Kerir, west of Alexandria. It serves tankers
up to 500,000dwt with draughts up to 75 feet - too deep to pass through the
Suez Canal. Egypt gets 85 per cent of the revenue from Sumed by virtue of
its equity share, together with money from customs, taxes and end-ownership
rights.
According to Dr Aly Nazih, Sumed's chairman, last year's daily throughput
was 84m tonnes, equivalent to some 1.6m b/d, - up from 77.6m tonnes in 1992.
The capacity is already there to provide for a throughput of 117m-120m
tonnes a year (equivalent to 2.3m b/d), but will not be operational until
completion and testing of the Dollars 120m boosting stations south of Cairo.
The new pumps will enable Sumed to increase its share of the Mediterranean
and European markets. Although traders are reported to have complained that
the extra capacity would mean more delays for tankers off-loading at Ain
Sukhna and a resulting increase in spot prices for their clients' crude, Dr
Nazih curtly refutes suggestions that there had ever been delays at either
Ain Sukhna or at Sidi Kerir.
Officially Sumed does not compete with the SCA - by not catering for tankers
of less than 150,000dwt, the maximum that can pass fully laden through the
Suez Canal. Instead, Sumed concentrates on very large crude carriers (vlccs)
and ultra large crude carriers (ulccs), which discharge at Ain Sukhna, pass
through the Suez Canal in ballast (empty) or partly laden, and reload at
Sidi Kerir. To take tankers of less than 150,000dwt would deprive the SCA -
and the Egyptian government - of much-needed revenue.
'Everyone thinks there is competition with SCA for the smaller tankers, but
there is none whatsoever,' Dr Nazih insists. 'We are only dealing with
tankers which cannot be accommodated by SCA.'
This may not make commercial sense to Sumed's non-Egyptian shareholders.
Sumed's expansion plans and increased capacity will inevitably lead
shareholders to push for a greater market share.
In fact, as Mr Mohamed Ezzat Adel, chairman of SCA, explains, the SCA/Sumed
relationship rests uneasily on an oral 'professional agreement' that Sumed
should offer enough incentives for buyers and traders to load all the extra
capacity on to vlccs and ulccs, not on to medium-size tankers which could be
using the Canal.
In an interview with the Cairo daily Alam el Yom on April 10, Mr Adel
pointed out that 'last year the Suez Canal transported 41.2m tonnes of oil
from the Gulf to Europe. By contrast, Sumed carried 76.9m tonnes through the
pipeline. Sumed should concentrate on oil for the US and Europe, and leave
the Mediterranean ports for the Canal.'
At the beginning of April the SCA began to accept loaded vessels with a beam
(width) of 158 feet drawing 53 feet, instead of 144 feet drawing 55 feet. On
June 1, the beam limit will be kept constant but the permissible draught
will increase to 54 feet. For vlccs and ulccs in ballast, SCA has begun to
accept a beam of up to 210 feet instead of 190 feet.
This extra capacity will marginally help to make SCA more attractive,
underpinned by the new 'long-haul rebate scheme' to tempt long-distance
traffic away from the alternative Cape Route.
At present, SCA worries about being able to maintain revenue; any business
Sumed might take away would be sorely felt. 'Oil represents a big slice of
our revenue, so I should be worried not only about competition from Sumed,
but also from other lines in oil and gas cargo,' Mr Adel said on April 3.
SCA's revenues for the calendar year 1993 were Dollars 1.965bn, compared
with 1991-1992 fiscal year revenues of Dollars 1.752bn. The 1993 results
were a disappointment. 'We were anticipating more than Dollars 2bn; and this
year has so far started miserably because of the recession in the west,' Mr
Adel said.
A ship from Jeddah to, say, the Black Sea saves 83 per cent on distance by
using the canal. But a ship from Tokyo to, say, Rotterdam, which makes use
of the canal, saves only 23 per cent. Incentive rates or rebate schemes can
tempt these into using the canal.
Low prices for bunker fuel mean that freighters and tankers from Asia can
steam around the Cape at slower speeds and save money. Moreover, the SCA
must operate in SDRs, and has been losing out because of the progressive
decline of the US dollar. If the dollar gets weaker, then a ship which
contracted for Dollars 100,000 will actually be paying Dollars
110,000-Dollars 115,000, depending on the devaluation of the dollar.
A further worry for the SCA is the possible resumption or expansion of the
Tipline. Tipline is severely under-used. It is taking 50,000 b/d of Egyptian
crude. Total Israeli domestic consumption is about 200,000 b/d.
'At present this line is being used only for local consumption,' Mr Adel
says, 'but there are studies being done to link this line with others or to
build a new one. If this happens, it will cause problems for both the SCA
and for Sumed.'
Dr Nazih obliquely concurs: 'So far we have no problem with the Israeli
pipeline. Their economy has to grow a lot before they are competing with
us.'
It is too soon to say how Sumed and the SCA will respond to the possibility
of Qatar, and perhaps Iran, wanting to pipe their gas through to a
Mediterranean terminal. A multi-national natural gas consortium similar to
Sumed's for crude is one possibility - if the potential Arab shareholders
ever reach agreement on structure and pricing. Mr Adel said in the same
interview with Alam el Yom: 'If Qatar extends a gas pipeline to Israel for
the latter's domestic use, then fine; but if this pipeline for Israel is to
export gas to Europe, then this is hitting below the belt as far as the Suez
Canal is concerned.'

FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (13): Safety net does its best - The Social
Fund was set up after the IMF agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Egypt's Dollars 613m Social Fund for Development, backed by the World Bank
and 16 other donors, was designed as a safety net to counter hardship caused
by a structural adjustment programme imposed after an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund.
Twenty per cent of the country's population is unemployed. Many are
graduates with serious expectations and a high susceptibility to the Islamic
fundamentalists whose recruiting ground they have become. At least another
20 per cent is under-employed and a further 20-25 per cent eke out some sort
of existence beneath the poverty line.
If Egypt is to keep pace with a population growth of 2.3 per cent a year (as
reported in the 1992 Egypt Demographic and Health Survey), it needs to
create 600,000 jobs a year for things to stay as they are.
The IMF programme, removing Dollars 10bn worth of subsidies on most goods
(with the exception of the potentially explosive baladi bread price) and
services, began to bite in 1991. The programme followed successful fiscal
adjustment and foresaw large scale privatisation and a wider shakeout in the
arthritic government bureaucracy.
Very little privatisation has taken place and there has been almost nothing
in the way of public sector redundancies leading to 'employment retraining
and adjustment' - the fund's priority.
Established three years ago, it was first seen as independent from the
government. Targeted at Gulf War returnees, laid-off workers, women and
children, it came in for some early criticism because of alleged political
pressures on its allocation process. Eight of the 17 board members were
cabinet ministers who, critics claimed, behaved like lobbyists for their own
ministries.
Apart from the difficulties of recruiting suitably trained people,
establishing reporting systems, identifying projects, and satisfying the
specifications of 17 different donors, every decision had to be cleared by
the board. Disbursement was extremely slow.
Administrative infighting led to the resignation in early 1992 of Mr Hamid
Mubarak, the then managing director and the president's cousin. Mr Hussein
el-Gamal, who succeeded him, has tried to improve the fund's image and
streamline its decision making. An executive committee of seven - four
ministers and three businessmen - was established. The spending of sums over
Pounds 10m requires the imprimatur of the World Bank, which retains a
resident officer to monitor the fund. But sums up to Dollars 1.5m can be
authorised by Mr el-Gamal on his own, and the committee.
Of the EPounds 382m invested, most of it over the last 18 months, by far the
largest amount - EPounds 228m - has gone into the enterprise development
element of the nominally six-pronged scheme.
No-one denies that the main beneficiaries have been unemployed, politically
dangerous graduates, who suffer up to 85 per cent unemployment in sensitive
parts of the country such as Assiut, traditionally the stronghold of the
Moslem Brotherhood.
'The poor will always find some sort of employment, even begging,' says Ms
Thea Christiansen, an official at the United Nations Development Fund which
has established the Fund's basic channels. 'Unemployed graduates are not in
their situation because of structural adjustment. The government job
guarantee system disappeared long ago, and because they are a political
threat, the government wants to provide some alternative to the
fundamentalists.'
Islamic militants have already found a political voice through the
professional unions which, in the past, ensured jobs for life. Part of the
fund's function is to change the attitudes of graduates whose employment in
the public sector once gained them not just security of work and a pension
at the end of it, but enormous status.
In place of what was once the safe option, graduates - mostly graduates of
technical colleges - are being persuaded to join credit schemes to establish
small businesses in their home areas. Cheap loans supplied through local
banks by the Arab Fund, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates are the most
popular.
Local support groups - the 8,000 effective non-government organisations -
are responsible for the loans if the beneficiaries fail, but so far the
maximum business failure rate has been 7 per cent.
'There are risks to credit schemes everywhere,' says Ms Amani Abou Zeid,
senior officer at the Fund's projects and planning unit. 'A 10 to 15 per
cent failure rate would still be considered successful.'
The credit scheme is estimated to have benefited 385,000 people and created
77,771 permanent jobs. Cattle raising enterprises seem the most popular.
Otherwise small sewing businesses are the most talked about, but they have
been part of the government's productive family programme for a number of
years. That is not to say that the truly poor have been entirely neglected.
Almost EPounds 73m has been spent on public works such as irrigation, River
Nile protection schemes, provision of potable water and rural road
improvements.
The community development element of the fund, aimed at eradicating
illiteracy (perhaps Egypt's most fundamental difficulty, along with
population growth), providing village pumps and a modicum of health care,
has accounted for EPounds 67m. Only EPounds 10m has been devoted to
employment retraining, for which there has been little demand as yet.
Technical assistance accounts for another EPounds 10m, largely devoted to
strengthening the non government organisations which perform a crucial role
at the sharp end of most schemes.
The social fund, based on a much less ambitious project in Bolivia in the
1980s, has had some serious and sometimes unfair criticism. It employs only
120 staff, including those in 12 regional offices. They present their
accounts once every 15 days. Everything is strictly accounted for. They feel
that the local press and some politicians have raised unreasonable
expectations. 'We are here to alleviate, not to eradicate problems,' says Ms
Abu Zeid.
If a safety net is not in place, as Egypt goes through the pain of
adjustment, it will not be for want of the social fund's best - if belated -
efforts.

FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (12): 'About to enter a gas era' - Heady
news in the hydrocarbons sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It would have sounded unlikely even a year ago, but in the past few months
oil ministry officials have begun talking cautiously about Egypt becoming a
gas exporting nation by the end of the decade.
There has been much excited talk - most loudly from Israel - about gas
pipelines feeding Egyptian gas to its neighbour, which is already the
biggest single consumer of Egypt's crude oil exports.
It remains early days for all this yet. But Egyptian officials believe they
have reasons to be cheerful.
The cause is a sudden flush of good gas finds which led Mr Hamdi al-Banbi,
Egypt's petroleum minister, to raise earlier this year, almost at a stroke,
the official figure for Egypt's gas reserves from 12.8 trillion (million
million) standard cubic feet to 21 trillion.
Moreover, after further recent finds, particularly offshore in the
Mediterranean, and the recent allocation of new and potentially gas-prone
concessions, ministry officials are confident that this official reserve
figure could double again.
'You can say that Egypt is about to enter a gas era,' says Mr Wafik Meshref,
the state petroleum company's vice chairman for agreements.
All this is heady news for a hydrocarbons sector which previously had
offered little to cheer about. Egypt's oil industry, for instance, continues
to pump at about its capacity of 900,000 barrels a day (b/d).
Oil executives say they are doing better than they expected at prolonging
the life of mature fields, but tend to rule out the prospect of big new oil
finds. According to many in the industry, given present trends, significant
crude production looks commercially sustainable in Egypt for little more
than a decade.
The oil ministry is doing what it can to squeeze life into the oil sector.
Under Mr al-Banbi, the government has increased the flexibility and terms of
production sharing agreements with foreign oil companies, offered bigger
concessions and kept up a rolling series of bid rounds.
The present round, launched in January and scheduled to close at the end of
September, offers tracts in North Sinai, West Ismailia, Beni Suef basin, Abu
Aradik and Sidi Barrani, near the Libyan border. All but the last of these
are considered more likely to be oil than gas prone.
Some oil executives in Cairo say there are 'initially encouraging' results
from the application of 3-D seismic tests beneath the hitherto opaque salt
layers under the Gulf of Suez, the source of most of Egypt's crude. But such
promising avenues are few.
Most people in the industry argue that with greater prizes available in
Central Asia, Latin America and elsewhere, the continued attraction of Egypt
for oil exploration alone will depend critically on yet further improvements
in the terms of production sharing agreements.
Gas, therefore, appears to be Egypt's best bet.
According to Mr Meshref, most of the concessions awarded in the preceding
bid round, which formally closed last December, are either known to have gas
or seem to be gas prone.
Of the five areas awarded, British Gas and Shell won the shallow
Mediterranean Rosetta bloc; BG and Edison the deepwater West Delta,
International Egyptian Oil Company (IEOC), the Agip arm; and Amoco the
Rasal-Bar bloc in the eastern Mediterranean. (IEOC looks as if it may win
the operating agreement for the deepwater East Delta tract.)
Any real talk of prospective exports will hang crucially on the results of
drilling in these concessions.
But according to one of the foreign companies involved: 'There is already
enough encouragement, from what we see out there, to be talking about
possible exports eventually'.
At present, Egypt is in no position to sell gas. For the past several years
the country has been engaged in a long term policy of replacing fuel oil
with gas in the country's power stations, essentially to release further
crude for export. The country presently has about 170,000 b/d available for
export, and crude sales last year earned Dollars 2.13bn, according to Mr
al-Banbi, making it one of Egypt's main hard currency earners.
By the end of this year some 75 per cent of the country's power stations
will have been converted to gas, according to ministry officials, consuming
roughly 64 per cent of the country's gas output. This stands presently at
around 1.2m s cu ft daily.
The remainder of Egypt's gas supplies the local fertiliser industry (15 per
cent of the total), other industries and household consumers (a mere 1 per
cent).
But with domestic gas consumption rising by about 14-15 per cent a year, and
at least three new gas fuelled power stations planned, proveable gas
reserves will have to rise well above present levels before export plans can
go much beyond their present early discussions.
Nevertheless these have taken place - particularly with Israel. Egyptian
officials, however, are reluctant to say anything in public (or much even in
private) about these talks, beyond confirming that Mr al-Banbi has discussed
possible long-term export prospects. Several foreign companies are also
known to be examining the possibility of an export pipeline, notably ENI,
the Italian group, which has held discussions on a link from Port Said into
Gaza with a capacity of about 200m cu ft a day and a possible construction
cost of Dollars 800m.
Bankers in Cairo say that other proposals are being discussed but, given the
continued political sensitivity of deals with the Jewish state, remain for
now 'a bit hush hush,' as one banker put it.
Israel and perhaps also Jordan would be a natural market, given the
geography of Egypt's present and likely gas finds. Of present reserves, 38.5
per cent lie in the Mediterranean, 14 per cent in the Nile Delta and 16.8
per cent in the Gulf of Suez, with the remainder in the Western Desert.
Further big finds in the Mediterranean and Delta would give real impetus to
an Israeli pipeline deal.
Nevertheless, Egyptian officials say cautiously that they require more
detailed data on the size of a prospective Israeli market for their gas
before talks with the Israelis can go much further. Moreover, the ministry
is also studying Turkey as a prospective market and, possibly, Italy. For
the latter, however, exports would almost certainly be feasible only through
an LNG scheme, for which Egyptian officials say they would need a minimum of
5t s cu ft of gas available for export.

FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (9): Strict controls applied - The cotton
industry is being rescued from terminal decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The winds of change are picking up speed over Egypt's cotton fields,
breezing through its spinning mills, and buffeting the country's textiles
industry.
Egypt's production of cotton is all classed as Extra Fine Cotton. About
one-quarter is Extra Long Staple (ELS), which means that fibre lengths are 1
3/8' and above, such as the varieties Giza 77, Giza 70 and Giza 45. ELS is
popular because of its long fibrelength - which can produce high counts in
weaving - together with its strength and durability.
After more than 30 years of strict state control the Egyptian government has
finally accepted that capitalist forces are required to rescue the cotton
sector from terminal decline.
The resulting process of deregulation and eventual privatisation is causing
the biggest shake-up since the sector was nationalised in the early 1960s.
The government's long term strategy in liberalising the cotton sector is to
try to regain Egypt's prominent position as a world exporter. Well before
Liverpool or New York became world centres for the cotton trade, the
Egyptian city port of Alexandria on the Mediterranean had an active futures
market - as early as 1861.
As the number one producer of premium long and extra long cotton staples,
famed for comfort and durability, the sector flourished until the mid-1970s.
Before then the cotton crop was a lucrative 10m qantars, 77 per cent of
which were exported. Local farmers planted cotton in more than twice the
area planted today (currently 840,296 feddans), and all the best designer
labels of the time were marked; 'Made With The Finest Egyptian Cotton'.
But government mismanagement has caused Egypt's cotton output, particularly
exports, to fall dramatically.
The six state-run co-operative marketing companies, which control the buying
and selling of cotton, have been offering increasingly low procurement
prices for the crop to cover the mounting costs of its monopoly.
This lack of a financial incentive caused farmers to switch to more
competitive produce which they could sell on the open market - even at the
expense of being fined for ignoring government instructions to allocate a
certain acreage of their land to cotton. Thus cultivation techniques became
sloppy and yields fell.
At the same time, mounting inefficiencies ate into the 12 public sector
spinning and weaving mills. They did not have to compete for their work;
they became beset by problems of excess labour and outdated technology.
Deterioration of quality went side by side with mounting debts.
As more and more subsidies were pumped into flagging operations, the
government-fixed cotton prices rose above the international market. Foreign
demand diminished. Among cotton traders Egypt became known as expensive and
unreliable. On top of all this, the collapse of important markets in the
former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, which received 40 per cent of
exports, and an overall glut in world cotton supplies, exacerbated the
decline.
As a result, cotton exports plummeted from 7.5m qantars in the 1960-1961
season to 3.29m qantars in 1980-1981 - and just 360,000 qantars in
1990-1991. Gross lint revenues were worth only Dollars 52m in 1991-1992 and
Dollars 43m last year, leaving cotton as the country's sixth main source of
foreign exchange after rice. Faced with the eventual bureaucratic
strangulation of cotton farming in Egypt, the government decided once again
to open up to the private sector.
A new law, which is expected to be on the statute books in September 1994,
in time for the coming season, will formalise this transition. Plans are
under way to re-open the spot price Mina Al Basal Cotton Exchange in
Alexandria and the sector will be open to private competition.
'The new law will finally give choice to those working in cotton,' explains
Mr Ahmad Shouman, chairman of the state-owned Cotton and International Trade
Company, who has helped to draft the law. 'Suddenly farmers will be able to
choose at what price they sell. Traders will choose which spinning and
weaving mills to use. Clothes manufacturers will choose which yarn or fibre
they want. They will all be free to do what they like,' he says from his
office in Alexandria.
In an attempt to cushion the shock of price changes when the exchange opens,
the government has raised the price at which cotton is bought from farmers,
and lowered its export rates closer to the international market. This, along
with a concerted effort by the state to improve yields through a more
refined use of pesticides, resulted in a 22 per cent rise in output last
season over 1991-1992, from 5.8m qantars to 7.1m qantars, and a slight rise
in export volumes.
On the input side, subsidies on cotton seed, fertilisers, pesticides, and
irrigation costs are due to be completely scrapped this season, and their
supply also opened to the private sector.
This will wipe away sizeable government outlays. A report prepared by the
American embassy in Cairo calculates that despite a 50 per cent reduction in
fertiliser subsidies, it still cost the government EPounds 25m in 1992-1993,
while pest control cost EPounds 112m.
Some farmers in the Delta region fear that the cut in subsidies, together
with the expected drop in cotton prices when the exchange opens, will make
cotton less profitable. Mr Madi Fayez Taboul, who rents 25 acres of land
from the government near Alexandria, says that he has not planted cotton
this year because he has no idea what its price will be. 'When I sell to the
government I know what I'll get - but now I don't know what's happening,' he
complains.
Textiles manufacturers and cotton traders, however, are more sanguine about
the changes. 'Only those making money without work have been cornered,' says
Mr Fathi Ahmad Ali, chairman of Egypt's second largest spinning and weaving
factory (which is 100 per cent state owned), looking forward to more
competitive prices.
Most observers agree that those with the most to gain from the
liberalisation programme will be the exporters. Mr Said Haggag, managing
director of Alcotan, the public trading company, says that cotton exporters
will be able to focus on recapturing the world market in the premium ELS
cotton varieties which have been losing ground over the past decade to
American grown Pima cotton.
For local consumption, spinners and clothes manufacturers do not require the
high quality of ELS and are increasingly turning to imported medium and
coarse cotton varieties. About 1m qantars of medium and short staple
American cotton are normally imported in a year, making up nearly one fifth
of local consumption. But with US cotton selling locally at Dollars 0.74/lb
compared with over Dollars 1.5/lb for Egyptian varieties, this share is
likely to widen as the textiles industry is given more freedom of choice.
Mr Shouman believes that by the end of the century more than half of Egypt's
cotton output will be exported in the form of either yarn, fabric or high
quality clothing while the local market will mainly import foreign cottons.
'Whatever the balance, it will be for the market to decide,' he says.

FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (10): Put your shirt on it - The textile
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year the Egyptian shirt was added to the host of thorny trade issues
taxing American government officials.
Exports of shirts to the US rose by a record 569 per cent in 1993 - to 6.5m
shirts worth Dollars 30m - and American trade negotiators have called for a
quota to prevent further rises.
Such a reaction has astonished those working in Egypt's textiles industry.
The US exports over Dollars 2bn worth of goods to Egypt every year, compared
to a total of only Dollars 450m in Egyptian exports to the US, so the
shirt-makers complain that the Egyptian shirt hardly threatens the balance
of trade.
On the one hand the dispute is a serious concern to the Egyptian government.
On the other, it is proof that the country's structural adjustment programme
is at least working successfully in the field of ready-made garments.
The textiles sector is Egypt's oldest and largest manufacturing base. It
contributes to the economy an annual EPounds 4bn, of which exports account
for about EPounds 1.7bn. But for years it has been dogged by problems of
excess labour, outdated technology, and a lack of quality control as a
result of the state's monopoly over cotton and most of the country's
spinning and weaving mills.
But future prospects are bright. A growing number of flourishing small
clothes manufacturers in the private sector are breathing renewed life into
the business.
There are between 500 and 600 medium-sized, mainly state, textile factories
and over 1,000 cottage industry operations in Egypt. However, 90 per cent of
the ready-made garments sector is in private hands, ranging from traditional
tailors to sophisticated manufacturers producing garments under franchises
from, for example, Italy's Benetton, America's Wrangler, and France's Naf
Naf. Most focused on the domestic market. Many are now gearing up for
lucrative foreign markets.
Mr Samir el Serafy, a director of a private sector clothes factory in
Alexandria, believes that the future of Egypt's textiles industry no longer
lies with the large-scale public sector manufacturers of cloth and fabric,
but with smaller, privately-run producers of finished goods.
'The decline in the cotton sector and its export market has created a market
for ready-made clothes which is better achieved by the private sector than
the state,' he says. The secret of their success, he claims, is a strict
policy of quality control. 'This is where we can beat the public sector
hands down.'
Mr Serafy's company, Societe Franco Egyptienne de Confection, exports
clothes and other garments to the Gulf states, France and the UK (where he
supplies the retail company Habitat with curtains, table-cloths and
bed-sheets). He employs about 400 staff, and many of his designs are
manufactured under a franchise from the French company Indreco.
With an annual turnover of EPounds 10m-EPounds 11m, the company began
pushing its exports last year and has already earned over EPounds 340,000 in
foreign sales in the first three months of 1994.
The private sector's total output of cloth - that is, finished clothes and
fabric - was about 85,000 tonnes in 1993; tiny, compared to the public
sector's output of about 130,000 tonnes. But this balance is likely to
change as the private sector expands and the state eventually sells off its
spinning and weaving operations.
In the meantime the public sector, where output is mostly yarn and fabric,
is also keen to take a part of the ready-made garment market.
Mr Fathi Ahmad Ali, who recently became head of the publicly-owned Misr Fine
Spinning and Weaving company with a staff of 25,000, annual turnover of
EPounds 450m and exports of EPounds 200m, also argues that the only way to
turn round losses of EPounds 60m a year is to improve the quality of its
output.
The expected freeing of Egyptian cotton prices later this year and an
eventual lowering of tariffs, should benefit the textiles sector. As a
signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), most
Egyptian clothes manufacturers support abolition of the multi-fibre
agreement.
The manufacturers say that they do not fear competition from east Asian
producers when protectionist measures are removed. They argue that
production costs will be kept low by importing medium to short staple cotton
from abroad, instead of using the relatively expensive and high quality home
grown extra-long and long staples, and employing cheap but skilled labour.
If they succeed, then the era of the Egyptian shirt has only just begun.

FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (8): Jump start to future hopes -
Developments in high technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FIONA MOFFAT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Egypt is aiming to jump-start its sluggish economy by attracting investment
from international high-technology firms in its Pyramids Technology Valley
(PTV), instigated in 1989 by the Cabinet Information and Decision Support
Centre (IDSC).
PTV has gained increased relevance in the past year following the sharp
decline in the country's previously flourishing tourism industry, the fall
in oil revenues, and general stagnation in most export sectors. Mr Hisham El
Sherif, PTV initiator and IDSC chairman, insists that there is now both the
money and political will to implement this highly ambitious scheme. 'High
technology will be the oil of the future,' he says.
The aim is to develop a world class, export-based industry. Two science
parks - 'technopolis' - are planned in the 6th October industrial satellite
city. The Suez Canal governorate of Ismailia is offering a range of
financial incentives including free zone privileges for both the local as
well as the export market. The hope is that Egypt would then be in a
position to capture a share of the growing Dollars 800bn international
information technology (IT) market already successfully entered by other
developing countries such as India and Singapore.
A report commissioned by the IDSC from Dataquest, the international
consultants, suggests that although Egypt's IT industry is small - annual
production is about Dollars 172m - the opportunities are enormous, but only
if global manufacturing companies will act as engines of growth.
The report concludes that local high tech production could be worth Dollars
2.5bn a year within five to seven years. Dollars 1.5bn would come from
export revenues, creating 60,000 job opportunities and increasing GNP by
between 3 per cent and 5 per cent a year. Most of this would be software.
While such figures should be taken with a degree of caution, there is broad
agreement within the industry that software is Egypt's obvious niche in the
global market. In the increasingly price-conscious environment, Egypt has in
abundance what big software companies really need: a large pool of cheap
trained labour.
In return, international software houses offer Egypt the benefits of
technology transfer. 'Software development is mainly man hours,' notes Mr
Hesham Gabr, general manager of Bull, the French IT group, which is planning
to build a software factory in a PTV technopolis.
Bull, which is one of only four big IT companies with a subsidiary based in
Cairo (the others are IBM, ICL and AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions,
formerly NCL), estimates that Egyptian software engineers are about 30 per
cent cheaper than those at its base in Paris. IBM places Egyptian labour
costs at about half those in Europe and the US.
But this can be a mixed blessing. Local computer firms complain about a
steady leakage of trained personnel to higher paid jobs in Saudi Arabia and
the Gulf. However, Mr Ali El Hefnaoui, PTV's general manager, cautions that
Egypt's competitive advantage in labour costs is likely to continue for only
another 10 years as wages continue to rise towards international levels.
'Engineers with good basic computer science skills are easily available, but
there is still a need to build skills for large complex project management
and system design,' says Mr Amin Khaireldin, manager of IBM's Cairo-based
software Arabisation centre. PTV seeks to address this through two recently
established institutes which take about 1,300 honour graduates a year and
train them up to international standards.
Labour issues aside, Egyptian officials say that Egypt's lead role in the
region allows easy access to the markets of the Middle East, particularly
the high-growth markets of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf. Egypt is also a
stepping stone to Africa and backyard development for Europe - and if
regional peace becomes a reality, for Israel.
The answer is 'marketing, marketing, and more marketing,' according to IDSC
chairman El Sherif, to capitalise on the country's competitive advantages.
PTV has started to sponsor Egyptian pavilions at important trade fairs, and
a software association is in the process of being formed under the aegis of
PTV. But still too much is being left to the individual level - too small to
attract the big participants. 'Egypt has not positioned itself in the global
market as yet,' comments Mr Adel Danish, managing director of the local
Standardata, which also has offices in the US and France. 'The messages have
been too diffuse and too few.'
Mr Danish, who is also chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Egypt's IT committee, advocates an aggressive government strategy linking
big public sector contracts to work executed in Egypt, to start the ball
rolling. There are, however, reservations among local firms as to whether
those at the highest level are willing to act, in effect, as salesmen.

FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (7): Bureaucracy is a barrier - Gulf Arab
investment now comes mainly from the private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The scale and structure of Gulf Arab investments in Egypt have changed
dramatically in the last decade and a half, away from Gulf governments' aid
and cash disbursements amounting to billions of dollars a year, towards
selective private sector investments involving only hundreds of millions.
Before Egypt broke ranks with the rest of the Arab world to sign the 1978
and 1979 peace agreements with Israel, Gulf governments propped up the
Egyptian economy through their various aid agencies as well as through state
investments.
Little is heard these days, however, about heady projects such as, say, the
Arab Organisation for Industrialisation (AOI). A Dollars 2bn investment
established in 1975, jointly owned by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and
Qatar, it was to have been the Arab world's workshop for military hardware.
At its height this single investment employed 17,000 people. But AOI, and
all other aid and investments from Gulf governments, was abruptly halted
after Egypt broke ranks.
AOI still functions well under sole Egyptian ownership. It produces tanks
and aircraft for Egypt's own use, as well as civil products such as optics,
agricultural machinery and steel for sewerage systems. But apart from some
cash pay-outs during and after the Gulf crisis of 1990-1991, Gulf
governments have all but stopped investments on their former scale. For one
thing, they no longer have the money they had in the late 1970s.
On the other hand, private investors from Gulf countries do have the money.
But their investments are based not on political but on purely financial
considerations, and the amounts involved are much less. In aggregate, they
do not amount to more than 70 per cent of Gulf governments' single
investment in AOI.
According to the Cairo branch of Jordan's Arab Bank, the total value of
non-Egyptian Arab investment projects approved at the end of last June
amounted to Dollars 1.42bn, of which Gulf Arab investors from Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and the UAE made up Dollars 916m, some 65 per cent of the total.
Saudi Arabia alone accounted for 41 per cent of outside Arab investments.
But despite the relative scarcity of Gulf Arab investments  - and they
probably do not include direct purchases of some real estate, such as second
homes - the total is still marginally greater than private investments from
the west.
Gulf Arab investments are heavily concentrated in financial institutions -
more than 60 per cent - with about 20 per cent of the total in industry and
some 12 per cent in services such as hotels and tourism companies.
One of the most significant Gulf companies is Gulf Arab Investment Company,
Cairo-based, an Egyptian free-zone joint stock company with a paid-in
capital and reserves (last June) of Dollars 46.5m and total assets of
Dollars 51.3m. Owned by private investors from Bahrain and Saudi Arabia as
well as from Egypt, GAIC operates on classical merchant banking lines -
buying into companies, improving and selling them.
The Saudis are becoming more deeply involved than other Gulf investors.
Their interests in Egyptian industry range from cement to aluminium to
edible oil plants. The Saudi Bugshan brothers have a 20 per cent interest
with Pepsi-Cola - and with a local firm - in a joint venture which paid
about Dollars 52m earlier this year for Egyptian Bottling (which bottles
Pepsi).
The precise extent of Gulf Arab direct investments in property - either
personal homes or hotels - is almost impossible to quantify. Several hotels
in Cairo and Heliopolis, including the Gezira Sheraton, the Meridien and the
Al-Salaam Swiss hotel, are partly or wholly owned by Gulf nationals or
institutions.
Although this is a bad time for the tourist trade because of violent
activity by Islamic activists - the typical volume of western tourism,
according to one local banker, is down by as much as 80 per cent - the
financial loss may only be as low as 50 per cent, because one Saudi or Gulf
Arab family is reckoned to spend 15 times as much as a western package
tourist. But Gulf-owned investments on the Red Sea and in Sinai, which rely
almost entirely on western package tours, have been badly affected.
There are formidable barriers to the growth of private sector Gulf Arab
investments, common to all outside investors and to wealthy Egyptians whose
money is abroad.
The first is the bureaucratic barrier. 'There are 26,000 laws in Egypt,'
says one Egyptian banker, who acknowledges that daily frustration gets the
better of her patriotic ideals. 'Each new law is added to, rather than
superseding, an old one. For any investor, there is always the risk of a
bureaucrat plucking an old unused law off the shelf, blowing away the dust,
and applying it today.'
A second deterrent is the twin elements of government ineptitude and lack of
commitment. One Egyptian banker in Cairo says: 'It is true that exchange
controls have been eased, and in theory you can repatriate profits. But any
foreign investor needs to be very careful. Get a good lawyer. The laws and
their application are contradictory.'
A third factor, perhaps more a potential deterrent than an actual one, is
the economic recovery in Lebanon which causes Gulf Arabs to think twice
before they make an investment in Egypt.
A fourth reason is the amount of money which the Egyptian private sector
itself is reputed to keep outside the country. Guesses as to how much vary
to a startling degree. One western diplomat puts it at 'not less than
Dollars 4bn, and it could be as high as Dollars 16bn.' Egyptian estimates
vary between Dollars 20bn and 'not less than Dollars 100bn.'
It is hardly surprising that many Gulf investors will not put their money
where Egyptians themselves fear to tread.

FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (5): Sales will help balances - Banking is
approaching a milestone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next June should be a milestone for Egypt's banking system. If the four
public sector banks, National Bank of Egypt, Banque Misr, Banque du Caire,
and Bank of Alexandria stick to the government's stated intentions, by June
they should have announced plans to sell their shares in about a dozen joint
venture commercial banks to the private sector.
These shares constitute the 'jewels in the crown' among the assets on the
books of public sector banks. Their sale is intended to strengthen their
balance sheets, before they in turn are privatised according to the
timetable discussed between the government, the IMF and World Bank.
Cairo bankers say that defining the different categories of bank is about as
straightforward as local interpretation of the highway code. The four public
sector banks dominate national retail and domestic credit with about 70 per
cent of deposits and local corporate assets.
Apart from these four there are more than 40 commercial banks: a mixture of
domestic public and private sector joint ventures; private sector foreign
and local joint-ventures; foreign commercial banks which are allowed to deal
in local currency - among these some which offer investment banking
services; foreign banks which have not met the extra Dollars 15m capital
requirement and are therefore restricted to foreign currencies (some of
these last also offer investment banking services like private banking).
There are also some 15 investment banks which are defined as such, including
international Arab banks and off-shore banking units and at least one with
special status. Finally there are about 30 domestic regional development
banks, some of which are commercial banks, others specialist industrial or
agricultural.
The central bank, in its latest annual report (for the fiscal year July 1
1992-June 30 1993) notes that the securities' portfolios of all banks in
this period amounted to 49.8 per cent of their total loan portfolios, and
that T-bill holdings made up 89.7 per cent of these securities.
'In the last year there were limited first-class lending opportunities,' one
joint-venture banker said in March.
But banks' earnings held up well, because until last autumn all banks could
arbitrage on these T-bills, available to foreign investors as well as local
banks. All banks could get extra funds at 14-15 per cent from the interbank
market, while paying only 9.5-10.5 per cent on customer deposits. The
surplus liquidity was going into T-bills. 'It was a good margin and tax-free
after all expenses,' said one banker.
Then the central bank realised the extent to which commercial banks were
'just playing the market,' and barred private commercial banks from bidding.
Now only public sector banks can bid.
But there are opportunities from trade financing and short-term corporate
lending. Egyptian British Bank increased profits by 270 per cent last fiscal
year (to June 30) by improving market share and trade financing, but like
most local and joint-venture banks it made little headway in retail or
consumer lending. 'The timing is not right to push consumer lending,' says
one private sector banker.
The appointment last October of Mr Ismail Hassan, the former head of bank of
Alexandria, smallest of the four public sector banks, as central bank
governor, was generally well-received.
He is credited in some quarters with having successfully restructured Misr
American International Bank. 'He is not an initiator,' one banker remarked.
Another added: 'But everything moves slowly here and that is the natural
pace.'
Among joint-venture banks Misr International is held up as 'well-run'. It is
a fairly typical example of a polyglot public and private sector bank with
foreign and domestic shareholdings.
Egyptian-American is a joint venture between Bank of Alexandria (which has a
stake in no fewer than four joint venture banks) and American Express, which
is also a partner in Egyptian-American bank. In addition, Amex in its own
right is one of four foreign banks allowed to deal in local currency. The
others are Citibank, Jordan's Arab Bank and Credit Lyonnais.
Others expected to increase their capital by the required Dollars 15m to get
their licence amended so they could deal in local currency, but which have
not done so, include Bank of America, Banque Paribas and Credit Suisse.
Banca Commerciale Italiana has pulled out altogether.
Paribas is counter-guaranteeing the first - Dollars 8.8m - corporate bond
issue for the German joint-venture Hoechst Orient. By the end of March,
however, after long delays waiting for members of the Capital Markets
Authority to be appointed, this had still not received the go-ahead from the
CMA.
Commercial International Bank (CIB) is an example not only of the polyglot
nature of some banks' shareholdings, but also of the strength and weaknesses
of the capital markets and the investing public.
A year ago it decided to raise about Dollars 115m through a public offering
to increase its paid-up capital. Prior to that some shares were held by the
staff, but to all intents and purposes, National Bank of Egypt had full
control. The issue last October was 50 per cent oversubscribed. Some of the
new shares were bought by the International Finance Corporation, the World
Bank's private sector affiliate; others by two Saudi institutions. More than
half the subscribers were individual investors.
CIB's earnings in the run-up to the share issue had been very good: 20 per
cent annual compound growth based on shares of EPounds 100 par value.
However, when CIB floated it was at a share price of EPounds 250. 'It will
be very difficult to sustain such a growth based on that share price,' said
one foreign banker, 'and too many individuals will not have appreciated
this. This market is not an emerging market; it is 'pre-emerging' in the
level of investors' understanding and the lack of any stock market.'
What worries professional bankers, Arab and western, who remain unconvinced
by high-sounding statements of intent from officials about liberalising the
economy, is that there is not only less growth and more poverty, but also
that the public sector still has a stranglehold: 75 per cent of GDP compared
with 80 per cent in 1991.
'Let's see what happens in June; that will be the litmus test,' says one.

FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (6): Coffee house atmosphere - The Cairo
stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For romantic connoisseurs of emerging markets, Egypt's stock exchange in
downtown Cairo still has that classic coffee house ambience.
Aside from its recently added computer screens which now display the latest
share prices, the physical appearance of the bourse has changed little since
colonial times. The only problem is that more cups of coffee are drunk there
than shares are traded.
Since the country's vociferous programme of nationalisation in the late
1950s and early 1960s, under the presidency of Gamal Abdel-Nasser, what was
in its day the world's fifth largest securities market has been reduced to
little more than a maverick's cafe. Out of the 674 companies listed,
scarcely more than 15 are actively traded, resulting in a highly illiquid
and volatile exchange.
Official market data is scarce and, when it exists, spurious. A number of
local brokerage firms have begun compiling their own market reports, but
even these differ widely.
Perhaps the best reflection of the market's float was the description, in a
recent Cairo newspaper article, of a fall in the price of shares in the Suez
Cement Company, one of the more active listings which has a 21 per cent
public holding, as 'a mini stock market crash'.
This is not the stuff which makes emerging market fund managers rush to
bring out a new prospectus. But salutary steps are taking place to reverse
this decline. By next year, Egypt may well be vying for a place on
international investors' portfolios.
The revitalisation of the country's financial markets is a crucial item on
Egypt's structural adjustment programme. The Capital Markets Law, passed in
April 1993 and slowly bringing results, aims to go some way towards this
end. The law provides for the establishment of modern brokerage firms and
merchant bankers; investment vehicles such as mutual funds; the use of debt
instruments and corporate bonds; stringent disclosure and transparency
requirements for listed companies; and tax advantages to both floated
companies and investors.
Results so far include Egypt's first mutual fund, set up by the National
Bank of Egypt, worth EPounds 100m. Hoechst Orient, the German/Egyptian
joint-venture pharmaceutical company, is issuing the first ever corporate
bond: a EPounds 30m issue with a five year maturity, underwritten by Banque
Paribas.
Cairo's stock exchange has been linked by computer to the bourse in
Alexandria, thus reducing the discrepancy in prices between the two
exchanges. And a string of corporate brokerage firms are rapidly being
formed amid high expectations.
The new regulations give a free run to foreign investors on the market, with
no ownership limits - although companies' own bylaws may be restrictive -
and no tax on dividends or capital repatriation. Furthermore, with the
commercial banks awash with liquidity, resources are there to fuel domestic
demand for shares. The only thing missing is the paper to invest in.
Despite this, interest in the market is on the rise. According to figures
complied by the Egyptian Financial Group (EFG), the current market
capitalisation of the 15 or so companies which are actively traded is
EPounds 11.5bn - this includes tranches in cement and textiles companies and
a few banks. Last year's turnover was about EPounds 1.1bn and the average
price/earning ratio has risen from 5.2 to 8.2 over the past year. The EFG
Index is up by 19 per cent since January 1994 after a 38 per cent increase
in 1993.
'The market has witnessed an upwards shift in demand without an increase in
supply. Gradually more people are participating, in anticipation of what is
to come,' explains Mr Hisham Tawfik of EFG.
The most exciting source of new scrip is an ambitious privatisation
programme.
The government has undertaken to sell half of its assets in 314 state
enterprises by the end of 1995. But difficulties in valuing company assets,
overcoming huge debts and finding the political will to 'sell the family
silver' have so far hindered any outright sales. Furthermore, a new share
issue by the state-owned Commercial International Bank (CIB) did little to
impress investors with the public sector's ability to organise a flotation.
The CIB issued 1.5m shares to raise its capital by public flotation last
September. The issue was 50 per cent oversubscribed. Eight months later, the
6,049 new subscribers had still not received their share certificates.
Because informal trading of receipts is illegal, the new shareholders were
unable to act upon their investments - a bad precedent for future
subscriptions.
Most local analysts argue that a strong signal from the government, proving
its commitment to free markets, is essential before Egypt's stock exchange
re-emerges. Otherwise, Cairo's downtown bourse will retain its quaint coffee
house feel.

FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (3): Slow response to reforms - Mark
Nicholson finds private investment levels disappointing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By almost any measure the levels of private investment in Egypt, both
foreign and local, are a big disappointment.
They are particularly so, given the successful macro-economic stability
achieved during the past two and a half years of reforms steered by the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
These reforms were designed to create the conditions for robust private
investment and job-creating growth. The fact that neither has followed
Egypt's remarkable monetary and fiscal achievements proves that such reforms
provide only a necessary condition for such growth.
Creating an investment environment sufficient for growth rates capable of
absorbing Egypt's annual flood of new labour market entrants is, however,
proving a complex and intractable task. Economists in Cairo suggest that
there is no single easy answer.
Economists, bankers, businessmen and investment agencies concur in blaming a
raft of reasons, ranging from the psychological to the petty bureaucratic,
for the dim showing of private investment. But most people also agree that
Egypt is not short of profitable things in which to invest. 'There are
certainly far more opportunities here than the attention Egypt is getting,'
says Ms Anahid Harrisson, director of the EU-backed European-Egyptian
Investment Promotion Programme.
Hard numbers on investment levels in Egypt are scarce and official figures,
where available, are unreliable guides. One fact, however, is clear: that
the decline in public sector investment, which is a concomitant of the
IMF-inspired reform programme, has left a gap which is a long way from being
filled by the local private sector or foreign investors.
A recent International Finance Company report on private investment in
developing countries notes that private investment in Egypt was
'considerably below other regional countries', and shows that between 1985
and 1992 gross investment shrank from 26.7 per cent of GDP to 18.2 per cent.
Public sector investment almost halved - from 20.5 per cent in 1985 to 10.4
per cent in 1992. Private sector investment edged up to 7.8 per cent over
those seven years from 6.1 per cent of GDP.
It is difficult accurately to break down private investment between domestic
and foreign flows.
The General Authority for Investments, which handles the bulk of foreign
investment approvals, estimates that 57 per cent of total private investment
is domestic, 22 per cent from Arab countries and the remainder from the rest
of the world. However, these figures refer only to projects approved rather
than actually pursued.
The slow response of domestic investors to the increasingly deregulated and
stable economy of the past two years is perhaps the biggest disappointment
to the advocates of Egypt's drastic reforms.
In particular, economists say they have seen little of what they estimate to
be tens of billions of dollars worth of Egyptian flight capital - some
people put the figure at Dollars 60bn - returning to the country in
productive projects. Some money has returned, but bankers say that much of
it is invested short-term on local treasury bills, which presently offer a
rate of just under 14 per cent.
Part of the reason for the lack of response appears to be psychological.
'Many of Egypt's wealthiest potential investors have been badly hurt before
by sudden shifts of government policy,' says one Cairo banker. 'These people
are unlikely to commit themselves until they are more certain about the
government's commitment to the private sector in the country.'
In this regard, there is a unanimous feeling among bankers and businessmen
that the best signal the government could send such investors - and
potential foreign investors - would be vigorous pursuit of its proposed
privatisation programme. 'That would clearly send the message that the
government's reforms are irreversible,' says an economist.
However, there is also unanimity in the view that the glacial pace of
privatisation, and the government's shifts and wriggles in pursuing World
Bank targets for company and asset sales, has sent precisely the wrong
signal.
Another reason for the slow pick-up of the local private sector, according
to local economists such as Ms Heba Handoussa, head of the World Bank-funded
Economic Research Forum in Cairo, is that it is still adjusting to the
painful shock of the past two years' reforms. 'To get the private sector to
make up for the loss in public investment when demand is down is asking a
lot.'
Added to the shock of real interest rates (a novelty for the private sector
since 1991, after years of negative rates before the IMF-led reforms) are
higher fuel and energy prices, tariff cuts, tax reforms and overall price
deregulation. All these have made the environment for local business
considerably tougher.
But even with the present high interest rates - about 7 per cent in real
terms - there are a few encouraging signs. Bank claims on the private
sector, for instance, are up 19 per cent in 1993 on a year earlier.
The modest levels of foreign direct investment in Egypt are possibly more
surprising, given the government's macro-economic success - something which,
in fellow IMF-reformed countries such as Tunisia and Morocco, has helped
spark a substantial rise in foreign interest. Here, too, analysts partly
blame psychological factors for Egypt's limited success.
One such, clearly, is the negative effect of the past 18 months' rise in
Islamic militancy and the attacks on tourist targets. Before these attacks
the tourism sector was far and away the most powerful magnet for both local
and foreign investment (other than the oil and gas sector, which obeys its
own quite distinct rules and has for a long time attracted the bulk of gross
inward investment.) New tourism ventures, however, have almost dried up.
Another factor is Egypt's reputation for cumbersome bureaucracy. But local
businessmen and experienced investors in the country suggest that this is a
two-edged sword, and that in any case that Egypt's reputation for red tape
is increasingly overstated.
The double edge of Egypt's bureaucracy is simply that while such time and
paper-consuming barriers to investment exist, they provide something of a
shelter behind which greater returns are possible than in more open
economies.
'The rates of return here rank among the highest in the world, partly
because of the bureaucratic constraints.' says Mr Farouk Nasser, who chairs
the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt's investment committee. He says
that some of the bigger foreign investors are able to show returns on equity
of as much as 40 per cent, once they have mastered the system.
Such mastery - which critically requires finding good local counterparts for
an investment - is also considered by many of the country's bigger investors
to be no more difficult than in other developing markets. In fact, Egypt has
considerably streamlined its investment approval system in the past three
years and a recent study of European investors in Egypt found 'significant
improvement in the investment environment, from both the operational and
regulatory perspective, particularly within the last 12 months.'
Most foreign investments must be approved by the General Authority for
Investment (GAFI). Its director, Mr Mohieddin el-Ghareeb, is at pains to
characterise the authority as a provider of investment services rather than
a regulatory or approvals body. And increasingly, investment agencies report
that this seems to be true, with many investors reportedly happy that they
can at least achieve most of the necessary bureaucracy through a single
body.
Mr el-Ghareeb also claims that investment these days is 'automatically
approved' - which is truer than it was since the 'negative list' of sectors,
in which investment requires case by case approval, has been trimmed to
embrace only military industries, tobacco and investments in Sinai.
Nevertheless, the GAFI board meets infrequently, partly because it is
chaired by Mr Hosni Mubarak, the president, himself, which means that
investors can wait up to eight months to receive final approval for a
project.
This sort of delay is among the chief complaints made by investment bodies
in Egypt. Another is the government's apparent reluctance to sell itself
harder to foreign investors and emphasise investment benefits which,
according to Mr James Pringle, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce,
include 'world class, competitive incentives'. Alongside Egypt's chief
attractions of cheap labour costs - ranging, for example, from about Dollars
60 a month for semi-skilled labour to Dollars 700 a month for managerial
staff - and a 60m local market, these include access to preferential trade
agreements with the Gulf, and tax holidays of up to 10 years for investment
in prescribed industrial zones.
At present, such investment promotion as exists is in the hands of small
lobbies such as the American Chamber of Commerce, its German equivalent and
the EEIPP, which is soon to be replaced by another EU-backed body.
What seems to be lacking is a concerted push from the Egyptian government
itself - a push conspicuously present in regional competitors such as
Morocco, Tunisia or the Gulf states.

FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (4): Beyond the bureaucrats - The informal
economy is a necessity of life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is impossible to get by in Egypt without making use of the informal
economy.
Taking a taxi, getting a leaking pipe fixed, having laundry or ironing done,
repairing a car and a host of other services are all largely the preserve of
the informal sector. A good range of products, too - items ranging from
tourist souvenirs to furniture - are put together in small workshops, many
or even most of them unlicenced or otherwise outside the reach of the
bureaucrats.
And it is becoming increasingly clear to economists and businessmen vexed by
the task of heaving Egypt's leviathan economy to higher levels of growth
that perhaps the country itself cannot get by without making better use of
its informal sector.
According to most estimates and most definitions of what precisely
constitutes the informal sector, it is the biggest part of Egypt's private
sector. As such, many believe that fostering its faster expansion may prove
more effective than livening up foreign investment or Egypt's traditional
business elite as a means to growth. The trick would be to find a way to
manage it.
It is easy to give an estimated magnitude for the informal sector, but it is
impossible to calculate precisely its dimensions - not least in a country
where basic economic statistics on more observable phenomena are pretty
hit-and-miss. Moreover, no specific study has been published on the size of
the private sector which operates beyond state registration or the reach of
the tax man.
Existing data in Egypt on the informal sector tend to be based on evaluating
the extent of small enterprises. Some of these enterprises are - and others
are not - 'formal', in the sense of being licensed, registered or
tax-paying.
However, research conducted by Mr Marcelo Guigale, the World Bank's resident
economist in Cairo, leads him to estimate that up to 99 per cent of all
private sector units in the country employ fewer than nine people. These, he
reckons, account for 80 per cent of the country's overall private sector
employment and 75 per cent of the private sector's value-added.
Furthermore, according to Ms Heba Handoussa, head of the Economic Research
Forum in Cairo, the sector has been booming. She argues that it is into this
part of the economy that large chunks of Egypt's worker remittances are
funnelled. 'That's the potential for the future,' she says. 'You have this
vast mass of individuals in the lower income bracket who have this vast flow
of funds available to them - and continuing at consistent levels.'
The size of Egypt's informal sector already helps to explain how the country
somehow has managed to absorb so many new entrants to the labour force each
year. But Ms Handoussa and others believe that finding ways for the sector
to expand will provide the single most important means of addressing Egypt's
continuing acute need to create yet more jobs. 'Until now, the whole system
has been geared to ignoring these small enterprises and pretending they
don't exist,' she says.
Mr Farouk Nasser, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce's investment
committee, also believes attention should be turned, as a matter of urgency,
to somehow supporting the 'unclassified and undisclosed' economy. 'The only
hope lies in the 25 per cent of the country's workers who work in the black
economy,' he says. He adds that it is a question of finding ways to give
such small enterprises credit, easing their access to property for expansion
and other means of support, but without scaring them away by overtaxing
them.
But that would be a delicate trick. Many of Egypt's atomised tens of
thousands of small workshops and enterprises keep themselves small to stay
out of the way of the tax man and the dreaded bureaucrat. Egypt's informal
sector flourishes despite the government, and by minding its own business.
The 3m-4m workers in the sector might quite plausibly have concluded, given
the state of the rest of the economy around them, that small is more
beautiful.

FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (2): Private sector development stalls -
Conflicting signals in the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON

<TEXT>
Three years ago, when Egypt agreed to undertake its present drastic and
comprehensive programme of economic reforms, many observers in the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which designed the present
adjustment plan, doubted the country could ever come as far as it has.
In 1991 the country was in a parlous state. Hard currency reserves sufficed
to cover only two weeks of imports. Mr Atef Sidki, the prime minister, was
speaking alarmingly of Egypt having to default on some of its Dollars 40bn
worth of foreign debt.
Given the urgency of Egypt's economic crisis and the political goodwill of
its creditor nations for the country's firmly pro-western stand during the
Gulf war, the Paris Club struck a deal with the government to make a
staggered write-off of no less than half of the outstanding debt,
conditional on the country undertaking a complete IMF and World Bank
programme.
Egypt's remarkable macro-economic progress so far has already triggered two
tranches of debt write-off, each of 15 per cent of the country's debt as of
December 31 1990. The third and final tranche of 20 per cent, worth between
Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn, is due to follow in July, if the IMF approves
Egypt's progress with the reforms under the three-year Extended Fund
Facility agreed last year. Some ministers are already trumpeting their
confidence that the approval will be granted without much problem.
But it is in fact not clear that the IMF's approval will be such plain
sailing.
While the Fund can be only delighted with the continued success of Egypt's
macro-economic stabilisation programme, the course of structural adjustments
designed to foster private sector-led growth looks increasingly troubled. In
particular, the privatisation programme monitored by the World Bank -
considered by the Bank and most investors to be the most important signal of
the government's will to sustain and deepen its liberalising overhaul of the
economy - is badly stalled.
The government's apparent reluctance to move beyond a snail's pace with
privatisation is, however, already sending the wrong signals. In the wake of
the macro-economic reforms, among the chief reasons for the lack of
investment is a continued lack of confidence among local investors in the
government's real will to remove itself from its continued dominance of most
of the economy.
There is a widely-voiced view among bankers and businessmen that the
government is essentially intent on achieving the remaining debt write- off
under the Paris Club agreement - and that once this is won, neither the IMF
nor the Bank will retain their present leverage to push through the further
reforms necessary to create real growth. The risk for the government is that
such doubts about its will to reform without this kind of pressure is
already creating jitters which could eventually jeopardise the already
fragile stabilisation policies.
For now, however, the macro-economic achievements continue. The budget
deficit, which topped 20 per cent before the IMF programme, is down to 4.7
per cent and due to fall further - to 2.6 per cent this year. Inflation is
down from over 10 per cent last year to 7.4 per cent. The balance of
payments remains in surplus. In large part this is thanks to an improved
flow of remittances, averaging about Dollars 5bn a year, partly attracted by
the real domestic interest rates, which themselves have helped keep the
exchange rate largely stable at about EPounds 3.37 to the dollar. Hard
currency reserves are stable at about Dollars 16bn - a year and a half's
import cover.
To these successes can be added improvements in banking supervision and
legislation; improved capital markets laws; price de-controls; tariff cuts;
introduction of a proto-value added sales tax; a new unified income tax law
and an overall easing of investment regulations.
There remain points of issue with the IMF and the Bank. For example, both
would like to see energy prices rise closer to world levels - something the
government is resisting, as politically unsustainable. Both are also
irritated that while Egypt agreed to cut maximum tariff rates this year to
70 from 80 per cent (as part of a cascade of cuts towards a 40 per cent
maximum), the government simultaneously added a new 'user fee' of 5 per
cent.
But the biggest bone of contention remains privatisation.
The last visiting World Bank mission to monitor the programme, in March,
left apparently deeply unimpressed with movement towards its ostensible
targets. Its members suggested that they may not feel themselves able to
advise the IMF as early as July that Egypt is making sufficient progress.
From a list of more than 80 publicly-owned assets or companies slated for
sale as far back as the end of 1992, only a handful of assets have been
sold. Only one company, a bottling group, has yet been sold, although the
sales of two others are apparently agreed and waiting only to be finalised.
Moreover, there are signs that the government is backing away from its
earlier definition of what constitutes privatisation. From having declared
its intention eventually to sell off some 314 state companies - with an
official book value of EPounds 70-EPounds 80bn - ministers are now saying
that they are 'assessing the extent to which the private sector can buy into
these companies' - which is not quite the same thing.
This week the government announced plans to turn 11 state companies,
including real estate, irrigation, public works and land reclamation firms,
as well as two engineering consultancies, into what amount to workers'
cooperatives, transferring 75 per cent of the shares to employee shareholder
associations (ESAs). The World Bank welcomed the scheme, but foreign
economists said it did not look like privatisation in the usual sense,
because the shares would not be available to outside investors.
Political fears in the National Assembly that privatisation would lead to
the sale of Egypt's 'family silver' to foreigners forced Mr Atef Obeid, the
minister responsible for the programme, to state that sales to foreigners
would take place only in 'very limited cases'.
But it is political sentiment within the cabinet which appears to be most to
blame for the stalled programme.
Partly it is the real fear for the political consequence of the likely
unemployment which would follow more thoroughgoing sales of largely
inefficient state enterprises. This is understandable in a country where
unemployment is already estimated by independent economists at about 20 per
cent. But partly, too, it seems to reflect the fact that the convinced
liberalisers and privatisers within the cabinet do not constitute an
over-riding majority.
The departure, in last year's cabinet reshuffle, of Mr Fouad Sultan, the
former tourism minister and then the government's most ardent champion of
the private sector, has only helped fuel the belief that the government is
not ideologically committed to removing itself from the economy's commanding
heights.
The upshot is exasperation among bankers, foreign investors and local
businessmen who had been positioning themselves to take advantage of
privatisation.
Several US and other foreign banks which had doggedly, and expensively, been
pursuing opportunities have thrown in the towel in the last few months.
'It's a complete sham,' says one. 'I was given all sorts of false promises
and in the end have nothing to show for it.'
Privatisation alone was never likely to create the kind of real growth the
IMF and World Bank-guided reforms were designed to achieve. But while the
stalled programme continues to undermine business confidence (as discussed
elsewhere in this survey), such growth rates look increasingly remote.
According to Mr Youssef Boutros Ghali, minister of state for international
co-operation, Egypt needs to raise growth rates to 5 or 6 per cent; rates
which might then help absorb the estimated 400,000-500,000 new entrants to
the workforce each year.
But by the best available estimates, Egypt's economy is growing modestly if
at all. Some economists estimate GDP to be declining by perhaps 1 per cent.
Others, however, suggest the there is evidence to indicates the economy may
be growing by 2 per cent.
Aside from private sector gloom, there have been other notable depressants
on growth, not all of which are susceptible to economic management. One of
these is low crude prices, which helped cap the increase in oil export
revenues last year at just over Dollars 2.1bn. More serious is the
continuing negative effects of militant attacks on tourist targets.
The tourism industry, which earned Egypt (the government rather
optimistically claims) a record Dollars 3.2bn in 1992 before the attacks
began, suffered sharp declines in 1993. According to one official European
study, tourism's overall contribution to GDP is expected to fall to 3.3 per
cent of GDP in 1993 from 8.6 per cent in 1992.
The economy is therefore hovering in what one foreign banker calls a
'discomfiting status quo'.

FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (1): Mr Mubarak still refuses to be rushed -
Economic reforms continue and political reforms are promised once the
Islamic fundamentalists are defeated. But progress is slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON

<TEXT>
President Hosni Mubarak is now well into his 13th year as Egypt's leader and
six months into a third presidential term which should see him at the helm
of the most populous Arab nation until the end of the millennium.
So it should not seem odd that he prefers to take a longer-term perspective
on his plans for the country. If Egypt is suffering hardships and
irritations (such as the recent rise in terrorism), this should not be
surprising, he explained recently. 'The government can be excused, as it is
engrossed in reforming a burdensome heritage accumulated over 50 years'.
Mr Mubarak's message is clear - and largely unchanged over the past decade
of his rule.
Liberalising economic reforms are necessary to dismantle the remaining
statist legacy of Gamal Abdul Nasser, but they will be pursued only
steadily. Wider political reforms must await the resulting economic
transformation. Militancy, which may seek to threaten this project under the
guise of Islam or any other, will be crushed. Above all, Egypt cannot - and
his government will not - be rushed.
To this domestic agenda can be added his ambitions for Egypt as a regional
power. Having reclaimed its centrality as an Arab power following its
isolation after the Camp David peace accord with Israel, Egypt will now
prove essential in helping to achieve the comprehensive peace now delicately
being negotiated. And it will remain a stalwart ally of the west, available
as broker and mediator in other regional problems - perhaps increasingly in
Africa, should its present role as interlocutor in the Arab-Israeli peace
talks diminish in importance.
The past couple of years, however, have begun to issue challenges to Mr
Mubarak's comfortable view, potentially threatening every aspect of it. A
growing number of critics inside the country, and among its important
allies, wonder whether, in the face of rising domestic pressures and
uncertain international shifts, six more years of similarly slow progress in
the same direction constitute a recipe for continued political stability -
the totem of Mr Mubarak's rule. They wonder, too, whether Mr Mubarak's
determination to keep the same coterie of old faces in his ageing regime is
an adequate response to such shifts and pressures, or whether his own regime
is only acquiring its own 'burdensome heritage'.
On the domestic front, the rising pressures are self-evident and nowhere
more so than in the sharp rise in violent Islamic militancy. Since militant
groups such as the Gamaa al-Islamiyya and Jihad began to launch attacks
against security personnel, senior government figures, banks and tourist
targets in late 1992, more than 350 people have died in violent clashes - at
least as many victims as the total number killed over the preceding three
years.
Last month Mr Hassan al-Alfi, the interior minister, told the Financial
Times that the security problem was 'very much under control'. The police
had successfully infiltrated several militant groups and constrained their
operations in Cairo, he said, and violence was now largely confined to towns
such as Assiut and Dairut in Upper Egypt, a traditional stronghold of
Islamic militancy where violence has long been aggravated by low levels of
education, higher than average unemployment and a culture of vendetta.
But any improvement in the security situation is relative only to the
sharply higher plateau of violence.
Already this year, more than 70 people have died in clashes. Moreover, the
murder of a senior police general in Cairo a few weeks ago shows that,
despite the most sweeping and sustained security operation in at least 10
years, the security forces cannot eradicate extremist groups.
For some time it appeared that an attempt to get rid of them through
security measures which included mass detentions and - so it is alleged by
human rights groups - torture and occasional resort to 'shoot-to-kill' raids
on suspected extremists, constituted the sole government response. But this
may be changing, and according to analysts like Mr Mohammed Sid Ahmed, a
leading political commentator, behind public expressions of unconcern, the
government is certainly taking the militants more seriously. 'People in
senior positions who, a year or two ago, would once have dismissed the
threat, are no longer doing so,' he says.
There are some signs of a more sophisticated public relations offensive. The
government has recently begun to orchestrate a media campaign, for instance.
This has included the televised 'confessions' of a 'repentant' militant; and
prime-time soap operas portraying Islamic extremists as misguided and
corrupt.
But this falls a long way short of the more fully-fledged political response
to the political violence long called for by some of Egypt's opposition
parties and innumerable intellectuals. On his re-affirmation as president in
October, Mr Mubarak said he would call for a 'national dialogue' among
Egypt's established political groups, although no date has yet been set for
the talks.
If and when they do convene, however, Mr Mubarak seems firmly to have ruled
out discussing any of the sort of structural changes called for by some
opposition groups which might dilute his present near-absolute executive
powers - for example, he has governed under a 'state of emergency' more or
less unbroken since assuming power.
The talks will also exclude, as a group, the Moslem Brotherhood. This will
be indirectly represented by the Labour Party, under whose banner Egypt's
most cohate, popular and professedly moderate Islamic group has been
permitted only a degree of official representation.
The more optimistic advocates of the national dialogue suggest that, once
begun, it might develop a momentum of its own in which such issues as
corruption (allegations of which have swirled with increasing persistence
around people associated with the regime) might be openly debated. 'The
dialogue might confront the regime with the need to find ways to renew and
refresh itself,' suggests Mr Sid Ahmed.
But diplomats and other observers suggest that it is precisely such a
possibility which the government will endeavour to prevent. They cite the
government's recent decision to put on trial journalists with the
publication al-Shaab, the Labour Party's (and thus indirectly the
Brotherhood's) mouthpiece) for coverage which has been much braver than most
in pointing at government corruption. 'For the government, the dialogue will
be an attempt to rally everyone behind its policies against the extremists,
no more,' says one western diplomat.
Aside from bullets, prison and soap operas, the government's chief weapon
against militancy appears to be its hope of achieving an economic
turn-round, to attack the disillusion and unemployment it blames for the
unrest. But here, too, there are grave doubts about the government's ability
to deliver.
Nearly three years into International Monetary Fund and World Bank-inspired
reforms, Egypt's sprawling and still public-sector dominated economy remains
well short of the 4 or 5 per cent growth rates the programme aimed to
stimulate.
GDP growth, not helped by the negative effect of militant attacks on the
tourism industry, is a modest 2 per cent at best. Worse: the effects of
subsidy cuts and rises for utilities such as power have almost certainly
made the poor poorer - some estimates indicate that household consumption
has slipped by 2 or 3 per cent over the past two years.
By some tallies, Egypt's economy will have to produce between 5m and 6m new
jobs by the end of Mr Mubarak's present presidential term in order to
accommodate the influx of new workers - and make some inroads in present
unemployment, which is already about 20 per cent. This is Egypt's political
timebomb. 'If the country cannot produce the 5m jobs, the amount of
discontent will be enough to produce a political change, one way or
another,' one western economist gloomily concludes.
But after its undeniable and hard-won success in managing its stabilising
macro-economic reforms, Mr Mubarak's government now faces the more
politically sensitive task of pushing through structural reforms, such as
privatisation and deeper tariff cuts, which threaten short-term unemployment
and cut into deeply entrenched vested interests. There are already signs
that the private sector, whose confidence is vital to inspiring the growth
Egypt needs, is beginning to suspect a weakening of government will.
Mr Mubarak's bet appears to be that he can continue the reforms at his own
pace, trusting to his political instinct as to how far and fast he can push
Egypt.
He is relying on what one foreign businessman describes as 'Egypt's uncanny
ability somehow to keep its head above water'. He is also relying, no doubt,
on Egypt's strategic importance to the west - a strategic importance which
is the mainspring of an annual Dollars 3bn in aid and political backing for
Egypt within the IMF, World Bank and Egypt's foreign creditors in the Paris
Club.
For the moment, Mr Mubarak's bet seems to be the only one which counts. He
has no self-evident political rival. His international support seems
assured.
And he retains in his hands all the levers of security and political power.
For yet another year, therefore, Mr Mubarak will try to show that Egypt can
remain a sort of political Leaning Power of Pisa and defy - or at least
defer - the apparently inevitable.

FT  22 APR 94 / 800 jobs go as Texas Instruments closes down in Bedford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Texas Instruments of the US, one of the world's largest electronics
companies, is closing down its operations in Bedford with the loss of 800
jobs.
The company, Bedford's largest manufacturing employer, has been in the town
30 miles north of London for 38 years. At its peak in the 1970s, Texas
employed 3,500 people in the UK. After the withdrawal from Bedford, only 500
jobs will remain.
The move is part of a worldwide restructuring plan put in place by Texas to
rationalise its manufacturing operations. It said the object was 'to achieve
sustainable levels of profitability after several years of unsatisfactory
performance'. It intends to concentrate the manufacturing of its important
product lines in France, Germany and Italy.
A result is that up to 50 of Britain's top electronics engineers will find
themselves being offered jobs in France, Germany and at the company's
headquarters in Dallas, Texas.
Some 400 administrative jobs at Bedford are to go, starting in August. A
further 200 positions will be relocated elsewhere in the UK. The only
operations remaining at Bedford will be a power transistors plant employing
200 people. Texas intends to find a buyer to take total or partial ownership
of this operation.
One reason Texas decided to pull out of Bedford is that although most
aspects of its operations were represented, it was not a centre of
excellence for any of its main products.
Mr Mike Gwilliam, Bedfordshire's chief planning council officer, said: 'You
can say we are totally dismayed. It is not just a question of the jobs lost.
Texas was the kind of flagship, high technology company we were very much
hoping to retain.'

FT  22 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Retail sales gain undermines base
rate hopes - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reverberations from Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn purchase of Cheltenham
and Gloucester, Britain' sixth largest building society, dominated a UK
stock market subdued yesterday by a further, and possibly final, blow to
near-term optimism on base rates. The announcement of a 0.8 per cent gain in
domestic retail sales in March - well above expectations - was widely seen
as wiping out chances for a base rate cut, at least on economic grounds.
The FT-SE Index struggled back above the 3,100 mark, but only with the help
of a sharp rise in Lloyds Bank shares which was worth nearly four points on
the Index. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 3,101.2, up 2.9 on
the day, with London benefiting at the close from a gain of 17 Dow points in
early trading in New York.
The stock market took a highly favourable view of Lloyds Bank's deal,
regarding it as a potentially highly profitable move into the premium area
of the housing finance sector at an attractive price. Trading volume in
Lloyds' shares approached the highest daily figure for the past six years,
and there were signs that investment funds were switching into Lloyds from
some other financial sector issues.
However, with its views on the implications of the March retail figures
largely confirmed by gains in sterling and falls in short-dated government
bonds, the equity market made little headway. Analysts refused to take an
entirely negative stance, however, commenting that equities might benefit as
the market turned away from its fixation with base rates and paid more heed
to the flow of higher dividends and earnings from UK companies as the
domestic economy extends its recovery.
The possibility that base rates will be cut for political reasons remains
but equities could well react badly to such a move, according to some
analysts.
Seaq volume increased to 795.7m shares from Wednesday's 675.5m. But around 6
per cent of yesterday's volume came in three stocks - Lloyds Bank, Lasmo and
Rank Organisation. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed just 0.1 off at 3,782.5.
The market was helped by firmness in the pharmaceutical sector although this
was offset by a slower performance from the leading oil stocks which have
been moving up sharply since views on crude oil prices turned more positive.
The bank sector, in spite of the strong gain in Lloyds Bank shares, ended
weaker on the session as the withdrawal of base rate speculation suggested
that the investment focus might shift to the manufacturing sectors of the
stock market.
Strong gains were recorded among the store and retail stocks, with the
favourable implications of the March retail figures clearly outweighing the
fading of base rate hopes. Among stocks with international associations, the
cut in intervention rates by the Bank of France was a favourable factor.
Some strategists suggested that the March retail sales figures, which
contrasted with the tone of the survey published earlier this week by the
Confederation of British Industries, should be treated with caution. Some
nervousness was also expressed over the continuing hints from the forward
sterling markets that UK interest rates might head higher sooner than
expected.
Statistics on domestic M4 money supply are due this morning, but next week
the stress will be on data on the US economy.

FT  22 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Diminished hopes for an early interest rate cut contrasted sharply with more
optimistic feelings in the market over the corporate outlook and led to
volatile trading in the futures market, writes Christopher Price.
An expected weak opening failed to materialise, and the June FT-SE 100
contract moved up to 3,112 and began a period of tight trading prior to the
retail sales figures coming out. Forecasts of a 0.3 per cent rise proved
wide of the mark and at the unveiling of the chunky 0.8 per cent uplift June
went into swift reverse as the market's hopes of a rate cut were seen to
have been dealt a severe blow.
The heavy sell-off pushed June down to 3,083 at one stage, trading at a
7-point discount to the cash market. However, buyers moved back into the
market and June clawed its way back, helped by a bright start on Wall Street
and digestion of some impressive corporate results, particularly from
SmithKline Beecham. One dealer reported sentiment among institutional buyers
at its most positive for several weeks.
June closed at 3,115, its high of the day, with turnover reaching 13,282
contracts.
Traded options volume reached 52,739, with FT-SE turnover at 13,722. Lasmo,
inspired by recent takeover talk, topped the stock options at 5,338
contracts.

FT  22 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTINE BUCKLEY, CHRIS PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Takeover speculation in Lasmo, the oil exploration group, continued unabated
yesterday as marketmakers reported heavy trading in the ordinary shares, the
'new' nil-paid stock and in the traded options market.
Heavy activity in traded options earlier this week alerted the market to the
possibility that a potential bidder could be stalking the company. Elf
remains the market's favourite to bid for Lasmo, although other names,
including Enterprise have been mooted.
Yesterday saw 11m ordinary shares traded, 9.8m new shares change hands and
the equivalent of over 5m shares traded in the options.
Dealers said the pattern of trading in Lasmo shares and options yesterday
was the same as earlier in the week. The ordinaries opened better, eased in
mid-session and then moved up again as the buyer of the options re-appeared
during the afternoon. 'It certainly feels as if a stake-builder or bidder
might be operating,' said one broker.'
Lasmo ordinaries closed a further 4 higher at 145p and the 'new' nil-paid 4
up at 41p, after 43p. Lasmo options were the second heaviest traded.
An institutional seller of over 6m shares in Rank Organisation - around 2.5
per cent of the company - boosted total turnover in the leisure group to
14m, the third highest volume ever. SG Warburg, the company's broker, was
said to have bought the stock at 618p and sold it to several institutions at
621p. One dealer said the small discount to the current Rank share price and
the speed of the placing was an indication of the strong sentiment
underpinning recent strength in the stock. Rank shares slipped 3 to 423p.
In another big deal, 16m Iceland shares - over 6 per cent of the frozen food
retailer - were crossed by Charterhouse Tilney at 155p. The shares ended
steady at 164p.
A stock overhang in Compass Group, with dealers talking of an unplaced line
of 1.5m, saw the shares retreat 14 to 333p.
Disappointing figures from Albert Fisher knocked the shares, off 6 at 57p.
BICC outperformed the market, the shares closing 8 firmer at 443p in the
wake of as series of upbeat institutional presentations in Scotland
yesterday and in London on Wednesday. The company was said to have told
institutions that European markets are performing better than had been
expected and that the US businesses continued to perform strongly.
Vodafone jumped 12 more to 512p as NatWest's positive stance on Wednesday
was followed yesterday by a profits upgrading and buy recommendation issued
by Hoare Govett. The broker increased its 1996 forecast by Pounds 45m and
said it expected 1m new subscribers for Vodafone this year.
Continuing worries that the UK merchant banks and financial institutions
have suffered badly from the downward spiral in bond markets since
mid-February triggered renewed weakness in merchant banks where Hambros lost
17 more to 348p and Kleinwort the same to 448p.
Financial services groups were hit as senior market traders suggested that
Lloyds' move to absorb C &amp; G could well bring substantial redemptions of
unit trusts with monies being deposited ad hoc in building society accounts
to take advantage of any further moves by banks to absorb building
societies. Mercury Asset Management, one of the UK's leading fund management
groups, retreated 5 to 590p.
Hogg Group moved up 10 more to 234p as the market became increasingly
convinced that an opening shot of around 240p in a potential takeover battle
for the insurance broker is imminent. HSBC, remains the market's favourite
to initiate the battle, with several probable bidders in the wings.
Better than expected first quarter figures from SmithKline Beecham saw the
pharmaceutical group's shares rise 8 to 372p on turnover of 1.7m and the
Units add 12 at 339p with 1.7m dealt.
A profit warning from Transport Development sent the shares down 10 to 252p.
Conglomerate Williams Holdings rose 9 to 394p as SGST advised clients to
switch out of TI, down 2 before rallying to close 4 better at 418p.

FT  22 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy action in banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 1.8bn agreed merger of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society
and Lloyds Bank was the catalyst for a chain of big moves throughout the
financial sectors as analysts and institutions began to manoeuvre their
recommendations and stances in the light of the deal.
Lloyds Bank shares rocketed as the market reacted positively to the news,
reaching a session high of 588p, before easing back to close a net 48 firmer
at 585p. Turnover of 24m shares was the highest single-day's business for
five and a half years. Lloyds shares reached an all-time high of 684p on
December 29, but have since fallen sharply with the other banks as the City
has become disenchanted with the sector.
The market has been waiting for Lloyds to make a bold strategic move ever
since its last expansion attempt in April 1992, when it unsuccessfully
sought a merger with Midland Bank.
The deal also impacted on Standard Chartered, where Lloyds retains a near 5
per cent shareholding following an unsuccessful takeover attempt in the
1980s. Standard shares, also reflecting further overall weakness in the Hong
Kong market dropped 20 to 1015p on assumptions that the chances of Lloyds
bidding again for Standard may have diminished and that the stake could be
sold. Some observers said, however, that Lloyds may yet move to acquire
Standard which has an enviable presence throughout the far east.
Other bank shares fell sharply on fears that Lloyds/C &amp; G will introduce
much fiercer competition in the UK mortgage market. Abbey National was the
hardest hit, the shares sliding 17 1/2 to 446 1/2 p, while Barclays dipped 7
to 509p and NatWest 4 1/2 to 445 1/2 p. Shares in Lloyds' life assurance
subsidiary, Lloyds Abbey Life, sprinted 21 to 405p, reflecting the increase
customer base for its products.
One banks specialist said Lloyds' merger with C &amp; G, 'solves at a stroke the
former major worries about Lloyds, ie the acquisition and succession
problems'. He warned that Abbey National 'now faces a fierce assault from
what now looks certain to be a price war in the mortgage market.'

FT  22 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks turn firmer on bond
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks rallied as investors focused on a surge in bond prices and strong
corporate earnings, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished at its session high of 3,652.54,
with several waves of program buying contributing to a 53.83 gain on the
day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 powered 6.77 ahead to
448.73. For a second day running, trading was frenzied, with volume reaching
379m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite improved 3.53 to 431.13,
and the Nasdaq composite surged 13.22, or 1.8 per cent, to 718.74, ending a
three-day losing streak.
Stocks returned to old habits, closely tracking bond prices to sharply
higher levels. On Wednesday, share prices had de-coupled from the US
Treasury market, giving ground despite a rally in fixed-rate investments.
There was a mixed bag of economic news on offer yesterday, but equity
investors drew encouragement from the bond market's agility in side-stepping
potential obstacles. The Labor Department was helpful, reporting a big jump
in claims for unemployment benefit for a third consecutive week. Bonds moved
higher and stocks were close behind them.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve, however, offered a more complicated view
of the economy in its April survey of regional business conditions. The
overall index was softer, but the prices-paid index, keenly watched by the
inflation-sensitive bond market, was up sharply. Prices dipped on the news,
but in a surprising display of resilience, recovered quickly. By the
afternoon, bonds were showing solid gains.
The equity markets were impressed by the rebound, as it suggested a mild
reaction to Monday's move by the Federal Reserve to lift short-term rates.
In Wednesday's session, investors were growing increasingly concerned over
the impact of rising long-term rates on corporate profitability. Yesterday
was indication that the worst may be over, leaving them free to concentrate
a fresh batch of company results from the first quarter.
International Business Machines was the star of the session. The bellwether
stock jumped Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 58 3/8 after exceeding market
expectations of its first-quarter performance.
The issue accounted for nearly 10 points of the gain in the Dow industrials.
Caterpillar, up Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 106 5/8 , made a smaller
contribution in recovering some of its heavy losses the previous session.
Sears was up Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 48 1/2 after showing improvement in
the quarter. IBM's progress gave a boost to the entire technology sector,
which has been hard hit over the past fortnight. Texas Instruments climbed
Dollars 6 3/4 to Dollars 71 1/2 after announcing a decision to divest
non-strategic business and to boost its dividend. Micron Technology
rebounded from several days of weakness, adding Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 34
1/8 .
On the Nasdaq, computer stocks staged a parallel rally, led by Wellfleet, up
Dollars 5 1/4 at Dollars 71. Intel jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 60 1/4
and Microsoft climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 91 1/2 .
Canada
Toronto prices rose steadily throughout the day, in fairly active trading.
The TSE 300 composite index jumped 61.29 points, or 1.49 per cent, to
4,167.22, with advances outpacing declines 454 to 284. The rebound followed
four straight days of losses.
Volume of 70.15m shares was above Wednesday's 60.83m shares, and trading
value rose to CDollars 859.0m from CDollars 712.7m.
All 14 stock groups ended higher, with transportation and conglomerates
surging 5.25 per cent and 3.45 per cent, respectively. Mining gained 2.70
per cent, industrial products rose 2.36 per cent, and golds were up 1.55 per
cent. Consumer products and energy gained 1.10 per cent and 0.98 per cent
respectively, and banking was somewhat higher.
Noranda Inc. was up  1/2 to 23 1/2 afte reporting a first-quarter net profit
compared with a loss in the same period of l993.

FT  22 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico recovers lost ground
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexican stocks leapt more than 6 per cent Thursday in a technical rebound
after three straight trading session declines.
According to preliminary official information, the Mexican market's key IPC
index closed up 117.99 points at 2,075.32 - a gain of 6.03 per cent. At the
end of 1993, the IPC stood at 2,602.63. Value was a moderate 1.013bn new
pesos on 89.1m shares traded.
Traders said there was no real reason for the recovery in the Mexcian Stock
Exchange other than that investors saw opportunities to buy cheap stocks
after the market had lost more than 11 per cent earlier in the week.
Traders said, however, the market reacted favorably to gains by New York
stocks and also to the news that peace talks between rebel guerrillas in
Chiapas and the Mexican government look set to restart next week.
In intra-day trading, the market broke back through the 2,000 barrier.
Traders said this was a psychological boost to investors. The market fall
below 2,000 on Wednesday for the first time since Nov. 9 last year.
Most buying was done by foreign investors, with ADRs of Telmex leading the
recovery. Telmex L series shares were up 56 centavos, or 6.48 per cent, to
9.2 new pesos. Telmex holding company Grupo Carso was up 6.67 per cent, or
1.7 new pesos, at 27.2 new pesos.

FT  22 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Warsaw begins to recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Polish equities accelerated their recovery yesterday after sharp falls last
week, the WIG index rising 1,800, or 15.9 per cent to 13,099. The WIG has
gained 31 per cent over the past three sessions, following a drop of more
than 50 per cent since it reached a peak in early March.
The recovery comes after the Warsaw stock exchange suspended the 10 per cent
price limit movements and made investors set a price in their trading orders
rather than asking for the 'price of the day.'
The order driven market, which is modelled on the French system, is seeing
the gradual restoration of price limits: a 20 per cent spread was in force
yesterday, 15 per cent on Monday and a return to 10 per cent is set for next
Tuesday. Investors can once again ask brokers to sell at the 'price of the
day' and, yesterday, this meant that 11 of the 23 traded stocks hit the 20
per cent barrier.
Prospective price/earnings ratios for 1994, however, remain high at an
average of 21.3. This has encouraged foreign investors, who helped to fuel
the spectacular share price rises of last year, to remain absent.
Rights issues and flotations of both private sector companies and state
sector disposals will continue to divert funds away from the already listed
stocks. Mr Leslaw Paga, head of the securities commission, said yesterday
that he was examining 26 prospectuses, and a further three companies
yesterday received permission to go ahead with public share offers.
This year six completed rights and flotations have aggregated around Dollars
94m while the total value of new shares currently on offer amounts to around
Dollars 140m. Another Dollars 50m worth goes on sale next week in the
Polifarb Cieszyn rights issue and sale of paint producer Polifarb Wroclaw, a
state sector disposal. Turnover yesterday was Dollars 36m.

FT  22 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa ends lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg ended a quiet day lower with investors reluctant to commit
themselves less than a week before the elections. The weakness of the gold
price and a firmer financial rand added to the hesitant tone.
The overall index finished 8 softer at 5,037 and golds fell 23 to 1,860, but
industrials managed a gain of 3 to 5,963.
De Beers ended 50 cents lower at R107 and JCI fell R1 to R91. Richemont
reversed small early gains to lose 50 cents to R41, but substantial gains in
industrials were registered for Iscor, which added 7 cents to R3.27 and
Malbak, up 65 cents to R18.90.

FT  22 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Deutsche faces its critics,
shares rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses had mixed fortunes, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT shivered when bund futures weakened, and the Dax index touched an
intraday low of around 2,180. However, both futures and the cash market
recovered with the Dax closing at 2,196.97, and virtually holding in the
post bourse. Turnover eased from DM11.6bn to DM10.4bn.
Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said that German 10 year bonds
were now yielding around 6.30 to 6.40 per cent, 60 basis points more than
they offered at the end of 1993 in spite of the downtrend in short term
interest rates.
The Bundesbank, he said, needed to keep the D-Mark strong and to retain the
increasing foreign investment in German domestic bonds which has been
apparent since unification in 1990. Meanwhile, Merck Finck fancied a
contra-cyclical bet on financials.
Mostly, this was a good idea: Deutsche Bank decided to face its critics on
television (last night) and in the press (next Monday), rose DM16.50 to
DM765.50 and lifted the sector; but then there was Depfa, the mortgage bank,
a strong tip three or four weeks ago by analysts who thought it could hit
DM1,200. Depfa said yesterday that it was adding DM60m to loan loss
provisions to take account of its exposure to Schneider property loans, and
the shares fell DM35 to DM740.
PARIS was unimpressed by the 10 basis point cut in the French intervention
rate, and signalled its dissatisfaction at what it saw as 'too little, too
late' by diving to the day's low of 2,079.
The market recovered swiftly, but then retreated once again before a
positive opening on Wall Street helped it to recover just before the close.
The CAC-40 index ended off 10.76 at 2,091.95.
Peugeot slipped FFr9 to FFr905 as some profits were booked following a good
rise ahead of yesterday's 1993 results. Eurotunnel eased FFr1.05 to
FFr40.90, but off a low of FFr40.60, after announcing that it would open the
tunnel to passenger services in October.
ZURICH was again pulled lower by weak bonds but recovered with Wall Street,
the SMI index ending 37.1 lower at 2,781.6. Foreign selling depressed
insurers.
Zurich Insurance lost SFr35 to SFr1,235, Winterthur SFr10 to SFr665 and
Swiss Re SFr17 to SFr630. Among banks, SBC fell SFr13 to SFr404 and CS
Holding SFr14 to SFr606.
Some cyclicals continued to find favour. Georg Fischer, the foundries and
engineering group which last month forecast a return to profit this year,
added another SFr35 to SFr1,435, taking its gains this week to SFr95.
Roche certificates, seeing some profit-taking after this week's figures,
fell to a low of SFr6,780 before finishing SFr90 lower on the day at
SFr6,900 after some sustained late buying by a Zurich bank.
AMSTERDAM ended marginally firmer, The AEX index rising 0.57 to 415.41.
Nedlloyd added Fl 1.30 to Fl 75.70 as 1993 results came in much as expected,
while Hoogovens put on Fl 1.60 to Fl 64.70 on good 1994 prospects.
One of the best performances came from Nutricia, the food group, rising to a
12 month high, up Fl 1.50 to Fl 82.00. Goldman Sachs came out with a
positive recommendation this week, noting that the company promised good
1994 results, helped by recent restructuring.
MILAN played a waiting game, with domestic funds staying out of the market,
and the Comit index fell 10.79 to 766.81. Benetton rose L325 to L25,714 on a
12.6 per cent rise in 1993 consolidated net profits, although the result was
in line with forecasts.
Ferruzzi remained volatile, losing L37 to L2,498 as it emerged that the
company's L1,399bn funding programme will be launched next Tuesday. Ciga,
the hotel group, fell L26 to L1,207 in heavy volume of 25.5m shares amid
speculation that Sheraton may have to raise its bid to gain control.
Against the trend, Stet put on L26 to L5,863 which was attributed to
switching between the savings and ordinary shares.
Among blue chips, Fiat lost L70 to L6,394 and Pirelli L145 to L2,925,
although the tyremaker's Wednesday announcement that 1993 losses had
narrowed and the company should return to profit in 1994 was regarded as an
extremely positive development.
MADRID offered a gentle recovery, the general index rising 1.39 to 311.12 as
turnover fell further to Pta20.3bn.
In banks, Banesto recouped Wednesday's losses, rising Pta50 to Pta800;
Santander responded to higher first quarter profits, up Pta60 at Pta6,150;
but the non-bidders for Banesto stood out more with BCH up Pta115 to
Pta2,975 and Popular Pta310 better at Pta15,210.
ISTANBUL dropped 5.9 per cent on the fall in the dollar and the collapse of
Marmara Bank, banned from taking deposits after weeks of speculation which
engulfed the banking sector in a liquidity crisis. The composite index fell
1,212.16 to 19,428.31 as turnover soared from TL1,800bn to TL2,700bn.

FT  22 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong dips 3% on
property worries
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Nikkei fell for the third consecutive day on lingering worries over the
uncertain political situation and the rise in the yen, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The 225 index moved in a narrow range throughout the day in light trading,
falling 82.82 to 19,799.36 after a high of 19,934.89 and a low of 19,793.56.
Some overseas investors chose to take advantage of the rise in the yen and
sell large capital stocks. The yen closed up Y0.50 at Y102.90, rising above
the Y103 level in spite of intermittent selling by the Bank of Japan.
Traders sold the dollar against the yen and the D-Mark due to the overnight
fall on Wall Street.
Volume was 250m shares against 346m. Traders said that even dealers were
reluctant to take positions since institutional investors were placing buy
orders around the 19,500 level, while some corporations were looking to take
profits around the 20,000 level.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 5.93 to 1,607.50, while the
Nikkei 300 lost 1.01 to 293.83. Losers led gainers by 677 to 298, with 207
issues unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.06 to 1,310.7.
Steel stocks were sold by foreign investors: Nippon Steel, the day's most
active issue, fell Y7 to Y342, while Kawasaki Steel declined Y4 to Y362.
Japan Airlines, which had risen on Wednesday after announcing a voluntary
retirement plan for employees in their 30s, fell Y4 to Y709 on
profit-taking.
Nippon Trust Bank jumped Y23 to Y535 on reports, later denied, that
Mitsubishi Bank was planning a bailout package for the trust bank.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 140.51 to 22,083.43 in volume of 19.8m
shares.
Roundup
Wall Street's overnight weakness was reflected in the region.
HONG KONG saw heavy selling of property shares on worries about measures
being drafted by the government to cool the housing market and an expected
rise in interest rates in line with the US. The Hang Seng index dropped by
286.42, or 3.1 per cent to 8,934.59, its second lowest close of 1994.
Turnover rose from HKDollars 3.3bn to HKDollars 4.86bn as the property
sector plunged 766.69, or 4.7 per cent to 15,437.17. Cheung Kong and Sun
Hung Kai, two of Hong Kong's biggest residential property developers and
among the biggest listed stocks, dropped by HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars
35.75, and by HKDollars 2.75 to HKDollars 47 respectively; Hongkong Land, a
Jardine group stock and the landlord of much of central Hong Kong, ended
HKDollars 1.10 lower at HKDollars 22.10.
MANILA blamed a technical correction, profit-taking after a succession of
gains and a drop in PLDT stock in New York as the composite index fell
69.71, or 2.4 per cent to 2,777.11.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone lost Dollars 1 7/8 on Wall Street. At
home, it lost 65 pesos to 1,715 pesos, while the utility, Meralco, saw its B
shares down 10 pesos at 505.
AUSTRALIA was depressed by weakness in futures, the June share price index
peaking at 2,036.0 before a drop to 1,995.0 and a partial recovery to
2,007.0, down 13. The All Ordinaries index ended 17.0 down at 2,029.6.
Turnover was ADollars 410.86m. Among the few risers, Brambles Industries
rose 20 cents to ADollars 14.40 after a newspaper report said that the
company had sold its loss-making Austrian crane hire and heavy haulage
business.
NEW ZEALAND reflected weakness on Wall Street as the NZSE-40 index lost
22.40, or 1.1 per cent at 2,084.95.
BOMBAY fell in end-of-account trade, the BSE index closing 51.36 lower at
3,778.93. There was some selling by foreign institutions but brokers said
that the index fall was largely due to squaring up by local speculators.
KARACHI took profits before the Friday/Saturday weekend, the KSE 100 index
closing 17.42 at 2,481.64.
SINGAPORE's banks were firm, but there was some weakness in properties as
the Straits Times Industrial index edged up by 1.63 to 2,231.29. KUALA
LUMPUR combined general uncertainty with short term speculation by retail
investors, but the KLSE composite fell 10.75 to 1,028.1.
TAIWAN put on 0.9 per cent on technical buying and news of maintained bank
dividends, the weighted price index closing 49.15 higher at 5,741.47.

FT  22 APR 94 / Markets Report: Franc firm after rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French franc finished the day firmer yesterday as the market gave an
approving nod to a 10 basis point cut in a key short term interest rate,
writes Philip Gawith.
The Bank of France cut the intervention rate to 5.80 per cent and the 5-10
day rate by 25 basis points to 6.75 per cent. The franc was trading at
FFr3.4310 against the D-Mark before the cut - below its old ERM floor of
FFr3.4305 - but then firmed to close in London at FFr3.427.
In a day characterised by fairly low volumes and narrow trading ranges, the
dollar was stable after weakening overnight. The US currency closed in
London at DM1.6882 against the dollar from DM1.694 on Thursday.
The D-Mark fell back slightly in Europe after its recent strength. It closed
at Pta81.44 from Pta81.88 against the Spanish peseta and weakened slightly
against the Italian lira, finishing at L958.4 from L958.7.
In the UK, sterling had a better day with the Bank of England's sterling
index closing at 80.5 from 80.1 on Wednesday. The pound was helped by
stronger than expected retail sales figures.
Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC, said the French cut was braver
than some people had expected, given the weak exchange rate. He said the
move was 'welcome given that exchange rate grounds were not put above the
needs of the real economy.' Economic growth remains sluggish, while
unemployment is 12.1 per cent and rising.
Mr Parsons said the cut was 'confirmation that the BOF may be independent of
French politicians, but it is not independent of the Bundesbank. French
interest rates are still set in Frankfurt.'
Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, Bank of France governor, told a news conference that
the monetary policy council had based its decision on 'clear signs of
non-inflationary growth'. He said the council would resist calls for lower
short term rates as these would increase France's medium and long-term
rates.
'A sudden and compelled cut in short term rates would have a negative impact
on expectations as to the internal and external stability of the franc and
thus do untold harm to the economy,' said Mr Trichet.
Mr Lee Ferridge, treasury economist at Natwest Markets, said the market had
been reassured that the French were not going to try and cut rates below
German rates. The Bank of France's intervention rate is 22 basis points
above its German equivalent, the repo rate, which is at 5.58 per cent.
The rate cut had little impact on sentiment in the futures market. On the
Matif, the June three month PIBOR future closed one basis point lower at
94.22. The December future fell by one basis point to 94.39.
After looking at one stage as if it might test the key support level of
DM1.6830, the dollar recovered to finish higher.
The US currency did not get any support from the release of the business
outlook survey conducted by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve. The market
ignored the prices component of the survey, which rose to 33.1 from 16 in
March.
Against the yen, the dollar fell to a low of Y102.50, before recovering to
close at Y103.545. The turnaround was based upon unconfirmed rumours of the
Fed and the Bank of England intervening in the market to support the dollar.
The US currency also gained support from comments made by Mr Lloyd Bentsen
before Sunday's group of seven meeting. The treasury secretary said the US
was not trying to devalue the dollar to increase access to Japanese markets.
The market fears that the US administration might resort to this strategy to
curb its large trade deficit with Japan.
Trading in dollar/yen should have greater direction today after Japan's
ruling coalition reached agreement on a common policy platform. This clears
the way for the election of a new prime minister.
Greater political certainty should help the dollar as it improves the
prospects for passage of a stimulatory fiscal package, and enhances the
chance of trade reform.
Strong UK March retail sales figures dampened hopes of a near term rate cut
and lent support to sterling. The UK currency finished a pfennig up at
DM2.527 from DM2.517. It was a cent stronger against the dollar, closing at
Dollars 1.4969 from Dollars 1.4858.
Retail sales volumes grew, year on year, by 3.8 per cent against a median
market expectation of 2.7 per cent. This merely compounded already depressed
sentiment about the outlook for easier monetary policy.
The June short sterling contract closed four basis points lower at 94.59
after touching an intra-day low of 94.55. The December contract was also
four points down, at 93.85.
Mr Parsons of CIBC said the fact that there was once again a positive yield
curve for sterling did not mean that short rates would rise.
In the money market, overnight rates rose as high as 10 per cent - nearly
twice the base rate of 5.25 per cent - as the Bank of England sought to
clear a large Pounds 2.3bn shortage. Recently, most daily shortages have
been below Pounds 1bn.

FT  22 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices at wool sales this week have held firm and in Australia the market
indicator edged to a new high for the season. This was only one cent above
the previous high when sales resumed after the Easter recess almost two
weeks ago. However, progress on the upward trend has been extremely slow.
Trading conditions in wool-using countries are very widely said to be dull,
and Europe is suffering from very competitive pricing, some high stocks of
semi-processed products, and a hesitant recovery from recession, where this
can be identified at all. Currency factors have tended to push down prices
in many wool-using countries, and sterling is buying more in dollar terms.
The official Wool International market indicator closed the selling week at
574 cents a kg.

FT  22 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: London coffee futures touch
five-year highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee futures prices soared in London yesterday with the second position on
the London Commodity Exchange hitting Dollars 1,545 a tonne at one stage -
its highest point for five years.
However dealers began to back off in late trading when the New York market
failed to extend the gains made earlier and London closed at Dollars 1,493 a
tonne, Dollars 9 higher than the previous close.
The drawdown in stocks of robusta coffee - the coarser variety that is
traded in London - has fuelled a surge in prices in the last few days. The
arabica futures contract on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange has
been pushed upwards by London, but it was beginning to go off the boil
yesterday.
'A lot of technicians are indicating the market here is a bit toppy and we
haven't been able to take out resistance levels,' said Mr Bill O'Neil, softs
analyst at Merill Lynch in New York. 'The next few days will be a key to
determining the market's short-term direction.'
Confusion among traders about Brazil's plans to begin the sale of its
17m-bag domestic stockpile, which were announced last week, has added to the
market's jitters. Brazil announced it would sell 2.4m bags in this financial
year, but it is unclear how the sales will be spread throughout the year.
The government is also under pressure from growers to call off the sale.
The tightness of physical supplies of coffee in the London market is putting
a squeeze on traders with short positions, which is likely to support prices
for some days.

vote

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Members of New York's two biggest futures exchanges vote on Monday on a
proposed merger that would result in an historic alliance between an
international oil market and a global gold market.
'From a global point of view, this merger would make us (both exchanges)
much more competitive,' Mr Daniel Rappaport, chairman of the New York
Mercantile Exchange and a vocal supporter of the plan, said yesterday.
Although New York's fractious futures exchanges have made plans before, the
current talks between Nymex and the smaller New York Commodities Exchange
(Comex) have gone farther than any in recent memory.
The plan, which needs approval from two-thirds of the Comex members who
vote, and 50 per cent of Nymex votes to pass, would make Comex a division of
Nymex. Comex's 786 members are being offered Dollars 50m in cash for their
exchange, and would also retain beneficial trading rights for Comex and some
Nymex products after the merger.

FT  22 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nigerian oil on slippery slope,
warns Shell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria's oil industry is in a downward spiral as the government's payment
arrears to its joint venture partners lead to cuts in international
investment and reduce production capacity, the managing director of Shell
Nigeria has warned in a bleak assessment of the industry which provides 95
per cent of Nigeria's foreign earnings.
'As production goes down, so does the Opec production quota, leaving even
less revenue for investment in future production,' said Mr Brian Anderson.
Speaking at a seminar in Lagos, Mr Anderson suggested that one way out was
for the government, which owns 60 per cent of the joint oil operations, to
pay in crude oil for its cash arrears to the oil industry, which have been
at least Dollars 500m for the past six months.
'Extra crude would make payment more certain, which would increase
investment and more revenue would flow,' he said. 'This would also provide
more revenue for compensation in the disputes with local communities.'
Shell lost 1,400 production days in 1993 because of violent attacks by
communities in the Niger delta, and employs one security man for every two
members of the workforce at a cost of Dollars 18m a year.
Under joint venture agreements the oil companies can take cash arrears from
the majority partner in the form of extra crude oil, but only with the
government's consent.
Shell produces about half of Nigeria's 2m barrels a day of oil, but
worsening payment arrears and the recent cut in the joint ventures' budgets
could push down production capacity to around 1.5m b/d by the end of 1995.
The cash crisis has been aggravated by the foreign exchange restrictions
imposed in the January budget. All the oil companies have suspended
development projects, have stopped drilling wells in existing fields and are
spending the bare minimum to maintain their operations.
At the recent Opec summit Nigeria was rebuked by other members for proposing
a reduction in quotas while its industry was the only over-producer apart
from Iran. Nigerian oil minister Mr Don Etiebet has ordered the oil
producers to stay within quotas. He has warned of penalties against any
producer exceeding its quota, which the government had not enforced since
last September.
Analysts say that Nigeria's over production was around 100,000 barrels a day
but the figures are unclear because of condensate production, which is
outside Opec quotas.
The government has also been forced to cut the price of its oil by traders
who were awarded term contracts earlier this year to lift two-thirds of
Nigerian export output.
Severe shortages of domestic fuel affect most of Nigeria. Two out of the
three oil refineries are out of action, the other is operating at half
capacity and the government says that there is not enough cash to import the
products.
This week former oil minister Mr Philip Asiodu repeated his criticism of
Nigeria's fuel price subsidy, which costs the state downstream oil industry
about Dollars 40m a month, while fuel is smuggled to francophone Africa or
sold on the black market for more than three times its official price of
less than 10 cents US a litre of petrol.

FT  22 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium producers hope to
broaden cuts scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminium producing countries already taking part in the international
agreement to cut global production hope within two months to find a formula
that will enable Brazil, the Gulf States and Venezuela to be included.
This was informally agreed at a meeting here yesterday when trade delegates
from Australia, Canada, the European Union, Norway, Russia and the US met to
report on progress so far.
Delegates said they hoped a way of widening the pact to include the other
regions could be worked out by the time of their next meeting in Canberra,
tentatively scheduled for June 20.
US trade delegates warned, however, that producers would have to tread very
warily because they might run into anti-trust problems.
Russia yesterday gave details of how it planned to implement its promised
annual output cuts of 300,000 tonnes by the end of this month and further
cuts of 200,000 tonnes in the following three months. It also undertook to
provide next month production statistics to the International Primary
Aluminium Institute, the trade organisation that collects figures from most
western companies.
Delegates estimated that total output cuts in the west would total 1.2m.
At a meeting in January the delegates agreed that global cuts of between
1.5m and 2m tonnes a year were needed for two years to bring the aluminium
market back into balance.

FT  22 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Duty cut shocks Indian coal
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A cut in the import duty on non-coking coal from 85 to 35 per cent has come
as a shock to the Indian coal industry.
The industry has been criticised since its nationalisation in the early
1970s for not giving due attention to customer servicing and the quality of
fuel produced. In the protected regime, the emphasis had been on stepping up
production.
Mr SK Chowdhary, chairman of Coal India Limited, the third largest coal
company in the world, says the lowering of customs duty may lead to the
import of 10m tonnes of non-coking coal in the next three years. But other
industry experts suggest that the power plants and other big coal consuming
industries located near the ports will be importing much more than that.
At Dollars 12 a tonne Indian non-coking coal comes much cheaper than the
imported coal, which costs about Dollars 30 a tonne. But as coal mined
abroad has a high calorific value and lower ash content, import at 35 per
cent duty will make sense for the strategically-located industrial units.
Moreover, the duty-free import of coal is allowed for the production of
exportable goods.
Coal industry officials admit that the import of non-coking coal will force
the Planning Commission to rework its production targets. The industry,
which in recent years had recorded an annual growth rate of about 5 per
cent, will at the most see a marginal rise in production in the current
year. CIL which accounts for over 90 per cent of India's coal output has a
production target of 223m tonnes for 1994-95 (April to March), against last
year's production of 216.1m. The company has stocks of 40m tonnes of coal at
the pitheads, however, so it may not chase the 1994-95 production target.
Mr Chowdhary says CIL is in the process of working out a strategy to meet
the competition from imports. The most important component of this will be
to organise the supply of beneficiated power grade coal, in place of the
present run of the mine non-coking coal.
The company will not itself set up washeries for non-coking coal. Mr Ajit
Panja, the minister of coal, has said that the private sector will be
allowed to set up coal washeries on a 'build-own-operate' basis, and CIL has
shortlisted 16 of the 42 private companies that have shown interest in
building washeries.
'If the non-coking coal is beneficiated, then the power plants and other
consumers will get fuel of uniform quality from indigenous sources, even
though the ash content of coal will remain high. But the Indian boilers are
designed to use high ash content coal,' says Mr PK Sengupta, director of
CIL.
The setting up of washeries will, however, take time. While CIL will try to
limit imports, it thinks it should be possible to develop an export market
for Indian coal, which has a low sulphur content. CIL will be talking to
foreign coal producers and trading companies to explore the possibility of
blending Indian coal with high-sulphur foreign coal for export to third
countries.
The company is reported to be keen to lease some mines in Australia and
export most of their production to India.
In the meantime, CIL has made a strong representation to the federal
government that in the 'liberalised import environment', it should have the
freedom to fix coal prices and production targets. There are strong
indications that the government will remove the price control on coal in
phases.
The new environment also demands that CIL should bring down the cost of
production of coal by improving the output per man-shift, which is very low
in India compared with international standards, and closing down the
uneconomic mines. In the first phase, 14 underground and four open cast pits
will be closed down.

Mr Paias Wingti, Papua New Guinea's prime minister, said yesterday that Mr
John Kaputin, the country's mining minister, had been told to 'pursue
discussions with the Malaysian Mining Corporation', over the large Lihir
mining project.
Last night, Mr Wingti's office declined to comment further on the
implications of this statement. It followed a presentation on the status of
the Lihir project by Mr Kaputin to PNG's National Executive Council. This
covered 'the present status of the project, the Lihir joint venture
partners' plans for developing a mine on Lihir, as well as unresolved
issues, including landowners' demands'.
The joint venture partners in the project, which envisages development of a
large gold mine on one of the islands within the New Ireland group, are
Britain's RTZ and Niugini Mining, a PNG-registered company quoted in
Australia and in which Battle Mountain Gold has a majority interest.
Their original plan was to divide shares in Lihir Gold, the holding company
for the project, three ways - giving RTZ a 40 per cent stake, Niugini
Mining, 30 per cent and the PNG government the remaining 30 per cent. Those
stakes would then have been diluted by a flotation of Lihir shares, which
could have raised upwards of Dollars 300m.
However, at the end of 1993, ministerial positions were shuffled in PNG and
the necessary special mining lease for Lihir has yet to be granted. There is
thought to be debate within the PNG government over whether the state-owned
MMC should be allowed into the project at an early stage. The original plan
envisaged that MMC might acquire a significant interest, but only through
the flotation process.

FT  22 APR 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries surge in spite of mixed
economic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A firming trend in the US Treasury market accelerated yesterday despite a
mixed bag of economic signals.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 1/8 ahead
at 88 9/32 , with the yield falling to 7.21 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was  3/16 better at 99 7/32 , to yield 5.536 per cent.
The market continued to build on solid gains in the previous two sessions,
suggesting prices may have bottomed out with the sell-off triggered by
Monday's move by the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy.
Bonds improved right from the start of trading, buoyed by news of big jump
in unemployment claims for the third consecutive week. The Labor Department
said 14,000 more people applied for jobless benefits last week than during
the previous seven days, suggesting economic activity slackened more than
economists had expected.
However, mid-morning brought complications. The Philadelphia Federal
Reserve, which two months ago tripped up the market with its regional report
on business activity, was out with its April survey. It included a sharp
rise in the keenly-watched prices-paid component.
As most traders had expected a modest drop, bonds immediately dipped. In a
surprise, the market quickly recovered amid short-covering and retail
buying. Traders drew encouragement for a concurrent decline in the
prices-received index, which suggested higher prices for raw materials were
not feeding through into finished goods. The overall index was softer, too.
Towards midday, reports began to circulate that the Fed was furtively buying
government securities, helping to prop up prices and luring more accounts
off the sidelines. Technical Data, the Boston research firm, estimated that
the central bank bought Dollars 300m in five-year notes and the same amount
of 10-year bonds.
European government bond prices bounced back yesterday, taking their cue
from the stronger turn in the US Treasury bond market. Dealers pointed out
that many of the European bond markets had appeared oversold this week,
after Monday's rise in short-term US interest rates sparked a heavy
sell-off, particularly in the futures pits.
The Bank of France provided the main talking point yesterday, as it cut its
intervention rate by 10 basis points - from 5.90 to 5.80 per cent - and
lowered its five-to-10-day repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.75 per cent.
The cuts followed the Bundesbank's decision to lower its official discount
and Lombard rates by 25 basis points a week ago, and its repo rate by 12
basis points on Wednesday.
Market analysts had speculated on whether the Bank of France would be able
to follow the Bundesbank's lead, given that the French franc had weakened
against the D-Mark this week. However, the French currency strengthened
yesterday and moved back inside its former ERM band of 3.4305 per D-Mark to
trade at around 3.4283 to the D-Mark, despite the French interest rate cut.
French government bond prices stayed firm across the yield curve, with the
OAT due 2004 yielding 6.90 per cent against 6.95 per cent the previous day.
The notional bond futures contract traded on the Matif exchange ended 0.02
lower on the day at 120.08, having traded to a high of 120.50 and a low of
119.66.
'Given the economic fundamentals in France, I think French government bonds
offer the best value of any of the global government bond markets just now,'
said Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson.
'Some people think there may be another 10 basis point cut in the
intervention rate next week, but I think that's too optimistic,' said Ms
Marie Owens Thomsen, bond strategist at Midland Global Markets. She said it
was unlikely the Bundesbank would would pave the way for France to cut again
by reducing its own repo by 10 basis points next week.
Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, Bank of France governor said: 'The decision to lower
interest rates is within the context of internal and external currency
stability, the good fundamentals of the French economy, and a desire to
accompany the non-inflationary growth that is clearly visible.'
German government bond futures ended higher after a relatively volatile day.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 94.47 and traded down in the
morning, then picked up after the US opening and rose to a high of 94.74.
The futures contract sold off again in the afternoon and then bounced back
to settle at 94.60. Traders said the main domestic story for the bund market
remained the upward revision in economic growth forecasts, and the focus on
signs that the German economy was gradually pulling out of recession.
UK government bonds nose-dived in the morning after the release of the UK
retail sales figures for March, but then staged a strong recovery to end the
day nearly a point higher.
Retail sales volume rose a provisional, seasonally-adjusted 0.8 per cent in
March from February, giving a rise of 3.8 per cent from a year earlier.
The March rise was far greater than expected, and gilt prices tumbled as
hopes of a near-term cut in the base rate evaporated. The Liffe gilt futures
contract, which opened at 105.26, dropped to a low of 105.10. However, it
gradually climbed back to settle at 106.16.
The Italian treasury will today make the first payments under a new
fast-track scheme to refund withholding tax to foreign bond-holders.
The scheme came into force at the end of March, replacing the previous
cumbersome refund system, which kept non-resident investors waiting for up
to 12 months for repayments of the 12.5 per cent tax.
JP Morgan in Milan said under the new computerised system, refunds should be
available within 35 business days of the coupon payment.

Reuter reports from Rome.
Global co-ordinators of the INA flotation - scheduled for late June - will
be Banca Commerciale Italiana, Credito Italiano, Istituto Bancario San Paolo
di Torino and Goldman Sachs.
The company is seeking a listing in Italy and the US. Goldman will lead the
US share placement in a consortium with Salomon Brothers, Credit Suisse
First Boston, Morgan Stanley, Fox Pitt &amp; Kelton and IMI.
Other foreign placements will be handled by National Westminster Bank,
Banque Indosuez, the Union Bank of Switzerland, Dresdner Bank, Goldman Sachs
and Fox Pitt.
The Italian treasury has not said exactly how much of the insurance group it
plans to sell. However, INA executives have said they hoped Rome would offer
at least 51 per cent.

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US and Canadian-based financial institutions will be allowed to open
subsidiaries in Mexico from the second half of this year, according to
regulations that came into effect yesterday.
The Mexican finance ministry will accept applications from banks,
brokerages, insurance and other financial institutions until July 31 this
year. The ministry will evaluate applications on that date, and give
authorisations soon after.
Non-US and Canadian institutions will be able to apply through their
subsidiaries in North America.
Foreign banks will collectively be limited to 8 per cent of total Mexican
banking capital this year. If the limit is not reached, the ministry will
invite a second round of foreign banks to apply for licenses.
The capital limit for foreign banks is set under the North American Free
Trade Agreement, and will grow to 15 per cent in 1999, after which it will
be scrapped. An individual bank's capital will be limited to 1.5 per cent of
the total.
Foreign brokerages will initially be limited to 10 per cent of the Mexican
market, with the share rising in equal increments to 20 per cent by 1999,
and to 30 per cent over the following four years.
Foreign insurance companies that already have interests in Mexico will be
able to fully-own Mexican insurance companies after 1996; others have to
wait until 2000.
The ministry said foreign institutions would have to satisfy requirements
similar to those demanded of Mexican entities operating abroad.

New issuance in the Eurobond market ground to a halt yesterday as continued
uncertainty in the secondary markets pushed issuers and investors back to
the sidelines.
A news agency report from New York that Hanson, the Anglo-American
conglomerate, was considering a global bond offering of Dollars 1bn or more
enlivened the market in the afternoon. Although the Hanson rumour has
surfaced before, the report came as a surprise to most London-based
syndicate managers yesterday.
Hanson declined to comment on the report.
Some syndicate managers say the rumour may have been triggered by news that
Quantum Chemical Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hanson, planned
to redeem some more bonds.
Hanson said the redemption of these bonds would complete the refinancing of
all Quantum's public or privately-placed debt, and bring to Dollars 2.5bn
the amount of such debt it will have redeemed or repurchased since it was
acquired by Hanson.
Quantum plans to redeem, on May 22, all of its 6 per cent subordinated
exchangeable debentures due May 2011. Calculated on principal amounts, there
are currently Dollars 46.3m of debentures outstanding.
Elsewhere, Halifax Building Society took advantage of investor demand to
increase Wednesday's offering of capped floating-rate notes, to Pounds 150m
from an original amount of Pounds 100m. The four-year notes were trading at
99.52 yesterday afternoon, up from a re-offer price of 99.50.

SG Warburg Global Equity Derivatives has launched its first issue of covered
warrants on a basket of Swedish stocks.
The American-style call warrants are on a basket made up of 50 shares in
ASEA, 70 in Ericsson, 80 in Investor, 20 in SSAB and 40 in Volvo. The value
of one basket is approximately SKr104,000. One thousand warrants control one
basket, and the approximate issue price per warrant is SKr16.3.
The issue was targeted on the back of research by Swedish stockbroking firm
Haglof and Ponsbach. In December, SG Warburg agreed to buy the research and
institutional sales business of Haglof and Ponsbach from Gota Bank.
Salomon Brothers has launched its second issue of warrants on the
recently-introduced 30-year German government bond. The warrants have a
one-year life.
The number of UK equity warrant issues has grown by 13 per cent, to 224 from
198, since the start of the year, according to the McHattie Group's latest
warrants directory.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Lower productivity hits gold
mine profits at Anglo American
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A decline in productivity at most gold mines in the Anglo American group,
the world's largest producer, led to a 4 per cent drop in attributable
profits of R263.5m (Dollars 73.2m) in the three months to end-March from
R274.4m in the December quarter.
Overall production dipped 7 per cent to 61,295kg after reaching 66,115kg in
the previous quarter. This offset an increase in the average gold price
received for the group, which rose to R41,261 a kg from R39,793 a kg as a
result of the higher gold price and the group's reduced exposure to hedging.
Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Anglo American's gold division, said the group
now had 80 per cent of production exposed to the gold spot price and had
restructured its hedges so that they could be rolled over.
The decline was most apparent in the Freegold division, where gold
production was 10.2 per cent lower at 25,272 kg as a result of a lower yield
and less ore milled. However, the company declared a final dividend of 200
cents, sharply up on last year's 140 cents payout.
Mr Nap Mayer, managing director of the gold division, attributed the
'unsatisfactory performance' to a combination of slightly lower average
yields and some industrial unrest on the mines partly related to the
forthcoming South African election.
The company expects the situation to improve over the next few quarters, but
warned that overall production was likely to be down on this year's total of
111,668kg, which was itself below the previous year's record of 115,320kg.
Among the group's other big producers, Vaal Reefs, the group's most
profitable gold mine, reported a 6.8 per cent decline in production to
17,928kg for the quarter compared to 19,239kg. This was in part the result
of the fall-off in yield after the abnormally high grades achieved last
quarter. Combined with a higher tax bill, this led to a drop in attributable
profit to R65,9m, down 8.3 per cent from R71,9m the previous quarter.
Western Deeps proved one of the few bright spots, increasing attributable
profit to R47,4m from R42,4m, although this was largely due to lower capital
expenditure. Overall production declined to 10,138kg from 11,210kg.
The smaller Elandsrand and Ergo divisions also performed creditably and
recorded slight increases in overall gold production for the quarter.
Mr Sunter said that he expected the overall gold price to remain at current
dollar level over the next few months, but warned that fluctuations in the
rand as a result of political factors would have an important effect on the
market.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malayan United Industries (MUI), a medium-size Malaysian conglomerate headed
by Malaysian Chinese entrepreneur Mr Khoo Kay Peng, yesterday said it had
paid MDollars 361m (USDollars 134.3m) for Mr Rupert Murdoch's remaining 15.1
per cent stake in the South China Morning Post group (SCMP), Hong Kong's
biggest English-language publishing company.
The move gives Malaysian investors a 50 per cent stake in the SCMP. In
September last year Mr Robert Kuok, another Malaysian Chinese regarded as
one of south-east Asia's richest businessmen, purchased a 34.9 per cent sake
in SCMP for USDollars 349m.
MUI's purchase of the SCMP appears to have been executed at a price of
HKDollars 4.59 a share, compared with the HKDollars 5.16 a share Mr Kuok is
believed to have paid last year.
The sale by the News Corp chief to Mr Khoo was seen as friendly to Mr Kuok.
He and Mr Khoo have co-operated on various ventures in the past, but like Mr
Kuok, Mr Khoo and the MUI group are new to the media business.
Last December, MUI purchased a 30 per cent stake in Kerry Financial, a
private financial services group in Hong Kong oned by Mr Kuok, for HKDollars
60m (USDollars 7.78m).
MUI also controls a listed company in Hong Kong - Morning Star, in which it
owns a 53 per cent interest acquired for HKDollars 229m.
Mr Khoo is known as one of Malaysia's most reclusive businessmen. In the
late 1970s and early 1980s the MUI group, centred on banking and financial
activities, diversified into property, cement and manufacturing activities.
But the MUI group fell into political disfavour during a mid-1980s political
leadership tussle in Malaysia, with Mr Khoo alleged to be a key supporter of
Mr Razaleigh Hamzah, a rival of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister.
There was also believed to be official displeasure that Mr Khoo spent
increasing amounts of time outside Malaysia devoting himself to other
business activities and to a charismatic Christian sect called The Christian
Abundant Life.
Reports say official pressure was used to make Mr Khoo sell the MUI Bank and
its finance company in Malaysia late last year.
But Mr Khoo extracted a good price: the Malaysian Hong Leong conglomerate
paid MDollars 1.1bn for the two institutions, giving MUI a considerable cash
hoard.
There is much speculation in Malaysia as to why Mr Khoo bought the SCMP
stake. A statement from MUI merely said that the SCMP shares had been
acquired for long-term investment as part of the group's investment
strategy.
In recent years MUI has been concentrating on its cement manufacturing
concerns in Malaysia and on developing its hotel and property interests. MUI
owns the Ming Court group of hotels in Malaysia and has made several foreign
acquisitions, particularly in the US. It recently bought a Marriott hotel
and office complex in Houston, Texas, and a 750-room hotel in Atlanta,
Georgia.
For 1993, MUI had a pre-tax profit of MDollars 103m on turnover of MDollars
657m.
Hong Kong's securities watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission, said
it would examine the sale of the South China Morning Post stake to MUI,
Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
The market is speculating on whether the purchase by a close business
associate of Mr Robert Kuok complies with Hong Kong takeover and mergers
code, brokers said.

A group of minority shareholders have began legal proceedings to force
Pinault-Printemps, the French retail group, to improve the terms of its
offer to take full control of La Redoute, its mail order unit, writes Alice
Rawsthorn in Paris.
Pinault was 'warned' this week by the Paris stock market authorities over
the valuation of its La Redoute offer.
ADAM, a French shareholders' pressure group, has filed a suit on behalf of
minority investors at the commercial court in Roubaix, where La Redoute has

Marmara Bank yesterday became the second Turkish bank to be closed down,
after the seizure last week of the assets of Turk Yatirim Turizm Bank (TYT).
MarBank was banned from taking deposits and conducting banking transactions,
according to an announcement in the official gazette.
The Treasury is currently investigating both banks. A senior government
official said TYT had been involved in imprudent and improper' banking
practices. But he stressed that the overall health of the industry was not
in doubt.
The Treasury is currently preparing a draft bill to establish a lifeboat
system to help troubled Turkish banks.

stores
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japanese retailers have been hit by continuing weak consumer confidence
exacerbated by a cold summer and falling corporate profits.
The growth of discounting retail chains, due to the economic slump and
deregulation of the retail industry, has affected profit margins at leading
supermarket chains which this week announced annual earnings to February.
Convenience store chains, which have been one of the few growth sectors
within the industry, have also been affected by the growing trend to
discount products, and announced lower-than-expected profit increases.
Most leading supermarket chains were especially hard hit by the fall in
clothing sales, the leading profit earners during the past few years. At
Ito-Yokado, which suffered its first annual profit fall in 11 years,
clothing sales fell 0.4 per cent to Y444.7bn (Dollars 4.3bn) while food
sales rose 2.9 per cent to Y532.5bn.
The profit fall at Daiei comes in spite of cuts in interest bearing debts
and other efforts to strengthen its financial base. The company reported a
Y13.8bn extraordinary profit from the release of its securities holdings and
a Y14.4bn extra loss from the liquidation of its subsidiaries. The company's
after-tax profit rose 24.9 per cent to Y10bn.
At Jusco, company officials said the number of customers rose after the
retailer increased its low-priced product lines, but as a result, the amount
which each customer spent declined. After-tax profit at the company rose 3.5
per cent to Y11.1bn due to asset sales including shares and real estate. The
company also posted extraordinary losses from liquidating a subsidiary.
The retailers, still suffering from over-expansion during the economic boom
of the late 1980s, hope to implement rationalisation measures this year,
including reduction of labour costs. 'Supermarket chains above a certain
size in Japan seem to experience dis-economies of scale from excessive
overheads that result in lower efficiency and performance than that
experienced by slightly smaller chains,' says Mr Shintaro Hori, director at
Bain &amp; Company, the business consultancy.
Mr Dean Perry, retailing analyst at brokers Lehman Brothers in Tokyo, says
retailers' earnings this year will depend on the yen's fluctuations and its
effect on overall corporate earnings and prospects for employment.
Deflationary pressure on retail prices is expected to persist due to the
increase in cheaper imports, widespread competition from discount retailers,
and overall deregulation of various industries.
However, many economists are predicting a pick-up in the economy in the
second half of the year, led by a rise in consumer spending, and point out
that some of the retailers' earnings projections may be too conservative.
Daiei sees pre-tax profits for the year to next February rising 18.1 per
cent to Y26bn, on a 24.9 per cent rise sales to Y2,590bn. Ito-Yokado expects
sales to rise 1.9 per cent to Y1,565bn and pre-tax profits at Y86.5bn, up
5.5 per cent. Jusco projects a 10.3 per cent rise in sales to Y1,170bn on a
1.9 per cent in pre-tax profits to Y26.5bn.
Meanwhile, earnings growth at convenience stores seems to be slowing, as
they, too, have been forced to discount some of the national brand products.
The stores, most of which are open around the clock, were previously seen as
the high-growth sector of the retailing industry since they cater to a
market separate from the supermarket chains and were not susceptible to the
fall in prices. However, earnings projections by the retailers yesterday
indicated that the industry trend toward discounting has started to affect
profits.
For the current year to February, Seven-Eleven Japan expects a 2.1 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits to Y90bn on a 5.5 per cent increase in sales to
Y206.5bn. Family-Mart forecasts a 10.5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to
Y18.8bn on sales up 9.3 per cent to Y85bn.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Japanese steelmakers cut capital
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two of Japan's leading steel companies announced large cuts in capital
spending for the current fiscal year.
Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, said it would cut capital
spending by 24 per cent to Y130bn (Dollars 1.26bn) because of a lack of
large investment projects.
The level of capital spending targeted by Nippon Steel is the lowest since
the company suffered weak demand amid a sharp fall in economic activity in
the late 1980s due to the yen's sharp rise against the dollar.
The reduction is part of a restructuring plan at Nippon Steel, which aims to
restrict its capital spending to Y340bn over the next three years. As a
result, capital spending in fiscal 1995 and 1996 is expected to be even
lower than this year's.
Kobe Steel also announced plans to reduce capital spending by 42 per cent
this year to Y60bn from a previous Y103bn.
'As most of (the planned) large scale investments for reorganising the
production systems to increase competitiveness have been completed, capital
expenditure is being controlled to reduce fixed costs,' Kobe said.
Both Nippon Steel and Kobe Steel are expected to have incurred losses in the
year to March 1994, and Kobe Steel is passing its dividend.

Dollars 36m
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Net income at Westinghouse Electric, the troubled US conglomerate, fell to
Dollars 36m in the first quarter from the previous year's Dollars 59m before
accounting changes, the company reported yesterday.
The decline came in spite of a one-time gain of Dollars 10m before tax from
the sale of two radio stations. But the company had warned in January that
the figures would be much lower, and the shares put on Dollars  1/2 to close
at Dollars 11 1/2 .
Sales were down to Dollars 1.74bn from Dollars 2.02bn last time and
operating profits were down to Dollars 65m from Dollars 146m. Earnings per
share were 7 cents, down from 14 cents before accounting changes.
The figures were hit by increased pension costs of Dollars 33m and reduced
licensee income of Dollars 15m. The previous year benefited from a Dollars
25m change in accounting for nuclear fuel revenues.
Mr Mike Jordan, chairman and chief executive, said progress was made on a
number of strategic initiatives. Its financial structure had been
strengthened through last month's Dollars 520m preferred equity issue, and
the company had received Dollars 1.4bn from the sale of its distribution and
control business and the Westinghouse Electric Supply Company. Net debt was
down to Dollars 3.3bn at the end of the quarter from Dollars 5.1bn at the
beginning.
Broadcasting, government and environmental services, Thermo King and WCI
Communities improved financial contributions. Electronic systems and energy
systems made lower contributions while power generation, The Knoll Group and
other businesses increased their losses.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: US bank sees cut in derivative
use
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Many companies are reducing their use of financial derivatives following the
upheaval in financial markets of the past two months, a senior executive of
Bankers Trust, the US bank, said yesterday.
There was likely to be 'some slowdown (in the use of derivatives) as
policies and procedures are tightened up among corporate users,' said Mr Tim
Yates, the bank's chief financial officer. 'That in itself may be a good
thing,' he added, and predicted that the use of derivatives to manage
financial risk would continue to grow in the long term.
Bankers Trust, the US commercial bank which has been one of the most active
banks in selling derivative instruments to help companies manage risk, has
been threatened with legal action by two companies in the past 10 days which
have lost money on rate swaps.
Procter &amp; Gamble last week put its losses at Dollars 102m, while Gibson
Greetings, a US greetings card company, said on Tuesday that it faced a
paper loss of Dollars 19.7m.
These and other losses have led many companies to review the risks they may
be running through their corporate treasury activities.
Mr Yates said companies that had lost money on derivatives were a minority.
A review of the trades with Procter &amp; Gamble and Gibson had shown them to be
'correct and proper in every way'.
Bankers Trust provided more details yesterday of its trading results in the
first quarter, which were well below 1993 levels. The bank said it lost
Dollars 49m on trading for its own account, an activity which made Dollars
594m in 1993.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Pharmacia sale may face hurdles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo's plans to sell a 28 per cent stake in Pharmacia will end an
involvement in the pharmaceutical industry which dates back to 1985.
Pharmacia is one of the world's top 20 drugs companies with 1993 sales of
SKr27bn (Dollars 3.4bn) - bigger than Astra, its main Swedish rival  - and
it has strong market positions in areas such as growth hormones, eye
surgery, and smoking cessation.
It will not be an easy shareholding for Volvo to offload and it has made the
government's task of selling a 46 per cent stake in Pharmacia this summer,
Sweden's biggest privatisation, more complex.
Volvo's stake will hang over the privatisation, even though it has a pact
with the government which prevents it from selling all but a small portion
of its holding before the end of next year. This means Volvo must sell in
1996 to comply with its own disposal timetable.
At today's price, Volvo would get SKr7.7bn from selling the Pharmacia stake,
against a SKr6.2bn book value. But the company will probably expect proceeds
to be higher, providing the privatisation proceeds smoothly and
pharmaceutical stocks come back into fashion.
For the moment, the sector is overshadowed by worldwide pressure on
healthcare spending.
Much will depend on how Pharmacia performs over the next two years. The
group will undergo restructuring following a period of rapid expansion and
last year's Dollars 1.3bn purchase of Farmitalia Carlo Erba, the Italian
pharmaceutical company.
Pharmacia does not have the volume growth of Astra, and it will be relying
on cost-cutting to lift profits.
The company has indicated it expects as much as half of its production
capacity - spread over 46 plants in 15 countries - to be closed in the next
four years.
At the moment, the most widely held view is that Volvo is most likely to
dispose of its stake through an institutional placing.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Everything that does not conform
must be sold off - Volvo's strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time in months, the pressure on Volvo's senior executives is
off. After a period of large losses and the trauma of the collapsed merger
with Renault, the company has emerged into a period of strong recovery with
a firm strategy.
It is a strategy which has been generally welcomed by shareholders and the
market, even if some motor industry experts are not fully won over.
Everything which does not conform with the concept embodied in Volvo's name
 -latin for I roll - will be sold. That means the disposal of all activities
built up during the heydays of 1980s diversification, including consumer
products, pharmaceuticals, stockbroking and property.
By the time the programme is fully implemented at the end of 1996, the group
will have shed some SKr40bn (Dollars 5.1bn) worth of non-core assets,
including its holdings in two of Sweden's biggest companies: Pharmacia, the
pharmaceuticals group, and BCP, the consumer products concern. The company
will be a pure transport group for the first time since the mid-1970s.
Analysts say the group could generate as much as SKr20bn in capital gains
from the programme. If realised, this would reduce its SKr14.7bn net debt
and help to reach an equity-to-assets ratio of 50 per cent, double today's
level.
The calculation is that a strong balance sheet will give the group enough
muscle to sit out cyclical industry troughs. It will provide the resources
for the group to support its automotive operations without relying on the
economy-of-scale benefits that the Renault link-up would have brought.
'The key thing here is that after the disposals, Volvo will be strong enough
to develop a new car on its own,' says Mr Christian Diebitsch, Swedish
analyst with Kleinwort Benson in London. The top-range 900 series is in the
process of renewal. While a new 400 series is being developed in
collaboration with Mitsubishi through a Dutch-based joint venture called
NedCar
Volvo's aim is no longer to find a single partner; rather it is to strike
specific co-operative ventures with a number of different companies across
the range of its activities.
There is much talk of internal as well as external partnership. By this the
group aims to shorten lead times and increase co-ordination of operations
across different model ranges.
In the short term, the company has gained a respite thanks to the weak
krona, recovery in key markets, intense cost-cutting, and the success of its
850 model. Profitability will soar in 1994 and 1995, enhancing the benefits
it will derive from the disposals and further cost-cutting.
Question marks remain over the group's longer-term strategy. Many
commentators believe it will be forced to seek a deeper alliance with
another manufacturer, particularly to support its car operations.
'My worry is that Volvo has underestimated the costs and complications of
running joint venture collaborative agreements,' says Professor Garel Rhys,
director for the Centre of Automotive Industry Research at the Cardiff
Business School.
He believes that other car manufactures match Volvo's traditional selling
strengths in safety, quality and longevity. He says that without being able
to charge a premium for its product, the group will be forced to seek
economies of scale with another big automotive group to avoid having the
higher unit costs of the small-scale manufacturer.
The way ahead could include a deepening of Volvo's collaboration with
Mitsubishi, or even a partnership with Honda, following BMW's takeover of
the Rover Group.
Prof Rhys believes Volvo would be better advised to look to Japan for its
partners, rather than Europe. 'With a European partner, Volvo would become a
branch factory of a European operation. With a Japanese company, it could
become a bridgehead into Europe,' he says.
But Volvo has gained a breathing space to consider its options when it can
negotiate with a potential partner from a position of strength.
Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive, stressed at Wednesday's annual general
meeting in Gothenburg that he had not changed his views since last autumn
when the group was in the throes of its controversial merger with Renault.
However, he may find that Volvo's independence has to be compromised to a
greater extent than he seems to envisage.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: BCP's core should draw buyers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BCP's strong brand names and dominant market positions should ensure that
there is plenty of buyer interest in its core food, beverage and tobacco
operations.
The division, which last year had revenues of SKr22bn (Dollars 2.78bn) and
operating income of SKr1.46bn, is an agglomeration built up by acquisition
over many years.
Disposal is likely to be through piecemeal sales to Nordic and international
groups, say analysts.
The Nordic countries constitute BCP's main market, with Sweden accounting
for 55 per cent of sales.
The company dominates the Swedish beer and soft drinks market, with a 50 per
cent share through brands such as Pripps and Ramlosa, while Felix, Abba and
Ekstroms Onos are strong brand names on the food side.
Analysts say Nordic consumer product companies such as Norway's Orkla and
Finland's Huhtamaki may show an interest in parts of BCP's food and drink
business, seeing it as an opportunity to bolster market share.
However, they expect competition from big continental companies, such as
Nestle. The beer segment may see a challenge from Carlsberg.
On the tobacco side, Swedish Match Lights, BCP's most international
operation, is the world's largest producer of matches and the third-largest
manufacturer of disposable lighters.
Such a strong global position will almost certainly entice interest from
groups such as Philip Morris and Hanson. Swedish Match has a strong position
in the domestic market, where it is the leader for matches and cigarettes.
BCP's market value is SKr18bn-SKr20bn. Volvo's current 73.6 per cent stake
is booked at only SKr5.8bn, suggesting big capital gains.
However, sales are unlikely to begin before Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief
executive, has completed his bid to mop up the BCP shares which the company
does not own. Selling BCP will be easier for Volvo when it has full control.

American Express's core card business continued a recovery begun last year,
helping to push income from continuing operations at the financial services
group up 18 per cent to Dollars 317m, or 62 cents a share, from Dollars
268m, or 53 cents a share, a year before.
The company's travel-related services division reported after-tax profits of
Dollars 234m, 12 per cent up on the year before.
The amount of business billed on the company's cards during the period rose
to Dollars 31.8bn, from Dollars 28.3bn, more than offsetting a decline in
the average discount rate charged to merchants.
This rate had fallen from 3 per cent in the first quarter of 1993 to 2.87
per cent in the final three months of the year, as American Express sought
to extend the network of retailers who accept its cards. In the latest three
months, the rate was 2.85 per cent.
Though the total number of cards in force remained unchanged over the
months, at 35.4m, the number of charge cards fell by 200,000 to 19.3m.
The company also saw further earnings growth in its IDS financial services
subsidiary, with after-tax profits climbing 22 per cent to Dollars 91m on
revenues of Dollars 818m, 10 per cent higher than a year before.
Lehman Brothers, the investment bank which is due to be spun off during the
current quarter and which is accounted for as a discontinued operation, made
net income (before accounting changes) of Dollars 55m, up from Dollars 34m.
Lehman avoided the sort of trading losses seen in some other banks,
maintaining its trading income at Dollars 434m for the period. With a higher
cost base than many rivals, though, its return on capital during the period
remained low by industry standards, at 10.8 per cent.

<TEXT>
MCI Communications, the second-largest long-distance telephone company in
the US, yesterday reported a 38 per cent increase in first-quarter profits
to Dollars 209m, or 39 cents a share.
A year ago, the company earned Dollars 151m, or 28 cents, although that
figure included a modest charge taken to cover the early retirement of debt.
Revenues were up 15 per cent at Dollars 3.22bn, and traffic volume rose more
than 16 per cent.
The first three months of the year were a busy period for MCI, which
announced several strategic initiatives during the quarter.
These included: the investment of Dollars 1.3bn in an alliance with Nextel
Communications and Comcast to provide digital wireless personal
communications services developed by Motorola; the acquisition of BT North
America as part of an alliance with British Telecommunications; and a joint
venture with Banacci, Mexico's largest financial group, to compete for
long-distance business in Mexico.
MCI said the key to its growth was the steady winning of new customers. New
revenue commitments from large business accounts were up more than 50 per
cent on the previous three months.

suffers

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sears, Roebuck suffered a first-quarter loss of Dollars 97.7m, or 27 cents a
share, after claims related to California's earthquake shook the company's
Allstate Insurance unit. In the same period a year ago, the group's income
from continuing operations amounted to Dollars 317m, or 82 cents.
Sears' consolidated revenues in the first quarter rose 8.6 per cent to
Dollars 12.27bn, from Dollars 11.3bn last year.
Allstate, which is 80.1 per cent-owned by Sears and contributed Dollars
320.1m to Sears' income in the first quarter of 1993, delivered Dollars
220.5m in losses in this year's first quarter.
The catastrophe losses at Allstate, which totalled Dollars 1.1bn for the
quarter, masked a strong performance by Sears' other main business, its
retail stores. Sears Merchandise Group's income more than doubled in the
first quarter, to Dollars 129.5m from Dollars 63.6m a year ago.
Group sales advanced to Dollars 6.9bn, from Dollars 6.1bn last year.
Mr Rick Nelson, retailing analyst for Duff and Phelps in Chicago, said
Sears' 12.4 per cent increase in comparable store sales during the quarter
reflected the success of its new merchandising strategies.
Homart, Sears' real estate division, saw income rise to Dollars 5.2m in the
first quarter from a loss of Dollars 8.2m a year ago.
Mr Edward Brennan, chairman, said: 'Operating performance at Sears
Merchandise Group and Allstate Insurance was solid, and the underlying
fundamentals of these groups are strong, as evidenced by revenue growth of
more than 8 per cent.'

Allstate into loss

<TEXT>
Allstate Insurance, swamped by catastrophe claims from the recent southern
California earthquake, yesterday reported a loss of Dollars 275.2m for the
first quarter of this year.
The loss was a reversal for the US insurance group, which in the same
quarter of last year made a profit of Dollars 320.1m.
The insurer said the earthquake, which struck the Los Angeles area on
January 17, was the second costliest catastrophe in its history, after
Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
The company recently revised its estimate of earthquake losses from Dollars
600m to Dollars 950m. It was the company's second revision; initially it put
losses at Dollars 350m.
Although Allstate's revenues rose during the quarter by 4 per cent to
Dollars 5.32bn, the cost of meeting catastrophe claims from the earthquake
and the severe weather which blanketed much of the US during the winter left
the company nursing an operating loss (excluding after-tax capital gains) of
Dollars 349.4m.
A year earlier, Allstate reported an operating profit of Dollars 259.3m.
However, Allstate's life insurance operations remained profitable during the
quarter, with income rising slightly to Dollars 64.4m on revenues of Dollars
724.6m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Monsanto, the St Louis-based chemical group, yesterday said the cyclical
upturn in the US economy and a strong performance by its herbicide business
helped lift profits to record levels in the first quarter.
Net income in the first three months of 1994 climbed 38 per cent to Dollars
194m, or Dollars 1.63 a share, from Dollars 141m, or Dollars 1.17, in the
year-earlier quarter, when the company realised an after-tax gain of Dollars
22m, or 18 cents.
The results exceeded Wall Street's consensus forecast of Dollars 1.53 a
share, but the stock made only modest progress on the announcement.
On the New York Stock Exchange the share price closed Dollars  1/4 higher at
Dollars 76 1/4 .
Mr Paul Raman, an analyst with SG Warburg in New York, said Monsanto's
improved profitability reflected cost cutting as well as strong growth in
sales volume.
Consolidated net revenues came in at Dollars 2bn, against Dollars 1.94 in
the first 1993 reporting period.
In its agricultural division, the growing popularity of Roundup, a herbicide
that allows farmers to clear land without tilling, lifted operating income
by 37 per cent.
Better-than-expected sales of BST, a controversial new hormone that
increases milk production by cows, helped offset lower prices for most
products, especially in Europe.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Apple Computer reported sharply lower earnings for its second quarter,
underperforming Wall Street expectations.
Net income for the second quarter was Dollars 17.4m, or 15 cents per share,
well below analysts' projections of about 24 cents per share and down
sharply from Dollars 110.9m, or 92 cents, in the same period last year.
Revenues increased 5 per cent to Dollars 2.08bn, from Dollars 1.97bn. Apple
said that strong sales of its Power Macintosh models, introduced last month,
had compensated for slow sales in January and February as customers
anticipated the introduction of the new computers.
However, the company's gross margins fell sharply, from about 38 per cent of
revenue in the second quarter last year to 24 per cent.
Macintosh shipments increased by 9 per cent in volume compared to the same
period last year, the company said, with 145,000 Power Macintosh personal
computers shipped during the quarter. 'We are very pleased with the early
acceptance of Power Macintosh,' said Mr Michael Spindler, Apple's president
and chief executive.
International revenues were 52 per cent of total net revenues during the
second quarter, up from 47 per cent a year ago. The growth in international
revenues was driven by strong shipments in Japan. Apple said that Japan is
now its largest market outside the US.
Apple's results reflected a significant reduction in operating expenses.
Operating expenses for the quarter totalled Dollars 464.3m, a reduction of
Dollars 127.4m compared to the Dollars 591.7m in the same quarter a year
ago. Research and development spending was also reduced.
'Since we announced our restructuring in July last year, we have driven down
costs and increased Apple's efficiency while at the same time working to
deliver important new products like Power Macintosh,' said Mr Spindler.
For the half year period, revenues were Dollars 4.54bn, up from Dollars
3.97bn in the same period last year. Net income was Dollars 57.4m, or 49
cents per share, compared with Dollars 272.2m or Dollars 2.25 per share.

<TEXT>
Strong overseas cigarette sales helped RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco
group, compensate for lower prices in the domestic market, writes Richard
Tomkins.
First-quarter net income fell by 8 per cent to Dollars 194m before
extraordinary items from the comparable quarter's Dollars 210m. The latest
figure, however, included a one-time tax benefit of Dollars 20m. At the
pre-tax level, profits fell by 11 per cent to Dollars 329m from Dollars
370m.
Sales were down to Dollars 3.57bn from Dollars 3.74bn and earnings per
share, fully diluted and excluding extraordinary items, were down 25 per
cent to 12 cents from 16 cents.
The figures are the last that will suffer from an unfavourable comparison
with quarters preceding last year's so-called 'Marlboro Friday', when Philip
Morris prompted a price war by cutting the price of its premium brands.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: ITT-Ciga hotel deal on brink of
collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The agreed L900bn (Dollars 556m) purchase by ITT of Ciga, the Italian luxury
hotel group controlled by the Aga Khan, was last night on the brink of
collapse following an unexpected surge in Ciga's share price.
The US conglomerate ordered its ITT Sheraton hotel subsidiary to recall
immediately all its staff from Ciga hotels in Europe, where they had been
managing the transition to new ownership.
ITT said the deal could not be done at the new share price levels because
Ciga's creditor banks would no longer be willing or able to deliver the
hotel group's equity at the price previously agreed.
But it also said that Ciga's hotels needed capital investment in excess of
L300bn - a disclosure likely to prompt speculation that it was trying to
walk away from the deal because it had become too expensive.
Two months ago ITT appeared to have stolen the Ciga deal from under the nose
of Forte, the UK hotel group that had earlier led the bidding. But the
L900bn it agreed to pay surprised the hotel industry because Ciga is
loss-making and heavily debt-laden.
The ITT agreement provided for Mediobanca, the Italian bank, and 22 creditor
banks to deliver 50.1 per cent of Ciga's equity to ITT at a price of L740 a
share. The rest of the equity would have been acquired on the open market.
In the last few days, however, speculative activity has driven Ciga's share
price up to about L1,300. ITT said this meant there was serious doubt about
whether the banks could deliver Ciga's equity at the agreed price.
ITT said it was still ready to go ahead with the deal under the original
terms, but this was unlikely to be possible unless Ciga's share price
collapsed.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Amoco weathers drop in oil price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amoco, the Chicago-based energy company, yesterday reported a net profit of
Dollars 398m for the first quarter, up from a Dollars 343m a year ago. The
rise was posted in spite of lower oil prices. Revenues were Dollars 6.7bn,
down slightly from Dollars 6.9bn in the same quarter of 1993.
Mr Laurance Fuller, chairman, said cost-cutting and restructuring had
allowed Amoco to post stronger earnings in spite of a 'Dollars 4-to-Dollars
5-per-barrel' drop in crude oil prices. However, he said further changes to
corporate structure were required to keep Amoco competitive.
Lower oil prices were partly offset by a 66 per cent jump in profits, to
Dollars 90m, at Amoco's chemical business. Refining, marketing and
transportation earnings also rose, to Dollars 104m from Dollars 80m a year
earlier.
Income for exploration and production operations in the US, however, were
lower than a year ago, at Dollars 207m against Dollars 253m. This was
primarily because of the drop in crude oil prices. Earnings from Amoco's
overseas exploration and production operations also declined, to Dollars
61m.
Worldwide capital and exploration spending dropped to Dollars 357m from
Dollars 381m a year ago.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Northwest Airlines bucks trend
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northwest Airlines, the US carrier that returned to the stock market last
month after being taken private five years earlier, yesterday reported net
income of Dollars 18.3m in its first quarter, compared with net losses of
Dollars 100.3m last time.
The profit was in sharp contrast with the losses reported a day earlier by
American Airlines and USAir, which said they had been hit by severe winter
weather and low fares.
However, Northwest's figures were flattered by two non-trading items. It
gained Dollars 9.2m before tax from an accounting item related to its
employee stock ownership plan, and a Dollars 12.7m cut in depreciation
expenses following a revaluation of some of its aircraft.
Operating revenues rose 5 per cent to Dollars 2.13bn and earnings per share
were 5 cents, compared with losses of Dollars 1.86 last time.
One reason Northwest's figures did not suffer as badly of those of American
Airlines and USAir is that its route structure is not concentrated in the
north-east of the US, where the worst of the weather struck.
The airline is also benefiting from wage and benefit concessions worth
Dollars 886m over the next three years, under an agreement with its
employees which will give them a 27.4 per cent stake in the company.
Southwest Airlines, the most profitable airline in the US, reported
first-quarter net income of Dollars 41.8m, an increase of 68 per cent on the
comparable period's Dollars 24.9m before accounting changes.

Four Seasons Hotels, the Canadian luxury chain, says it has had over 50
initial inquiries from buyers interested in acquiring the group, and expects
to conclude a deal by the end of the year, writes Michael Skapinker.
Four Seasons is seeking a buyer because Mr Isadore Sharp, its founder and
controlling shareholder, wants to loosen his ties with the group over the
next three to five years. Mr Sharp and his family own 18 per cent of the
group's shares, but control 70 per cent of the votes.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Earthquake pushes Allstate into
loss
</HEADLINE>

Allstate Insurance, swamped by catastrophe claims from the recent southern
California earthquake, yesterday reported a loss of Dollars 275.2m for the
first quarter of this year.
The loss was a dramatic reversal for the US insurance group, which in the
same quarter of last year made a profit of Dollars 320.1m.
The insurer said the earthquake, which struck the Los Angeles area on
January 17, was the second costliest catastrophe in its history, after
Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The company recently revised its estimate of
earthquake losses from Dollars 600m to Dollars 950m.
Mr Wayne Hedien, chairman, said the lesson of the California earthquake was
that, with so many people unable to afford earthquake insurance, the
financial impact of large natural disasters needed to be addressed at a
national level. He said the company was supporting the Natural Disaster
Protection Act before Congress.
The act proposes that the public and private sector jointly provide
homeowners with affordable insurance against natural disasters.
Although Allstate's revenues rose during the quarter by 4 per cent to
Dollars 5.32bn, the cost of meeting catastrophe claims from the earthquake
and the severe weather which blanketed much of the US during the winter left
the company nursing an operating loss (excluding after-tax capital gains) of
Dollars 349.4m.
A year earlier, Allstate reported an operating profit of Dollars 259.3m. As
a result of the catastrophe losses, the company's combined ratio - claims
plus expenses over premiums - jumped 26.9 points to 127.7 in the quarter.
Allstate's life insurance operations, however, remained profitable during
the quarter, with income rising slightly to Dollars 64.4m on revenues of
Dollars 724.6m.
Yesterday's results did not surprise analysts, and they had little impact on
the company's share price, which eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 22 3/4 on the
New York Stock Exchange.
Chubb Corporation, another US insurer, was also hit by earthquake and winter
storm losses. It posted net income of Dollars 73.2m for first quarter, down
from Dollars 125m a year earlier.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Year-end sale forecast by Four
Seasons Hotels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four Seasons Hotels, the Canadian luxury chain, says it has had over 50
initial inquiries from buyers interested in acquiring the group.
Mr John Richards, senior vice-president, said yesterday the group expected
to conclude a deal by the end of the year.
Four Seasons announced earlier this month it was seeking a buyer because Mr
Isadore Sharp, its founder and controlling shareholder, wanted to loosen his
ties with the group over the next three to five years.
Mr Sharp and his family own 18 per cent of the group's shares, but control
70 per cent of the votes.
The buyer would initially make an offer to outside shareholders, followed
later by the purchase of the Sharp family stake.
Mr Richards said the group would formally be placed on the market by Goldman
Sachs at the end of this month.
He added that the initial inquiries had come from all over the world,
although the majority were from North America.
The group is also trying to sell six of its properties, including the Four
Seasons (formerly the Inn on the Park) in London, although it says it will
insist on the right to continue managing the hotel.
Mr Richards said the group expected to sell three of the hotels by the end
of the year.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Upturn in US helps Monsanto lift
to record Dollars 194m in quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Monsanto, the St Louis-based chemical group, yesterday said the cyclical
upturn in the US economy and a strong performance by its herbicide business
helped lift profits to record levels in the first quarter.
Net income in the first three months of 1994 climbed 38 per cent to Dollars
194m, or Dollars 1.63 a share, from Dollars 141m, or Dollars 1.17, in the
year-earlier quarter, when the company realised an after-tax gain of Dollars
22m, or 18 cents.
The results exceeded Wall Street's consensus forecast of Dollars 1.53 a
share, but the stock made only modest progress on the announcement. In early
trading on the New York stock market, the share price added Dollars  1/8 to
Dollars 76 1/8 .
Mr Paul Raman, an analyst with SG Warburg in New York, said Monsanto's
improved profitability reflected cost cutting as well as strong growth in
sales volume.
Consolidated net revenues came in at Dollars 2bn, against Dollars 1.94 in
the first 1993 reporting period.
In its agricultural division, the growing popularity of Roundup, an
herbicide that allows farmers to clear land without tilling, lifted
operating income by 37 per cent.
Better-than-expected sales of BST, a controversial new hormone that
increases milk production by cows, helped offset lower prices for most
products, especially in Europe.
Mr Raman said early acceptance of BST suggested it could become 'Monsanto's
new home-run product', with the potential to grow into a Dollars 500m
business within three or four years.
In chemicals, US economic expansion in the second half of last year, and
improving conditions in Europe, fed through as a 70 per cent surge in
first-quarter operating income.
Monsanto benefited from robust demand in automotive and housing sectors,
improved productivity and more efficient utilisation of factory capa-city.
The Searle pharmaceuticals division returned to profitability with an
operating profit of Dollars 12m, after posting a Dollars 27m loss a year
ago.
But the NutraSweet aspartame business slipped 15 per cent to Dollars 29m,
despite efforts to cut costs and boost market share.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Net income at Nabisco drops 8%
to Dollars 194m
</HEADLINE>

Strong growth in overseas cigarette sales helped RJR Nabisco, the US food
and tobacco group, compensate for the continuing effects of lower prices in
the domestic market in its first quarter.
Net income fell by 8 per cent from the comparable quarter's Dollars 210m to
Dollars 194m before extraordinary items. The latest figure, however,
included a one-time tax benefit of Dollars 20m. At the pre-tax level,
profits fell by 11 per cent to Dollars 329m from Dollars 370m
Sales were down to Dollars 3.57bn from Dollars 3.74bn and earnings per
share, fully diluted and excluding extraordinary items, were down 25 per
cent to 12 cents from 16 cents.
The figures are the last that will suffer from an unfavourable comparison
with quarters preceding last year's so-called 'Marlboro Friday', when Philip
Morris prompted a price war by cutting the price of its premium brands.
RJR Nabisco said international tobacco volumes rose by 12 per cent, with
strong performances in western Europe, the former Soviet Union and Canada.
The company planned to start manufacturing in the Czech Republic.
International tobacco sales were up 4 per cent at Dollars 727m and operating
profits rose by 13 per cent to Dollars 179m.
Domestic tobacco volume was 9 per cent lower than in last year's first
quarter and sales, at Dollars 1.13bn, were 19 per cent lower. Operating
profit was down 21 per cent at Dollars 393m.
However, domestic tobacco margins rebounded almost to the comparable
quarter's levels. Although its low-cost brands lost volume, sales of its
premium brands like Camel and Winston were almost the same, reflecting the
company's decision to concentrate on profitability.
The Nabisco foods division increased operating profits by 13 per cent to
Dollars 230m, with Nabisco Biscuit doing well from new, reduced-fat versions
of its cookie and cracker brands.
