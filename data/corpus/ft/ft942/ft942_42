FT  21 APR 94 / Energy bill may fall at final hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Energy Conservation bill, which faces its final hurdle in the Commons
tomorrow, looks likely to be killed off by last-minute amendments from the
government and Conservative backbenchers, Bronwen Maddox writes.
Mr Alan Beith, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats who introduced the
bill, said he had counted 216 amendments to the bill and seven new clauses.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, filed 53 of the amendments and three
of the new clauses, and backbenchers submitted the rest late on Tuesday
night.
Energy conservation pressure groups fear there will not be time to debate
the amendments in the bill's third reading tomorrow.
The bill would oblige local authorities to assess the energy efficiency of
households in their area. Ministers are concerned that the bill could result
in an unnecessary financial burden on central and local government.

FT  21 APR 94 / EC set to back Cardiff barrage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is believed to be close to lifting its objections to
the Cardiff Bay barrage after assurances by the government that it will help
to offset the loss of habitat for wading birds.
The Welsh Office has not authorised work to start on the barrage after Mr
Yannis Paleokrassas, the environment commissioner, sent a strongly worded
letter in January to Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary. Mr
Paleokrassas demanded more measures to protect birdlife, especially dunlins
and redshanks.
Mr Wayne David, Labour MEP for South Wales, said yesterday the government
had proposed additional measures which he was told by 'a senior source'
within the commission were acceptable. 'A letter to the government is
imminent,' Mr David said.
Cardiff Bay Development Corporation said: 'We have heard nothing officially
yet. But we're anticipating a response very soon and it sounds like good
news.'
But the Department of the Environment said: 'It is still a matter of ongoing
discussion with the commission which we consider confidential.'
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which alleges that the
barrage contravenes European law on the protection of bird habitats, said it
did not expect a ruling before June.
The corporation recommended six weeks ago that the main Pounds 93m
construction contract should be awarded to a joint venture of Balfour Beatty
and Costain. The barrage, which will take four years to build, will replace
tidal mudflats with a 500-acre freshwater lake as part of the regeneration
of Cardiff's docklands.
The corporation proposes a Pounds 5.7m alternative habitat. But Mr
Paleokrassas's letter, leaked to environment group Friends of the Earth,
called for further measures.

FT  21 APR 94 / Tax concessions for shipping likely
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tory backbenchers campaigning for stronger support for the shipping industry
believe the government is set to announce a limited tax concession.
The Treasury is expected to extend the period during which tax relief can be
obtained under the rules governing the operation of capital allowances.
Expectations of a concession have been aroused by Sir Marcus Fox, chairman
of the backbench 1922 Committee. Unusually, he took a leading role in
seeking to secure more generous tax treatment for the industry during the
final stages of the finance bill. He joined other senior Tory MPs in backing
an attempt to improve the first year allowances for ships.

The pay packages of the 150 highest-paid directors of listed companies rose
by an average 32 per cent last year, says the latest Arthur Andersen
corporate register, Simon Davies writes.
The survey, by publishers Hemmington Scott, does not list the corresponding
increase in earnings for the companies employing the directors, but it would
be closer to 20 per cent. It lists an average pay package - excluding
pension contributions - of Pounds 677,280 for the 150 directors, up from
Pounds 505,852.

FT  21 APR 94 / Bart's casualty closure 'unfair'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, acted 'unfairly, unlawfully and
unreasonably' in ordering the closure of the accident and emergency unit at
St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, the High Court heard yesterday.
Lord Lester QC said the consultation procedure was flawed because Mrs
Bottomley had in effect made up her mind by the time statutory consultations
started. He was appearing for the London boroughs of Islington and Hackney
and on behalf of an individual.
Lord Lester asked the court to grant a declaration that the decision last
year to authorise the closure by the end of this year was unlawful, and to
make an order quashing it.
But Mr David Pannick QC, for the health secretary, said the allegation of
bad faith was false.

FT  21 APR 94 / Smith slams 'electoral pacts'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A row over electoral pacts broke out yesterday after Mr John Smith accused
the Conservatives of standing down local election candidates in four London
boroughs to squeeze out Labour and improve the Liberal Democrats' chances of
winning.
The Labour leader told an election rally in London last night that there was
evidence of 'a number of electoral pacts' between the other two leading
parties.
He said Tory candidates were standing down to give Liberal Democrats 'a free
run' in Barking, Haringey, Waltham Forest and Tower Hamlets.
'People in London should know that if they vote Liberal they may well be
supporting John Major by the back door.'
The Labour leader's claims were rejected as 'complete nonsense' by the
Liberal Democrats. There were 'at least nine councils where Labour and the
Conservatives were in cahoots', the party added.
Mr Smith said that Labour was putting forward candidates in all 1,917 seats
up for election in the capital. This was 75 more than the Tories and 308
more than the Liberal Democrats.
The Labour leader's speech followed hard on the heels of a Westminster press
conference at which leading Conservatives attacked Liberal Democrat policies
in London.
Meanwhile Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman, targeted the Pounds 1.25m
advertising campaign being run by Unison, Britain's largest union, in
advance of the May 5 elections, branding it 'a shameful example of money
being spent to buy influence'. He said Labour gave Unison two 'pay-offs' in
return for the 'backdoor subsidy' to its campaign: 'a massive number of
votes at the Labour party conference' and 'a promise of a national statutory
minimum wage'.

FT  21 APR 94 / Minister hopeful on Malaysian ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British officials say considerable progress has been made towards lifting
Malaysia's ban on giving government contracts to British companies. They
believe it will be some time, however, before trade relations between the
two countries return to normal.
Lord Cranbourne, the junior defence minister, has been in Kuala Lumpur for
talks with Mr Najib Abdul Razak, the Malaysian defence minister. 'I have had
some very constructive negotiations,' Lord Cranbourne said. 'I don't want to
get into details of how the matter is going to be resolved. It is a matter
of some delicacy, but we hope an accommodation will be made before too
long.'
Mr Najib said the ban 'could not be lifted overnight'.
Malaysia announced the ban in February in retaliation for unfavourable
British press reports about Malaysia and its prime minister, Dr Mahathir
Mohamad.
British companies say the UK could lose millions of pounds worth of
contracts if the ban continues.
Since a memorandum of understanding on defence sales was signed between
Malaysia and Britain in 1988, British defence companies have sold Pounds
1.3bn of equipment to Malaysia, including 28 British Aerospace Hawk aircraft
and two frigates.
More than 60 British defence companies are attending a defence exhibition
this week in Kuala Lumpur.
UK companies have been told that they are not being considered in
pre-qualification applications to bid for construction of a Pounds 2.5bn
international airport outside Kuala Lumpur. They are also likely to lose
contracts in Malaysia's fast-expanding power sector.
Dr Mahathir has said the ban will remain until the British press 'stops
telling lies'. He wants an apology from The Sunday Times for publishing a
story suggesting that a British company offered him bribes in exchange for a
government contract.
'Much nonsense has been talked about Malaysia in the British press,' said
Lord Cranbourne. 'We must not let the press come between old friends.'

FT  21 APR 94 / Red faces over white cliffs backlash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government signalled a retreat last night as its plan to mark the 50th
anniversary in June of the D-day Normandy landings with nationwide
celebrations turned into a public-relations fiasco.
Dame Vera Lynn, the singer and wartime 'forces sweetheart', added to the
backlash against the alleged trivialisation of the anniversary by suggesting
she might withdraw from the celebrations' centrepiece. Responding to a
demand from the Normandy Veterans Association that the government scrap a
planned jamboree in London's Hyde Park, Dame Vera said her attendance would
be conditional on the veterans' approval.
Amid mounting criticism from organisations representing soldiers who took
part in the Allied invasion of France in 1944, Downing Street sought to
limit the political damage by distancing Mr John Major from the detailed
planning.
But Field Marshal Lord Bramall, a former chief of the defence staff and
cited earlier in the week by the prime minister as a key supporter,
indicated he was among those unhappy with the carnival-style approach.
Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, responded by signalling
the government may modify plans for the jamboree after a meeting with
veterans' representatives today. He said: 'We are obviously concerned to
make sure that it is something which responds to their view of what the day
should be. . . .that obviously takes a more commemorative flavour.'
Another suggestion - backed by Lord Bramall - was that the Hyde Park event
might be postponed until next year's 50th anniversary of the Allied victory
in the war.
The furore also saw an outbreak of Whitehall infighting between the defence
ministry, responsible for the military commemorations, and the heritage
department, which is co-ordinating civilian celebrations. The MoD blamed the
heritage department for failing to take sufficient account of the
sensitivities of veterans before announcing plans for street parties and
other events.
The veterans insist such activities would detract from the solemn nature of
the anniversary. A total of 37,000 soldiers died and 200,000 were wounded
before the Allies wrested control of Normandy from the German forces.

FT  21 APR 94 / Further Lloyd's actions planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An increasing number of aggrieved Lloyd's Names are considering taking
individual legal action in the wake of last week's successful court cases by
two lossmakers.
Mr David Tiplady, solicitor with DJ Freeman, said he had started acting on
behalf of six further individual Names in the past few days. 'The level of
interest has been phenomenal,' said Mr Tiplady, who represents about 50
Names in individual actions.
Most litigation by Names - individuals whose assets support the insurance
market - is being co-ordinated by action groups. The biggest group has 3,000
Gooda Walker Names and its action comes to court next week. Many of the
individual actions centre on allegations that Names were placed on high-risk
syndicates against their wishes.
Indemnity Insurance Services, a specialised insurance broker which supplies
Names with a stop-loss (or personal reinsurance) facility, forecasts says
Lloyd's Names will face losses of Pounds 2.37bn when the market reports its
results for 1991 next month. The figure is made up of Pounds 1.13bn relating
to losses incurred on business underwritten in 1991 and Pounds 1.24bn on
business written in previous years.
Earlier this month Chatset, the market analyst, said 1991 losses could
exceed Pounds 3bn.

FT  21 APR 94 / Banks 'failing to act' on complaints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks and building societies record customer complaints but do little to
improve their procedures as a result, according to a survey.
Ms Rhoda James and Ms Mary Seneviratne, writing in Consumer Policy Review,
say that of the 13 building societies and 21 banks surveyed, most hold
statistics on customer complaints.
While the majority of building societies said they made practical changes as
a result of the complaint, only a minority of banks did so. 'That is clearly
disappointing and leads one to question why efforts are made to record
complaints in such detail if they are then to have such little impact,' say
the authors.
Ombudsman decisions also have a limited impact, with few institutions
circulating the results of decisions among their staff. Only two building
societies and five banks had ever changed policy or procedure as a result.
However one benefit of the ombudsman scheme has been to formalise the
complaints procedure.

FT  21 APR 94 / Cut in duty on alcohol ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Treasury minister yesterday poured cold water on the idea that the
government might cut duty on alcoholic drinks as a means of recouping
revenue lost through cross-Channel trade.
Sir John Cope, the paymaster-general, told a conference in London: 'If we
were to sharply cut the rate of duty, there is no way we would get back more
than a fraction of the billions of lost revenue from increased UK sales.'
Since the introduction of the European single market at the start of last
year the amount of beer and other drinks imported by shoppers from the
European mainland has increased sharply. The drinks trade argues that
imports are cutting government revenue as well as damaging its own business,
and has urged the government to cut rates of duty.
While disclaiming any knowledge of what the chancellor would do in the next
Budget, Sir John said revenue had not been harmed. In the first three months
of this year alcohol duties were up 7 per cent on the year before. In 1993
as a whole, duty receipts had been up for every category of drink.
Sir John said total duty plus value added tax on alcohol this year would
come to Pounds 6.1bn. The highest estimate produced by lobbyists for lost
revenue in 1993 was Pounds 250m. Even accepting that figure meant a loss of
under 5 per cent of the yield, he said.
Sir John played down suggestions that the European Commission might oblige
the UK to permit cross-Channel drinks shopping by telephone. The official
who had expressed that view had been promptly 'slapped down' by the European
tax commissioner, he said.
Whisky exports exceeded Pounds 2bn for the first time last year, the Scotch
Whisky Association said yesterday. The value of exports rose by more than 5
per cent to Pounds 2.06bn.

FT  21 APR 94 / Speedy appeals on regulations urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two Conservative MPs yesterday tabled an amendment to the de-regulation bill
that would allow companies speedy help in the courts if their businesses
were threatened by decisions of government regulators.
The amendment would allow companies to plead in magistrates courts in
England and Wales for a stay of execution if, for example, government
environment or health and safety inspectors interpreted regulations in a way
that imposed excessive costs on the business.
Mr Ian Smedley, responsible for de-regulation at the Institute of Directors,
said the amendment was 'a good test of whether the government is serious
about easing the regulatory burden on small businesses'.
Many companies complain not so much about government regulations as about
the way they are interpreted, he said.
The amendment would give companies, particularly small ones, an easier and
quicker way of resisting what can be unreasonable enforcement actions by
government regulators, he said.
The amendment to the bill, now in committee stage, has been put forward by
Mr John Sykes and Mr Nirj Deva. Mr Sykes claims support for the amendment
from up to 80 backbench Conservative MPs.

FT  21 APR 94 / Lautro to vet sales by life insurers: Undercover clients to
be used
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life insurance customers are to be recruited by Lautro to act as undercover
'mystery shoppers' in providing the industry's self-regulating organisation
with information about how life insurers really treat their clients.
The first step in this enterprise will be a pilot project to be carried out
with the voluntary assistance of three or four life companies.
Lautro hopes to have carried out a trial project involving some 50 'mystery
shoppers' before the end of June. Diagnostics, a consultancy, is advising it
on recruiting the potential customers.
Mr Kit Jebens, Lautro chief executive, said the project would be very
different from the approaches used by some investigative television
programmes. People involved would be 'genuine prospects', and so the process
could be followed all the way through to the sale.
The 'mystery shoppers' would be trained before they approached life
companies and would be interviewed after they had experienced the sales
process.
Mr Jebens said he hoped that if the results provided reliable information,
then the Personal Investment Authority, which is due to become the regulator
for retail financial services from July, would also pursue the idea. The new
watchdog had already expressed some interest in it, he said.
Lautro sees the project as part of developing a 'customer care index'. This
would be critical in devising a system including incentives to encourage
life companies to adopt high standards of behaviour, alongside the existing
penalties for those companies that do not meet regulators' requirements.
Lautro has been examining this area for more than a year and believes there
is scope for loosening the regulatory reins for companies that score highly
on the customer care index, enabling them to make substantial savings from
not being bound by the detailed provisions set out in regulators' rules.
Mr Jebens was very cool, however, on the role of individual registration of
sales agents in effective regulation - a practice likely to be urged on the
PIA by the committee of MPs examining financial regulation.
He argued that Lautro did not need to have a contractual relationship with
individual sales agents and that it was better not to undermine the
companies' clear responsibility for those it employed.

600 passengers by adding extra seats. Return sailings on the
Folkestone-Boulogne route have increased from four to five a day, two
steering jets have been added and improvements are planned to give a
smoother ride. The sea journey takes 35 minutes and the motorway to
autoroute time is 50 minutes.
Agreement has been reached with Rolls-Royce for the supply of spares for the
company's hovercraft to extend their working life beyond the year 2000. In
addition Pounds 1m has been spent on a tax-free shopping terminal at
Boulogne. There are also plans to upgrade port facilities in Folkestone and
Dover.

FT  21 APR 94 / Halifax backs statutory rules in financial services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A directly administered system of statutory regulation for financial
services would overcome the 'conflicts of interest' from the industry's
involvement and produce a stable regulatory regime, Halifax building society
told MPs yesterday.
Mr Mike Blackburn, Halifax chief executive, said that the society had not
made up its mind whether to apply to join the Personal Investment Authority,
the new watchdog to protect the private investor.
But the Commons Treasury committee examining financial regulation sharply
questioned how the society could assert it was committed to high standards
when it refused to volunteer to customers details of the commissions paid on
certain products until forced to do so as a regulatory requirement.
Mr Blackburn undertook to write to the MPs with details of some examples of
costs of particular policies, but he and his colleagues said that disclosing
figures which could sensibly be compared across the industry was a complex
matter.
As for the form of regulation, the society said that without a need for
primary legislation the staff carrying out the regulatory functions could be
brought directly under the Treasury. This would cut down the 'multi-tiering'
of the planned system.
Mr Blackburn said Halifax was still considering the possibility of being
regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
watchdog.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB chairman, told MPs that although the bank had
applied to join the PIA he hoped the balance of its board would be changed,
so that people working in the financial services industry were in a
majority.

FT  21 APR 94 / Adviser to dead Kuwaiti urged to come forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Police last night appealed for the financial adviser to the murdered member
of one of Kuwait's wealthiest business families to help them with their
inquiries. The adviser is thought to be a London stockbroker but his
identity is not known.
The victim - whose decapitated and burnt body was found in Manchester in
December - was yesterday identified as Mr Adnan Abdul Hameed Al-Sane.
His family business interests are thought to include several businesses and
private holdings in the Middle East, properties in Europe and offshore bank
accounts.
Police said Mr Al-Sane was the youngest member of a family of 11 and the
only one not living in Kuwait. Banking sources said he is understood to have
left his country with a large debt after a local stock market crash. He is
believed to have settled in London in 1986 after living for a period in
Bahrain.
Det Supt Bernard Rees of Manchester police, who is leading the
investigation, said that he wanted to interview an individual who is
believed to have advised Mr Al-Sane on his extensive interests. There is no
suggestion that the individual was in any way involved with the murder.
Police who searched Mr Al-Sane's apartment in Maida Vale, north London,
discovered papers relating to his financial dealings missing from boxes of
files. They have been told by close relatives that the files contained
details of properties held in Switzerland, France, Jordan and the Cayman
Islands, Swiss bank accounts and share certificates.
According to the police, Mr Al-Sane's severed and mutilated head was found
in Staffordshire seven weeks after the discovery of his torso near a
Manchester railway station. The victim was identified by his solicitor after
a photograph of a model of his head was circulated by police.
The mystery surrounding Mr Al-Sane's macabre murder deepened yesterday when
it emerged that a Jordanian citizen wounded with his girlfriend in a
shooting incident in London at the weekend had been involved in a civil
legal action involving Mr Al-Sane.
The Jordanian, who is recovering in a London hospital, was being sued in
connection with Pounds 600,000 that Mr Al-Sane claimed was owed to him.

FT  21 APR 94 / Wellcome critic on Pounds 250,000 extortion charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A health charity official who has persistently criticised the activities of
Wellcome, the drug manufacturer, and is charged with demanding Pounds
250,000 with menaces from the company, appeared yesterday at London's
Horseferry Road magistrates court.
Mr Michael Wolfe, executive officer of the Herpes Association, was remanded
on unconditional bail until committal proceedings later in the spring.
The charge against Mr Wolfe relates to Pounds 250,000 in cash passed to him
by a senior Wellcome executive. The payment was made in August last year
after the two men went for a drive in London in the executive's car. Mr
Wolfe was arrested immediately after the payment was made.
Both Mr Wolfe and the Herpes Association have been persistent critics of
Wellcome's policy for marketing its herpes and cold sore drug treatments,
Zovirax.
Zovirax is Wellcome's biggest selling product by a significant margin,
accounting for more than a third of its Pounds 2bn annual turnover.
In September it launched an over-the-counter version of the drug in cream
form, for the treatment of cold sores. It spent an estimated Pounds 4.5m on
the launch.
The Herpes Association has accused Wellcome of 'hype and misinformation' in
exaggerating the threat posed by the virus to promote its product. It has
argued the herpes virus is an extremely common condition with less serious
implications for carriers than Wellcome's publicity material suggests.
Reporting restrictions in the case have been lifted at the request of Mr
Wolfe. This move was opposed by Wellcome.
Mr Wolfe has been an executive officer of the Herpes Association since 1985.
The main work of the association is to counsel herpes sufferers.
It has publicised research showing that about 95 per cent of adults are
infected with the virus - although the symptoms in most cases are dormant -
and that acute attacks are rare.
It has also promoted research saying that the use of Zovirax for facial cold
sores offers only marginal benefits and that the treatment of repeat
episodes of genital herpes has proved disappointing.

FT  21 APR 94 / Germans in talks to rescue Lancer Boss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jung Heinrich, the Hamburg-based lift-truck producer should be ready next
week to bid for the UK operations of its rival Lancer Boss, Mr Bob Bischof,
chairman of Jung Henirich (GB), said last night.
Mr Bischof spent yesterday at the Lancer Boss UK headquarters in Leighton
Buzzard, Bedfordshire, in discussions with Grant Thornton, which earlier
this month was appointed administrative receiver for the UK operations.
Last week Jung Heinrich bought Steinbock Boss, Lancer Boss's German unit
from a German receiver and discussions yesterday focused on the continuing
trading relationship between Lancer Boss and Steinbock Boss, whose product
ranges are inter-related. Mr Allan Griffiths, one of the UK receivers, said
last week that this relationship needed to be sorted out before he could
sell Lancer Boss - whether to Jung Heinrich or to other potential
purchasers.
Mr Bischof has been brought out of semi-retirement to handle the
negotiations with Grant Thornton and he will remain closely involved if Jung
Heinrich buys Lancer Boss.
Begbies, the London accountants, is also seeking an administration order
from the High Court in respect of another Lancer Boss unit, Toddington Manor
Farms in Bedfordshire.
Begbies was appointed as 'law of property act' receivers by National
Westminster Bank over the parts of Toddington Manor Farm that are collateral
for a loan from the bank to Boss Trucks, a Lancer Boss UK unit.
Mr Nicholas Hood, a partner at Begbies, said it had applied for the
administration order so it could take control of the farm's assets and sell
the farm as a going concern.

FT  21 APR 94 / Hoover 'free flights' scheme costs Pounds 48m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoover's ill-fated 'free flights' promotion has cost the company Pounds
48.2m, far more than it originally feared.
Early last year the company's US parent, Maytag, took a Dollars 30m charge
(then about Pounds 20m) to cover the costs of the promotion, launched in
autumn 1992.
People who bought Hoover products costing Pounds 100 or more were offered
two air tickets to continental Europe or the US. Hoover was swamped by the
response and thousands of customers complained they were unable to obtain
the flights they wanted.
Hoover, based at Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, yesterday said that the total
cost was now put by Maytag at Dollars 72.6m. It said the extent of the
problem had not been known when Maytag originally set aside Dollars 30m.
Under the offer, 220,000 people have already flown or are booked to do so by
the end of this month when the main promotion closes.
'Everyone who followed the rules and the conditions will have been offered
flights,' Hoover said.
Three senior executives lost their jobs over the promotion and a taskforce
of 250 people was set up to handle the flight applications. Two tour
operators were put under contract to make bookings.
Mr Richard Rankin, co-chairman of the taskforce, said: 'We have devoted
enormous resources, both financial and human, to resolving the situation.'
About 70 claims for compensation have been brought against Hoover under the
small claims procedure. The company said it had lost about 20 per cent of
the cases. 'There is still a steady trickle of claims and our policy is to
defend them.'
An action group of dissatisfied Hoover customers intends to send a
delegation to Maytag in Iowa tomorrow. But Maytag said no meeting had been
arranged and it saw no purpose in such a meeting.
In February Maytag reported that Hoover Europe had lost Pounds 6.9m in the
final quarter of last year.

FT  21 APR 94 / S Africa to bid for helicopter order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa is to enter the competition to supply the British Army's new
attack helicopter. The invitation is a landmark in the country's efforts to
penetrate export defence markets.
The Ministry of Defence has allowed the South African Denel company to
tender its Rooivalk helicopter, following an approach from the company last
November. Denel has teamed up with Marshall of Cambridge to mount the bid.
A decision on which helicopter to use is expected next spring, and the
Pounds 2bn order for up to 100 helicopters is one of the army's top
priorities. Attack helicopters are now considered with tanks as the main
battlefield offensive weapons.
The invitation to Denel comes at a time of increasing defence links between
the UK and South Africa. Britain is to help train the new South African
army, formed from the merger of the old defence force and the armed wing of
the African National Congress.
South Africa is also thought to need six corvette ships. When the arms
embargo is lifted Swan Hunter might be in the running to build them.

FT  21 APR 94 / Business encouraged by stronger recovery: Service and
manufacturing sectors more confident - Export sales and orders up in first
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's economic recovery is strengthening after disappointing growth in
recent months, the British Chambers of Commerce said yesterday.
The chambers said their latest survey of 7,492 companies showed that
domestic output, export sales and export orders rose in both services and
manufacturing in the first quarter of this year.
Mr Christopher Stewart-Smith, president of the organisation, said: 'Most
indicators are now moving fractionally but consistently upwards.
Particularly encouraging is that the intention of firms to recruit and
invest is more positive than it has been for the last four years.'
The poll, carried out between March 4 and March 25, showed the balance of
manufacturers reporting a rise in domestic orders in the first quarter, over
those reporting a fall, was 27 percentage points, up from 26 points in the
previous quarter.
The balance of companies seeing improving order books rose from 21
percentage points to 27 points, reversing the decline in orders seen in the
final quarter of last year.
But the chambers said they were concerned that, although the improvement was
seen across all indicators in the service sector, there remained one or two
areas in manufacturing where growth had been static or slight.
Growth had been particularly strong in the Thames Valley and Home Counties
regions, but it had slowed in the north-east and north-west and it had been
particularly slow in Merseyside and the south.
The balance of manufacturers reporting a rise in export order books rose 4
percentage points, while there was a 6 point rise in the balance of service
exporters seeing an improvement in orders.
The chambers said the resumption of the upward trend in sales had improved
investment intentions. The balance of manufacturers planning to increase
their investment in plant and machinery over those making a downward
revision was the highest since the fourth quarter of 1988.
However, capacity utilisation remained low with just one quarter of all
manufacturing companies working at full capacity in spite of the higher
rates of sales.
The chambers said employment remained static in the manufacturing sector
with equal percentages of companies both taking on and cutting staff. Large
companies continued to cut staff, while small companies were increasing the
size of their workforce.
However, employment expectations for the second quarter are improving. A
balance of 8 per cent of manufacturers expected to increase the size of
their workforce in the next three months. Service-sector employment
continued to grow at a faster rate.
While manufacturers were more confident about improving turnover, they were
less optimistic about their profitability. The chambers said that confidence
could be hampered by next month's tax rises.

FT  21 APR 94 / Ulster committee to debate jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Commons Northern Ireland committee yesterday chose employment
creation as the subject of its inaugural inquiry and set a date of May 18
for its first public hearing.
Speaking as a European Union report concluded that Roman Catholics in the
province were more than twice as likely to be out of work as Protestants,
Sir James Kilfedder, the committee's chairman, said the choice reflected the
deep concern about jobs felt by MPs on the committee.
Sir James, the Ulster Popular Unionist party MP for North Down, said the
inquiry would take in issues related to inward investment. In the course of
the inquiry the committee - which intends to make a symbolic first visit to
Ulster within four weeks - would have to meet in Northern Ireland 'from time
to time'.
The announcement came on the eve of the first meeting of a joint council of
the Confederation of British Industry and the Irish Business and Employers
Confederation under an initiative to boost trade between the province and
the Irish Republic.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said the joint council had set
itself the target of doubling north-south trade - now estimated at Pounds
1.5bn - over the next five years. At a dinner in Belfast last night, Mr
Davies said there was 'no reason' why the target should not be achieved -
'particularly if we see further steps towards a cessation of violence and a
political settlement'.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, who is just back from a
trip to the US and Canada, said there was 'a definitely favourable bias in
the US towards investment in Northern Ireland - notwithstanding our media
image that we here are running a Clint Eastwood scenario 24 hours a day'.
Yesterday's EU report said there had been no 'substantial improvement' in
employment prospects for Catholics over the past 20 years - in spite of
anti-discrimination measures introduced by British governments. Catholics
suffered most from long-term unemployment and were under-represented in many
top-ranking executive posts.
The report, which is due to be considered by MEPs tomorrow, calls on the
European Commission to investigate labour market discrimination in Ulster.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday called for greater
security to protect Northern Ireland's nationalist community from attacks by
loyalist gunmen.
He said security had to be stepped up in vulnerable areas.

FT  21 APR 94 / Number employed is higher than thought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some 326,000 more people are in employment than had previously been thought,
revised statistics published yesterday by the Department of Employment have
found.
The total workforce in employment in the UK at the end of last December is
now estimated at 24,705,000, an increase of 326,000 on the original
estimate.
The change in the figures reflects a shift in employment patterns towards
services, small businesses and self-employment. The Department of Employment
said that about two-thirds of its employment estimates are based on figures
taken from a panel of businesses. Previously this panel was made up of
representative companies from a 1989 census of employment, but a 1991
employment census has updated the sample to reflect economic shifts.
Studies have shown that employment in very small workplaces (one to five
people) has been growing while that in all other sizes of workplace has been
falling. The majority of the 'missing jobs' found by the new survey were
among the self-employed.
The revisions mean that the slump between the peak in employment in June
1990 and the trough in March 1993 was less than had previously been
estimated. The recovery between March and December 1993 was also less than
had been thought.
Part-time jobs continue to fuel the growth in employment. Between December
1992 and December 1993, part-time employment rose by 122,000 while full-time
jobs fell by 106,000. Self-employment rose by 66,000 over the year while the
number of employees fell by 2,000.
The long-term decline in manufacturing employment seems to have halted. Jobs
in the sector rose by 3,000 in February, following an increase of 5,000 in
January. The revisions show that at the end of 1993 manufacturing employment
was 95,000 higher than previous estimates.
The 30,300 seasonally adjusted fall in unemployment in March means that over
the six months to March the jobless count has fallen by an average 29,900
each month. February's decline was revised to 37,700 from the 38,800
previously announced. In all, 324,600 people joined the jobless count in
March, while 360,600 left it.
Every region saw a fall in unemployment in March for both men and women,
except Northern Ireland, where female joblessness rose slightly. Northern
Ireland remains the region with the largest percentage of unemployed people;
East Anglia has the smallest proportion.
The number of unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres declined by 1,300, on a
seasonally adjusted basis, between February and March. The total now stands
at 139,800.
Financial incentives are not the only influence on working patterns, and the
government's labour market policy must take into account other
considerations if it is to be effective, the Policy Studies Institute says
today.
The report from the independent think-tank cites the assumption that women
married to newly unemployed men do not increase their paid employment
because of disincentives in the benefits system. In fact, it says,
non-financial factors such as the 'complementarity' between the leisure of
husbands and wives is just as important.

FT  21 APR 94 / Concerns on council fraud 'not met'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authority councillors are failing to respond to high levels of public
concern about fraud and financial malpractice in local government, a report
warns today.
The report by Public Concern at Work, a charity which helps people raise
concerns in the workplace, found that one in 20 of those questioned in a
survey of 1,000 people said they had some direct experience of fraud and
corruption in councils. About a quarter of those had worked for a council or
for a local government contractor.
The report highlights a number of fraudulent practices including a building
services manager who was demanding cash from companies which wanted to stay
on the council's list of contractors.
A study by the Audit Commission, which monitors local government spending,
estimated the loss from reported frauds in 1992-93 at Pounds 25m. Most were
benefit frauds, however, rather than malpractice, and the charity accepts
that local government fraud was still relatively low. Public perception,
however, suggests that councils need to respond more effectively.
The survey calls for internal council 'hotlines' or separate reporting

FT  21 APR 94 / Midlands reports brighter prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial companies in the Midlands expect to make higher profits this year
as the national economy regains some strength, according to a survey
published yesterday.
Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant bank, said that just 7 per cent of 500
medium and large companies in the west Midlands expected profits this year
to be lower than in 1993.
The strongest expressions of confidence came from industrial, engineering
and construction companies, Singer said. The greater financial optimism
appears to have spilled over into the investment outlook - there is a
prospect of increased spending on plant at 66 per cent of companies.
Heightened prospects follow several months of slowly improving deliveries.
In the east Midlands, the Engineering Employers' Federation questioned 143
of its members and found that 60 per cent had increased deliveries in the
first quarter of this year over the final quarter of 1993.
However, less than half reported increasing order books. Mr Nigel Chubb, the
federation's director, said the outlook was still poor in the aerospace
equipment sector. Further, nearly 60 per cent of companies are working under
full capacity.
Meanwhile, manufacturing output in Northern Ireland increased 3.6 per cent
last year - double the national rate, according to government figures
released yesterday.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Moulinex, the French kitchen appliance manufacturer, is to close its
Moulinex Swan kettle plant in Birmingham, with the loss of 333 jobs, the
company said yesterday.
The company blamed the decision on 'old-fashioned machinery and
infrastructure, along with severe problems encountered in updating the
technology', and on 'financial difficulties resulting out of the general
recession and continued losses in the UK'.
Mr John Allen, executive council member of the AEEU engineering and
electrical union, said: 'This is another instance where a foreign company
has taken over an established British company, used its trade names and then
closed the company down.'

Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said last night that
ministers had concluded, following a review, that the ECGD's status as a
separate government department remained 'best suited, in present

In a Commons written answer, Mr Heseltine said the conclusion reflected the
continuing high level of ministerial involvement in the business of the

FT  21 APR 94 / Money launder reports double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of reports to UK authorities about suspected money-laundering
activities has more than doubled in two years, from 5,000 in 1991 to 12,700
last year, Alison Smith writes. About 80 per cent of such reports come from
the four main clearing banks and the TSB.
At the start of a three-day London meeting of the international Financial
Action Task Force, UK agencies involved in fighting money laundering said
that greater awareness of the problem had contributed to the rise in
reports. The taskforce was set up in 1989 in response to the growth of
international money laundering.
The UK agencies expect another sharp rise in reports this year - after
further tough regulations on disclosure of suspicions about money
laundering, which came into effect this month.
They added, however, that there were signs that some 'dirty' cash was being
withdrawn from the UK because Britain had tightened up its response to money
laundering.
This issue was highlighted by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, as one of
the reasons why the international taskforce was so important.
Speaking at the meeting, he said: 'Of course, even firm government action,
if it is carried out in isolation, carries the risk that the launderers will
simply move their activities elsewhere.'

FT  21 APR 94 / Nissan profits slashed to Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nissan, the Japanese car-maker, suffered a steep fall in profits at its UK
manufacturing operations last year.
The company is set to announce that the net profits of Nissan Motor
Manufacturing UK, the group's Sunderland assembly plant, were between Pounds
1m and Pounds 2m, compared with Pounds 29.3m in 1992 and Pounds 18.4m in
1991.
Output at the plant rose 38 per cent last year to 246,281 cars from 179,000
a year earlier - but Nissan was forced to halve production in the final two
months of the year.
Under the impact of the steep fall in new-car sales in continental European
markets last year, Nissan had to reduce UK production to a one-shift
operation by abandoning the night shift for four months from November.
It has also cut its Sunderland plant workforce by almost 600 jobs to about
4,000 through a voluntary severance package.
Production was cut to reduce excess stock levels, and the need to reduce
inventories further will continue to depress output during 1994.
Production this year is expected to be below the 1993 level and is forecast
to total between 200,000 and 240,000. Nissan said that it expected overall
new-vehicle sales in Europe to grow by between 1 per cent and 2 per cent
this year, and it forecast that its sales in Europe would be unchanged at
about 480,000 following a fall of 8.3 per cent last year.
Mr Ian Gibson, Nissan Motor UK managing director, and manufacturing and
purchasing vice-president of Nissan Europe, said yesterday that the
Sunderland plant was the most efficient car production facility in Europe.
But it had embarked on a three-year programme to match the standards of
Toyota - the best of the Japanese manufacturers in Japan - by 1996.
Mr Gibson said the plan called for increases in productivity at the
Sunderland plant of about 10 per cent a year in each of the next three
years. Productivity had been raised by 10 per cent in 1993. The plant's
total cost performance was already superior to Nissan's domestic Japanese
plants, said Mr Gibson, helped in part by the strong appreciation of the
yen.
Nissan was aiming to improve its efficiency in the UK with assistance from
its suppliers. It has set the target of 25 per cent of its suppliers
reaching a reject performance of 100 parts per million this year and 50 per
cent achieving this target by 1996.

FT  21 APR 94 / Wages data spark fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News of an increase in the rate of growth in average earnings raised
inflation fears in the City yesterday.
The Department of Employment said that underlying growth in earnings was 3.5
per cent in the 12 months to January, compared with its earlier estimate of
3.25 per cent. In February, the annual rate was unchanged at 3.5 per cent.
The main reason for the increase, according to the employment department,
was bonus payments, particularly in the banking sector.
However, recent figures from Incomes Data Services, the pay analysis group,
have shown that pay settlements have been increasing this year, with the
majority of deals ahead of the inflation rate. Furthermore, the actual -
rather than the underlying - rate of increase in earnings in the 12 months
to February was 4.4 per cent, up from 3.6 per cent in January.
This may indicate that the underlying rate has further to rise, especially
as higher public-sector pay deals, such as those for doctors and teachers,
will shortly be absorbed in the figures.
The underlying increase in service-sector earnings in the 12 months to
February was 3.25 per cent, while that in manufacturing was 4.5 per cent.
Mr Robbie Gilbert, the Confederation of British Industry's director of
employment affairs, said: 'We need to keep a firm hold on pay. Earnings
increases in the UK, after allowing for inflation, remain above the European
average.'
Figures for unit wage costs reflect the rising earnings trend. In the three
months to February, wages and salaries per unit output in the manufacturing
sector were 1.8 per cent higher than they were in the same period a year
earlier. The three-monthly rate has picked up from 1.7 per cent in January
and 1.2 per cent in September.
However, for the whole economy, unit wage costs in the fourth quarter of
1993 were only 0.5 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier.
Productivity continues to grow; in the fourth quarter of 1993, output per
head was 2.4 per cent higher than a year earlier.

FT  21 APR 94 / British film goes to top of US ratings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A low-budget British film that cost Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.4m) to make and was
shot in 36 days has gone to the number one slot in the US cinema box-office
ratings.
Four Weddings and a Funeral, a romantic comedy produced by Mr Tim Bevan and
Mr Eric Fellner, is the first British film to reach the top spot in the US
since A Fish Called Wanda in 1988.
The picture was wholly funded by Polygram and Channel 4 and is being
distributed by Gramercy, Polygram's distribution company in the US.
It opened at the beginning of last month on just five screens in New York,
but after favourable reviews it has grossed Dollars 14m across 721 screens.
Next week its coverage expands to 900 screens.
The film was made by Working Title Films, written by Richard Curtis and
opens in the UK on May 13. The cast includes Rowan Atkinson and Andie
MacDowell.
The film's success follows attention attracted by British films in the US
such as The Crying Game, Much Ado About Nothing and Shadowlands.
'It seems to me that something is definitely happening out there,' said Mr
Bevan.

FT  21 APR 94 / Sharp rise for Rover Group car sales in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Car sales by Rover Group in Germany shot up by 51 per cent in the first
quarter of this year, during which it became a subsidiary of BMW, the German
carmaker, John Griffiths writes.
Rover announced the increase at the opening of the Turin motor show, where
it also reported a first-quarter sales increase of 30.6 per cent in Italy,
in spite of a fall of 11.2 per cent in Italy's new-car market overall during
the same period.
Mr John Towers, Rover's chief executive, did not directly link the German
sales rise and Rover's change of ownership, but said the surge was 'clear
evidence' of increased awareness of Rover in continental Europe.

FT  21 APR 94 / PSBR is Pounds 3.9bn less than forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government borrowed Pounds 11.3bn to finance public-sector spending in
March, taking the total borrowing requirement for the 1993-94 financial year
to Pounds 45.9bn - Pounds 3.9bn less than predicted in the November Budget.
Debt repayment by local authorities, which was Pounds 2bn higher than had
been anticipated, and lower central government borrowing - Pounds 2.3bn
below predictions - were the main reasons for the undershoot.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'Having
underspent this year, government departments will find it that much harder
to increase their spending in the future.'
He said that it was likely that the Budget forecast of Pounds 38bn for the
PSBR in the financial year 1994-95 would also be met.
The Treasury said spending by all government departments was lower than
expected, although the fall in social security payments as unemployment had
fallen had played an important part.
Excluding privatisation proceeds, the PSBR was Pounds 12.5bn in March and
Pounds 51.3bn for the financial year 1993-94 - compared with Pounds 44.8bn
in 1992-93 and Pounds 3.9bn below the budget forecast.
Privatisation proceeds in March were Pounds 1.2bn - mainly receipts from the
British Telecommunications share issue - giving a 1993-94 total of Pounds
5.4bn.
Central government borrowing on its own account in March was Pounds 8bn and
Pounds 47.8bn for 1993-94, compared with Pounds 42.4bn in 1992-93. Local
authorities borrowed Pounds 1.9bn in March, but paid back Pounds 2.7bn in
the year. Public corporations borrowed Pounds 1.4bn in March - a net Pounds
800m in the whole year.

FT  21 APR 94 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Rise in long-term rates rings
the alarm bells
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent rise in long-term interest rates is ringing alarm bells among the
Group of Seven leading industrial countries and at the International
Monetary Fund.
European monetary officials said yesterday that the rise in long-term rates
since February had been put on the agenda of Sunday's meeting in Washington
of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors, while the IMF reported
that the increase was 'of concern'.
Mr Michael Mussa, the director of the IMF's research department, told a
press conference at the Fund's headquarters yesterday that there was a
'degree of (financial market) overreaction' in so far as US long bond rates
had exceeded 7 per cent.
In the wake of this week's increase of the Federal funds rate to 3.75 per
cent, the yield of the benchmark US long bond rose on Monday to 7.41 per
cent.
However, Mr Mussa also said that much of the rise in long bond rates from
just over 6 per cent was a 'normal and not undesirable reaction to the
strengthening of growth prospects in the US'. There had been a dramatic
upwards revision in expectations of US growth since the autumn.
But there was no reason for long-term rates to be above 7 per cent if the
Federal Reserve could keep inflation in the 3 per cent to 4 per cent range,
Mr Mussa said. The IMF believes that if monetary conditions in the US are
allowed to tighten sufficiently, fears of inflation should ease, reducing
pressure on long-term rates.
Mr Mussa said that by raising short-term rates, the US was not putting on
the brake: it was merely easing the accelerator.

FT  21 APR 94 / IMF World Economic Outlook: UK urged to await 'firm
evidence' on inflation fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain should be cautious in cutting interest rates and should not take
yesterday's news that the budget deficit undershot its 1993-94 target as a
signal for an easier fiscal policy, the IMF says.
The Fund's latest World Economic Outlook suggests that a further easing of
UK financial conditions might be possible in the light of considerable slack
in the economy and the tax increases this year.
But it says that Britain should wait for 'firm evidence' that inflation is
well on course towards its medium-term target of 1-2.5 per cent before any
further cuts in interest rates.
Further moves to consolidate the deficit will be needed in the UK and the
other big industrialised countries. 'Prospective budgetary imbalances will
continue to absorb significant shares of domestic saving,' the IMF warns.
Its projections showing that Britain will have the second highest budget
deficit as a share of gross domestic product among the Group of Seven
countries both this year and next should do nothing to encourage talk of tax
cuts in this year's Budget. Instead, the IMF believes that tax increases
taking effect this month have helped to improve the British policy mix and
should not halt the recovery.
Although it has revised downwards its expectation of UK growth this year to
2.5 per cent from last October's 2.8 per cent, the momentum of recovery
should be sufficiently strong to allow output to rise by 2.8 per cent next
year. By that time, the Fund hopes that Britain will be able to benefit from
recovery in its important European export markets.
The IMF notes that recovery so far has been mainly supported by private
consumption and that exports have made only a small contribution.
Although the Fund expects inflation, as measured by the retail prices index
excluding mortgage interest rates, will ease slightly next year to 3 per
cent from 3.2 per cent this year, this will be somewhat higher than the
average consumer price rise in the industrialised countries.
The IMF expects employment in Britain will grow by 0.6 per cent this year
and by 0.8 per cent in 1995, helping to bring the annual unemployment rate
down to 9.8 per cent next year from 10 per cent this year.

FT  21 APR 94 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Much better, but must try harder
 -A call for all countries to work hard to boost recovery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The good news in the International Monetary Fund's latest World Economic
Outlook is that the global economy is heading for stronger growth.
But all countries - industrialised, developing and those former communist
states in transition to market-based economies - must work hard to stay
competitive and participate in the economic revival.
Because nations are in very different stages of growth and development, the
advice dispensed in the Outlook is almost as varied as the IMF's 178
members.
Each of the three groups of nations analysed includes some that are doing
well and some that are doing badly. Some of the most pertinent parts of the
200-page report tell the laggards how to improve their performance.
The main industrial countries are at different stages of the business cycle
but should come closer to convergence in 1995. The US is growing strongly
and the UK and Canada are recovering well. But while the output decline in
continental Europe and Japan 'may have come to a halt, prospects for a
meaningful recovery are still fragile'.
Recovery is not expected to get under way in Germany before the middle of
this year, the IMF warns. In Japan, where the IMF has cut its forecast of
growth this year to 0.7 per cent from 2 per cent last October, it says
margins of slack could grow further this year.
The IMF hopes for a 'a continued cautious but significant lowering' of
German short-term interest rates. It calls on Japan to deregulate and open
its home market to increase living standards and consumer confidence.
All industrialised countries are urged to use the forthcoming period of
economic expansion to reduce their budget deficits and push through
fundamental labour market reforms. The recent increase in long-term rates
could be a signal that extra efforts are needed to cut budget deficits, it
says.
The Fund calls on the US to act, warning that a continuing structural
deficit of 2 to 3 per cent of gross domestic product could impede 'business
investment, job creation, future growth and improvement in the external
position'. The report, written before this week's increase in US short-term
interest rates, approves of the monetary tightening initiated in February.
Further action 'would seem appropriate'.
The developing nations fall into two camps. There is a fast-growing
successful majority that are building on macro-economic stability, good
governance and market oriented policies and achieving added dynamism through
increased trade with each other. There is also a group of low growth, poor
laggards whose problems are 'truly daunting' but not hopeless.
There is no easy solution to the problems of the slow growing developing
nations, many of which are in Africa. But the Fund cites high and variable
inflation, overvalued currencies, excessive fiscal deficits and import
controls as factors behind a failure to catch up. The lack of a stable
environment for economic decision making has been exacerbated in some cases
by 'poor governance and considerable social and political instability'.
Some countries such as Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique and Somalia suffer
extensive war damage.
Those countries undergoing the difficult transition from communism to
capitalism also fall into two groups. Some, such as Poland and the Baltic
states, are showing signs of economic recovery founded on 'a reasonable
measure of macroeconomic stability and significant progress in structural
reform'. Others, notably Russia and most of the former Soviet republics, are
experiencing a continued deterioration in economic conditions.
The IMF believes the process of transition is 'in most important respects,
essentially irreversible'. But the very expansionary monetary and fiscal
policies pursued by countries such as Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, have not
mitigated the large declines in output associated with the process of
transition. Instead, they have aggravated already difficult economic and
social conditions by fueling near hyperinflation that has stimulated capital
flight and deterred foreign investment.
The IMF partly blames the lack of progress towards macro-economic
stabilisation in Russia and other former Soviet republics on a lack of
sufficient adjustment at company level and the failure of the authorities to
resist demands from industry and agriculture for large-scale financial
support.
In spite of these problems, the IMF forecasts that the world economic growth
will quicken to 3 per cent this year from 2.3 per cent in 1993 and
accelerate further to 3.7 per cent in 1995. While growth in the
industrialised nations is forecast at around 2.5 per cent this year and
next, the IMF expects the developing world will grow by nearly 6 per cent.
As a group, the transition countries are expected to return to growth of 1.4
per cent next year compared with an anticipated drop in overall output of 6
per cent this year.

FT  21 APR 94 / House hangs tough on crime bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Representatives is expected to complete its version of a crime
bill today after a week of debate on the right blend of punishment and
prevention.
In an election year in which crime has soared to the top of many voters'
list of concerns, most members of Congress have preferred to err on the side
of toughness. They even voted to ban weightlifting equipment from federal
prisons.
Already, the House has voted to reject measures to streamline the appeals
process for prisoners facing a death sentence - which opponents said would
actually allow prisoners to drag out their appeals for longer - as well as
an attempt to substitute life in prison for all the death sentences in the
bill.
The appeals overhaul would generally have allowed prisoners to make one
appeal to the federal courts within a year of exhausting their state
appeals. It would thus overturn the effect of some recent Supreme Court
decisions which have limited the right to appeal to the federal courts on
the basis of new evidence or a new legal ruling.
The House voted, however, to allow defendants to use statistics to prove
racial discrimination in the imposition of the death penalty against them.
Statistically, black Americans are three to four times as likely as whites
to be sentenced to death for a given crime.
Statistically, a black American is more than twice as likely to be sentenced
to execution for killing a white victim than for killing a black victim.
It has also voted to expand the 'three strikes and you're out' proposal,
which would impose a mandatory life sentence for someone convicted of a
third violent felony, to include certain non-violent drug offences.
Critics feared this expansion of the 'three strikes' measure, which has been
endorsed by President Bill Clinton, could dilute its effect and possibly
even put the whole crime bill at risk.
However, Congressman Gerald Solomon of New York, who sponsored the measure,
argued that there was no such thing as a non-violent drug trafficking
offence.
It is hard for members of Congress to restrain themselves when it comes to
voting for anti-crime measures, even when they know very well that they will
probably not provide the money necessary to carry many of them out.
The version passed by the Senate last year already carried a price tag of
Dollars 22.3bn, including Dollars 8.9bn over five years to help local
governments hire 100,000 new police officers, and Dollars 3bn to build at
least 10 new federal prisons for violent offenders.
The cost of the House version has already risen above Dollars 28bn. Although
it provides for fewer new police officers, it adds an extra Dollars 10.5bn
to help states build more prisons of their own.

FT  21 APR 94 / Clinton under pressure on Haiti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure is growing on the Clinton administration to adopt more forceful
policies against the Haitian junta.
Late on Tuesday, five liberal senators proposed a bill, similar to one
already in the House, which would significantly tighten existing sanctions.
It would extend the current oil embargo to a complete ban on commerce, cut
off air links, and freeze the US assets of the junta and its civilian
backers, as well as denying them US visas.
Yesterday, Mr Randall Robinson, a respected political activist now in the
second week of a hunger strike, said he would not abandon his fast until the
'discriminatory, immoral and profoundly racist' US policy of summarily
returning Haitian refugees was dropped. The Senate bill would also deny
federal funding for operations repatriating Haitians.
The State Department was also forced to defend the purchasing by US
diplomats in Port-au-Prince of petrol illegally imported through the
Dominican Republic. This practice, according to Senator Christopher Dodd,
the Democrat from Connecticut and co-sponsor of the bill, rendered the oil
embargo a 'joke'.
The State Department said US embassy officials had no choice if they were to
tour the island, checking on human rights abuses and helping humanitarian
supplies get through.

FT  21 APR 94 / Mexican recovery put at risk as rates rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexican interest rates rose sharply yesterday, further endangering chances
of an economic recovery before August's presidential election. The rise did
not prevent a further weakening in the peso.
Interest rates on 28-day government paper rose to 18 per cent, 3.4
percentage points up on last week and compared with 8.8 per cent at the end
of February. Real interest rates are now about 11 per cent.
The rise in rates also led yesterday to another drop in Mexico's stock
market, which plunged 5.2 per cent to close at 1,957. The government allowed
rates to rise in an effort to prop up the peso, which has been hit by heavy
selling of Mexican securities provoked by the increase in US interest rates
and political turmoil that followed the assassination of presidential
candidate Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio.
The peso is trading at 3.37 to the dollar, the central bank limit.
The rate rise threatens to choke economic growth in advance of the
presidential and congressional elections. Mexico had negative growth in the
last two quarters of last year and little growth is likely in the first half
of this year.
However, the government evidently believes a devaluation of the peso out of
its trading band against the dollar would be more costly than low economic
growth.
For the moment, it seems willing to let interest rates rise to the levels
necessary to defend the peso.
Mr Miguel Mancera, head of Mexico's independent central bank, said in an
interview last week: 'Probably we could have interest rates lower for some
time, but this would be an artificially low level, unsustainable, and in the
long run would produce more problems, more inflation, and probably a more
difficult situation in the exchange rate market.'

FT  21 APR 94 / Peru human rights warning
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Peru's national human rights co-ordinating committee, the Coordinadora, has
warned that violence, human rights abuses and 'scorched earth' tactics seem
poised to re-surface in the country's anti-guerrilla campaign.
The warning came as the Peruvian army mounted what some commentators predict
will be the last big offensive in a 14-year war against the Sendero Luminoso
guerrilla movement. For two weeks, airborne troops have strafed hamlets on
the west bank of the Huallaga river, 40 miles from Tingo Maria, where some
of Sendero's last remaining battalions are reported to be dug in.
The Coordinadora alleges there has been 'indiscriminate aggression against
the civilian population' in the zone.
It says numerous witnesses have reported army bombardments of civilian
targets, burning of houses, rape and torture. The number of dead is thought
to be 'alarmingly high' and reports include the sighting of a single group
of 40 corpses.
The Coordinadora says access to the zone has been denied to impartial
observers, including the International Committee of the Red Cross.
An army source, meanwhile, said the operation had dislodged two of the three
Sendero battalions. He claimed the zone was no longer inhabited by
civilians, but admitted several children living in the guerrilla encampments
had been among the '30 or so' killed during armed attacks.
Other violent incidents condemned by the Coordinadora's report were the
April 16 massacre by Sendero Luminoso of 18 natives and settlers in the
eastern jungle province of Mazamari, and the killing by an army patrol of
eight peasants in Leoncio Prado province on April 11.

FT  21 APR 94 / Housing starts bounce back after US winter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US housing starts rebounded sharply last month after a winter hiatus caused
by exceptionally cold weather, official figures indicated yesterday.
Starts rose 12 per cent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
1.47m.
This was 35 per cent higher than the figure in March last year, but still
well below the recent peak of 1.61m starts in December.
Housing rebounded in all regions, with the biggest gains recorded in the
Midwest, where starts rose 30 per cent from February.
Building permits, which offer a guide to future construction activity, rose
5 per cent last month.
With demographic trends less favourable than in the 1980s and mortgage rates
now rising, analysts are growing sceptical about how much scope there is for
further big gains in starts.
The March jump could be the 'last hurrah' for this cyclical sector, said Mr
David Munro, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, a New York
consultancy.
Analysts at C J Lawrence, a New York brokerage, said starts would probably
fluctuate around the March level, averaging 1.4m-1.5m this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Brazilian government has eliminated or cut import duties on 19 products
in an attempt to put pressure on local companies it suspects of imposing
excessive price rises, writes Patrick McCurry in Sao Paulo. A government
ordinance which came into effect yesterday , cuts the tariff on 17 products
to 2 per cent. They include beer, soft drinks, instant coffee and tyres.
Most of the products were subject to duties of 10-20 per cent. The measure
also eliminated import duties on condoms and aluminium cans.
On March 11 the Finance Ministry cut duties on 14 items ranging from steel
products to medicines. The government said the tariff cuts, which are
expected to be temporary, have been sparked by 'abusive' price rises imposed
by local oligopolies since 1990.

FT  21 APR 94 / Cuban exiles go home for talks
</HEADLINE>

   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cuba's economically embattled government will try to mend fences with its
nationals living abroad when it meets leaders of exile groups in Havana for
a three-day conference starting tomorrow.
The agenda includes immigration, human rights and travel, but will not
include political issues, according to the Cuban Foreign Ministry.
The ministry, which arranged the conference, said it is intended to
'normalise links with overseas Cubans'. It is expecting about 200
participants, mainly from exile communities in the US, Europe and Latin
America.
The government says it has not invited representatives of exile groups which
have been opposed to President Fidel Castro's administration, saying that
these 'hysterics' had 'excluded themselves' by supporting the US economic
blockade of the Caribbean island, and by advocating foreign intervention in
Cuba's domestic affairs.
Those invited are representatives of exile groups which have not been openly
hostile to the Castro government, those which have advocated an end to the
economic embargo and a normalisation of relations between Washington and
Havana, and supporters of the Cuban government.
Diplomats in Havana said yesterday that the government's intention was to
bring together all shades of opinion which were not hostile to the
administration, and to try to develop a more solid and influential lobby for
an end to the economic embargo. The meeting is likely to end with a call for
a thaw in relations between Washington and Havana.
The decisions of the representatives of some Cuban exile leaders to accept
Havana's invitation have divided the exile communities, particularly in
Florida.

Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of
the Palestine Liberation Organisation, were due to meet in Bucharest last
night to resolve the last few remaining obstacles to an agreement on
Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho.
Shortly before the scheduled meeting PLO and Israeli peace negotiators in
Cairo said they had completed agreements on all issues of the transfer of
civilian authority from Israeli to Palestinian hands, including the
sensitive matter of control over water.
Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, also said last night a breakthrough
was imminent on one other outstanding issue - the jurisdiction of
Palestinian laws and courts over Israelis and foreigners in Gaza-Jericho.
If reports of progress prove to be solid this would leave only one main
security issue to be resolved - zoning arrangements for the Gaza Strip.
Israel and the PLO must also conclude an agreement on economic relations
between Israel and the future Palestinian economy which appeared deadlocked
in Paris last night on imports and customs duties.
Before seeing Mr Arafat, Mr Peres dampened expectations of the agreement
being signed next week in Cairo when Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of
state, will be visiting the Middle East. 'We are getting close to the end,'
he said. But he added: 'I don't think we'll finish by next week.'

FT  21 APR 94 / Japanese steel giant to halve investment

NKK, Japan's second largest steelmaker, plans to more than halve its capital
investment this year in an effort to cut costs and tide it over the
recession.
Mitsubishi Motors, the Japanese car company, meanwhile said it was testing
Korean-made steel, which is as much as 20 per cent cheaper than Japanese
steel, underscoring the growing rift in the traditionally strong business
ties Japanese companies have had with each other.
If Mitsubishi decided to use Korean steel, it would be the first Japanese
car company to do so on any scale in the domestic market.
NKK said that as part of its restructuring programme it would reduce capital
spending to Y63bn (Pounds 414.5m), or 52 per cent less than the Y130bn spent
last year.
The company, which expects to make a Y25bn loss in the year to March, is
planning to reduce capital spending by March 1997 to one-third of levels
seen in the past three years.
The move highlights the increasingly difficult trading environment facing
Japanese steelmakers, battered by falling demand at home, the strong yen and
increasing competition from cheaper, foreign-made steel.
The car industry provides as much as 20 per cent of overall steel demand in
Japan. Earlier this month, the main steelmakers were forced to agree price
cuts demanded by leading carmakers, for the first time in five years.
Mitsubishi emphasised that there was no change in its policy of maintaining
good relations with Japanese steelmakers. 'The high quality of Japanese cars
owes much to the technology development efforts of Japanese steelmakers,'
Mitsubishi said.
But Japanese carmakers themselves are under extreme pressure to reduce
costs.
Even if Mitsubishi in the end decides against using Korean steel, the
message will have been delivered - the recession has made vulnerable one
link that had seemed inviolable.
The US government yesterday upheld a preliminary ruling that Japanese makers
of grain-oriented electrical steel have been dumping their products in the
US market.
If the International Trade Commission decides that the practice is hurting
US business, Japanese steelmakers could face anti-dumping tariffs of up to
31.08 per cent.

<TEXT>
A realignment of Israeli politics appeared to be under way yesterday as the
Labour party of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin suspended three MPs for
disloyalty.
Among the three is Mr Haim Ramon, former health minister, who is forging a
political coalition to challenge Mr Rabin's supporters in next month's
elections for Histadrut - the trade union federation.
Political observers said Mr Ramon's initiative is a landmark in Israeli
politics similar to the creation of the SDP in Britain which could signal
the beginning of the end of the traditional Labour party. They also said it
would divert the government's attention from the Middle East peace process
at a critical time.
Mr Ramon, a popular politician widely touted as a future prime minister, is
contesting the Histadrut elections on an independent list supported by the
left-wing Meretz bloc, the ultra-orthodox Shas party and several members of
the younger generation of the Labour party. The two other members were
suspended for taking part in Mr Ramon's list.
Analysts say Mr Ramon intends to use the Histadrut elections to test public
support for the creation of new centre-left reform party capable of
challenging Mr Rabin and the traditional Labour party at the next general
elections due in 1996. According to newspaper reports, Mr Ramon has already
named his future party MASAD - Hebrew initials for the Social Democratic
party.
Mr Ramon's challenge has won support from many Labour activists, fed up with
the dominance of the trade unions and old guard leadership represented by Mr
Rabin and Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, who are both in their 70s.
Mr Gideon Samet, a political columnist for the respected Ha'aretz newspaper,
said the split was largely generational and that Mr Ramon was quietly being
supported by a substantial number of ambitious junior politicians who, for
the moment, have chosen to stay inside the party. Mr Ramon's hard-core
Labour supporters inside the parliamentary party include Mr Yossi Beilin,
deputy foreign minister, Mr Haggai Merom, head of the Knesset Committee, Mr
Avraham Burg, head of the Knesset Education Committee and Ms Yael Dayan.
'It is always a matter of timing for an ambitious group to emerge and it
will emerge even at the cost of bitter splits and quarrels with the old
guard,' Mr Samet said. 'The group headed by Ramon and Beilin is certainly
the power to be. The question is when and how and whether they will be able
to stay in the Labour party and take it over.'
Mr Ramon's challenge has caused considerable concern among senior Labour
leaders who accuse him of splitting the party and weakening the fragile
coalition which supports the peace process.

FT  21 APR 94 / US and Seoul plan for military manoeuvres
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US will hold its Team Spirit military exercise in South Korea some time
in November if North Korea continues to refuse full international nuclear
inspections.
The decision was announced yesterday after talks in Seoul between Mr William
Perry, the US defence secretary, and South Korean officials.
The military exercise, which involves extensive ground manoeuvres, cannot be
held earlier because it would disrupt planting and harvesting activities in
farming areas, according to South Korean officials.
However, the late schedule for Team Spirit, which is normally held in the
spring, could weaken its use as a negotiating tactic to pressure North Korea
to allow nuclear inspections.
The US has offered to suspend Team Spirit if North Korea permits nuclear
inspections to proceed. But the International Atomic Energy Agency wants to
conduct the inspections by early next month. North Korea has repeatedly
protested against the staging of the exercises, which have been held almost
annually since 1976, as a provocative act that would raise tensions on the
Korean peninsula.
Analysts believe that the US may use this year's Team Spirit, if it is
conducted, as a means to stockpile more US military equipment in South
Korea. Mr Perry said that the US and South Korea had agreed to improve their
defence preparations through the deployment of new equipment, such as
Patriot anti-missile batteries, Apache attack helicopters and mobile missile
early-warning systems.
The US is also asking South Korea to purchase artillery targeting systems
that would spot the location of thousands of North Korean artillery
batteries along the demilitarised zone.
But Mr Perry emphasised that there is 'no imminent danger of a military
confrontation' and explained the military build-up was a precautionary
measure.

FT  21 APR 94 / Singapore's PM warns US over China: Washington urged to
pursue a policy of constructive engagement with Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, warned yesterday that a break
in Sino-US relations over China's human rights policies would have severe
long-term consequences for the world.
In an interview with the Financial Times in London, Mr Goh emphasised that
he did not foresee a fracture in relations because he did not expect
President Clinton to revoke China's most-favoured nation status, which comes
up for annual renewal in June.
'The US at the end of the day will be rather pragmatic,' he said. 'China is
a huge export market for the US. US business people are putting pressure on
the administration that you can only make a point on human rights thus far
and beyond that the Chinese are not going to move.'
But if there were a break between Beijing and Washington, Singapore would
continue to invest in China. 'China will need even more investments from
Singapore because there will be fewer from the States. The market will be
open to those who trade with China.' The principal concern would be over the
geo-political consequences. China would interpret the US action as an
attempt to limit its growth and would remember it for a long time, Mr Goh
said.
'China will continue to grow - that is our assessment. The resources are
generated internally, not like the former Soviet Union which depends on
(other countries) for resources,' he said.
'When China becomes powerful in 20 or 30 years time, there is no reason why
China should behave kindly towards the west. That's our worry: China may
want to flex its muscles and then it will be a very troublesome world,' Mr
Goh said.
To prevent this, Mr Goh advocated a policy of constructive engagement 'so
that when China grows, it grows as part of the international community.
There are certain ways of behaving, certain norms of behaviour
internationally. If China wants to be an influential member in the world it
can have influence only if its norms of behaviour are similar to the
others'.'
Mr Goh said that Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation, the 17-member
trans-Pacific grouping, was the best forum to promote common understanding.
Mr Goh declined to comment on Singapore's caning sentence on Mr Michael Fay,
an 18-year-old American convicted of vandalism, in advance of consideration
of Mr Fay's appeal.
The prime minister was in London to spearhead a marketing effort for
Singapore's 'external wing' policy, under which it is building industrial
parks in other Asian countries and wants foreign companies to set up plants
in them while also basing part of the operation - corporate headquarters,
high-technology manufacture, training or research and development - in
Singapore.
He admitted the argument was less persuasive to UK companies with
long-established Asian links that it was, for example, in Germany.
The industrial parks which Singapore is building in China, India and
Indonesia were regarded as 'an extension of Singapore - so that you can take
advantage of the lower labour costs in those countries'.
Among other points, Mr Goh said:
Following last year's partial privatisation of Singapore Telecom, the
government planned to offer shares in the gas and electricity systems - now
run by the Public Utilities Board - and in the port.
It was considering enlarging the government's property development arm by
merging smaller companies into it, to prepare it for privatisation.
Singapore was seeking to develop 'three or four' multinational corporations
and to encourage 'a big presence' for them abroad which, he said, would be
both systematically developed and entrepreneurial.
Protest votes against the ruling People's Action party sprang from growing
materialistic aspirations.
Asked whether he expected opposition parties to become a force to be
reckoned with, he replied: 'Not in my political life-time.'

Cambodian government troops have been pushed up to 8km away from the Khmer
Rouge headquarters at Pailin, which they first captured last month, in what
appears to have been a rout. Senior military officials in the nearby town of
Battambang said Pailin was again under the control of the guerrillas.
When government troops first marched into Pailin exactly a month ago, the
victory was presented as proof the Khmer Rouge had been fatally weakened.
Gen Pol Saroeun, who led the attack, said that if Pailin was lost again his
soldiers did not deserve to be called the national army.
The government is trying to present the defeat as a tactical withdrawal but
there is severe embarrassment over the reversal, with government soldiers
fleeing Khmer Rouge artillery attacks.
Wounded soldiers being treated at the hospital in Battambang said morale
among the troops was very low because they were short of food and were not
getting the medical supplies they needed.
The troops also complained that their officers were keeping everything they
found in Pailin for themselves and not sharing the spoils with their troops
as they had promised. So, when that attack came, there was little resistance
and many of the troops simply ran away.
The prime minister, Mr Hun Sen, angrily blamed the Thai military for helping
the Khmer Rouge. He claimed the Thais had provided artillery support and had
moved several hundred guerrillas along the border for the attack.
The Thais have consistently denied such allegations, which they regard as a
means of trying to conceal the incompetence of the Cambodian army.

FT  21 APR 94 / North Korean threat tests Japan's resolve: The Pyongyang
problem has put Tokyo on the defensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two or three times a month, a ferry leaves the port of Niigata, on Japan's
western coast, and crosses the Sea of Japan to Wonsan, in North Korea. The
boats carry Koreans living in Japan to relatives and friends in a country
which is suspected of secretly developing nuclear weapons and with which
Japan has no formal relations.
About 700km north of Niigata, on the island of Hokkaido, Japan's Defence
Agency has stationed Patriot missiles to defend the country against any
possible aggression. North Korea denies it is developing nuclear weapons,
but earlier this month its ambassador to India warned that if it did so they
would be 'primarily designed to contain Japan', rather than aimed at South
Korea or the US.
The ferries and the missiles are vivid symbols of the conflicting feelings
of guilt, uncertainty and fear that have shaped Japan's uneasy relationship
with its communist neighbour.
The Koreans crossing to Wonsan are members of a 700,000-strong Korean
community who have found themselves living in Japan as a result of its
imperialist past.
The Patriot missiles, which are a less sophisticated version of the missiles
used during the Gulf War and are incapable of targeting missiles in the air,
are testimony to the weakness of Japan's independent defence in the face of
the growing perceived threat North Korea has come to pose in the region's
shifting security environment.
As tensions threaten to grow on the Korean peninsula, Japan is having to
face up to the legacy of its imperialist past, rethink its defence
arrangements, and clarify its vision of the role it hopes to play in the
region's long-term security.
The arrival in Tokyo today of Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, will
impress on the Japanese public the importance of doing so. Mr Perry is
scheduled to meet ministers to discuss North Korea as well as the US-Japan
security arrangement.
Japan's coalition government this week took a significant first step towards
putting these issues on the public agenda by formulating a unified stance on
Japan's response to the Korean problem. The coalition agreed that Japan
would follow United Nations policy on North Korea and would prepare for any
emergency within the framework of Japan's constitution and in close
co-ordination with the US and South Korea.
But the accord papers over differences its members have on the issue.
Reaching a national consensus on the difficult questions North Korea poses
for Japan will be an extremely painful process.
Japan's historic guilt about both Koreas, and geographic proximity to the
Korean peninsula, have caused an uncanny silence in Tokyo about the
implications of North Korea's supposed nuclear ambitions. That silence has
masked Japan's dilemma in choosing between its inclination to follow the
international line as much as possible and domestic circumstances that make
doing so very difficult.
For example, while international concern has been raised about the flow of
funds from Japan to North Korea through Korean residents such as those
travelling from Niigata to Wonsan, the official response has been dictated
by sensitivity towards Japan's Korean community.
Japanese officials insist that 'Korean residents in Japan should have the
same rights as Japanese people to travel, to return to their country or to
send money they have earned to relatives,' as one foreign ministry official
says.
The issue is complicated by suggestions that owners of pachinko (pinball)
parlours also regularly transfer funds to North Korea. About 40 per cent of
Japan's 18,000 pachinko parlours are linked to the Chosen Soren, a pro-North
Korean organisation, says Mr Toshio Miyatsuka, associate professor at
Yamanashi Gakuin University.
And on Tuesday Japanese police searched the offices of a trading company on
suspicion that it secretly paid Dollars 118,860 (Pounds 81,411) into the
bank account of a North Korean trading house based in Pyongyang in breach of
Japan's foreign exchange law. The trading company, Mitaka Boeki, is
suspected of illegally transferring the money to the Pyongyang company by
fabricating a contract to import North Korean marine products.
Japan's complicated North Korean connection raises questions about how far
the country is prepared to go to enforce UN decisions. Although government
officials underline the Japanese commitment to abide by UN decisions, if the
UN decides to impose economic sanctions, given its policy of protecting the
rights of all Koreans living in Japan, the country will face a difficult
decision on whether to stop the flow of people to North Korea.
Such concerns are aggravated by the coalition government's own lack of a
clear stance on North Korea amid the political turmoil that has rocked the
country over the past eight months.
On the one hand, the Social Democratic party, which is the largest coalition
partner, has traditionally had close ties with North Korea's Workers' party,
with 119 SDP Diet members belonging to the Japan-North Korea Committee, an
organisation which aims to improve relations with North Korea.
The SDP is also strongly opposed to amending Japan's pacifist constitution,
which allows military activity only for the purpose of self-defence.
On the other hand, right-wing members of the coalition, such as the Japan
New party, favour a more active role for Japan in supporting UN decisions,
even if it means amending the constitution.
Such divergent views will undermine Japan's ability to respond effectively
should the international community adopt a more hardline stance.
At the same time, developments on the North Korean peninsula have posed
questions about Japan's long-term regional security arrangements. 'For the
first time Japan is having to think about the issue of nuclear weapons as
something that could directly affect its own security,' says Mr Masao
Okonogi, professor of international affairs at Keio University.
While the country's constitution gives Japan little choice but to rely on
other countries, any more tangible signs of a real security risk are likely
to raise calls both domestically and internationally for Japan to strengthen
its defences.
'Japan has to have the means to deal with threats of a missile attack.
Otherwise, its foreign policy will be dictated by the whims of countries
that have developed nuclear weapons,' warns Mr Hiro-omi Kurisu, a specialist
on international affairs and defence.
The North Korean situation will be a crucial test of Japan's willingness to
overcome its past and play a new, more assertive role on the international
stage. Given its keenness to join the UN security council, and growing calls
to assume an international role more commensurate with its economic
strength, it will be more difficult for Japan to continue to insist that it
prefers to live in the shadow of its guilt and the US military shield.

FT  21 APR 94 / Chinese banker pledges tight money policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and REUTER
</BYLINE>

   BEIJING, CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China is committed to a tight money policy and will not ease credit
restrictions in response to signs of a marked slowdown in the state
industrial sector, one of the country's top bankers said yesterday.
Mr Dai Xianglong, a deputy governor of the People's Bank, the central bank,
delivered a blunt message to a national banking conference in Shanghai that
faltering state enterprises could not expect to live on easy credit.
Mr Dai also pledged that money supply growth would be kept within this
year's targets which envisages year-on-year growth of about 15 per cent
compared with annual growth of 30 per cent since 1990.
The bank official, whose remarks appeared aimed at heading off demands from
the state enterprise lobby for a loosening of credit restrictions, said that
the country's economic managers must 'remain cool headed'. Inflation, he
said, 'was showing no sign of improvement'.
Figures released earlier this month by the State Statistical Bureau revealed
that industrial output of state enterprises, which account for between 40-50
per cent of the total, had slowed to 2 per cent.
This compared with 50 per cent for township enterprises and 90 per cent for
foreign funded ones.
China's overall rate of economic growth began slowing in the first quarter
to 12.6 per cent compared with more than 13 per cent in 1993. The
government's target for this year is 9 per cent.
Cost-of-living increases are running at more than 25 per cent in the cities
compared with last year. Retail inflation exceeded 20 per cent in the first
quarter against the same period in 1993. The authorities introduced a
16-point stabilisation programme last July in an effort to cool an
overheating economy.
Mr Dai warned that state enterprise demands for additional credit would be
examined on a 'case-by-case' basis. Priority, he said, would be given to
those with good economic performance, followed by those in a position to
'turn red into black in a short time'.
Enterprises up to their neck in debt and with no hope of recovery will be
declared bankrupt, he added.
China, which wants closer ties with India, is considering a big land
concession to New Delhi as a step to settle a border dispute, China's
ambassador in India said yesterday, Reuter reports from Calcutta.
Mr Cheng Ruisheng told a news conference at Calcutta that his country,
claiming huge parts of several Indian border states, was prepared to concede
the Himalayan Sikkim region to India. He did not say when China was planning
to officially recognise Sikkim as an Indian state.

FT  21 APR 94 / World Trade News: North Americans fall out over wheat - A
dispute over Canadian grain imports to US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just a week after negotiators from 125 nations gathered in Marrakesh to
celebrate trade liberalisation, the US is preparing to erect new barriers to
one of the most valuable exports of its biggest trading partner.
The administration of President Bill Clinton has pledged to raise tariffs on
fast-rising imports of Canadian grain, unless a solution is found by
tomorrow to a long-running dispute between the two countries.
The contrast between the mood in Marrakesh and US-Canada trade relations is
especially stark in the area of dispute settlement. Even as the
administration was hailing the new multilateral mechanism to defuse trade
rows, its actions suggest frustration at the bilateral system set up under
the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement.
The US has been the loser in most of the high-profile cases referred to
bi-national panels over the past five years. These include four decisions on
alleged Canadian subsidies on softwood lumber, and two 'extraordinary
challenges' to Canadian exports of pork and live pigs.
In February 1993 a dispute settlement panel, headed by Mr Griffin Bell,
former US attorney general, rejected the US claim that Canada's durum wheat
exports were violating the free trade agreement. Still, it recommended that
the US and Canada jointly funded an audit of Canadian durum sales.
This was done between January 1 1989 and July 31 1992 and it was concluded
that the Canadian Wheat Board had been in compliance with the FTA in 102 of
105 sales.
The weight of public evidence to the contrary has not discouraged a group of
US prairie senators from pressing for firm action against Canadian wheat. In
a letter to the White House last week, six senators - including Mr Max
Baucus, head of the trade subcommittee - railed against the 'array of unfair
Canadian trading practices' and the 'monopolistic' Wheat Board.
They called on the administration to invoke Section 22 of the US Agriculture
Adjustment Act, which allows the imposition of quotas or tariffs against any
farm product that 'materially affects' domestic price support programmes.
The case for this contention rests heavily on a confidential US Department
of Agriculture report which last year charged that cheap imports from Canada
had cost the US farm programme Dollars 600m and interfered with the
operation of the wheat market. The department has so far declined to release
the study.
It is not in dispute that US imports of Canadian durum, used mainly for
pasta, have risen steadily from 11m bushels in 1988-89, when a drought
created a domestic shortage, to an estimated 30m bushels for 1993-94. At the
same time, US production has fallen from 93m bushels in 1987-88 to a
projected 69m this year.
Analysts disagree on the cause of the production decline. Some say US
farmers find it more profitable to plant spring wheat, which yields much
more grain per acre than durum. Others say US farmers have been discouraged
from planting durum because the Canadian imports have knocked down the
price. Whatever the cause, half the US durum produced in the last seven
years has been exported with the help of generous export subsidies.
Other studies have also found little basis for Washington's complaints. The
US International Trade Commission, in a 1990 study, found no consistent
difference between US and Canadian prices. Still another study, published
last Monday by a number of food industry groups, said Canadian imports at
most pushed down US wheat prices by a few cents per bushel.
Mr Martin Abel, the agri-business consultant whose firm prepared the report,
added that 'the US and Canada compete in both domestic and world markets.
When imports into the US are not sold in the world market, they make more
room for US growers in the global marketplace.'
The Canadians contend that cut-price US exports are partly to blame for the
present impasse. Wheat sold under the US Export Enhancement Programme has
squeezed Canadian supplies out of many overseas markets, forcing the
Canadian Wheat Board to look south for new outlets.
They say they are only responding to demand from US millers and food
processors for high-quality, reasonably-priced raw materials.
So strong is the demand that this year's average price is projected to be
Dollars 4.35 a bushel, well above the US support price, which means the US
agriculture department will not be obliged to pay production subsidies.
When the administration indicated that it was considering action under
Article 28 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which would
require an offer of compensation to Canada, the prairie senators became
alarmed. 'We believe that this apparent switch in emphasis from Section 22
to Article 28 locks us into supporting a trade restraint,' they said, 'when
our real goal is to promote truly free trade.'
Mr Roy Maclaren, Canada's trade minister, told parliament on Tuesday that
the two sides were still far apart.

FT  21 APR 94 / World Trade News: Dunkel sees end to skirmishes on trade
front
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Arthur Dunkel, former director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, yesterday suggested that its successor World Trade
Organisation would virtually outlaw the use of unilateral trade retaliation.
'Now, if things work well, the multilateral system will be so strong that no
government will need to make recourse to unilateralism,' he said. 'The World
Trade Organisation will cover practically everything that is the subject of
disputes: goods, services, ideas.'
Mr Dunkel, speaking in Washington, said that the US would be able to bring
its complaints about the EU's audio-visual protection to the WTO, where a
3-5 member arbitration panel would hear the case.
He does not expect Washington to withdraw the laws allowing it to act
unilaterally. However, if the US imposed sanctions, they could be appealed
against at the WTO where the US may be forced to 'correct the situation'.
He refused comment on the contention by Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, that the US can continue to act unilaterally in disputes not
covered by the WTO.
Mr Dunkel wrote most of the new text of the rules agreed in Marrakesh last
week. He refuses to say how much of his 'draft final act' was later amended
until the new WTO is approved by all the governments. Mr Dunkel said the WTO
would offer faster recourse in disputes than any current mechanism.
Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, yesterday said his department was
monitoring 50 large environmental projects around the world so that US
companies can compete swiftly for the business.
He spoke during a week of Commerce Department activities highlighting the
mobilisation of government resources behind exports of environmental
technology. US officials say the effort has already helped to generate more
than Dollars 595m (Pounds 407.5m) in environmental exports.
Mr Brown is establishing an environmental trade advisory committee with 30
members of Congress and the private sector to advise the government.
A working group within his department is identifying markets where
government assistance to US companies can secure 'high immediate returns'.
These include Mexico, the China Economic Area, Germany, South Korea, Brazil,
Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Chile and Argentina.

Ansaldo Volund, a Danish subsidiary of Ansaldo, the Italian state-controlled

partner, have won contracts worth Dollars 300m (Pounds 205.4m) to build
waste-to-energy incinerators for two Taiwanese cities, Andrew Hill writes

Dollars 100m to Ansaldo Volund, for a four-year project which will generate
electricity for the equivalent of 20,000 families in the cities of Pali and
Hsinchu.
Ansaldo, which is controlled by the Italian state engineering group
Finmeccanica, said the award would give Ansaldo Volund 40 per cent of the
Taiwanese market for incinerating urban waste, or 50 per cent if the share
of NKK, the Japanese company to which the Danish group has granted a
licence, is included. The group has won orders for two other incinerators in

FT  21 APR 94 / World Trade News: Volvo seeks factory site in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo, the Swedish carmaker, is investigating several different sites for
the production of cars in Russia, including the massive Gaz plant which
produces the Volga car at Nizhny Novgorod.
Mr Pekka Pattiniemi, head of Volvo sales in the Commonwealth of Independent
States and the Baltic states, is visiting Nizhny Novgorod today to examine
the plant.
Volvo sold 7,100 cars through its official importers and dealers in the
former Soviet Union last year in addition to a couple of thousand cars
imported through other channels.
Gaz is one of three main sites under examination by Volvo - the others
include one near the Finnish border and another near Moscow - but it has
emerged as the favourite because of the company's preference for existing
facilities over a greenfield site.
Several other western carmakers have examined the possibility of
manufacturing in Russia, but no decision has yet been made. Most important,
General Motors, the US carmaker, has signed a memorandum of understanding
with Vaz, the Russian producer of Lada cars to conduct a feasibility study
into the eventual production of the Opel/Vauxhall Corsa small car at the Vaz
assembly plant at Togliatti.
The Russian car industry is in crisis, with sales of all models, especially
the Volga, falling off precipitously as enterprises and individuals lose
purchasing power.
Volvo cars have long been favoured by the foreign diplomatic, business and
media communities in Russia, and the Swedish carmaker has greatly expanded
its toehold in the market in the past three years with sales to the growing
Russian business class.
It is assisted by the relatively high prices charged by the Russian
carmakers for their products, which are less reliable and have fewer
features than their foreign competitors.
The initial plan by Volvo would be to establish small volume assembly of its
940 model from SKD (semi-knocked down) kits with a production of 5-10,000 a
year.
Volvo said that it was being forced to consider local assembly in Russia by
the high level of customs duties. 'We expected to sell 10,000 cars this
year, but customs duties have put a brake on it.'
The Russian government has delayed a decision on a stiff increase in customs
duties, including on cars until June, but it is being pressed very hard by
the industry lobby to make a decision in favour of a high tariff regime to
shield the domestic industries from competition as their costs rise.

secondary market in securities. The merchant banks - Samuel Montagu,
Kleinwort Benson, and Hambros - together with accounting and management
firms - Ernst &amp; Young, and Deloitte &amp; Touche  - will select companies on a
competitive basis. They expect to pick one or two companies in each of five
Russian cities - Moscow, St Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Perm, and
Nizhny-Novgorod. The plan is part of a campaign to help companies attract
finance following the sale of their shares for 'privatisation vouchers'

<TEXT>
Germany's Federal Cartel Office said yesterday a contract by Thyssengas and
Ruhrgas, the country's largest gas supplier and distributor respectively, to
supply energy to four cities in Germany would be forbidden under European
monopoly regulations. The companies can appeal to the Berlin Courts. The two
had intended to organise the distribution of gas to the cities of Cologne,
Duisberg, Dusseldorf and Oberhausen, a move which, according to the
decision, would have created a monopoly in the region.
The decision coincides with efforts by the economics ministry to prise open
gradually Germany's highly regulated energy sector and open up the industry
to domestic and international competition. It also coincides with growing
pressure by emerging participants in the German market, notably Wintershall,
the gas subsidiary of BASF, the country's largest chemical group, which is
seeking a larger niche in the energy sector.

<TEXT>
Sweeping new pan-European insolvency procedures could be in place by the end
of this year, or next year at the latest. The text is nearing completion for
a European bankruptcy convention which would require the courts in each
member state to recognise one another's authority and insolvency
proceedings. Details were revealed by Mr Manfred Balz, chairman of the EU
Council group on bankruptcy and head of the Berlin office of lawyers Wilmer,
Cutler &amp; Pickering.
Mr Balz said the convention would permit the liquidator in the principal
country of a liquidation to stall proceedings in other countries where a
company has subsidiaries, and require EU courts to recognise the authority
of practitioners from other countries. Cross-border insolvency problems have
been highlighted by the case of Lancer Boss, the UK lift-truck manufacturer
forced into receivership after unilateral action by banks against its German
subsidiary. Once final negotiations with EU members are complete within the
next few months, the text will be forwarded to the Council of Ministers.

FT  21 APR 94 / UK monetary disclosure wins no converts: Eddie George's
European Union confreres take a fairly dim view of transparency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, is accustomed to taking
decisions that do not meet the universal approval of European central bank
colleagues.
When he agreed last summer a five-year freeze on his Pounds 200,000-plus
salary to show anti-inflation commitment, one foreign central banker
telephoned to chide him for setting an unfavourable example.
Mr George expects that last week's decision to publish minutes of his
monthly monetary meetings with the Treasury may also encounter some
criticism. Nowhere else in Europe are there any signs of other central banks
wanting to make monetary decisions more transparent.
The Treasury-Bank minutes released last week revealed interest rate policy
differences between Mr George and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of
the exchequer, in recent months.
Britain has now moved broadly into line with practice in the US, where the
minutes of the federal open market committee meetings are released after a
six-week interval. The Bank of England, unlike the US Federal Reserve, does
not have monetary policy independence, since responsibility for setting
interest rates rests with the Treasury.
Mr George backs publishing the details of his discussions with Mr Clarke to
underline his efforts to press monetary rectitude upon the government.
Elsewhere in Europe, however, no moves are on the horizon towards lifting
secrecy surrounding interest rate decisions. A spokesman for the statutorily
independent German Bundesbank called the Treasury-Bank move 'a courageous
step to improve credibility'. But he said the Bundesbank had no plans to
follow suit.
At present, edited minutes of the fortnightly meetings of the Bundesbank's
policy-making council are published only after expiry of 30 years. Although
roughly 35 copies of the minutes are circulated to senior Bundesbank
officials and to ministries in Bonn, details of the central bank's interest
rate-setting gatherings rarely find their way into the press.
The Bundesbank's view is that publication of these minutes after a shorter
time lag could constrain the frankness of discussions among its 16 council
members. Additionally, publication could damage the tradition under which
the bank's top officials try to present policies to the public with a united
voice, the spokesman said.
Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, said last week his
bank did not plan to follow the initiative by the Treasury and Bank of
England.
Since the beginning of the year, the Bank of France's nine-strong monetary
committee has set interest rates independently of the government. However,
the central bank regards the deliberations as secret. Even relatively
trivial matters such as whether or not decisions are taken by vote are kept
confidential.
Mr Trichet, who presents the Bank of France's annual report to President
Francois Mitterrand today , will later make oral presentations to the
finance committee of national assembly and senate.
Members of the bank's monetary committee have been asked not to talk in
public about their fortnightly discussions. Mr Michel Sapin, the former
finance minister, has probably been the most vocal member of the committee.
His most notable public comment so far has been a declaration in January
opposing competitive devaluation.
The Bank of Spain, too, will not lift the veil over its policy-making
procedures. 'The situation here is entirely different from what Mr George is
planning,' according to a bank spokesman. Mr Lus Angel Rojo, the governor,
sees Mr Pedro Solbes, the economy minister, 'fairly frequently'. 'They talk
a lot on the phone but nobody takes any minutes,' the spokesman says.
Under current guidelines, the government is responsible for monetary policy,
and the Bank of Spain executes it, although legislation before parliament is
designed to give the central bank Bundesbank-style autonomy.
A Bank of Italy spokeswoman said yesterday her bank, too, had no plans to
publish details of decision-making, made by the central bank in consultation
with the Italian Treasury. 'Every day we have discussions. It is very
informal,' she said.
An official at the Netherlands central bank, which, after the Bundesbank,
has the most orthodox reputation in Europe, pointed out that the bank was
specifically excluded from Dutch legislation on open government. When the
bank's five-man directorate makes a monetary policy decision, the governor,
Mr Wim Duisenberg, 'phones the (finance) minister to tell him,' the official
said. 'The minister is normally more enthusiastic when interest rates go
down than when they go up.'
Making details of such conversations public 'has never been a matter for
discussion', the official said. He added that sterling's non-membership of
the exchange rate mechanism helped the UK to follow a more open policy. The
Dutch view is that publishing details of George-Clarke conversations might
risk sterling's stability - a matter that, if Britain were in the exchange
rate mechanism, would have repercussions on other European currencies.

FT  21 APR 94 / Economic Watch: German industry optimistic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Federation of German Industry, encouraged by an apparent improving trend
in factory orders, has revised its forecasts for growth in western Germany
this year. Mr Tyll Necker, president of the influential BDI industry group,
said he now expected west German gross domestic product to rise by 1 per
cent in 1994, compared with earlier forecasts of a 0.5 per cent rise. In
eastern Germany, Mr Necker said that growth forecasts of between 6 and 8 per
cent were 'thoroughly realistic'.
The Bundesbank announced yesterday a sharper-than-expected decline in its
securities repurchase rate - a key marker for German money market interest
rates. The central bank said the rate had fallen to 5.58 per cent from 5.70
a week ago, well above market forecasts.
Belgium's fiscal revenues rose in the first quarter of 1994 by 16.4 per cent
to BFr433bn (Pounds 8.4bn) from BFr37bn in the first quarter of 1993. In
March they were up 11.5 per cent to BFr148m compared with BFr132m in March
last year, the Finance Ministry said.
Swedish retail sales fell 2.4 per cent in February compared with February
1993 after a 0.5 per cent increase in January, the national statistics
agency said yesterday.

FT  21 APR 94 / Hungarians queue again - for shares: The launch of a not so
massive mass privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The queue, that symbol of communist mismanagement, is staging a comeback in
newly free-market Budapest. When Jozsef Ring 33 opened its doors on Monday
morning about 200 sleepy customers were waiting. The first had turned up
just after their Sunday lunch the day before.
Jozsef Ring 33 is a bank branch and it sells shares to the public. More
precisely, and alluringly, they are shares for which an investor only has to
pay over five years, and not at all if the securities do not perform.
For Monday was the first day of the small shareholder programme, Hungary's
belated answer to mass privatisation.
An advertising campaign has been building up to the launch for weeks.
Billboards proclaim to the public that 'Every single forint is working
capital.' Full-page newspaper adverts offer 'Property to the smart'. But the
advertising campaign is out of proportion to the size of the transaction.
Hungary's mass privatisation is distinctly unmassive.
The small shareholder programme begins with just one public offering, of
Soproni Sorgyar, Hungary's third-largest brewery. The State Property Agency,
the privatisation authority, is selling a 37 per cent shareholding, worth
Ft1.9bn (Pounds 12m) at the issue price of Ft3,800 a share. Three-fifths of
the issue is reserved for small investors.
Pannonplast, a plastics producer, is next in line. The privatisation
authorities have earmarked about 70 companies and state shareholdings worth
more than Ft100bn for possible inclusion in the scheme.
Even this tentative estimate pales in comparison with the Dollars 7.1bn that
foreign investors had ploughed into Hungary by the end of last year, about
half of which was connected to privatisation projects.
Nor does the small shareholder programme match the ambition of the Czech
Republic's voucher privatisation. The first Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.7bn) wave
of the Czech project privatised more than 1,000 companies. A second phase
currently under way will distribute about Dollars 5.3bn worth of shares in
another 861 companies.
Mass privatisation was supposed, in its initial conception, to reach the
parts of the economy that foreign investors could not, or rather would not.
But the Hungarian scheme does little to extend privatisation to the large
industrial companies such as bus maker Ikarus which have languished,
disdained by private investors, in state ownership.
The small shareholder programme largely passes them by to focus on
profitable and stockmarket-ready concerns - consumer goods producers,
retailers, hotel companies and utilities.
While the Czech voucher scheme has given investment funds the corporate
reins, the Hungarian version will have minimal effect on corporate
governance. The privatisation authorities have picked, for the first
candidates at least, companies that already have foreign investors in the
majority or at least in control of management.
So why is Hungary engaging in 'mass' privatisation at all? Hungarians appear
to be markedly less enthusiastic about the basic principles of privatisation
and the market economy than the Czechs and other neighbours. A recent poll
put support for private ownership of large companies at just 50 per cent.
Foreign control won the backing of just 30 per cent of those asked.
One reason may be a widespread public feeling that privatisation has done
little more than enrich others and put up prices. Foreign investors
dominated privatisation at the start, accounting for 85 per cent of proceeds
in 1991. The balance has since tilted towards domestic investors but it is
company managers and entrepreneurs who have benefited rather than the
general public.
Hence the programme, even if it is symbolic, to create popular capitalism.
'It is privatisation not for the few but for the many,' says Mr Tamas Szabo,
privatisation minister.
And the many waited their turn at Jozsef Ring 33 yesterday. One middle-aged
woman said: 'Just look at how much money managers are getting under
capitalism and compare it with how much I earn. This is a kind of
compensation.'
Others will be more difficult to reach. Economics student and stockmarket
punter Jozsef Molnar displayed cynicism typical of modern Hungary. Casting
around for the motives behind the government's share give-away, he
eventually concluded: 'They are fools.' He is joining the small shareholder
programme anyway, of course, as are many of his classmates.
Or perhaps the government is not so foolish. The conservative Hungarian
Democratic Forum is trailing badly in the opinion polls and the first public
offerings on easy terms coincide with the run-up to elections on May 8.
Ministers deny any connection, but Mr Lajos Csepi, managing director of
state holding company AV RT, is disarmingly frank: 'This is part of the
election campaign, timed by coalition parties to convince the public that
privatisation is heading in the right direction.'
But the Forum is stuck still in fourth place on around 10 per cent in the
opinion polls and most observers doubt the share give-away will come in
time.
'It is too little, too late, to save them,' says Mr Molnar, waiting
patiently for his shares nonetheless.

FT  21 APR 94 / Franc under renewed pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French franc faced continued pressure yesterday, increasing uncertainty
about whether the Bank of France will lower interest rates at today's
meeting of its monetary policy council.
The French currency fell to FFr3.4386 to the D-Mark from FFr3.429 on Tuesday
evening, despite the 12 basis point cut in the German repo rate to 5.58 per
cent. The French currency recovered to close in London at FFr3.435, although
it remained close to its old narrow band European exchange rate mechanism
floor rate of FFr3.4305 to the German currency.
Economists were divided about the implications of the franc's weakness for a
cut in French interest rates. But most said they still expected a reduction
in the intervention rate, the key short-term interest rate, which currently
stands at 5.9 per cent.
Of greater concern is the rise of French bond yields. In the past week,
yields on 10-year bonds have climbed by 40 basis points to about 6.9 per
cent. The French government attaches particular importance to reducing
long-term interest rates, which, it argues, are more important for
industrial investment.
'The fall in the franc might lead the Bank of France to be more cautious,
but it will not want to show that it is concerned or that it is trying to
defend an exchange rate target,' said a currency economist at one French
merchant bank. He said the central bank was pursuing a strategy of gradual
interest rate cuts, following the German repo rate.
Other economists said that a reduction in French interest rates might
strengthen the franc by improving the prospects for economic recovery and
curbing the growth of unemployment, currently at 12.2 per cent and rising.
French economic officials said they were not concerned by the movements in
the foreign exchange markets, which they attributed to general instability
caused by the rise in US interest rates. They said the recent decline of the
franc should not affect the process of lowering interest rates in France.
They say a reduction in short-term interest rates is less important for the
economy, and argue that recovery, fuelled by exports and increasing consumer
expenditure, is already under way.

Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the head of the Left Democratic Alliance, the
former communist partner in the ruling coalition, moved yesterday to defuse
a clash with President Lech Walesa over his right to veto ministerial
appointments. Mr Kwasniewski told the president that his group would drop
its proposed constitutional amendment empowering parliament to overrule the
presidential veto. The president had threatened to call new elections should
the constitution be changed.

FT  21 APR 94 / French brood on the pain of their past: Furore over trial of
Paul Touvier has caught the national mood of gloomy reflection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The eerily emotionless face of Mr Paul Touvier was splashed across the front
pages of yesterday's French newspapers following his conviction in the early
hours of the morning for crimes against humanity - ordering the execution in
1944 of seven Jews in the town of Rillieux-la-Pape.
The trial has generated a blaze of publicity in France. Revelations of his
collaboration with the Nazis and the role of the Roman Catholic church in
sheltering him after the second world war have brutally reminded the French
of one of their history's ugliest periods.
Yet the furore over the trial is only one aspect of the flood of maudlin
nostalgia that has settled over contemporary France, described by
yesterday's Le Monde as the 'new cult of memory'. The trial followed the
release of an unprecedented stream of books and documentaries about Nazi
collaborators during the war.
Ms Christine Ockrent, the influential broadcaster, believes that one reason
why the collaborator is attracting so much attention is because it is only
now, 50 years after the war, that the French feel able to be more honest
about the atrocities of that era.
'It's a sort of generational process,' she said. 'It has been initiated by
the young historians, lawyers and journalists of today who are free from the
contradictions of the past. It's a welcome phenomenon and it's important for
our collective mental health.'
Other commentators suspect the urge to dwell on such humiliating events is
linked to the gloomy mood of latter-day France, now in its worst recession
since the war and unsettled by violent industrial disputes and youth
protests.
Mr Jean-Marie Colombani, editor-in-chief of Le Monde, last week summed up
the state of the nation and the problems of Mr Edouard Balladur, the
centre-right prime minister, in a front page article entitled La France en
panne (France broken down).
'The climate is very depressed,' said Mr Jean-Luc Parodi, professor of
politics at L'Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris, the prestigious
graduate school. 'France's economic and social problems have created a sort
of masochism that tempts the French to brood over painful issues and to feel
impelled to purify themselves by facing up to the worst aspects of their
past.'
Nazi collaborators are not the only Gallic villains to have come under the
spotlight. The centenary of the Dreyfus affair was marked earlier this year
by the publication of several books mulling over that anti-Semitic episode
in French history.
Meanwhile, the French right is attempting to rehabilitate Mr Georges
Pompidou, the conservative president who in 1971 outraged the Jewish
community by granting Touvier a pardon. The 20th anniversary of his death
has been commemorated by so many biographies and seminars that Liberation,
the liberal-left daily newspaper, last week accused the right of indulging
in 'Pompidoumania'.
At the same time the left is steeling itself for the first anniversary next
month of the death of Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the former Socialist prime
minister who shot himself following his party's defeat in last spring's
parliamentary elections.
The anniversary is particularly poignant in the light of the suicide earlier
this month of Mr Francois de Grossouvre, a senior aide to Mr Francois
Mitterrand, the Socialist president.
Even the literary scene is glumly nostalgic. The hottest new novel in France
is Premier Homme, a previously unpublished work by Albert Camus, the most
pessimistic of the post-war existentialists. An autobiographical novel that
Camus was working on before his sudden death in 1960, it shares the same
gloomy sense of nihilism as his other works. It was published last week and
is already a best-seller.
'France is in a very nostalgic mood,' said Mr Parodi. 'Perhaps it's a
coincidence because there are so many anniversaries this year. But I don't
think so. It looks as though the French are choosing to wallow in the past
rather than facing up to the complications of the present and the
uncertainties of the future.'

FT  21 APR 94 / MPs to probe Credit Lyonnais
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The finance committee of the French parliament yesterday unveiled proposals
for a cross-party investigation into the financial problems of Credit
Lyonnais, the heavily loss-making bank which last month was baled out by a
FFr44.9bn (Pounds 5.25bn) government-backed rescue.
The plan to create a team of 12 politicians to conduct a six-month inquiry
into Credit Lyonnais will be debated by parliament today. Mr Philippe
Seguin, president of the parliament, will lead the team. The appointment of
a man who is one of the bluntest members of the centre-right government has
been interpreted as an attempt to quash suspicions that the inquiry will be
toothless.
'Seguin is one of the few people tough enough to make sure there's a
thorough investigation,' said a senior financier. 'But there are so many
vested interests at stake here that it's hard to believe the inquiry won't
be a whitewash.'
However, the investigation could provide an unprecedented opportunity to
discover the truth behind the tangled story of Credit Lyonnais's problems
and to demystify the intricate relationship between the French government
and public sector companies.
Mr Jean Yves Haberer, who chaired Credit Lyonnais from 1988 until last year,
has been widely blamed for its problems. However, he has attempted to spread
the blame by claiming that many of his actions were the result of government
instructions.
Different areas of the French financial establishment are already attempting
to distance themselves from the scandal. The Bank of France last month
issued a statement exonerating Mr Jean-Claud Trichet, its chairman, from
responsibility for Credit Lyonnais in his old role as head of the Treasury.
Liberation newspaper recently published a leaked memorandum in which Mr
Michel Sapin, former socialist economy minister, warned Mr Haberer about the
bank's involvement with MGM, the stricken Hollywood film studio. Economy
ministry officials are expected to try to divert attention to the state
accounts office, which vets the finances of public sector companies.

FT  21 APR 94 / Euro-MPs may delay entry of new EU members
</HEADLINE>

The European parliament last night threatened to upset plans for Austria,
Sweden, Finland and Norway to join the European Union next year.
The parliament must approve the accession of the four countries but Euro-MPs
have been angered by a controversial compromise deal on EU voting rights
agreed by the UK and its European partners during accession negotiations
last month.
Despite assurances by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, that
the compromise was virtually meaningless there was still no certain majority
of MEPs in favour of approving the accession treaty.
Mr Delors made a pointed if implicit reference to the British government,
warning that although the compromise was entered into 'in good faith', in
today's EU 'giving your word doesn't count for what it used to'.
The parliament's faction leaders will decide today whether to put the
mandatory ratification on the agenda for May 4.
Ratification is not likely to be placed on the agenda if it is thought that
there is a possibility it might be voted down by the MEPs.
'It is highly uncertain whether there is a majority in this house for
enlargement,' said Mr Gijs de Vries, a Dutch liberal leader. He added that
only if parliament got equal status to the Commission in the 1996 treaty
review could ratification be guaranteed.
The votes compromise - which was agreed to overcome Britain's objections to
a dilution of voting powers following the EU expansion from 12 to 16 -
allows a small minority of member states in the Council of Ministers to hold
up decisions for a 'reasonable' period, even when they cannot muster the
higher threshold of votes which are needed to block.
Mr Delors said that the political agreement on votes was not legally
binding, and that the EU treaty and Council rules of procedure could be used
to overcome obstruction tactics.
Pressing for ratification yesterday, Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek
European affairs minister, who currently chairs the Council, said 'this
simply codifies what has long been established practice in the Council',
aimed at getting the widest consensus.
Mr Pangalos said anything beyond a two to three-month hold-up of
controversial measures would be difficult.
Attempts continued yesterday to secure the votes of 260 out of 518 MEPs
needed to enable the newcomers to enter the EU.
Faction managers claimed firm support of about 250 votes, but most felt a
good 20 to 30 more vote pledges were needed.

FT  21 APR 94 / Recovery drive reduces rate cut hopes: Earnings growth and
rising employment awaken fears of inflationary pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, RICHARD DONKIN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further evidence of a buoyant UK recovery yesterday reduced hopes of an
early interest rate cut.
Financial markets were upset by an increase in the underlying rate of annual
growth in average earnings to 3.5 per cent in the 12 months to January,
compared with an earlier estimate by the Department of Employment of 3.25
per cent. In February, the annual rate figure remained unchanged at 3.5 per
cent. The figures were seen as a signal of inflationary pressures.
A fall in unemployment and an upbeat survey from the British Chambers of
Commerce represented further evidence of economic recovery.
Traders assumed that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would be less likely
to sanction a reduction in base rates from 5.25 per cent.
The FT-SE 100 Index dropped 29.7 points to 3,098.3 on the day while the June
long gilt future fell by more than a point.
Mr Clarke, moved swiftly to damp suggestions at Westminster that the
evidence of recovery - and also lower-than-expected public borrowing - could
prompt a relaxation of the government's fiscal stance.
He said the tax increases and public spending curbs announced in last
November's budget would remain in place, and dismissed suggestions that the
government might relax spending and borrowing constraints.
The number of people out of work and claiming benefits fell by 30,300 in
March to 2,722,600 on a seasonally adjusted basis.
At 9.7 per cent of the workforce, unemployment is at its lowest level since
June 1992. On an unadjusted basis, the fall was 63,868 to 2,777,545. Most of
the jobs being created were either part-time or in self-employment.
Between March and December 1993, the number of part-time workers rose by
162,000, while those in full-time work fell by 124,000. The Department of
Employment also published figures showing that, at the end of 1993, 326,000
more people were in work than had previously been estimated.
A change in the method of compiling the statistics, to reflect the growth of
the service sector and of small companies was responsible for the revision.
Good news on employment also came from the Chambers of Commerce survey which
showed service and manufacturing companies plan to take on more staff over
the next three months. The survey showed that employers' optimism about jobs
and investment intentions is the highest since the recession began.
However, Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment spokesman, accused the
government of grossly understating the real level of unemployment which he
claimed was running at 5m.
This figure takes in an additional 2.2m people who say they would like to
work but are not actively looking for work. At the rate that unemployment
was falling, he said, 'it would still take the best part of eight years to
get to the level of unemployment the Tories inherited in 1979'.
Meanwhile, figures showed the public sector borrowing requirement for
1993-94 was lower than had been forecast at the time of the Budget,
provoking calls for the recent round of tax increases to be reversed.
The Central Statistical Office said the PSBR for 1993-94 was Pounds 45.9bn,
compared with the earlier government forecast of Pounds 49.8bn. But the
Treasury said the improvement was due to one-off factors, such as greater
than expected debt repayments by local authorities.

FT  21 APR 94 / Volvo will dispose of Pounds 3.4bn assets to focus on
vehicles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GOTHENBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo yesterday announced plans to sell up to SKr40bn (Pounds 3.4bn) worth
of assets to focus its operations exclusively on vehicles.
The disposals, to be completed during 1996, will include the sale of BCP,
the consumer products group, and a 28 per cent stake in Pharmacia, the
pharmaceuticals company. These two sales alone could raise between SKr25bn
and SKr30bn.
The Swedish company is also likely to sell its 20 per cent stake in Renault,
after the collapse of plans to merge with the French carmaker, and smaller
investments in stockbroking, property and investment companies.
Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive, set out the post-Renault strategy at Volvo's
annual general meeting in Gothenburg.
He said: 'Volvo's operations will be concentrated on passenger cars and
trucks and buses, supplemented by marine and industrial engines, aircraft
engines and a major stake in construction equipment.'
Mr Gyll also made clear that Volvo was not seeking a single long-term
partner to replace Renault. But he left the door open for specific
co-operative ventures with other vehicle groups and suppliers.
He said the company had to strengthen its balance sheet and reduce its
SKr14.7bn net debt to provide the resources for its automotive businesses.
Volvo acquired its holdings in BCP and Pharmacia only last year when it
agreed a split of the old Procordia group with the Swedish government. At
that point, BCP, which owns Swedish Match and many of Sweden's best-known
food and drinks brands, was seen as a valuable cash cow to support the more
cyclical vehicle business.
Volvo first wants to take 100 per cent control of BCP by offering to buy the
26 per cent which it does not already own. This offer was confirmed by
shareholders yesterday.
Volvo's room for manoeuvre with Pharmacia is more limited due to its pact
with the government. This prevents Volvo from selling its Pharmacia stake
before 1996, well after the government's planned sale of its 46 per cent
holding in the pharmaceutical company this June.
The group's non-core holdings will immediately be brought together in a
detached structure and under a separate management. Volvo did not specify a
precise timetable for each disposal, noting that the approach would vary
from company to company to maximise value. Units could be sold as a whole,
or in parts, or shares might be listed publicly.
Volvo's short-term prospects have been transformed by the weak krona,
booming sales in its main US and Swedish markets, and the success of the 850
model. The group said first-quarter sales at 100,000 cars were 25 per cent
higher than a year ago. Truck shipments were 30 per cent higher at 15,000
units.
The group is expected to rebound strongly into profit this year, after last
year's SKr2.64bn pre-tax loss. It would have made a profit in 1993 but for
SKr5.2bn in costs linked to the unwinding of its three-year alliance with
Renault.

FT  21 APR 94 / Clinton steps up air strike threat against Serbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER, GEORGE GRAHAM and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, WASHINGTON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday promised to 'make the Serbs pay a higher
price for violence' by stepping up the threat of air strikes to protect the
UN-designated safe areas for Moslems in Bosnia.
His move came as a rocket attack killed up to 14 people and wounded dozens
in the hospital at Gorazde, the Moslem enclave surrounded by Serbs. Aid
workers said the fighting there had led to suffering without precedent in
Bosnia's two-year war.
Mr Clinton called for an extension of the approach used at Sarajevo, the
Bosnian capital, earlier this year in which Nato threatened to bomb any
heavy weapons left within a 12-mile radius exclusion zone.
'Our proposal would create Sarajevo-like areas - that is, safe zones around
all the safe areas, including Gorazde,' Mr Clinton said in a press
conference, forcefully condemning the Serb forces for shelling Gorazde's
hospital.
But after a day of telephone conversations with President Boris Yeltsin of
Russia, President Francois Mitterrand of France and Canadian prime minister
Jean Chretien, Mr Clinton said the US would also lead a concerted diplomatic
drive to restart peace negotiations.
'The imperative now is not only to address the latest Serb transgressions.
It is to renew the momentum toward peace,' Mr Clinton said. He indicated
that the US was willing to contribute more money for UN peacekeeping troops
in Bosnia, responding to complaints from Washington's allies that the US had
reneged on funding commitments.
He also proposed tightening economic sanctions on the Serbian government in
Belgrade for supporting Bosnian Serbs.
Support for escalating air strikes was stronger in Washington than in
Europe, where officials were wary of alienating Russia and putting UN ground
troops at greater risk in an intensified battle. Moscow has rebuked the
Bosnian Serbs over their continued attacks on Gorazde, but still opposes the
use of force against them. President Clinton claimed to have secured 'broad
agreement on objectives' in a telephone call to President Yeltsin. However,
Mr Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, insisted that both Serbs and
Moslems were responsible for the latest fighting, and that air strikes would
not stop it.
US administration officials said they would press allies to endorse the use
of air power outside the safe areas.
In Brussels, Nato ambassadors gave a cautiously positive response to a
request from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, for more air
support.
A Nato spokesman said Nato military planners would 'urgently' start drawing
up plans for possible air strikes.
British officials stressed that an ill-planned recourse to air strikes would
put ground troops in danger.

The US and its European allies yesterday threatened to step up air attacks
on the Bosnian Serbs as suffering in Gorazde reached new extremes with the
reported death of 10 patients in a rocket attack on the town hospital.
Support for escalating air strikes was stronger in Washington than in
Europe, where officials were wary of alienating Russia and putting UN ground
troops at greater risk. Moscow has rebuked the Bosnian Serbs over their
continued attacks on Gorazde, but still opposes the use of force against
them.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said broader use of air power
was necessary to avoid a repetition of the Gorazde tragedy in the five other
places designated by the UN as safe areas for Moslems.
He also called for tighter sanctions against the Serbs and fresh efforts to
bring the parties round the negotiating table. Other US administration
officials said they would press their allies to endorse the use of air power
outside the safe havens.
In Brussels, Nato ambassadors gave a cautiously positive response to a
request from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, for more air
support. A Nato spokesman said Mr Boutros Ghali's request had been
'considered in a favourable light', and Nato military planners would
'urgently' start drawing up plans for possible air strikes in co-ordination
with the UN protection force.
But Nato leaders warned that these preparations could take several days, and
said a firm decision would not be taken until another Nato meeting, expected
to take place in the next day or two. Nato diplomatic sources indicated that
they hoped to use the delay to consult Russia over any possible action.
Bosnian radio said the town was gripped by panic as 60,000 people, most of
whom are refugees, were under fire despite the promise on Tuesday night by
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, of a unilateral ceasefire.
The agreement also allows for the deployment of some 150 peacekeepers in the
Moslem-controlled part of Gorazde, which would lay the groundwork for the
Serb partition of the town in the strategic Drina River valley.
Ten people were killed and 15 wounded when three rockets hit the hospital,
aid workers said. However, the Bosnian Serb army accused the Moslem
defenders of sniping and firing mortars and anti-aircraft guns from the town
centre, said Tanjug, the Yugoslav news agency.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Pechiney to press on with
sell-off despite tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pechiney, the French state-owned aluminium group, fell into a net loss of
FFr980m (Dollars 167m) last year, compared with a profit of FFr203m in 1992.
The group was hit by the depressed state of the aluminium market and an
exceptional charge to cover losses on forward purchases of metals.
In spite of the losses, Mr Jean Gandois, chairman, said he hoped the group
would be privatised this year, claiming that the conditions for the sale of
the company could be set this summer.
Mr Gandois saw signs of encouragement for 1994, pointing to improved
economic conditions in the US and Europe and a strengthening of aluminium
prices. 'Recovery to break-even for 1994 is within our reach,' the chairman
said.
Group sales, which fell to FFr63.03bn last year from FFr65.37bn in 1992, had
risen by between 9 and 10 per cent in the first two months of this year, he
said.
Pechiney is one of the 21 companies slated for privatisation by the
government. However, it is not on the list of the next three companies being
prepared for sale. Pechiney's privatisation has been complicated by its
earnings performance and by the government's desire to create an alliance
with Compagnie Nationale du Rhone, the hydroelectricity producer, before
privatising the group.
The plan has drawn opposition from Electricite de France, the state-owned
utility, which has a virtual monopoly on French electricity sales. As a
result, industry observers believe the project could be delayed.
According to Mr Gandois, the principal cause for the downturn in profits
last year lay in its aluminium operations, which suffered a loss of FFr302m,
compared with a profit of FFr621m last year. The reversal was blamed on the
fall in aluminium prices which declined by an average of about 9 per cent,
as a result of excess supply.
Losses from aluminium operations were exacerbated by an exceptional
provision of FFr298m. This resulted from what Mr Gandois described as a
management error in metals purchasing by American National Can, the US
subsidiary of Pechiney International, the packaging group which is 67 per
cent owned by Pechiney.
Pechiney said in December it would have to take provisions to cover ANC's
forward purchases of aluminium at prices well above market levels.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: French and German groups in
robotics deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Groupe Schneider of France and AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie of Germany are to
pool their robotics businesses in a joint venture, the companies announced
yesterday.
The new company, to be called AEG Schneider Automation, will have annual
sales of about FFr3bn (Dollars 508m) and will employ 3,000 people, according
to Schneider.
The French electrical engineering group said the joint venture would rank
second in the international market for automated engineering equipment and
robots.
Schneider said the new company would group its Telemecanique and Square D
operations. AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie, the electrical engineering unit of
Daimler-Benz, will provide its AEG Modicon subsidiary.
The two groups declined to comment further, ahead of a more detailed
announcement due tomorrow. But industry analysts said the move should
strengthen their presence in the international market, giving them a
combined market share of about 12 per cent.
'In the robotics business it is essential to gain critical mass to be able
to cover the significant R&amp;D costs arising in a business which has little
series production,' said an analyst at Societe Generale in Paris.
In spite of the advantages, industry observers said question marks remained.
In particular, they said that the joint venture could mean the closure of
production sites in Germany and that Schneider may have to accelerate its
rationalisation process in France.
Yesterday's announcement is the latest move in a restructuring of the
international robotics industry.
Last year, Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group, acquired
the robotics operation of Renault, the French state-owned car group, and
formed a joint venture in automated vehicle assembly.

FT  20 APR 94 / Russia expects release of Dollars 1.5bn IMF loan: Foreign
fears over growing budget pressure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Russian government expects the board of the International Monetary Fund
to release today a Dollars 1.5bn loan, agreed provisionally last month with
Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director.
The loan represents an act of faith by the IMF in the government of Mr
Victor Chernomyrdin, and is meant to encourage international financial
institutions and private investors to step up activity in Russia. The World
Bank is expected to lend Dollars 2bn this year, and there are signs of
increased financial investment in Russian companies.
The government has fulfilled the relatively light conditions imposed upon it
by Mr Camdessus and has also kept tight control of credits and money supply.
It has signed a memorandum with the IMF on its economic policies for the
rest of this year, and has laid before its parliament a series of decrees
which would raise the budget revenue by Rbs20,000bn from its present level
of Rbs120,000bn.
The memorandum sets limits on the issuing of central bank credits to the
government and to commercial banks which have resulted in falls in monthly
inflation from about 20 per cent a month to the present 7 per cent.
A budget has been passed 'in principle' by the state Duma, with the demand
that estimated spending of Rbs180,000bn be raised and that the budget return
to the Duma in two weeks' time. This tug-of-war is expected to continue
until the summer.
However, foreign observers fear that the pressure on the budget will soon
prove insupportable, especially when the agrarian lobby demands money for
harvesting and subsidies are paid to Arctic circle cities before winter. In
addition, many large enterprises which are lying idle for lack of supplies
and customers are threatening massive layoffs if they are not supported.
The most evident of these is the giant Zil plant, famous for producing
massive limousines. In a passionately angry interview in the daily Trud
yesterday, Mr Yevgenny Brakov, the Zil general director, accused the
government of forgetting the plant and interfering with its attempts to
attract foreign partners.
In a graphic illustration of Zil's decline, he said production of trucks had
more than halved between 1985 and 1993, from 212,000 to less than 100,000,
and fell sharply again this year.

FT  20 APR 94 / Molyneaux sees end 'in year' to Ulster violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and JIMMY BURNS

   BELFAST, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Terrorist violence in Northern Ireland could end within a year, Mr James
Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, predicted yesterday.
Mr Molyneaux, who was speaking in Washington, added to a series of recent
upbeat predictions about an end to terrorism made by politicians and
security forces in the province since the IRA's recent three-day ceasefire.
In a particularly optimistic forecast, which caused some surprise in Ulster
last night, Mr Molyneaux said he believed violence would soon begin to
decline.
He stressed he was not ruling out 'the occasional Mafia-type operation' but
said that, once terrorist violence was over, the 'one united community in
Northern Ireland - Protestant, Catholic, no religion at all - will sit very
firmly on anyone who seeks to disturb the settlements which are now
beginning'.
Meanwhile, British and Irish police yesterday carried out a series of raids
as part of an unprecedented co-ordinated security crackdown on funding for
the IRA.
Scotland Yard said that a substantial quantity of drugs, cash, stolen
property and financial instruments was recovered from 41 addresses in the
Irish Republic, Northern Ireland, north-west England, London and the county
of Surrey. There were eight arrests.
The raids involved 1,000 officers drawn from police on both sides of the
Irish border, including the Royal Ulster Constabulary's anti-racketeering
squad, the Metropolitan Police anti-terrorist squad and three UK regional
squads.
The raids were part of a joint operation codenamed Operation Madronna. This
has involved more than a year of covert investigation, also involving the
British security service MI5, into suspect sourcing of several millions of
pounds of funding for the operations of the IRA.
A joint police statement last night described the raids as the first time
the RUC's anti-racketeering squad had mounted an operation involving so many
forces.

FT  20 APR 94 / World Trade News: Singapore may build Vietnam zone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore may build an industrial park in Vietnam, along the lines of those
it already has under way in China and India, Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singaporean
prime minister, said yesterday.
He told a business conference in London that Vietnam wanted Singapore to
build a zone similar to, but smaller than, the industrial township which it
is constructing at Suzhou in China's Jiangsu province. But Mr Goh said
Vietnam would have to offer domestic market access to companies which set up
plants in such a zone.
Singapore plans to invest as much as 30 per cent of its reserves in Asia,
under its policy of developing an 'external wing' to its economy. Most of
its efforts are going to develope industrial parks in China, India and
Indonesia, and market them to foreign companies as an efficient way to
participate in Asia's rapid growth.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (28): Airports of the world - Kai Tak
choked by success / Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport is a microcosm of the territory it serves:
compact, relatively efficient and hideously congested.
It is an airport past its sell-by date, having operated beyond capacity
since last year. Work on a better version is under way, though progress on
the key elements of the project remains hostage to Sino-British
disagreements over the funding.
With around 28 flights taking off every hour and a daily thoroughfare of
some 67,000 passengers, Kai Tak is in effect choked by its own success.
Immigration queues are long and processed slowly (customs officials,
possibly with reason, find it hard to believe Asian visitors would fly to
Hong Kong for a holiday and ulterior motives of employment are invariably
applied to holders of Philippine passports). Information is not as
accessible as it might be, especially at arrivals.
Despite requirements to arrive at the airport well in advance of flights,
there is little by way of amusement once passengers have checked in.
Shops selling duty free goods, books, souvenirs and sweets occupy cramped
premises that are soon filled out by backpackers.
Yet, despite being the third busiest airport in the world, Kai Tak is small
and contained under one roof.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (29): Airports of the world - Changi -
so little to improve / Singapore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore is clean. It is efficient. It has very little crime. It is a
country that works.
Singapore is boring. Too controlled. More like a giant theme park than a
country. A society in which people are reduced to digits by a government
obsessed by staying ahead.
Opinions on Singapore differ wildly. But even the most jaded observer of the
Singapore scene finds very little to criticise about Changi Airport, the
island republic's international terminus.
First, there is the space. There are acres of arrival and departures halls.
Plenty of seating is available, even at peak travel times. The restaurants
and bars are almost never crowded. And there are enough shops to exhaust a
wallet full of plastic (few bargains are on offer).
It is difficult to tell when Changi is busy. Perhaps that is the test of a
truly efficient airport. No queues, no bustle, no hustlers trying to carry
your bag off to some dark place. Changi runs like - well - like Singapore.
More than half of the Changi site was reclaimed from the sea. Changi opened
in 1981 and now handles more than 18m passengers a year. It is consistently
voted as one of the world's best airports.
A bit of time between flights? A free city tour can be arranged. Singapore
does not suffer the traffic mayhem of other cities in Asia. Your sightseeing
bus is guaranteed to get you back in time.
Need a little rest? Then there are two transit hotels. Rooms can be leased
for SDollars 48 (Dollars 30) for six hours. The charge is double for 12
hours. There are saunas, fitness rooms, a cinema and business centres.
There's even a carp pond to gaze into and meditate.
Skytrains link Changi's two terminals. Kleptomaniacs seem to roam the
world's airports pinching luggage trolleys. No such problems at Changi.
Enough trolleys to trip over.
Singapore loves statistics. It's a sure bet that passengers arriving in
Singapore clear the airport faster than anywhere else. Queues at immigration
are rare. Luggage comes off the carousel like fish down a slide.
No matter how efficient an airport is, the letdown usually happens when
weary passengers reach the real world outside to be greeted by taxi touts or
face an ill-tempered wait for transport.
But in Singapore, air-conditioned taxis are ready to whisk you to your
hotel.
Some might quibble that Changi is a bit soulless. But then airports these
days are hardly places that encourage warmth and tenderness.
There is only one real problem. Changi, in common with other airports, now
bombards passengers in departure lounges with TV pulp. There is no escape.
The screens are large. The sound cannot be turned down. It makes you want to
leave - even to leave Changi.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (27): Airports of the world - O'Hare
drawback is congestion / Chicago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chicago's O'Hare Airport served 66m passengers in 1993, making it one of the
world's largest, and often among the most frustrating, transit points for
business travellers. Local politics have constrained badly-needed runway
expansion at O'Hare, resulting in air traffic congestion and flight delays.
The congestion extends to the highways that surround the airport. Interstate
94, the main artery between O'Hare and downtown Chicago, is under
construction throughout this summer, with the project planned to extend into
1995. Ground transportation delays are expected to peak during the weekends
preceding the May 30 and July 4 US holidays, and between June 14 and July 2,
when more than 60,000 foreign visitors will come to Chicago for the World
Cup soccer tournament.
Airport officials encourage travellers to use Chicago's train system to get
into the city, since traffic gridlock can turn a 40-minute taxi or rental
car ride into a two-hour ordeal at peak times. Chicago Transit Authority
trains can be caught right at the airport, and deliver passengers to the
central business district, the Chicago 'loop', in about 40 minutes for a
fare of Dollars 1.50. Taxi fares to the city run to about Dollars 30.
The CTA trains offer the noisy, untidy jolting of a carnival ride, and have
no provision for luggage. However, they provide unexpected views of
Chicago's mean streets, multi-ethnic neighborhoods, and some of the best
graffiti art in the US. Train travel is only recommended during daylight
hours, with cab or limousine service available after dark.
Last May a new Dollars 618m International Terminal (terminal 5) opened at
O'Hare. This bright facility offers a buffet of Chicago fast-food
specialties, including Chicago-style frankfurters and pizza. There is a
6,000 sq ft duty-free shop; one of the largest in the US; and information
booths with friendly multi-lingual attendants on both terminal levels.
But travellers should note that the international terminal is located away
from the main airport, and that connections can be made only by taking a
five-minute trip on the new Dollars 127m airport transit train.
While major international carriers are now using the new terminal, US
airlines that make international flights are still operating out of their
own terminals. International travellers departing from O'Hare should check
with their airlines for departure location.
O'Hare's largest concentration of business services is in Terminal 3 near
the American Airlines gates. It is equipped with 17 conference rooms with
video conferencing capabilities, all available for short or long-term
rental.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (31): Airports of the world - Better
gateway to New York / Newark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Newark airport, located 16 miles southwest of midtown Manhattan, may be in a
different state from New York, but it offers a more pleasant arrival and
departure point than JFK, and so is increasingly popular among visitors to
the city.
The main terminals at Newark are more modern, less crowded and better run
than those at the older, much bigger, JFK. There are not as many shops at
Newark, but the bars and restaurants at the airport are in better shape and
stay open longer. Service from airport staff is also generally more
courteous.
The big advantage that Newark has over JFK is the travel time between the
airport and the city. Because the roads between Newark and Manhattan are
generally less crowded than those into the city from Queens, outside the
morning rush hour it can take little more than 20 minutes to get to downtown
Manhattan (this is particularly handy for anyone eager to get to a business
meeting in the financial district). Add an extra 20 minutes, however, for
uptown destinations.
You can either take the bus or a taxi. There are two main bus services:
Grayline is quicker, costs Dollars 18 and can drop you off anywhere around
midtown, while Olympia Buses is a bargain at only Dollars 7 but it goes only
to one destination, Penn Station. Licensed yellow taxi cabs cost much they
same as they do from JFK, at anywhere between Dollars 35 and Dollars 45,
including tips and toll.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (30): Airports of the world - Last lap
may be the worst / JFK, New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Located in the borough of Queens, 15 miles south-east of midtown Manhattan,
John F. Kennedy Airport is the main hub for international flights to and
from New York.
Sprawled over almost 5,000 acres, JFK is like the city it serves: chaotic
and alsoovercrowded.
The terminals of the big US airlines (American, TWA, United, USAir and
Delta) are efficient but lack frills, and the quality of the shops,
restaurants, and bars is no better than average.
Standards are a bit higher at the British Airways terminal, but the main
international terminal used by all other airlines is a disaster, and it
really should be avoided whenever possible.
Airport staff are generally helpful when you can find them, although being
New Yorkers they are often a touch surly.
The greatest problem with JFK, however, is the lack of an efficient
transport service to and from the city. New York's subway does not reach as
far as JFK, but you can take a bus from the terminals to the nearest subway
station (Howard Beach/JFK Airport on the A, C and H lines, at Dollars 1.25
per one way trip).
It is more convenient, though no quicker, to take the bus all the way into
Manhattan.
Several companies run regular airport services (Carey Transportation is
regarded as the most reliable), and the fare costs between Dollars 12.50 and
Dollars 20.
The journey can take anywhere between 40 minutes to an hour and a half,
depending on the traffic and the number of stops the bus makes.
Taxi cabs are the quickest way to get into the city. Outside the rush hour
the journey can take as little as 30 minutes, but bank on at least 45
minutes to an hour.
Always use licensed Yellow cabs, and expect to pay between Dollars 35 and
Dollars 45 (including tips and tolls). For anyone crazy enough to use his
own car in New York, long-term parking at JFK is cheap, but the car parks
are some distance from the terminals.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (24): Airports of the world - It's easy
to get to Tokyo / Narita
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Narita, the international airport that serves Tokyo, now has two terminals.
While this should not worry the well-organised traveller, it is testimony to
the large scale and complexity of the place which anyone who finds himself
having to use Narita should be warned about.
Narita does try, however, to be user-friendly. Transport between the airport
and central Tokyo is relatively easy and the airport buildings boast
facilities ranging from shower rooms (for Y600 an hour) and audio-video
rooms (at Y400 for two hours) to a business centre and free children's play
room.
For those caught hungry at the airport, restaurants serve a variety of
Japanese, Chinese and western cuisine at somewhat higher prices than average
in downtown Tokyo.
There are hotels and conference facilities catering to a variety of needs
around the airport and two conference rooms in the airport itself, the
largest of which can handle up to 50 people.
Getting away from Narita is also relatively hassle-free. Perhaps the most
convenient way for travellers staying at hotels downtown is to use the
airport limousine, which runs at regular intervals to the major hotels and
stations in Tokyo, Yokohama and some parts of Chiba, including Tokyo
Disneyland. Some limousines go directly to hotels.
The cost is steep at Y2,700 (about Pounds 17.75) to central Tokyo and Y3,500
to Yokohama, but the ride is generally comfortable with reclining seats and
air conditioning. The drawback is that traffic can be horrendous depending
on the time of day and an average 70-minute drive to central Tokyo can
stretch out substantially.
The Narita Express trains which run from the airport to stations in similar
areas are much more reliable and offer smooth, comfortable travel to major
destinations for much the same cost. Access is relatively easy to the trains
which run at half-hour to one-hour intervals.
On the other hand, independent travel by car is somewhat more complicated as
parking facilities are relatively expensive and not within easy reach. Taxis
and car rentals are readily available but costs are steep.
While aeroplanes should not arrive at Narita too late, travellers should be
warned that Tokyo itself goes to sleep fairly early so that finding a place
to eat after about 10pm is difficult.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (25): Airports of the world - Casino set
to open by end of year / Schiphol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport is heavily dependent on transit passengers and
goes out of its way to make connections easy. Though the airport is growing
rapidly in size, it remains under one roof, so there is no need for terminal
hopping.
The business traveller running from one gate to the other is sure to
encounter Schiphol's extensive array of duty-free shops. Besides the usual
cigarettes, alcohol, perfume and cosmetics, these sell diamonds, cameras and
televisions.
The latest sector to be added to duty-free sales is golf: Schiphol recently
became the first airport in the world to open an indoor centre, complete
with putting greens and driving ranges as well as a 'video-golf simulator'
which replicates 24 of the world's golf courses. There is even a
professional on hand for lessons.
The airport has two business centres, one for transit passengers and the
other for people already through immigration and customs. These have meeting
rooms and computers, and secretarial services can also be obtained. Other
airlines also have executive lounges.
For relaxation, there is a fitness centre, a sun centre, a sauna and a
hotel, all in the transit area.
At the end of the year, Schiphol plans to become the first airport to have a
casino, where departing and transit passengers will be able to play
blackjack and roulette and other games of chance.
The only drawback to Schiphol at the moment is the heavy programme of
construction, which can make finding the car parks a chore for people
driving to the airport.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (26): Airports of the world - So typical
of the Swiss / Zurich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zurich's airport is everything you would expect of a Swiss establishment -
quietly efficient, tidy, convenient and expensive.
It is composed of two adjacent terminals, with spacious Terminal A occupied
only by Swissair and its partner airlines; Crossair, Austrian Airlines, SAS
Scandinavian Airlines, Delta Airlines and Singapore Airlines.
All other airlines and charter flights use Terminal B, and it is here that
crowding can often become unpleasant and service drop below acceptable
standards.
The airport is located only 11km north-west of the city centre. It can be
reached in a few minutes by car and very frequent train services from the
city's main railway station to the station underneath Terminal B. Traffic
jams going to the airport are rare, less so going into town.
The second class one way rail fare is SFr4.50, the taxi fare a numbing SFr40
(about Pounds 19).
There are multi-storey car parks connected to each terminal and parking
costs SFr4 an hour, SFr24 for 24 hours and SFr96 per week. For those
accompanying departing passengers or welcoming new arrivals, there are
usually a few parking spaces free at the respective ramps at SFr1 for a
maximum of 10 minutes.
Passenger processing is normally efficient and the terminals are not so big
as to require a half-hour hike to the gates.
Lounges for first class and business passengers have been cramped and smoky,
but Swissair has just opened new, enlarged ones in Terminal A for its
clients. Other airlines make do with what they can get, sometimes even
having to take space in Terminal A.
Oddly, Zurich airport is not famous for its shopping. This is because it is
owned and operated by the cantonal government which has to be sensitive to
the feelings of its many constituents who dislike the airport.
Attempts to expand airport facilities are always contested, so it is
pointless for the authorities to try to boost custom through marketing
promotions.
The transit areas feature a modest array of duty-free shops, but the prices
are not remarkably better than you can get in town.
On the other hand, there is an immense and varied shopping centre in the
basement of Terminal B above the railway station. It is as much for Zurich
residents as for travellers, being the only place in the region where
evening and Sunday shopping is allowed. But it is worth a browse, if only to
acquire a feel for how the natives shop.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (20): Airports of the world - Advantage
of being near to Brussels / Zaventem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time is money, so the biggest advantage of Zaventem airport is how near it
is to downtown Brussels. A 20-minute ride on the train costs a paltry BFr85
(less than Dollars 3). Driving takes between 20 and 25 minutes, providing
you do not travel between 4pm and 6.30pm when there is a high risk of being
trapped in city tunnel traffic. Taxis cost a hefty BFr1,200 (Dollars 40).
At first sight, the airport is unappealing. The arrival lounge has a mangy
bar which is full of stale smoke. The foyer teems with illegal cabbies on
the look-out for gullible foreigners. Heathrow's Terminal One looks
luxurious by comparison.
Further inside, standards pick up. Airline staff are courteous, and the
check-in queues shift quickly. Baggage handling is speedy and reliable.
Duty-free shops have the best chocolate in Europe. The executive lounge
looks as good as most. What is missing is a good toy shop for children's
presents and a high-class restaurant.
On the other hand, Zaventem does not specialise in transit connections,
unlike Schipol or Heathrow. It is a one-stop shop whose chief appeal is the
lack of crowds.
Two quibbles. Passport checking is irritatingly slow for a country which has
signed up to the Schengen agreement (the accord between European Union
member states which is supposed to make travel between signatory countries
pain-free). Brussels officials say that all will come good once airport
reconstruction is complete. The sullen expression on the faces of customs
officials suggests otherwise.
Second, there never quite seems enough parking space inside the airport
garage which is some way from the arrival and departure exits. Motorists may
need to kerb-crawl for up to 10 minutes to look for a vacant slot among the
6,000 allotted places. It is no particular consolation that parking costs a
fairly reasonable BFr295 a day.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (21): Airports of the world - Best and
worst of the terminals / Heathrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's Heathrow is the busiest international airport in the world. But
whether you enjoy the experience of using it depends largely on which
terminal you use.
Like Air France at Charles de Gaulle in Paris, British Airways has the best
terminal almost to itself. Terminal Four is a model of spaciousness which
even when busy causes no more stress than queueing to buy an ice cream on a
summer's day.
Terminal Two, on the other hand is a ghastly outdated construction where
even users of business class check-in desks have to manoeuvre their bags
around concrete pillars that could not have been better placed by the demon
of travel frustration. Take medical advice first if you suffer from
claustrophobia.
Terminals One and Three are in-between, but have a distinct Terminal Two
tendency at busy times.
Getting to the airport is never quite satisfactory. The Underground is cheap
and reasonably quick, but inconvenient and awkward if you have heavy bags.
Central London stations usually have steps rather than escalators at some
point. The airport bus is of variable reliability while taxis cost at least
Pounds 30 and are a guaranteed way of missing the aircraft if you leave in
the rush hour.
Parking costs Pounds 12 a day close to the terminals in 'business Car Parks'
close to the terminals and Pounds 7 a day further away in the long-term car
parks. At Terminal Four the best deal is the Hilton Hotel car park.
There are more than 25 business and first-class which, especially for long
haul, are generally well kept and spacious. The exceptions at busy times are
the British Airways club class and executive club lounges, which are victims
of their own success.
Thomas Cook has a business lounge between Terminals One and Two aimed at
short haul business passengers who travel on economy tickets.
Undoubtedly, Heathrow's strong point is its shopping. Once again, Terminal
Four is best, although Terminal Three is close behind. There are 59
duty-free and tax-free shops, so do not buy anything until you have gone
through passport control.
Such has been the overcrowding at Heathrow that some airlines have clubbed
together to pay for separate security and passport checks for business and
first class passengers. This 'Fast Track' service is genuinely useful and
operates at Terminals Three and Four with seven airlines participating.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (22): Airports of the world - Chancing
the fog at Linate / Milan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN SIMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Early morning passengers bound for Milan often betray an almost British
preoccupation with the weather. Is it foggy at Linate Airport? Will there be
a delay or even a re-routing?
The tendency for mist at Linate is aggravated by the nearby presence of an
artificial lake. Unfortunately, until mid-1995 the airport is without an
instrumental landing system, which is being improved to allow aircraft to
land in visibility of less than 75 metres.
On a clear day, the traveller can look forward to Linate, which is well
equipped and convenient for meetings in Milan. It is only 10km from the city
centre and a taxi ride costs L25,000 (about Pounds 10.50).
An airport bus, at 20 minutes frequency, connects with the main railway
station where there is also access to two of the city's three Metropolitana
(underground) lines. Tickets cost L4,000. Alternatively, there is the No 73
bus which has its other terminal at Santa Babila in the heart of the city.
In common with all buses, the L1,200 tickets have to be bought at newspaper
stalls.
There are three car parks, including a multi-storey for 1,300 cars, pleasant
bars and duty free and a business centre. The friendly woman at the
information desk, who offers a passenger one of her own L200 coins for a
telephone call, is typical of the local attitude.
Recent improvements at the airport have provided passengers with
rolling-bridge access to 75 per cent of national flights and also a new
national departure lounge connecting with international flight departures.
The baggage area for international arrivals has been extended.
But Linate, about the seventh biggest European airport with 9.5m passengers,
can grow no more and this is of great concern to Alitalia, which claims that
L3bn a day is lost in air fares sold by rival airports. Work on upgrading
Milan's other airport, Malpensa, with 3.6m passengers, got held up by
inquiries into Italy's Tangentopoli bribes scandal and, for now, the link
with the city is a 60-minute bus ride costing L12,000 for the 45km journey,
or a L120,000 taxi ride. Travellers usually prefer to chance the fog at
Linate.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (18): Airports of the world - An outpost
on an heroic scale / Munich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Munich's shiny new steel and aluminium Franz-Josef Strauss airport is, for
the most part, a successful attempt at user-friendliness. It might have come
off even better had the Bavarians not been tempted to build what is
essentially a medium-sized regional service point on such an heroic scale.
The place has clearly been built with long-term growth (and the prosperity
of the German metal-working industry) in mind. However, disproportionate
walking distances are partly compensated for by an unclaustrophobic
atmosphere and a liberal sprinkling of cafes and restaurants.
A full range of services is amply staffed by people with a tendency to brisk
efficiency, further contributing to a more relaxed feel than is common in
such places.
The principal drawback is the airport's position well away from the city,
which makes travelling to and fro something of a trial. It can be costly,
too, for those who elect to avoid the cheap 45-minute S-Bahn train ride
across the dead-flat Bavarian heathlands to the city centre.
High spot of the journey is the airport visitors' viewing point: a perfect
cone of spoil from the airport construction work. The S-Bahn journey is
comfortable enough, but over-punctuated with stops at every hamlet along the
way.
The taxi ride, officially 30 minutes, but often longer because of the
Germans' love of traffic jams, costs a whacking DM90.
Experienced hands on one-day trips prefer to hire a small car for up to
DM60, but this is not especially advised for occasional visitors unfamiliar
with Munich's whirligig traffic guidance systems.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (19): Airports of the world - Charmless,
but it has every facility / Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you have the legs and the patience to seach them out, Frankfurt Airport
has every conceivable facility for the business traveller within its
charmless vastness.
The tricky part is finding a helpful and knowledgeable ear to offer
directions. Don't even try on a national or regional holiday, but be sure to
arrive with plenty of time to spare if you are flying out. On peak days the
outward-bound total approaches 70,000 happy travellers.
Those en route to the US should leave an even greater safety margin in the
light of the continuing withdrawal of swathes of US military and ancillary
personnel, their dogs and bicycles.
Formerly bottle-necked security checks are showing signs of improvement with
the arrival of extra staff and an increase of almost a third in the number
of X-ray machines in the past few months. A newly-expanded supply of baggage
trolleys (apparently modelled on the Mercedes S-class car) also appears to
have put an end to regular wrestling matches, especially in the departures
area.
Mechanistic processes requiring minimum personal contact with airport staff,
such as baggage handling, tend to be flawless.
Passport control for new arrivals is erratic. Do not bother to smile at the
uniformed checkers, but make sure you toe the yellow lines as you approach
them unless you enjoy being harangued.
Public transport services are adequate. For preference take the train or a
20-minute taxi ride if the prospect of the gruesome drug-addict population
lurching around Frankfurt's railway station concourse deters you.
Car-hirers may be rattled by the tangle of roadworks associated with the
construction of the new Dollars 1bn terminal, scheduled to open a new era of
comfort and efficiency in October. Road signs near the airport are
confusing, to say the least.
Incoming drivers looking for a parking space are often best advised to avoid
the signposted car parks 1, 2 and 3, and nip along past the set-down area to
car park 4 which generally provides quickest access to arrival and departure
areas.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (23): Airports of the world - Great
shops; a pity Paris is so far / Charles De Gaulle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles de Gaulle may have lost a little of the sci-fi stylishness that made
it seem so funkily futuristic when it opened in the 1970s, but beneath its
grubby concrete facade lurks a remarkably efficient international airport.
Despite the grime, it is still a thrill to whizz up and down the glazed
escalators in Terminal One. While Terminal Two boasts the visual treat of a
Thunderbirdesque ring road that comes into its own when illuminated at
night.
The shops at both terminals are spectacular: as befits France's biggest
airport. The epiceries sell everything from cheeses to foie de gras. Even
the clothes shops (a sore point at most airports) are passable so that, if
the worst came to the worst and you lost all your luggage, you need not end
up looking like Eurotrash.
Charles de Gaulle also scores highly on the lounge front. The Concorde
lounge, predictably, is best for celebrity spotting, particularly during the
fashion season when posses of super-models fly in. Even the ordinary
business lounges are kitted out with all the necessary facilities. Although
the 'capsule' accommodation (literally a bed and basin) for passengers on
delayed flights should be avoided at all costs.
The big hitch about using Charles de Gaulle, other than the high statistical
probability of having your luggage pillaged by its sticky-fingered baggage
handlers, is getting there. The 25km trip between central Paris and the
airport can take as little as 30 minutes and cost around FFr100 (about
Pounds 12), but that is only on those very rare occasions (mainly between
the insomaniacal hours of 4am and 5am) when the roads are clear.
Even at moderately busy times the journey stretches to an hour and the fare
rises to FFr180 to FFr200. Anyone deluded enough to venture out to the
airport during the rush hour or, worse still, on the eve of one of France's
numerous national holidays, should allow for anything up to two carbon
monoxide-choked hours in an apparently endless traffic jam and a FFr250 bill
at the end.
The buses, which leave every 20 minutes or so to destinations such as the
Arc de Triomphe and Gare de l'Est, take just as long as taxis: but they are,
at least, cheaper at FFr40 a ticket.
The other option is the train, which is even cheaper with tickets at just
over FFr30. The snag here is having to wait - and wait - for the buses that
ferry passengers from the terminals to the Roissy RER station. There is also
the risk of public sector strikes (nearly as numerous as French national
holidays) and finally the threat of the thieves and flashers that prowl
around the Roissy line.
Any passenger really must watch his or her wallet at all times and it is not
safe to travel alone after dark.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (17): Asia-Pacific is the big growth
area - Golden opportunities in the region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Earlier this spring, posters inviting would-be Japanese travellers to the
bright blue beaches of Bali went up to enliven often dreary public sites in
Tokyo's concrete jungle.
The colourful posters, announcing a new direct route from the Japanese
capital to Bali, in Indonesia, are seductive. They are also symbolic of the
surging interest in Asia-Pacific travel that is being fuelled by the
spectacular economic success the region has enjoyed in recent years.
In all the gloom that has surrounded the world's aviation industry, the
Asia-Pacific region has remained a shining exception. The region is expected
to continue outpacing other parts of the world in growth in air travel and
the trend has encouraged airlines, both from within and without the region,
to boost their operations and take advantage of the golden opportunity.
However, much of the region's promise depends on its ability to solve
infrastructure and capacity constraints which have become an increasing
problem for travellers in the region.
In the past few years, the surge of business activity in Asia, from the
south-east Asian countries of Thailand and Singapore to Korea and Taiwan on
the east, has encouraged an enormous increase in the number of people moving
not just in and out of the region, but within it as well.
While the rest of the international market for leisure and business travel
grew just 5 per cent last year, the market in the Asia-Pacific region rose a
firm 15 per cent, according to the World Tourism Organisation.
'Countries such as Singapore, Taiwan and Korea did not see air travel levels
fall even while Japan did during the recession,' says Mr Yoshio Koteda,
general manager of international relations at the Japan Travel Bureau.
As a result, the proportion of people who left the country in 1992 to the
overall population was as high as 35 per cent for Hong Kong and 25 per cent
for Korea, compared with just 9.5 per cent for Japan, according to
statistics by the Japan National Tourist Organisation.
The growth in air travel in Asia has been so strong that in fiscal 1992
Qantas, the Australian airline, for the first time earned more revenues in
Asia than in its home market.
But the boom in regional air travel has not offered as effective a boost to
profits for all airlines with a stake in the pie. While most are benefiting
from the expansion of business in the region, the explosion of the market
has brought uneven blessings to the region's airliners.
Qantas, for example, is one of the more enterprising airlines which have
aggressively taken advantage of growth markets in the region.
The airline, which had just four flights a week out of Japan in 1985, has
aggressively expanded its routes and now has 32 flights out of the country,
which has become its largest source of revenue outside its home market.
Qantas has also actively promoted flights from regional Japanese
destinations, such as Fukuoka on the southern island of Kyushu and Sapporo
in the north, to regional sites in Australia. Last month it opened a route
from Tokyo to Darwin, in the Northern Territory, and plans to add five more
flights a week when the new Kansai International Airport opens in September.
For their part, south-east Asian carriers are putting in considerable effort
into cultivating regional traffic as well, and JTB's Mr Koteda says that
airlines such as Singapore Airlines and Thai International are very popular
among Japanese travellers.
Meanwhile, in the trans-Pacific market between the US and Japan, US airlines
have managed to build up a formidable presence on the strength of their
lower costs. Aggressive pricing has enabled them to take about 70 per cent
of the market even as passenger growth has been seen mainly from Japan
rather than the US.
The rising fortune of Asia-Pacific and US carriers in the region has largely
been at the expense of the Japanese airlines, which have suffered under a
high-cost structure that has been aggravated by the yen's recent
appreciation.
As they face rising competition from neighbouring airlines, the Japanese
carriers are also worried that the country's aviation accord with the US
gives low-cost US carriers unfair advantages that will limit their own
chances of capitalising on the spectacular growth of the Asia-Pacific
market.
They are angered by US moves to take advantage of their beyond rights to fly
from the US via Tokyo to a third destination in the increasingly popular
Asia-Pacific region. Northwest Airlines, for example, was accused by both
the Japanese and Australians of taking business that was rightfully theirs
when it flew a flight from New York to Sydney, through Osaka, which mostly
carried Japanese travellers between Osaka and Sydney.
Furthermore, there is rising concern that the high costs of landing at
Kansai International, a new international airport in western Japan, will
discourage airlines from taking up their landing rights there, and shift
business to other airports, such as a new one being built in Korea.
'For a lot of (Japanese) people, in many ways it could be more convenient to
fly via Kimpo airport in Korea, rather than through Kansai or Narita even,'
Mr Koteda points out.
Such worries are justified. The strength of the Asia-Pacific market is
expected to continue for the foreseeable future, with the region likely to
show stronger growth than other markets. Estimates range from 8 to 10 per
cent growth to the year 2000 and Qantas expects the Asian market to account
for 51 per cent of all international traffic by the year 2010 compared with
31 per cent in 1990.
But the ability of countries within the region to draw a significant part of
that traffic through their doors will depend to a considerable extent on
increasing capacity. There has been a rush to do so with new airport
facilities planned not only in Japan but in Thailand, Taiwan, Korea and
Singapore as well.
While growth in the Asia-Pacific market is sure to come, and the Japanese
will certainly enjoy their share of that growth, national aviation policy
and the efforts of the carriers over the next few years will be crucial in
determining where much of that growth is finally channelled.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (16): Charter may be good deal at Pounds
30,000 / A look at the advantages of hiring an aircraft instead of going by
scheduled flight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BOGGIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thirty thousands pounds spent over four days on hiring a jet and its crew
may sound like a lot of money.
But, say the charter operators, it becomes worth it as soon as you have two
or more destinations to combine within a day, or whenever the place you need
to get to is a little away from the main scheduled airline routes.
The Business Air Centre, London, is one of a small handful of charter
brokers that exists to put executive travellers in touch with the aircraft
operators. Ms Janice Hahn, one of BAC's directors, says: 'Charter becomes
cost-effective as soon as you take 10 people - or even half a dozen - from
London to Paris and back.'
Business for BAC has been strong in recent months. The Pounds 30,000 quoted
by Ms Hahn was the centre's fee for chartering a 16-seat Canadair Challenger
twin-jet executive on a flight that ran:
London, Paris, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Milan, Glasgow, Edinburgh
and back to London Heathrow.
The trip took four days. The Challenger came with a crew of two pilots and
one stewardess, and, Ms Hahn said: 'Full complimentary first-class meals and
bar.'
In principle, a group of business people could have booked the flight on
scheduled airlines. But schedules tend to involve many changes of airline,
and rely on precise time-keeping.
Another example quoted by BAC is a charter, booked - as was the previous
example - in February 1994, from Paris to Barcelona, Verona, Paris, Esbjerg
(Denmark), Brussels and back to Paris. The round trip, in a 10-seater
Dassault Falcon 20 - which has a somewhat smaller cabin than the Challenger
 -took two days and cost Pounds 18,000.
British Airways welcomed the challenge of meeting - or improving on - the
charter operators' costs while using scheduled flights. Replicating the
Falcon flight to Esbjerg and other points proved difficult, though.
BA successfully fitted the trip into two days on schedules, but found that
the Barcelona-Verona leg would entail a diversion via Rome, and
Paris-Esbjerg would be via Copenhagen. Only the charter can fly direct.
On price, BA was able to quote Pounds 1,264.60, business class, making the
airline itinerary cheaper as well.
For a theoretical flight carrying six people from Heathrow to Frankfurt,
Rome and Paris, then back to Heathrow, BA quoted a fare of Pounds 534.30 a
head and demonstrated that the itinerary could be fitted into a day, even on
schedules.
What could not be done was to keep to the same airline throughout. Assuming
an 07.40 start, the flyers could reach Frankfurt by BA at 10.15; catch
Alitalia to Rome at 11.55, arriving at 13.45; leave Rome at 15.35 to arrive
in Paris at 17.40; then leave Paris at 20.30 to return to Heathrow at 20.40.
For the same itinerary, BAC suggested a Learjet at a cost of Pounds 8,000.
Business class check-in, assuming hand luggage only, is reckoned as 20
minutes for the schedules. Ms Hahn quotes 10 minutes as normal for charters.
There would also be passport checks, so that the time available for a
meeting at Frankfurt would be just over an hour, assuming that flights
arrived and left on time.
BA also points out that charter aircraft may not necessarily be able to get
landing permission at Heathrow, with its intense pressure on slots.
That objection echoes concerns voiced by Mr Derek Leggett, chief executive
of the Business Aircraft Users Association, which represents corporate
aircraft operators in the UK. His members' access to gateway airports such
as Heathrow is, he says, 'getting progressively more difficult each year'.
Ms Hahn points out that, in the example quoted, the Challenger flight
actually had no difficulty in getting a slot at Heathrow in February.
Passports, she says, are still required between European Union countries,
but formalities can be minimised. BAC will take on the task of collecting
travellers' passport details and passing them on to the destination
airfields. The charter flight will avoid crowded airline terminals and go
instead to the general aviation block.
Charter charges normally include flying time only. Only if, say, the hire
period ranges over a week, with two non-flying days, does the hirer incur a
daily charge for the aircraft.
For shorter trips, a twin-turboprop such as the Beech King Air can compete
on cost and even on time with the jets. The pressurised King Air, which
flies at jet altitudes, can carry 10 people from London to Paris and back
within a day.
BAC, Ms Hahn says, has no 'typical business customer'. The hirers on the
Challenger and Falcon flights were financial executives. Nor does BAC have a
'typical aircraft type'. Models chartered have included the Piper Chieftain
 -a twin-prop, unpressurised 10-seater - on a round trip from London to
Orleans, France - and the Lockheed TriStar, an airliner that can seat 350
people.
Another advantage of charter is that the operator has a wider choice of
destination airfield. Mr Trevor King, commercial manager of Magec Aviation
at Luton Airport, points out that there are many more airfields that can
accommodate a business flight than are served by scheduled airlines.
Magec is a division of GEC-Marconi and has extensive experience of operating
a fleet of six British Aerospace 125 jets capable of seating eight to 12
passengers. One example that Mr King quotes is that of a client who needed
to fly seven executives from East Midlands to Kiev, a mission carried out
more easily than by schedule.
The value of charter, Mr King says, is determined by the value of the
passenger's time. The stress is less when you charter, he says. 'It's a more
restful way of travelling. You can pick your own schedule.'
Clients can hold business meetings in the air, or work on documents more
comfortably than on a schedule. Luton's executive wing has a conference
room, so that time can be saved when business partners meet at the airport.
Many big airports worldwide have similar facilities.
Depending on aircraft type, also, business meetings have been held aboard
the jet while on the ground. Privacy can be assured, which is another
advantage.
The more valuable the executive's time, the more benefit the company gains
from having the use of its own aircraft - and experience during the
recession has shown that the more companies sell off the corporate aircraft,
the more the demand for charter has grown. That Pounds 30,000 comes to look
less like expenses and more like an investment.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (14): Heavy toll of deregulation - US
airlines wage a cut-throat price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bad news for the US airline industry means good news for the business
traveller: or so it would seem from reports about the effects of the price
war being fought in America's skies.
Hardly a day passes without news of yet another US airline slashing fares in
an attempt to preserve its market share against competition from lower-cost
carriers - or alternatively, news of yet another airline reporting heavy
losses because of its inability to make money at the new fare levels.
The state of the US domestic market has become mythologised as one in which
air travel is now so cheap that airlines will practically pay you to fly
with them. But perhaps not surprisingly, low-cost travel in the US domestic
market is not quite as simple as all that.
That the market is competitive, there is no doubt. The US airline industry
has been deregulated since 1978, allowing operators to fly any routes they
like at whatever fares they care to set. Entrepreneurs seeking to enter the
market need only satisfy the authorities as to their competence.
As a result, industry giants such as United Airlines, American Airlines and
Delta Air Lines nowadays face competition from dozens of smaller newcomers
including Valujet *something in here (HP) *
Airlines, Republic Air or UltrAir, all of them trying to grab a share of the
market by undercutting the big carriers' fares.
The small airlines are able to operate at a fraction of the big carriers'
costs because they run intensive shuttle services on busy short-haul routes,
minimising turnaround times and maximising productivity. They also pare
costs to the bone by cutting out frills such as baggage transfers, in-flight
meals, free newspapers and first-class or business class accommodation.
The low-cost carrier that serves as a model for the industry is Southwest
Airlines, the Texas-based operator that is now the most profitable airline
in the US.
With operating costs per available seat mile some 22 per cent below the
average for the big carriers, it is trouncing the competition. Spreading
across the south from its home territory, where it is easily the dominant
carrier, it has become the biggest operator of flights within California and
has driven American Airlines out of the short-haul market in the south-west.
Taking a flight by Southwest Airlines is a novel experience for business
travellers accustomed to elaborate check-in rituals, fawning service and
endless parades of drinks and meals. Southwest has deliberately trivialised
the event, making it more like catching a bus. There is no first class or
business class. The in-flight meal is a bag of peanuts and a glass of orange
squash. Seats are not allocated: passengers just turn up and get on, and if
they miss the aircraft, it doesn't matter, because there'll be another one
along in a minute.
Southwest's fares are a fraction of those offered by other airlines for
comparable distances - a feature that has proved highly addictive to
cost-conscious US companies. Business travellers are not only deserting
other airlines to fly by Southwest: they are also choosing to fly with the
airline rather than drive, or to undertake journeys that their budgets would
not previously have allowed them to make.
Southwest's formula has been so persuasive that it is being imitated by
existing carriers as well as new entrants to the industry. Continental
Airlines has set up a low-cost operation nicknamed CALite, offering
so-called Peanut Fares on 875 of its routes. United Airlines, the biggest
carrier in the US, has won agreement from its labour unions to set up a
low-cost airline-within-an-airline, provisionally dubbed U2. Delta Air Lines
is studying the possibility of doing the same, and others are expected to
follow.
The result is that domestic air travel in the US, at least in the short haul
market, is being transformed into a no-frills commodity business - low-cost,
high volume, and with little added value.
Increasingly, the demarcations between business travellers and the rest are
disappearing. Value for money is maximised by treating everyone the same.
But the puzzle is: if domestic air travel in the US is succumbing to this
trend, why do business air fares show so few signs of coming down? Figures
from American Express, which has set up an airfare management unit to track
domestic and international fares, show that the average business fare for a
one-way trip hardly changed during 1993, sticking at around the Dollars
340-Dollars 350 level all year.
According to Mr Robert Harrell, vice president of American Express's airfare
management unit, the answer is simple. The impact of the low-cost carriers
on the US air travel market has been blown out of all proportion, he says.
Taken together, low-cost carriers still account for only about 4 per cent of
total domestic traffic. All the rest is carried by airlines with more
traditional cost structures.
Even so, things are changing. Up till now, most of the low-fare action in
the US has been in the west and south-west. Astonishingly, average fares on
short-haul routes in the east are now approximately double those in the west
 -partly because costs in the east tend to be driven up by bad weather, air
traffic control delays and heavily unionised workforces.
Recently, however - too recently to show up in the American Express index -
the fare war has started to penetrate the east, too. At the end of last year
Southwest Airlines began an assault on the market by offering flights on the
Baltimore-Chicago and Baltimore-Cleveland routes at fares up to 85 per cent
lower than those available from existing operators.
In January, Continental Airlines announced that it was introducing its
Peanut Fares to the east.
In February USAir, one of the biggest east coast operators, was forced to
respond by slashing its fares by up to 50 per cent.
The significance of these fare cuts is that they are not special offers
requiring advance booking and Saturday night stays: they are indefinite cuts
applying across the board. Business travellers could therefore emerge as the
main beneficiaries - provided, of course, they are happy to swap their
comfortable seat and in-flight meal for a cheap ticket and a bag of nuts.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (15): Traffic booms again - Route
profile of the North Atlantic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The North Atlantic has been the crucible of competition in business aviation
for years. But now innovation may be bumping the glass ceiling of capacity
constraints at the European end of the journeys.
Passenger traffic between the US and Europe is once more at record levels
now that the recession triggered by the Gulf War is history, while
businesses, especially in North America, recover from economic recession.
US Department of Transportation figures indicate that more than 32m
passengers flew between the US and Europe during 1993. The figure in 1991,
with demand crushed by the Gulf War, was barely over 25m. The UK remains the
most favoured point of departure of arrival, with more passengers than the
next two countries, Germany and France, put together.
Such a rise in traffic inevitably tests the limits to capacity. In the past,
the pressure has been borne more or less equally by airports on both sides
of the Atlantic. This time the pressure is on Europe rather than the US.
The rise in the strength of the US dollar has stimulated US airlines and
residents to travel. But increasingly they want to fly just to the main
cities at the European end of the journey, such as London's Heathrow, Paris
Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt.
Many of Europe's regional cities and smaller airports are suffering.
American Airlines, for example, is withdrawing from Berlin. The expected
boom in business travel to what is planned to be the new capital city failed
to materialise. It has also abandoned Stansted, London's third airport.
'We lost Dollars 1m a month for 10 months at Stansted. It's a Pounds 400m
white elephant. Nobody knows about it,' says Mr Hans Mirka, senior vice
president of international routes at American. By contrast, the US end of
the journey is seeing an increase in the number of cities served by non-stop
flights from Europe.
The main factor appears to be that big airports close to economic centres
are increasingly used as 'gateways' to the rest of Europe. They are hubs for
European airlines whose dense fan of spokes can take the incoming passenger
to almost any city on the continent. European airlines tend to have one main
hub, while US carriers have several.
These spokes that radiate from the hub are carrying a significant proportion
of transatlantic traffic. Between a quarter and a third of all transatlantic
passengers intend to fly beyond their first stop, says Mr Charles Gurassa,
British Airways' general manager for the Americas.
Some airlines even specifically sell services to their capitals as the best
air route to third points. Austrian Airlines is carving itself a niche as a
gateway to the once-communist countries of eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union. It has constructed a timetable that allows passengers coming
in on the overnight flight from the US to connect quickly to their onward
flights.
While the trend in Europe seems to be to reduce the number of gateways, the
reverse is happening in the US. The development of transatlantic airline
partnerships means that European airlines seek to plug into large domestic
US services. Historically, these have developed at many cities, not just the
traditional international gateways of New York, Washington, Chicago and Los
Angeles.
Relationships such as that announced last week between Delta and Virgin
Atlantic, and older ones between British Airways and USAir, KLM and
Northwest Airlines, are developing rapidly. Transatlantic passengers can
find themselves flying to a number of new non-stop destinations this year.
KLM flies non-stop to Minneapolis and Boston, where Northwest has its hubs,
while BA flies to Pittsburgh, Charlotte and Baltimore where its partner,
USAir, has domestic hubs. The changes have stimulated a response from US
carriers without main European partners. American Airlines may have given up
on Stansted and Berlin, but it has introduced services from Europe to
Nashville and Philadelphia.
These tie-ups are an essential part of offering onward flights on either
side of the Atlantic. 'The transatlantic service is an advertisement for the
short haul,' says BA's Mr Gurassa. They also allow the partners to offer a
range of fringe benefits such as frequent flyer programmes whose points can
be collected and redeemed on either network.
Mr Ron Speirs, Reed Travel Group's vice president of airline databases and
industry affairs, says that passengers who are transferring to flights with
partner airlines get 'higher priority in the case of delays and the option
to use partner's lounges and facilities. Other tangible benefits include the
interchangeability of frequent flyer miles between airline marketing
partners.'
Less tangible to passengers are the benefits of code-sharing. This is when a
single letter and number code identifies a service between two points with a
change from one carrier to the other. This helps joint marketing of the
service for the airlines, but apart from the co-ordination of timetables, it
provides little advantage to passengers and may result in their flying on an
airline other than the one they were expecting.
Such is the importance of this kind of interlinking of networks that it
becomes a central plank of the planning of corporate deals. Lufthansa, the
Germany carrier, and United Airlines of the US are planning to share routes
and offer 100 code-shared services. Unfortunately, the plan has been delayed
by the wrangles between the US and Germany over the bilateral aviation
agreement between them.
They, and other airlines which have yet to find partners, may have little
time yet to prepare themselves for the competitive onslaught from those that
already have partners. By the summer, just about every airline will have
refurbished business class service and passengers will find it harder to
distinguish between them on the number of channels the inflight
entertainment has or on the quality of their airport lounges.
Nor will they be able to look for huge rises in capacity to offer them a yet
greater range of departure times. After the rapid growth of the last two
years, American, for one, says it will not make a net increase in capacity
on North Atlantic routes at all this summer.
Instead, the battle will be over convenience, rapid connection times and
delayed free travel. On current trends it will be easier to fly into the new
US hubs than into the increasingly overcrowded European centres.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (13): Inns that can offer more - The
attractions of airport hotels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flight delays, severe weather and security alerts make airport hotels more
exciting places than their city centre counterparts.
Delayed flights often provide a sudden surge in demand as airlines search
for rooms to accommodate their passengers overnight. Even when flights are
leaving and arriving normally, airport hotel guests arrive and leave at
unusual times.
Guests usually arrive at city centre hotels in the afternoon and check out
in the morning. Airport hotels have to be ready for guests who arrive at any
time of the day or night and who might demand pre- departure breakfast in
the early hours of the morning.
Mr Grant Hearn, director of the London region of Forte, the UK hotels group,
says: 'Airport hotels have a dynamic quality that other hotels might not
have. There's potential for greater surges in demand.' Mr Hearn, whose
responsibilities include Forte's three hotels at London's Heathrow airport,
adds: 'It gives you a good adrenalin boost. It's quite narcotic in its way.'
The economic downturn in the US and Europe in the early 1990s might have
been bad news for the hotel industry as a whole, but it provided airport
hotels with a boost.
Mr Geof Rochester, marketing vice president at Radisson Hotels
International, says business travellers, under pressure to cut costs, found
staying at airport hotels meant they could cut down on the number of nights
they were away from the office.
Mr Rochester - whose group owns 81 airport hotels in cities as diverse as
Los Angeles, Beijing, London and Guatemala City - says US companies appear
to be continuing to use airport hotels even as the economy picks up.
The proximity of the hotels to the airport has increased their attraction as
meeting places and conference venues. A company which wants to hold a
conference of its European sales managers, for example, will often find it
easier to get them all together at Heathrow or Amsterdam's Schiphol airport
than at a rural retreat.
The conference and meeting business has the advantage, for airport hotels,
of providing a more steady source of business than that which comes from
guests who stay for just a short period before catching their flights.
While the average length of a guest's stay in an airport hotel is shorter
than in a city centre establishment, the difference is less than might be
expected. Mr John Wilson, chief oper- ating officer of Hilton International,
says the average length of stay in an airport hotel is 1.5 nights, compared
with 2.1 nights in a city centre hotel.
Mr Wilson, whose company owns 11 airport hotels worldwide, says the
challenge is to persuade airport hotel guests to stay for even longer. The
key to doing this, he says, is to provide guests with the sort of facilities
that makes it easier to do business from the hotel.
He adds: 'The airport hotel was perceived years ago as being a transient
place. Today's customer expects it to be more. You need excellent meeting
facilities, access to fax machines and transport to the airport. At most
airport hotels, you would also expect to find leisure facilities.'
Airport hotels, particularly in the world's most important business cities,
are becoming less spartan and functional than they were several years ago.
The hotel that Hilton International is currently building at Charles de
Gaulle airport in Paris will have spacious bathrooms and shower cubicles
which are separate from the bath.
Mr Rochester says leisure facilities are an increasingly important feature
of his group's large city airport hotels. Radisson's Los Angeles airport
hotel has its own golf course and its Heathrow hotel has a masseuse.
Apart from attracting conferences and meetings, air crews provide another
stable source of business for airport hotels. Airlines tend to pay lower
rates for their crews to stay in airport hotels than the amounts paid by
ordinary guests. Nevertheless, airport hotels compete fiercely to persuade
airlines to give them their air crew business.
Forte's Mr Hearn says air crew contracts have the advantage of providing a
guarantee that rooms will be filled for a certain number of nights, even if
the rates paid are lower. The normal length of an air crew contract is 12
months. Some airlines, however, are prepared to sign air crew contracts for
as long as three years.
In return, airlines expect hotels to provide their crews with special
facilities. Airline crews need to have sufficient rest to be able to fly
again. Flying in from different time zones, they need to be able to sleep at
odd hours.
At Forte's Excelsior hotel at Heathrow, there is a special crew section with
its own reception desk. Rooms used by air crews are supplied with irons and
have refrigerators instead of mini-bars. To help crew members sleep, they
have blackout curtains.
Hilton International's Mr Wilson says his company offers air crews a service
called Touchdown, which provides a separate lounge where air crews can play
games and get sandwiches and soft drinks 24 hours a day.
Many facilities provided to air crews would also be welcomed by other
guests. Mr Wilson says airport hotels will have to begin providing lighter
meals to all their guests, available at any time of the day or night to take
account of their travel schedules.
Many airport hotels already provide a wider range of restaurants than city
centre hotels because guests cannot wander along the surrounding streets
looking for somewhere to eat.
Mr Hearn says that service airport hotels will also have to provide their
guests with more opportunities to check in for their flights at the desk,
without leaving the hotel. Airlines' security worries have hampered the
establishment of a full hotel check-in service, as airline security demands
that luggage be checked in at the airport itself.
Mr Wilson says, however, that it is already possible to check in for El Al
flights at the Tel Aviv Hilton. He says passengers with hand luggage only
can also check in at Hilton's hotels at Heathrow and Schiphol.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (12): Almost the last word in airborne
comfort / A look at what is on offer in business class
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE BEVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The destination is more important for the economy passenger, but in
business class, frequent travellers pay much more attention to the flight.'
So says one large carrier which, in common with other airlines, concentrates
a great deal of money and effort on business class.
There is no denying that business class is much more comfortable than
economy - wider seats, more space, better food and service. But not all
airlines are the same. Such arcane points as differences in seat pitch - the
distance between rows - seat width and in-seat entertainment are just
scratching the surface.
Most business classes, such as those on the US carrier United and British
Airways, have a seat pitch of about 40 inches. By comparison, the pitch in
economy is usually about 32 inches, while those travelling at the really
expensive end of the aircraft in first class can look forward to 60 inches
in which to stretch out.
The best airlines to go for if legroom is your main consideration are the
ones that have thrown out the old first class/business class distinction and
have concentrated on a 'super business class' such as Virgin Atlantic and
Continental of the US.
Virgin and Continental both have seat pitch of 55 inches - nearly as good as
first class on other airlines. Width is also important, with most business
classes offering a seat of 19 or more inches wide. By comparison, economy
passengers are squashed into about 17 inches.
Regular travellers say there is little to beat the comfort in this type of
business class. This small but expensive end of the aircraft is what makes
the money for airlines, and the money spent on the product reflects this.
Continental has spent more than Pounds 11m on upgrading its aircraft, and is
spending a further Pounds 11m on advertising and marketing its BusinessFirst
brand.
Virgin says that it makes 40 per cent of its revenue from just 10 per cent
of its passengers - those flying in Upper Class, its 'super business class'.
United, which maintains the first class/business class distinction,
emphatically says it is well worth spending the money on the front end of
the aircraft.
A regular traveller will sit in as many designs of seat as there are
airlines. Virgin sings the praises of Upper Class seats on its new Airbus
A340 aircraft, promising a fully adjustable neck rest with adjustable
tilting, all controlled by a touch-sensitive panel in the arm rest.
Continental says its seats cost Pounds 5,000 each and have electronic
control of motorised leg rests, head rests and lumbar supports.
Seat gadgetry has also spread to other airlines with the more traditional
division between first and business classes. British Airways, for example,
which first launched its Club World brand in 1988, now offers the business
class traveller adjustable lumbar support, larger 'ears' to create a cradle
for the head and enhanced foot rests.
This array of gadgetry makes the more standard offerings from Qantas, the
Australian carrier, look positively mean in comparison, even though its
seats, with padded leg rests and contoured head rests are certainly
comfortable.
Space is an important factor for business travellers, and one that airlines
are taking seriously by attention to seat pitches and widths. Even
apparently minor points such as the width of arm rests is important to some:
one regular woman traveller remarked that she has often had to concede a
narrow arm rest to her neighbour.
The space to move around also contributes to a feeling of exclusiveness.
Virgin is resurrecting the old idea of aircraft lounges, where first class
passengers could break the tedium of a long flight by propping up a bar and
lounging on a sofa. It has created a lounge area on its aircraft, and will
be installing sofas by the bar.
Entertainment is important for some passengers, and most airlines now offer
in-seat facilities with varying degrees of sophistication.
Many carriers such as Qantas have a route map so that the geographically
curious can try and pinpoint the specks of light 35,000 feet below. Qantas'
map also provides information on height - both metric and imperial measures
 -as well as speed and distance from destination.
Most offer blockbuster films, as well as news, sport and comedy channels,
but a drawback on many of these is that they run in a continuous loop and
travellers have to wait until the sequence starts again if they miss the
beginning, although airlines promise that is being addressed.
On a long flight, the food is important. Airlines pride themselves on their
catering at the expensive end of the aircraft. Qantas includes Sydney Rock
oysters and emu on its menu, offering both Australian and European wines.
British Airways has recently introduced a programme designed to deliver the
traveller to his or her destination in a less bloated state - Well-being in
the Air. A standard menu might offer shrimp and bean salad for a starter,
together with lighter options such as seared and baked vegetables in a
balsamic vinegar dressing. Foodies will note that balsamic vinegar has
recently taken off in the way that extra-virgin olive oil did in the 1980s.
A main course could offer a choice between beef in red wine and anchovy
sauce, or for the more health-conscious passenger, vegetarian polenta with
woodland mushrooms, leeks and peppers.
Virgin, on the other hand, concentrates on the feel-good factor by inviting
top chefs such as Raymond Blanc to offer a dish and propose guest wines.
It is often the little touches that make a difference. Qantas staff make
sure that a glass of water is on hand to prevent dehydration, while BA
extends its Well-being in the Air programme to include a leaflet on
exercises to keep the circulation going. Virgin carries a beauty therapist
on most flights to provide massages and beauty treatments.
Some airlines even tuck you in for the night. First launched by BA in first
class, and now copied by Virgin in Upper Class and Cathay Pacific in its
business class, is the sleeper service. This provides a seat which goes
almost flat out, a duvet or blanket, pillow and sleeping suit, and is
preceded by a meal before take-off in the departure lounge.
The good news for the business traveller is that even with all this
technology and feel-good treatment, airlines are constantly reviewing and
upgrading their products. It can only get better.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (11): You can save - and still sit at
the front - Discounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wider seats, a better choice of meals and premium service for the business
traveller need not come at a premium price. Cut rate deals are not just for
the globe-trotting student or the family holidaymaker - discount prices can
now be found at the front of the aircraft.
If you know where to look, savings of thousands of pounds are there for the
taking. Due to an overburdened market and the growing business of travel
agents targeting the executive traveller, up to 40 per cent of all business
and first-class flyers now use discounted tickets for their journeys.
'There are so many airlines that there is over-capacity,' says Mr Bill
Kirkwood, sales and marketing director for Thomas Cook Travel. 'There are
more seats than (the airlines) can fill at full fare prices.'
The glutted market means better prices for the business consumer. Within
Europe, most major airlines publish cheaper rates in business class. On the
route from London to Paris, full return fares are around Pounds 318 in the
business cabin. British Airways offers a Pounds 240 return ticket in
business class, with travel restricted to BA only.
Passengers whose schedules mean they might need to switch airlines will have
to consider the higher price. For a further discount, British Midlands
offers passengers a Pounds 225 return fare from Paris to London for those
who only need three days for the trip. Similar discounts are available to
other European destinations.
For travellers from continental Europe to London, buying tickets in London
may be the best way to save money. Mr James Foster, of First Call Business
Travel, recommends that regular flyers from the continent buy one single
ticket to London, followed by a series of returns originating in London.
Because of currency fluctuations, tickets bought in Britain are generally
cheaper than those purchased on the continent.
The most dramatic savings are available on long-haul flights. To get the
best deals on these routes, executive clients should visit a specialised
travel company. Airlines do not directly advertise their cheaply-priced
first and business class tickets to passengers, and travel agents can often
find cheaper deals by combining airlines or negotiating stopovers that will
bring prices down.
In Britain, most major airlines regularly set 'net fares' to sell on a
limited basis to qualified travel management companies. With these tickets,
customers can achieve savings of up to 60 per cent off published prices.
A business class return fare from London to New York, for example, with a
published fare of around Pounds 2,130, can be found for Pounds 1,180 by
First Call Business Travel in London. In first class, that route usually
sells for just under Pounds 4,000. Discount agents can find a fare as cheap
as Pounds 1,500.
The London to Tokyo route has a published fare of about Pounds 4,900 for
first class and Pounds 3,180 in the business cabin. Rock-bottom tickets of
Pounds 1,295 in business class are available from special discounters.
In the US, airfares fluctuate more frequently and depend on more variables
than fares in Europe. Rather than purchasing 'net fare' tickets, travel
companies find the best deals by searching through their vast computer
reservation systems. Ms Regina Schneider, of Rosenbluth Travel in
Philadelphia, the third largest travel management company in the US with
1,600 corporate clients, says computerised technology helps the company stay
abreast of 'thousands' of fare changes each day.
US travel management companies often work with business clients to draw up
annual travel budgets and search for composite deals, rather than helping
clients to book cheap tickets on a trip-by-trip basis. US Travel, for
example, helps companies negotiate with airlines for a series of discounts.
'We find discounts on a global level rather than on a one-shot deal,' says
Ms Gusty Taler, spokesperson for US Travel.
Working with such companies can yield significant savings. US Travel's
international rate desk found a business class ticket from New York to
Frankfurt for Dollars 1,490. The published fare on that route is Dollars
2,772. Similarly, on a San Francisco to Paris route, a first-class traveller
could purchase a ticket for Dollars 4,022, a route that usually sells for
Dollars 6,846.
Wherever you go, it pays to use a travel agent or travel management company.
When choosing a travel company, Ms Roma Battye, of American Express Airfare
Centre, advises executive flyers to use 'one with a dedicated unit that
looks after cheap fares'.
'It is important to use a travel management company which has substantial
clout in the market,' says Thomas Cook's Mr Kirkwood. Signs of a good travel
agent are a centralised reservation service and trained staff. You should
always have a choice of fares for any route you specify.
'Always get the travel management company to search for the best thing that
is available,' says Mr Kirkwood. 'Don't just buy the first thing that is
offered to you.' Thomas Cook has a 'fair fares' deal under which the company
promises to match any fare cheaper than that which it offers on the same
route.
Brand loyalty is nearly impossible in the discount market, as the cheapest
fares are often offered on non-traditional airlines for the particular
route. 'There are ways to undercut prices if you are prepared to fly by
certain 'third-world' airlines,' says Mr Foster at First Call Business
Travel.
Discounted fares may also mean that flexibility is reduced. All such fares
are sold for a particular airline. 'With the special fares you cannot chop
and change from airline to airline,' says Ms Battye. For business travellers
with uncertain timetables, such restrictions could mean that you would be
stranded if you missed your flight.
Mr Foster says that such restrictions are not as draconian as they sound. If
a customer misses a flight, most airlines will re-route passengers on
alternative flights. Naturally, these details should be checked before you
head for the airport.
A good travel agent will try to find the maximum flexibility for you in a
discounted ticket. But Mr Kirkwood advises executive travellers to 'look at
the business itinerary and figure out what kind of restrictions they can
live with to save money.'
Rosenbluth Travel's Ms Schneider offers a few other suggestions for
corporate travellers: consider buying full price coach tickets for upgrades
to business class. Many airlines offer such deals, and travel companies can
find them for you. And several airlines now have special classes where
customers pay coach prices but get business or first class service. Virgin
Atlantic has a 'mid class', for example, and Continental advertises a
'business first' class.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (9): Comfort is very variable - Kate
Bevan compares the different standards of ground service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE BEVAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's 3am and you're in Bangkok. It's dark, you've just stepped off an
aeroplane from Sydney and you'll be getting back on it soon to continue to
London. You couldn't care less that it's Bangkok, all you want is a cup of
coffee and to stretch your legs.
If you're travelling economy, the best you can hope for is an uncomfortable
seat in the transit lounge, but if you're travelling at the front end of the
aircraft, you can at least while away the refuelling stop in an airline
lounge.
Or it's lunchtime in London and your flight to New York has been delayed.
You could wander through the shops at Heathrow's Terminal Three, but they're
mobbed. However, your business or first class ticket is a key to the airline
lounge, away from the noisy families, backpackers and other economy
travellers.
These two scenarios should end up in much the same way - the comfort of a
quiet lounge. However, the lounges you find yourself in may be quite
different. If your delayed flight from Heathrow is with Virgin Atlantic, you
can play with a train set or get your hair cut in the airline's comfortable
Clubhouse. But if you're in Bangkok with Qantas, you will find yourself in a
nondescript room equipped with a few sofas, newspapers and drinks . Most, if
not all, of the sofas are likely to be occupied by stretched-out, sleeping
travellers.
If you're passing through Taipei on a British Airways flight, your expensive
ticket gives you just a sofa in a room by the public canteen, while Virgin's
lounge at Boston does not have private toilets - the cossetting ends
abruptly when you queue with everyone else for the facilities by the
check-in desks.
The rule of thumb is that an airline's business class lounge is usually
pretty good at its home airport or a major base such as Heathrow, but away
from home the facilities can be less than luxurious.
Airlines are all keen to talk about the product they offer on the ground,
and equally keen to spend money on it. They point out that it is the
full-fare business and first-class traveller that keeps them aloft, not the
hordes travelling in economy, and they say that nothing is too good for
those passengers.
With some airlines, the treatment starts the moment you lock your front door
behind you. Virgin will whisk you in a chauffeur-driven limousine to
Heathrow from anywhere in the home counties, or provide you with first-class
tickets for the Gatwick Express train. Continental, the US airline, will
also provide chauffeur-driven luxury or first-class Gatwick Express tickets.
It also offers a free night at the Gatwick Hilton the night before.
It sounds good, but of course, once you're in the car or at the hotel you're
as good as on the flight - and unlikely to switch to another carrier.
Larger carriers say they cannot offer such door-to-door services, but they
arrange other perks. For example, United, the largest US carrier, offers a
discounted rate for parking at Heathrow.
The aim is to cut the amount of time the business or first class passenger
spends on the ground. This, say the airlines, is one of the main priorities
for these passengers, and to this end most have separate check-in facilities
to cut the queues. Carriers to the US encourage regular business and first
class passengers to join the Inspass programme so that progressing through
US customs and immigration procedures is reduced to simply having their palm
scanned. Both Heathrow and Gatwick airports at London have introduced a
fast-track system for some airlines' business and first-class passengers
which again bypasses the queues.
In spite of this, airlines still advise arriving at the airport up to two
hours before a flight, but most privately admit that the time margin can be
pushed quite substantially before a first or business class passenger is
denied permission to board. One carrier said it would probably get a
passenger on an aircraft even if he or she arrived with just 12 minutes
before departure - but added that this kind of tardiness was not encouraged.
Once you are airside, you can go straight past the crowds at the shops and
relax in a quiet lounge. Most are fairly straightforward: drinks and snacks
and a comfortable seat as well as access to business facilities such as
telephones, faxes and computers.
However, women travellers may feel slightly out of place in these lounges as
they tend to have overwhelmingly masculine decor such as leather seats and
wood panelling, and are still generally full of men. Often the only women to
be seen are the airline's staff. Virgin's lounge at Heathrow is stuffed full
of boys' toys: it boasts a train set, a video games arcade and a soundproof
music room with a state-of-the-art stereo, although Virgin, like other
carriers, says it does not deliberately set out to make lounges masculine.
Virgin points to its hairdressing and beauty therapy facilities where
travellers can attend to their appearance, and its conservatory - due to
open in the summer - where aircaft-spotters can watch from a plant-filled
haven.
Away from its home base, an airline may share facilities with other
carriers. BA is due to open a new lounge at Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport
which it will share with Qantas, the Australian carrier. Virgin shares
facilities with United at Hong Kong and Tokyo's Narita, while its passengers
at Gatwick and Miami use the airport's own lounge.
But what about when you arrive at the other end? The pampering ends with an
abrupt shock when you find yourself in the baggage reclaim hall not only
with everyone else on your flight but also with a couple of other
jumbo-loads all fighting to get their bags. Priority baggage reclaim is one
way to ease this shock, and most carriers make a point of getting first and
business-class luggage off the aircraft as quickly as possible and ahead of
the economy passengers' luggage.
Another way is to provide arrival facilities, and in this BA is leading the
way at its home base, Heathrow Terminal Four, with its recently opened
arrivals lounge. This has shower facilities and a valeting service so
arriving passengers can go on to the office clean and freshly pressed.
Passengers who have chosen to sleep through breakfast on the flight can eat
on the ground instead at the arrivals lounge, while those who still want
some sleep can snooze in the quiet area. For those arriving at Gatwick,
there are similar facilities at a nearby hotel, a service also offered by
Virgin.
But does all this really make a difference to the regular traveller?
According to one US businessman, 'I don't care which airline I fly. The
timing of the flights is much more important. I just want to get to my
destination at a convenient time and on time.'

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (10): The economics of persuasion -
Christine Buckley explains the useful art of upgrading your seat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Your mission, should you choose to accept it - and let me tell you that your
recession-hit company says you have no choice - is to prepare for a meeting
in an economy-class airline seat.
You must be able to maintain keen concentration and execute your work when
all about you is chaos and acute confinement.
A fine sense of balance will be essential if you are to keep a few papers on
the tiny table in front of you. Skills of contortion will come to the fore
as writing - or heaven forbid, working on a portable - will challenge any
theory of ergonomics. Unless you are very lucky, you will not have secured
an aisle seat.
All around you will be the frivolous noise of holiday travellers. At
frequent intervals with no notice, a few particularly excitable children
will run your way.
And those are only the tasters of your obstacles. If your concentration
manages to remain reasonably intact against these odds, you will also have
to cope with the sudden feeding of the 5,000 when those trays come round.
After that will come the loud and punchy Pearl and Dean style productions of
the duty-free films closely followed by the clatter of the duty-free
trolleys.
Sounds unreasonable? Corporate economising on air travel can indeed be tough
on the travelling executive.
So, what are you going to do about it? Where is your initiative? What
strategy will free you from this business travel into hell?
Well, Passenger X, it won't help to hear this but you should have instigated
action before you left terra firma. Have you never heard of upgrades?
Economy class need not necessarily be a one-way ticket, although obviously
airlines are reluctant to bump a passenger into a higher standard seat just
because he or she has the effrontery to ask for it.
You must also be braced to fight off a good number of rivals who are also
seeking salvation from their allotted economy class. The recession has
obliged many executives to turn right when they enter an aircraft - the way
to economy.
A survey last year by American Express showed that only 14.9 per cent of UK
companies allowed all staff to travel business class, a sharp drop from the
previous year when the figure was 25.4 per cent. According to that survey,
26 per cent of senior managers in Britain flew economy class to long-haul
destinations.
Last year, too, British Airways said that main growth in the first half of
1993 had come in economy class travel.
So Passenger X, if you are up to beating off the opposition with your laptop
and briefcase, consider the options.
Goodwill upgrades at the discretion of the airline from economy class to
business or similar standard are possible. You may be able to sweet-talk the
purser. But the party line from airlines is invariably that passengers get
what they pay for. Some are considerate on compassionate grounds, but
corporate executives wishing to work cannot expect to win such sympathy.
Virgin, for example, says that upgrades for full-fare paying passengers in
economy class are allocated strictly, irrespective of business
considerations. But the airline pledges that it will not turn completely
deaf ears to the plight of a struggling executive: 'It always depends on the
circumstances. Business travellers using economy could check in early, make
their request early and we could see what was suitable.'
Cathay Pacific unlocks the promise of consideration towards the business
traveller via the Marco Polo club. Membership of the club, which requires
relatively frequent - but not excessive - travel, gives the traveller at a
basic level priority service privileges. These include use of the airline's
lounges and those of reciprocal airlines, advanced seat reservations,
telephone or fax check-ins, extra baggage allowance, priority baggage
handling plus frequent flyer programmes.
For the hard-pressed economy-class business person, frequent flyer
programmes are an additional passage out of business travel hell.
On Cathay Pacific one only needs to make two return journeys economy class
between Hong Kong and Los Angeles to qualify for green card Marco Polo
membership. Cathay offers higher grade Marco Polo class such as gold or
diamond.
Likewise, KLM is keen to promote frequent travel concessions as opposed to
straightforward upgrading. The airline says that it does not have a policy
of upgrading because higher standards of travel should be enjoyed by those
passengers who have paid for such treatment.
But KLM operates the frequent flyer programme called Flying Dutchman World
of Difference through which economy class travellers are able to upgrade.
Further schemes guarantee the traveller privileges such as accommodation
upgrades, late check-outs, express check-outs and VIP treatment. In addition
to membership of such schemes, passengers receive points every time they
travel with KLM which they can use towards upgrading their seats.
TWA operates a similar policy. The airline, which last year abolished its
economy class in favour of a new comfort class which features more legroom,
issues full-fare paying comfort class passengers with an upgrade
certificate.
In fact, economy class has also been a beneficiary of a general trend among
airlines to ditch first-class travel. Usually, such a move is accompanied by
improvements to the remaining lower levels. In a trend set by British
Airways 10 years ago on its European flights, scrapping upper class caught
on quickly and most airlines followed suit.
Virgin took the classless society to long haul, replacing first with Upper
Class, which offers business class with first class comfort and providing
mid-class which aims to offer business comfort for full economy fare paying
passengers.
But what if upgradings - both personally and in terms of the airline's
provision - have firmly eluded you and you are absolutely stuck in economy?
What will the airlines do to lessen the misery?
Bad news, really. Little provision is made for business to continue as usual
when executive meets economy.
Few airlines provide newspapers. Virgin suggested that one of the few things
it may be able to offer the determined executive in economy class would be a
seat behind a partition.
Such accommodation may prove not quite mission impossible and you may be
able to assemble your thoughts and papers, but don't bank on it.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (7): China is fastest growing market -
The success story of Asia's airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asia's airlines are the envy of the rest of the world - and the jealousy is
justified. Customers might think the cause of that emotion is the carriers'
unparalleled reputation for service. That may be one partial reason, but the
main explanation is their commercial performance in the past and their
prospects for the future, given the likelihood of continued rapid growth of
their highly profitable short-haul routes.
That does not mean the region is without its problems, but they are trivial
compared with those confronting European and US carriers.
Over the last four years, while the rest of the aviation industry has been
struggling with overcapacity, weak yields, and patchy economic growth,
airlines based in the south-east Asia have enjoyed phenomenal passenger
volume growth in the regional market. This has averaged between 10 and 12
per cent since 1989. Last year, growth in south-east Asia was 9 per cent,
outpaced only by the former eastern bloc in Europe which averaged 10 per
cent, but from a much lower base.
Not surprisingly, four out of five of the most profitable carriers in 1992
were from south-east Asia. According to Air Transport World, the top five
were SIA, Cathay Pacific, British Airways, Thai International and China
Airlines.
Admittedly, in recent months some airlines, such as the Thai and Malaysian
flag carriers, have suffered declines in earnings because of intense
competition on long-haul routes and rising costs. The Japanese carriers,
Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways have also announced restructuring
plans.
But in spite of such problems, prospects remain bright. 'It's widely known
that the Asian market is the most lucrative and attractive in the world. And
it will be the fastest growing into the next century,' says Mr Koji
Yamashita, vice president, international sales and marketing at ANA.
'We're assuming the market will average growth at about 8 per cent between
now and the year 2010,' says Mr David Turnbull, deputy managing director at
Cathay Pacific. 'That's very much greater than the US or Europe, which are
expected to grow by an average of 4 to 5.5 per cent a year.'
The cornerstone of the Asian carriers' profitability is their short-haul
routes. 'Compared with the US and Europe, the fare structure is very stable,
making yields pretty healthy,' says Mr Yamashita.
Unlike Europe, where most money during the 1980s was made from business
class passengers, in the Asian market it is the back section or tourist
class which is the most profitable part of the jet, according to Mr
Turnbull.
Cathay Pacific is dropping first class on its short-haul routes because of
its high cost and questionable return, he says. 'Our primary revenue comes
from economy class in the Asia-Pacific region and that is our main focus,'
he adds.
Admittedly, not all Asian airlines find their short-haul routes so
profitable. The Japanese carriers, plagued by the longest and deepest
recession since the second world war as well as an extraordinarily high cost
base, have been suffering badly in recent years. JAL, for example, is
understood not to make any money on its Asian short-haul routes except those
to China.
The Japanese carriers' yields on Asian regional routes are clearly
inadequate. This is partly because Japanese customers have been using the
carriers' plight to snap up discount fares. At JAL, the yield management
system is being upgraded following a catastrophe last year when seats were
still available at the beginning of Golden Week, normally its most
profitable period.
JAL hopes the slump may be ending. In February, the airline registered a 20
per cent increase in passenger traffic compared with an admittedly subdued
February last year.
Some Asian regional routes are growing faster than others. 'The Philippines
and Indonesia are doing well, and Korea and Taiwan are very buoyant. We're
very bullish,' says Mr Turnbull at Cathay Pacific. Vietnam is an obvious new
destination for both business and tourism, he adds.
But for the rest of the century the most alluring market is China. Passenger
volumes have boomed over the last four years, making China the fastest
growing single market in the world, according to Mr Turnbull.
The rapid expansion of the Chinese market has been matched by profits growth
on routes to that country. 'This is a tightly regulated market,' says Mr
Yamashita at ANA. 'The Chinese still control frequencies and fares
structures and that helps keep yields high.' He expresses concern about US
carriers, however. United Airlines has just started a daily service from
Tokyo's Narita Airport to Shanghai using its fifth freedom rights.
Indeed, one of the most important irritants in this market, according to
Asian airlines, is the behaviour of US carriers. 'What is of concern to us
and other regional carriers is the way US groups are making use of outdated
bilateral agreements,' says JAL. 'They're spoiling the market by dumping
seats in Asia.'
Another irritant is the birth of secondary Asian carriers. South Korea,
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong all have fledgling secondary
airlines that could introduce greater competition and undermine margins in
the region.
However, Mr Turnbull at Cathay Pacific is dismissive of this threat. He
points out that many countries would have to renegotiate bilateral
agreements if they were to allow secondary carriers to land, and that the
chronic shortage of landing slots at Asian airports would hold back
secondary carriers for some time anyway.
This drought of landing slots is the main barrier to the future growth of
the region's airline industry. 'Tokyo's Narita Airport is already full, as
is Hong Kong's,' says Mr Turnbull. 'Tremendous investment will be required
in the region. Hong Kong's new airport, Chek Lap Kok, is due to be completed
in mid-1997 and is the single largest civil engineering project in the
world,' he adds.
A battle is raging between Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taiwan and Seoul to become
the regional hub of north-east Asia. Mr Yamashita discounts the chances of
the new Kansai airport near Osaka which is due to open this autumn. It has
only one runway, and although there are plans for another two the cost - an
estimated Dollars 15bn - is likely to be prohibitive.
The winner would need a minimum of two and probably three runways to avoid
slot restrictions, according to Mr Yamashita. 'There will be only one
dominant hub in the region. The others will complement it,' he says.
One way around the infrastructure problems is to use more local airports.
This has been an option adopted by the Korean carriers which fly to 17
cities in Japan. Passenger volumes and yields on these routes have been
high, especially since the two countries dropped visa requirements. JAL says
the Koreans' move to local airports has slowed the growth of its traffic
from Tokyo to Seoul.
Nevertheless, most Asian carriers plan to expand their routes network in the
region. ANA's main priority is to target Asian cities, while Cathay Pacific
expects most of its growth to take place in the Asia-Pacific region.
For its part, SIA plans to increase its capacity by about 8 per cent a year
until the end of the decade, says Mr Michael Tan, deputy commercial managing
director. The airline intends to increase capacity to Europe by only 5 per
cent a year, but some Asian routes could be boosted by up to 15 per cent.
The carrier has pinpointed India and China as particular targets. 'anyone
who is situated in Asia at this moment would be extremely foolish not to
recognise the opportunities,' Mr Tan says.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (8): City airports are just the ticket /
A look at the benefits - and the drawbacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the main airport hubs become more crowded, a niche market has opened up
for city centre airports such as London City and Berlin which cater mainly
for the business traveller. The growing importance of these 'close-in'
airports is underlined by the above-average passenger growth which they are
achieving in Europe despite the recession.
For example, about 500,000 passengers used Florence's Peretola Airport in
1993, up from just over 100,000 four years ago, while passenger traffic at
Belfast City Airport has increased from 546,000 in 1991 to 880,000 last
year. Meanwhile, London City Airport in Docklands handled more than 245,000
passengers last year, a 31.5 per cent increase over 1992's total. The surge
in passenger traffic appears to be continuing.
The extension of its runway to 1,199 metres in 1992, the opening of the
Limehouse link road into London and the improvement in reliability of the
Docklands Light Railway have all helped London's newest airport. So far this
year, passenger traffic at London City Airport is running 92 per cent ahead
of last year, well ahead of a budgeted 60 per cent increase.
Mr William Charnock, London City's managing director, says the airport is
doing 'tremendously well' and should comfortably pass the 400,000 passenger
mark this year. With that level of passenger traffic the airport, which was
developed by and is majority-owned by Mowlem, the construction group, should
break even this year for the first time since it opened in 1987.
Such passenger growth suggests that some of the advantages offered by city
airports are finally being recognised. Among these advantages are the
substantial savings in time (and stress) which they offer the business
traveller because they are usually more conveniently located for business
meetings, and because formalities such as check-in have been kept to a
minimum.
For example, both London City Airport and Berlin's Tempelhof Airport are
much closer to the business districts in their respective cities than either
Heathrow or Tegel. London City Airport is only six miles from the City and
an undisputed 15 minutes by road from the City financial district and 20
minutes from the West End, thanks to the opening last year of the Limehouse
Link.
In addition, city airports are smaller and less congested than their much
larger counterparts. Parking is directly outside the London City Airport
terminal building, check-in time is 10 minutes before the flight compared
with the 30 to 60 minutes demanded by most airports and for incoming
passengers it usually only takes five minutes to reclaim baggage and clear
customs from the time the aircraft touches the runway.
Despite these advantages, some city airports have also suffered from a
number of perceived drawbacks including restrictions imposed because of
environmental concerns and a lack of comprehensive flight scheduling.
Regulations such as restricted operating hours and specialist requirements -
such as the steep 5.5 degree approach at London City - have been imposed to
protect the environment but reduce the number and type of aircraft that can
use the airports.
As a result of these limitations, most large airlines have avoided the city
airports, leaving them to smaller or niche airlines which operate less
frequently and to fewer destinations than their larger competitors. Even
among the smaller operators there has been considerable 'churn'. For
example, at London City British Midland, one of the pioneers, pulled out in
1991 after losing Pounds 10m and Brymon, the first airline ever to use
London City, halted its operations there in March last year.
Nevertheless, the economic arguments in favour of using city airports are
steadily improving - particularly as delays, both in the sky and on the
ground, become more commonplace at the large hubs.
At London City early operators had to put up with the restrictions imposed
by a short runway which meant that only small turboprop aircraft, such as
the Dornier 228 and the De Havilland Dash-7, with seating for up to 30
passengers could use the airport.
The lengthening of the runway in 1992 opened the airport up to a new family
of regional jets including the 90-seater BAe 146 which has a range of up to
1,000 miles, putting 95 per cent of the European Union as well as
Scandinavia and eastern Europe within reach.
As a result, London has recently been attracting new carriers, and gradually
building its list of short-haul destinations. Last year VLM, the Belgian
airline, began new services from London City to Antwerp and Business Air
launched flights to Frankfurt which connect with Lufthansa's international
network.
Since the start of this year, VLM has become the first airline to take
advantage of domestic deregulation to operate a service between Liverpool
and London City, and Virgin Cityjet has launched a new service from Dublin
to London City which ties in with Contiflug's flights from London City to
Berlin Tempelhof. Meanwhile, Air France operates eight flights a day to
Paris, Sabena runs flights to Brussels, Flexair serves Rotterdam and
Crossair flies to Zurich/Lugano.
With new routes and improved passenger yields has come a renewed confidence
in the concept of city airports. As Mr Charnock notes, 'nothing breeds
traffic like traffic'. He suggests that London City represents a role model
for the future of air travel - a future which he believes lies in central
airport locations, easing airport congestion, reducing waiting time and
offering a stress-free environment.
Since its inception in February last year Mr Charnock has also been chairman
of the Conference of City Airports which initially grouped together London
City, Stockholm Bromma, Berlin Tempelhof, Belfast City and Toronto Island
and has since been expanded to include Florence, Edmonton (Alberta) and Tel
Aviv.
These eight city airports share three common features - they are used
'preferentially for scheduled air carriers and corporate traffic', they
practise 'efficient environmental technology and operational procedures to
the mutual benefit of the community and the airport' and they are 'located
within and serving the city business community'.
The conference members have held four or five meetings so far, each
concentrating on a single issue of collective interest. The next meeting in
Toronto next month will focus on relationships with the airlines.
'I suppose city airports share a threat from environmentalists,' says Mr
Charnock, but he adds: 'We faced up to that threat at public inquiries.' He
insists that subsequent events have proved that the airport 'is not a threat
to the quality of life'. London City Airport, he says, 'gets very few noise
complaints'.
As a result he believes other city airports, particularly those which still
face environmental challenges to their very existence or development, can
learn from London's experience. 'We want to show people that city airports,
properly operated and managed, can be friendly neighbours and an enormous
asset to local businesses.'

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (6): The death knell may sound for first
class - Economic downturn has accelerated a trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The skies are darkening for first-class air travel. Dutch carrier KLM and
Northwest Airlines of the US have become the latest airlines to abolish
first class cabins in favour of upgraded business ones on long-haul flights.
Flagging customer demand, prompted in part by the economic downturn but also
by the upgraded facilities being introduced in the business class sector,
have led nearly all the international airlines to review their first class
operations in the past two years. Not all that many have survived.
Luxury travel has been increasingly passed over by cost-conscious
travellers, with many big companies ordering their staff to book cheaper
seats as the recession has taken hold. The empty rows in first class have
prompted many airlines to create a middle class, and within that tier
further differentiation, by refurbishing their existing business facilities.
The effect has been a downward ratchet with many former first class
travellers unlikely to return, and a generation of prospective customers
satisfied in the cheaper business tier. For many airlines, a 5 per cent full
paying passenger load has become the norm in first class, with the remaining
seats filled by travelling airline crew or by upgrading business class
passengers.
With the quality gap closing between the middle and top tiers, the hefty
chasm between the respective fares looks all the more glaring. A first class
ticket between Chicago and Glasgow will cost in the region of Pounds 4,500,
whereas a business class fare comes in at around Pounds 2,500, with economy
at about Pounds 900.
However, the move away from first class travel is not simply a recent one.
The recession has accentuated a trend begun in the 1980s when attempts to
identify business travellers through a new range of branded products began
to pay dividend for airlines. As the range of brands proliferated, so too
did the fragmentation of the market, with first class pushed into an ever
smaller niche.
The first casualty were short-haul flights, with passengers rejecting the
luxuries and cost of first class for regional journeys. Last year, Swissair
became the last of the big airlines to offer a cheaper alternative to its
short-haul first class travel.
But it was the recession which sounded the death knell for first class. With
airlines plunging into losses throughout the world, the luxury services
proved the most costly to keep running and consequently the ones to receive
the severest cuts.
'There was hardly any demand,' says KLM. 'Business travellers want the
luxuries of first class but at a business class fare. That's what we're
going to give them.'
KLM and its US partner Northwest Airlines are abolishing their first class
tier and will offer passengers a choice between economy and a premium
service called world business class, an upgraded version of the old business
class service. The main feature of the new service will be increased leg
room. The only airlines offering more room to business class passengers will
be those that have already abolished first class travel - Virgin Atlantic of
the UK and Continental Airlines of the US.
British Airways is one of the few airlines to maintain a significant
presence in first class, although ironically it was the first to close down
its short-haul capacity. Mr Mike Batt, BA's marketing director, believes the
problem for most airlines is three-fold.
'An airline has to maintain a good load factor to make first class
economical, and for that it needs a good route network. Few airlines have
got the presence.
'Secondly, you need a strong branded product which customers can trust for
integrity and consistency. And most of all, you have to be able to deliver
that product.' For BA, integrity means few upgrades from business class.
'Upgrading devalues the product,' says Mr Batt.
So what do customers get for first class not available on other airlines'
premium brands? The lines of differentiation are getting increasingly
blurred. Executive lounges, extended leg room, wider chairs and personal
video are all offered in different measure by the premium services - and at
a cheaper price.
Mr Batt admits that first class is matched in many regards by other premium
services, but argues that the 'total travel experience' offered by the doyen
of air services is worth the extra expense.
'The first class traveller is someone who, because he is travelling a lot,
needs more than anyone to relax while he is doing it. If we can deliver a
busy executive overnight to a meeting the next day in a refreshed and
healthy state ready to do business, then first class travel is a wholly
justifiable business expense.'
First class makes up around 4 per cent of British Airways' revenue. And Mr
Batt believes that the move by other airlines away from the brand will draw
other passengers over to BA. 'There is a small but significant band of
regular travellers who are loyal to first class and do not want to fly
anything else.'
A typical BA 747 will contain around 300 economy class seats, 72-88 club
class and 18 or so first class. Other airlines with first class on their
747s are likely to offer far fewer seats. Even so, they have been finding
few takers and special deals proliferate, such as free second tickets for
spouses and discounts on future flights. Furthermore, plans being drawn up
for the new generation of 777 aircraft make no allowances for first class
cabins.
But BA intends to keep its first class product at the forefront of executive
travel. Later this year it plans to introduce its first aircraft to allow
first class passengers to send faxes, operate computers, receive E-mail and
make outgoing telephone calls. 'All our research indicates that our
customers do not want incoming calls,' says Mr Batt.
However, even bullish BA admits the future for first class is not
guaranteed. 'If the niche got too small, then we would have to look at our
options,' says Mr Batt. 'You have to be responsive and we will change with
the market.'

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (5): Loyalty gets its reward - Frequent
flyer programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frequent Flyer Programmes, invented in the early 1980s in the US in an
effort to create and maintain customer loyalty, have become an invaluable
marketing tool used by most airlines.
Most carriers' FFPs work by offering regular passengers 'points' or 'miles'
which can eventually be exchanged for free flights, seat upgrades or other
benefits. Membership of an FFP may also entitle the traveller to other
benefits such as additional excess baggage allowances, express check-in or
the guarantee of a seat when flights are fully booked.
In most cases, the cost of an FFP to the airlines - that of filling seats
that would otherwise be empty - is marginal and despite the early misgivings
of some airline industry executives, FFPs have proved tremendously popular
with travel-hungry airline customers and successful for the airlines
themselves.
According to Carlson Marketing Group, which has helped design a number of
FFPs on both sides of the Atlantic, the 32m frequent flyer members in the US
alone have already earned more than 620bn miles' worth of free travel,
enough to fill about 590,000 fully-loaded transatlantic Boeing 747 flights.
'Travel, and free travel in particular, appeals to everybody,' says Mr David
Perkins, managing director of Carlson Marketing in the UK. He believes that
part of the reason for the success of FFPs is that travel allowances provide
a flexible way to reward loyalty.
From the carriers' perspective FFPs have also proved to be effective in
capturing valued business traffic. For example, in a survey conducted last
autumn by the Official Airline Guide, 70 per cent of European business
travellers said that, given a choice of carriers on a route, they would
choose a carrier connected with their FFP.
However, European and Asian carriers in particular are relatively recent
converts to the FFP. Airlines outside North America initially viewed the
birth and subsequent rapid growth of FFPs during the 1980s with a mixture of
disapproval and trepidation. In the last few years these concerns have
subsided and most airlines outside the North American market have bowed to
commercial pressures and now operate or belong to an FFP.
In Europe British Airways launched its frequent flyer scheme in May 1991 and
all the other main European airlines have subsequently followed suit with
their own programmes, or have joined existing programmes run by their
marketing partners. Though European and Asian carriers were late entrants to
the FFP game, they have learned from the US experience. In particular,
unlike their US counterparts, they have generally limited their FFPs to
business travellers and changed the rules to limit the give-aways.
The objective of an FFP for any airline is to attract the regular business
passenger, not the price-sensitive leisure traveller who perhaps flies once
a year. Thus, while US carriers and other airlines which compete in the US
market have been forced by cut-throat competition into using the schemes to
compete even for discount ticket sales, in Europe and elsewhere FFPs
generally exclude discount fares.
Similarly, late arrivals in the FFP business such as BA, Air France and
Lufthansa have also improved on the US experience by imposing time limits on
cashing in accumulated points. This once again favours frequent travellers,
who fly often enough to earn free flights quickly, and enables the airline
to control the flow of free seats and minimise its future seat liabilities.
Airlines have also discovered another key reason for operating or belonging
to a frequent flyer programme - customer information. Less than 15 per cent
of travellers book their tickets directly with an airline, the remaining 85
per cent booking through a third party such as a travel agent, depriving the
airline of any means to capture valuable information about its customers.
By using the often detailed information generated by an FFP, airlines argue
that they can target-focus their marketing efforts more accurately as well
as serve their customer base more effectively.
In Europe Carlson Marketing has built FFP computer relational databases for
SAS of Scandinavia, Swissair and Austrian Airlines. FFP databases allow
airlines to find out who their passengers are and their patterns of travel.
They can then use direct mail to send sales and marketing information to
particular groups of customers. 'Customer knowledge can be a competitive
advantage,' says Mr Perkins.
Crucially, Carlson argues that loyalty marketing is much more cost-effective
than most broad scale advertising. As Lord Leverhulme once said: 'Fifty per
cent of my advertising is wasted, the trouble is I don't know which 50 per
cent.'
Detailed customer information has enabled some airlines to operate several
tiers of frequent flyer membership - depending on a passenger's spending
pattern. British Airways, for example, now has four levels of frequent flyer
membership with varying levels of benefits.
Smaller airlines can also make good use of FFP information, but naturally
suffer from having a much smaller database to start with. One increasingly
popular solution is the cross-airline allegiance. For example, Mr Richard
Branson's Virgin Atlantic has extended its Virgin Freeway FFP to include
British Midland, SAS and Air New Zealand. Similarly, Singapore Air Lines,
Swissair and Delta of the US have linked their FFPs across three continents.
Another distinct trend is the broadening of FFPs to include hotel chains,
car rental groups and other companies, for example credit card issuers.
These cross-company links enable airlines, big and small, to expand the
scope and attractiveness of their FFPs.
Armed with such linkages, FFPs have conquered the travel and leisure
industry in little more than a decade. There are, however, still a number of
unresolved issues.
Although more recent FFP conditions have been tightened, US airline
executives in particular acknowledge that accounting standards bodies are
questioning whether the financial liability of FFPs should be included in
company accounts as a contingent liability and some US airlines have already
blamed low passenger yields on FFP members exercising their rights to free
seats.
Tax authorities on both sides of the Atlantic are also looking at the value
of the give-aways for both the airlines and their customers. Any move to tax
FFP benefits could seriously affect their attractiveness. In addition,
companies, which are already scrutinising their travel budgets closely, may
press for better fare deals rather than racking-up frequent flyer points for
their staff.
Some critics have expressed the hope that once all airlines have FFPs, their
usefulness to distinguish one airline from another - and therefore their
value as a marketing tool - will diminish. So far, however, there is no sign
of that happening. Indeed, it has become increasingly difficult to imagine
an airline industry without frequent flyer programmes.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (4): Low-cost carriers start to make
inroads - Developments in short-haul services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most striking developments of the past 12 months has been the
emergence in the US airline industry of a powerful breed of new low-cost
airlines which have made increasing inroads in the traditional market of the
big American carriers.
The rise of these new low- cost carriers is the latest chapter in the
12-year-old story of US airline deregulation. Concentrating essentially on
shorter and medium-range domestic routes, these new carriers have challenged
the dominance of the big airlines, forcing them to take radical
restructuring steps ranging from the creation of new low-cost airline
subsidiaries to full employee ownership in the case of one of the biggest
carriers, United Airlines.
The question for Europe's newly liberalised airline industry is whether a
similar pattern will ultimately emerge in the European market. On the
surface at least, there are already signs that smaller airlines have taken
advantage of the new freedoms of the European Union's single aviation market
by extending their range of services to include domestic operations in other
EU member states, competing against the big carriers on busy intra- European
routes and stim- ulating fares competition both in the business and leisure
markets.
These smaller airlines have also helped develop a more extensive network of
regional services, boosting the growth of regional airports throughout
Europe. In some cases, this has involved head-on competition against the
larger carriers, but in most instances it has led to increasing co-operation
between smaller and bigger carriers with the smaller carriers providing
passenger feed for the longer haul services of larger airlines.
Large flag carriers, most notably British Airways, have actively developed
associated or subsidiary airlines in other EU states as part of their
efforts to create a broader European airline network. Apart from setting up
a lower cost European airline operation based at London's Gatwick Airport
following its takeover of Dan-Air, BA has sought to strengthen its reach in
the internal European market through its new Deutsche BA subsidiary in
Germany and its large minority stake in TAT, the French regional carrier.
In the same way, Lufthansa has set up a low-cost subsidiary in Germany to
serve the domestic market and has taken a stake in Lauda Air of Austria. KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines has stakes in Air UK, which has been expanding its
short-haul European network from its base at London's Stansted Airport, as
well as in the Dutch carrier Transavia, which now operates 10 scheduled
routes from Amsterdam.
Another growing trend has been the development of franchising with small
carriers negotiating franchising agreements with larger established
airlines. One example is the recent franchising agreement between the Irish
carrier Cityjet and Virgin, whereby Mr Richard Branson's carrier is
providing sales and marketing in the UK for Cityjet's service from London
City Airport to Dublin, using BAe 146 aircraft painted in Virgin livery.
Virgin has a similar agreement with South-East European Airlines of Greece,
which operates a Boeing 737 aircraft on Virgin's behalf between Athens and
London's Gatwick Airport.
The emergence of smaller carriers has had an impact on intra-European fares,
where standard fares have traditionally been about 30 per cent higher than
on equivalent routes in the US deregulated market. British Midland Airways
has led the field in bringing down fares on expensive intra-European routes
by providing competition from a third carrier on routes previously served by
the two flag carriers of each country.
Although the introduction of European 'open skies' at the beginning of last
year has clearly had tangible benefits for consumers and airline
competition, they have been somewhat limited by comparison to the impact of
deregulation in the US market.
In a far-reaching report on airline competition in the single European
market, the UK's Civil Aviation Authority has warned that any significant
increase in active competition in the longer term in Europe would occur only
if investors felt confident that airlines which are efficient and responsive
to their customers would survive and be profitable.
Unfortunately, substantial obstacles persist for smaller carriers and the
new entrants that the EU is seeking to encourage in the market. As the CAA
put it: 'Given substantial barriers to entry on many routes, the
opportunities for competition will be made reality only by positive
long-term action going beyond the liberalisation already achieved.'
The biggest hurdle remains the issue of state aid for financially troubled
European flag carriers. Unless limits are set on the amount of aid granted
to financially distressed state-owned airlines for restructuring, there are
clearly significant risks of distorting competition and discouraging new
entrants into the market.
French government proposals to inject a further FFr20bn into Air France, the
loss-making French national carrier, have provoked a wave of concern among
smaller carriers as well as larger airlines which have had to restructure
themselves and cope with the industry-wide slump on their own.
Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's chairman, recently warned that state aid was
encouraging bankrupt carriers to carry on with overcapacity which in turn
put pressure on fares. 'Six European carriers are known to have received or
applied for state subsidies to an amount of over Pounds 4.4bn: BA, KLM and
Lufthansa are the exception to this situation,' he said.
The other serious obstacle facing smaller airlines and undermining
competition is the lack of take-off and landing slots at congested European
airports. Unless new regulations are introduced to make more slots available
at busy airports for new competitors on European routes, the CAA argues that
existing flag carriers will further entrench their dominant position at
their main airport bases at the expense of potential new competitors.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (2): The force of gravity begins to be
felt - Fares are feeling the pinch as traffic between Europe and Asia
reaches a peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Air links between Europe and Asia are coming of age. For years, they have
been the fiefdoms of a handful of carriers whose fares seemed to defy
gravity. Now the business of flying east is beginning to succumb to
competitive pressures that promise to bring fares down and are already
raising service quality.
Traditionally, flying between London and Hong Kong or Frankfurt and Tokyo
has meant choosing between the two national carriers involved. Such
competition as there was arose from the Asian standards of service  -
subservient and ever-attentive - which the European carriers felt necessary
to counter.
Today, tight limits on competition still apply to some large destinations
such as Seoul, South Korea, and Beijing in China. But progressively the
others have seen third competitors muscling in. To Singapore it is Qantas,
to Hong Kong and Tokyo it is Virgin Atlantic, and to Bangkok there are a
whole host of carriers, including Austria's Lauda Air and Taiwan's Eva Air.
There is evidence that the changes are bringing with them a taste of the
competition that has so far been mostly confined to north Atlantic routes.
On the London to Tokyo route, where four airlines compete - British Airways,
Japan Air Lines, Virgin Atlantic and All Nippon - BA finds itself now the
only carrier that offers a standard business-class sized seat. In February,
ANA announced that it was refitting its business class cabins with seat rows
50 inches apart instead of 40 and a month later JAL followed suit. Virgin
has had its big-seat Upper Class product since 1989.
Virgin has had a more rapid impact on the London-Hong Kong route. Both
British Airways and Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific have responded to the
arrival of Virgin Atlantic on the London service by adding 'sleeper
services' of their own. The idea is one pioneered by BA on its transatlantic
routes and involves feeding passengers on the ground so that they can get
more sleep in the air. Passengers also get items such as sheets to sleep in
and seats in a specially designated part of the aircraft. These products are
not as good as Virgin's, where business class passengers get first class
sized seats, but could help prevent some defections to the new competitor.
Such competition has a powerful effect on fares, too. A typical business
class return fare between London and Tokyo is about Pounds 3,400. Between
Zurich and Tokyo, where Japan Air Lines and Swissair are the competitors,
the fare is almost 20 per cent higher at about SFr8,400 (Pounds 4,000).
It is similar on routes to Singapore from London, where there are three
competitors. The business class return fare is about Pounds 2,400 while from
Paris, where only Singapore Airlines and Air France operate non-stop
services, the business class return fare runs to around Pounds 3,500.
Competition on routes between Europe and Japan especially is continuing to
grow, says Mr David Scowsill, British Airways' regional general manager for
Asia-Pacific. 'In the last year or two airlines have loaded more capacity on
routes to Japan despite the fact that Narita (Tokyo's main international
airport) is constrained.'
He says that competition will be given another boost this year with the
opening of Osaka's Kansai airport in September. This investment in capacity
is happening in spite of the economic difficulties in Japan, he says.
'Airlines are taking a long-term view.'
Even bigger than Japan, both in terms of growth and potential market size is
the Chinese market.
'European carriers took about 200,000 passengers into Beijing last year, a
rise of about 15 per cent on 1992,' says Mr Scowsill. About one in six are
on business and that figure will grow this year.
The airlines are keen to put on more services to China but are largely
limited to traffic that originates in Europe in spite of the fact there is a
growing class of high income Chinese. This is mainly because the Chinese
government has a strict visa issuing regime for Chinese nationals wishing to
travel and there is no infrastructure of travel agencies in China, making
the simple act of buying a ticket difficult.
Add to this the need for long negotiation between European government
officials and their Chinese counterparts and this has made it difficult for
carriers all over Europe to add services to China. Even today, no airline
runs a daily non-stop service between Beijing and London, Paris or
Frankfurt.
Of Europe's airlines, it is Germany's Lufthansa that has a valuable head
start over other European carriers in services to China because it has the
only direct flight (with one stop) to Shanghai.
Other carriers usually go through Hong Kong with a change of aircraft and
often airline. So Hong Kong remains the first choice of business traveller
working in Europe, although there is plenty of room for growth, according to
Cathay Pacific, especially from continental Europe.
Cathay is planning to increase its presence in central Europe where it is
practically an unknown name. Mr Jobst Rottman, Cathay's manager of sales and
distribution in Germany, says that the airline is still suffering both from
its low profile in Germany and from economising by recession-hit German
business travellers.
'We think that 20-25 per cent of economy class passengers are travelling on
business, twice the level of two or three years ago,' says Mr Rottman.
Cathay's response has been to try to feed more passengers into Frankfurt for
the journey to Hong Kong. It offers free short-haul flights to business
class passengers and last year signed a co-operation agreement with Malev,
the Hungarian carrier.
Such an arrangement mirrors what has been happening on the North Atlantic
where passengers feed into an ever smaller number of European cities from
which the long-haul flights leave.
'There will be more pressure on key points in Europe. Far eastern carriers
are beginning to find that secondary points do not warrant non-stop
services, they cannot make them pay,' says Mr Scowsill.
The solution, according to both BA and many of the Asian carriers, is for
aircraft manufacturers to design and build bigger aircraft.
Until this comes about, the fight for customers will be conducted on a
relatively mundane level. This is, nevertheless, one that the business class
traveller is likely to feel keenly. According to Mr Paul Griffiths,
commercial director at Virgin, business travellers in Asia are accustomed to
higher levels of service than their counterparts in the US. That does not
mean the battle between carriers will be limited to fringe benefits. There
will be fare competition too, he says. The gauntlet has been thrown down.

Some of them will probably also be carrying a shoulder bag or briefcase
containing a portable computer, fax-modem, cellular telephone and the
associated paraphernalia that makes up the 'mobile office'.
Advances in technology over the past decade have removed most of the
restrictions imposed in the past by heavy hardware and fixed communications
links. Today it is possible to make a voice telephone call, send a facsimile
message or exchange computer data with the office local area network from
virtually anywhere in the world by using cellular radio or satellite
telecommunications services.
Soon a second generation of pocket-sized personal digital assistants (PDAs)
will be available, adding another dimension to the concept of the mobile
office by combining the functions of a pen-based computer and a hand-held
telecommunications device.
Meanwhile, the data and voice telecommunications services available to the
globe-trotting business traveller are also expanding rapidly and becoming
more international. For example, the introduction of digital cellular
telephone services across Europe based on the pan-European GSM standard
means that travellers will soon be able to use their mobile phone or even
more conveniently, their GSM smart card, anywhere in Europe.
Similarly, on both sides of the Atlantic a new breed of dedicated mobile
digital packet-switched data networks is springing up to provide portable
computer users with high speed, high quality wireless data links.
These terrestrial telecommunications developments are being mirrored in the
sky with the introduction of new digital aeronautical telecommunications
services in the US and now in Europe and elsewhere.
For the first time they are providing airline passengers with a wide range
of high-quality telecommunications and other services such as in-seat
shopping, forward bookings, flight information and business news. Credit
cards are used to pay for all the services.
The original air-to-ground public telephone services - dubbed 'pay phones in
the sky' - were introduced by US carriers on their domestic flights in the
mid-1980s and were based on analogue VHF radio links. Although call quality
often left much to be desired, their growth was nevertheless impressive.
For example, more than 41m calls, including 10.5m in 1993 alone, have been
made using GTE's original Airfone system, which was introduced in late 1984,
and its more recent digital successor, GTE GenStar. GTE currently has air
telephones installed in 2,049 US jets.
The new GenStar system is built around 109 terrestrial base stations which
provide a telephone service over the US at Dollars 2 a minute.
In addition to enabling passengers to connect their portable computers to
send facsimile messages or data, GenStar - which is already in operation in
34 shuttle aircraft - will eventually also provide access to multi-language
video, video games, entertainment channels and flight information delivered
via seat-back screens or liquid crystal displays.
GenStar's customers include the USAir and Delta shuttles, United Airlines,
TWA and Air Canada. GTE plans to have the new service installed on more than
1,400 aircraft by the end of this year.
However, GTE faces fierce competition in the US and elsewhere from Claircom
Communications, a joint venture between McCaw Cellular Communications and
General Motor's Hughes Network Systems, which holds a 19 per cent stake.
Claircom's AirOne system, launched in 1992 with orders from Alaska,
Southwest and Northwest, has also won contracts from American Airlines and
from Air France which plans to install the system in up to 80
transcontinental jets. Altogether, Claircom claims that more than 1,500
aircraft are due to be fitted with its AirOne system.
The third competitor in the US digital air telecommunications market is
In-Flight Phone, a privately-controlled Illinois-based company. Its
FlightLink system has won orders from USAir, America West and Carnival
Airlines in the US and with Kuwait and Saudi Arabian Airlines in the Middle
East.
Some industry estimates suggest that revenues from digital US terrestrial
flight telephone system (TFTS) networks and services will be running at
Dollars 450m a year by the end of 1995.
All three US digital network operators are linking up their systems with
emerging satellite-based telecommunications systems to provide worldwide
access.
Satellite-based telephone services have been available on many private jets
and on a limited number of long-haul flights for a number of years. However,
outside North America public access aircraft telecommunications services
have been much slower to develop.
The development of a European terrestrial flight telephone system capable of
supporting low cost, high quality telecommunications services in the skies
above the region has been delayed by years of debate and wrangling between
rival national telephone organisations.
Unlike the competing US systems which all use proprietary technology, the
West European TFTS is being built by individual telecommunications
organisations but will be based on a common standard.
The telecommunications organisations in the UK and France have already
completed their segments of the TFTS network infrastructure and the first
ground stations in Sweden and Italy are also operational. The remainder of
Europe, including Scandinavia and Germany, will go live by the end of this
year.
Two TFTS service providers, Jetphone, a Pounds 10m BT-France Telecom joint
venture, and Mercury FlightLink, a subsidiary of Mercury Communications set
up in partnership with In-Flight Phone of the US, have already been
established to resell services on the trans-European network and provide the
aircraft equipment.
Like their transatlantic counterparts, both European service providers also
plan eventually to offer their customers a wide range of services in
addition to basic voice telecommunications.
Jetphone marked its official launch in January by announcing an agreement
with Air France to equip the French national carrier's entire short and
medium-haul fleet of 110 aircraft. British Airways is also installing
Jetphone equipment on 11 Super Shuttle airliners.
Jetphone has set a price of Ecu4.20 (Dollars 5.80) a minute for all calls
regardless of time of day or destination. Airlines will set prices in their
own currencies. Air France has tentatively set its price at FFr30 a minute
while British Airways will charge Pounds 3.30 a minute.
Meanwhile, Mercury FlightLink, which plans a two-tier call tariff structure
 -Pounds 2 for calls within Europe and Pounds 4 for calls to destinations
outside the region - is understood to have already signed two service
contracts which will be announced shortly and to be negotiating a third.
Although the company is likely to concentrate on being a TFTS service
provider, it is also considering building and operating its own network
segments in the UK and other countries where competition is being
encouraged. Mercury is also bidding for the German TFTS contract.
Mr David Stone, managing director of Jetphone, is predicting that the first
commercial calls will be made over the European TFTS 'in the next couple of
months'. Over the next five years he believes 1,000 aircraft in Europe will
be fitted with equipment for TFTS services, and that these aircraft will be
generating call revenues of Pounds 80m a year.
Mr Stone does not expect the TFTS services to compete directly with
expensive satellite-based airborne communications services.
For example, calls on Skyphone, the satellite system in which BT is also a
shareholder along with Singapore Telecom and Norwegian Telecom, are charged
at Dollars 9.95 a minute. Instead, he suggests that TFTS-based systems will
primarily serve local and regional markets while satellite-based systems
will service long-haul flights.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (1): The better seats start to get
bigger - Airlines are bowing to pressure from business travellers - usually
their most lucrative customers - to make flying more comfortable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airlines are at last beginning to give passengers what they want: space. For
years, survey after survey has shown that business travellers most
appreciate room in which to relax or work. Instead, airlines have plied them
with multi-channel television, gourmet meals, vintage wines and little bags
with glass jars of moisturisers and eyelid balms.
Now carriers appear to be bowing to the pressure from their customers. In
both long and short haul, they are installing wider seats with greater
legroom.
To a certain extent, the change is the result of technical changes. Newer
aircraft such as the Airbus A320, A340 and Boeing 777 are wider than their
older rivals, the Boeings 737, 747 and 767.
But the principal driving force is commercial. The latest round of surveys
reinforces the message. The Official Airlines Guide Business Traveller
survey shows that sleeping and working, both on long and short-haul flights,
rate far higher as 'preferred activities' than in-flight entertainment and
eating. The annual survey from the International Air Transport Association,
(Iata), published this week, shows that in all travel classes, more than
three-quarters of business travellers think that seat size is the most
important part of being in business class
The reason is simple. Space on long-haul means sleep and the chance to work
effectively on arrival. On short-haul, it means being able to make the best
use of valuable time away from the telephone in which to catch up on
paperwork.
It has taken several years for the airlines to get the message, but now just
about every airline is considering the move to bigger seats for premium fare
payers. Many have in recent months begun to take concrete steps towards
giving the business traveller something in which to sleep rather than slump.
The others may not be far behind.
The origins of the movement were humble. Although Scandinavian Airline
System was the first major carrier to drop a luxury first class service, in
1982, the idea was really born in 1984 when Virgin Atlantic introduced its
Upper Class. This not only eliminated the traditional three classes of
travel in favour of two, but gave passengers in the Upper Class first-class
sized seats for the price of a business class ticket.
It took eight years for the idea to spread. At the end of 1992, Continental
of the US introduced its Business First product for long-haul flight,
practically the same idea as Virgin's.
Other airlines held back for another year, arguing that Virgin and
Continental were desperate to attract passengers. Then, last year, Belgian
carrier Sabena, tried giving business class ticket holders first class seats
on its Brussels-New York flights only. And Eva Air, a new Taiwanese carrier,
introduced a four-class Boeing 747 which included a similar size of large
seat for business class passengers (and incidentally currently holds what is
probably the record legroom - called seat pitch in the industry - with its
first class seat rows 75 inches apart).
The breakthrough has come in 1994. Last month KLM, the Dutch carrier, and
its US partner, Northwest, announced they were co-ordinating the
refurbishment of their aircraft with business class seat pitch of 47 inches,
compared with the industry standard of 40 inches.
It is not as spectacular a leap as those of Continental and Virgin to 55
inches, but the KLM/Northwest product should make anyone on a long-haul
flight anywhere in the northern hemisphere think about switching from the
top US, European or Asian airlines.
Perhaps stimulated by KLM/Northwest, the pace of change is quickening. All
Nippon Airlines is increasing the business class seat pitch from 40 to 50
inches, saying that 90 per cent of business travellers cite space and
comfort near the top of their lists of expectations, second only to safety
and reliability. Japan Air Lines quickly countered the move, saying last
month that it would introduce similar 'super executive seats' on routes
between Tokyo and London, Paris and New York.
And in two weeks' time, Air Canada introduces business class seating that
owes a lot to Continental's Business First, perhaps stimulated by the fact
that it is a shareholder in Continental.
These changes come at some cost to the airlines concerned. With
KLM/Northwest there are eight fewer seats on the aircraft, while there has
been a loss of more than one fifth of the upper deck seats on some Boeing
747s.
But the trend will continue, according to Mr Richard Lovell, vice president
for northern Europe and Asia for Wagons-lits Travel, the French-owned
international travel agency. 'My prediction for the rest of the 1990s is
that the traditional cabin classes will be transformed, so that a superior
business class - at business class prices, a full fare economy and a basic
economy will replace the current first, business and economy class cabins.'
The airlines may be unwilling to give up crowded business class cabins
willingly, but they are hard pressed to disagree with the analysis that is
leading them in that direction.
American Airlines, on some measures the biggest in the world, has been
experimenting with putting business class ticket holders into the first
class cabin and moving economy class passengers with full-price tickets into
business. The idea is that the carrier can test the idea without first
refurbishing its aircraft.
Mr Hans Mirka, vice-president of international routes at American Airlines,
says that the experiment is working 'exceedingly well. We are going to go
through the summer and in fall when business travel really picks up, and if
it's a success, you may see more of it.'
When the world's biggest airlines get interested, it is a sure sign that an
idea's time has come. And airline industry research shows why the stakes are
rising.
The air travel recession of the early 1990s, the worst since the second
world war, seems to be ending. The latest Iata business travel survey shows
that although corporate travellers once again have smaller budgets than the
previous year, yet again the decline has slowed.
If the measure is travel rather than budget, the floor has been reached
already. Some 21 per cent of respondents to Iata's survey said that they
were travelling more than they were a year earlier. In 1993, the figure was
18 per cent and in 1992 14 per cent. The proportion reporting a decrease in
travel, on the other hand, has remained steady at 22 per cent or 23 per cent
over the three years.
Increased travelling on smaller budgets suggests that two things are
happening: business travellers are taking advantage of cut price deals in
the class they are travelling, or they are shifting down a class.
Larger companies have continued to bear down the hardest on budgets and
travel, the Iata survey finds. More than one third of the largest companies
 -those with more than 1,000 employees - reported a fall in air travel. Of
companies with fewer than 25 employees, 20 per cent had cut travel budgets,
but 17 per cent had increased them, according to the survey.
Differences around the world point both to regional economic vigour and the
flexibility of the buyer to find a cut-price deal.
North American companies appear more likely to cut both budgets and travel.
It is relatively easy for them to trim travel budgets because domestic US
airlines are falling over each other to cut fares and pare down service to
the kind of 'no-frill' operation run by SouthWest Airlines, one of the most
successful in the US in recent years.
Business air travel in the Asia-Pacific region, on the other hand, is more
buoyant. This is not only a factor of the strength of local economies, but
of the fact that the kind of cut price wars that have ravaged services in
North America are harder to find in Asia. This perhaps helps explain why few
carriers there show any inclination to offer super-sized business-class
seats.
European business air traffic is characterised by big prices and small
seats. Although it is the case that running costs such as air traffic
control and airport charges are relatively high, that may be about to
change.
Swissair is the last of the European majors to treat its business class
passengers well. The seats are 25 inches wide, bigger than many airlines
have in first class long-haul flights, making it easy to use a laptop
computer without banging elbows with your neighbour.
Swissair may be about to be joined by British Airways. The UK carrier is
considering abandoning the standard European short-haul business class
service of 'economy seat plus a hot meal' in favour of offering more space.
BA is such a powerful force in European business air travel than what it
does could be followed quickly by other carriers. The airline could make its
move within months, and then, perhaps, business travellers on short trips
will finally be able to buy the room to sleep or work that they have been
asking for.

FT  20 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities lose ground after turbulent
session - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's stock market, in common with other international markets, suffered
numerous mood swings yesterday as dealers and institutions struggled to come
to terms with the latest shifts in US monetary policy.
At the end of a highly volatile, but curiously subdued session in terms of
customer business, the FT-SE 100 index settled a further 10.2 lower at
3,128.0.
The modest closing fall masked a series of big swings in sentiment in an
equity market influenced primarily by the performance of Wall Street, which
itself mirrored erratic movements in US bonds.
The scene was set for a highly charged opening session as dealers braced
themselves for a bout of expected selling in the wake of the 41-point slide
on the Dow Jones Average on Monday evening, following the 25 basis points
rise in the US Federal funds rate.
In the event, the 100 index kicked off with a modest six point fall,
encouraged by a better-than-expected opening by gilts which started trading
with losses in the region of only a quarter point.
With very few signs of substantial selling from the big institutions share
prices began to rally and the market moved into positive territory within an
hour of the official opening. The FT-SE 100 index reached what was to be the
day's highest level, up 7.3 at 3,145.5.
The rally soon ran out of steam, however, as weakness in equity and bond
markets across Europe, and especially in Germany and France, unnerved London
investors.
At its worst, shortly after midday, the 100 index was down 24.5 with dealers
shaken by the mid-morning slide in gilts where the long dated stocks were
down more than half a point.
Thereafter, it was the performance of Wall Street that called the tune
across Europe. The US market opened firmer and moved more than 20 points
higher after good corporate news from leading US stocks such as Philip
Morris and Chrysler, before running out of steam and displaying a
double-figure fall after London closed.
The day's turnover reached 769.5m shares, well above Monday's 683.5m and
last Friday's 698.8m, but dealers pointed out that daily figures had been
inflated by another big placing of shares in Clyde Petroleum, one of the
smaller UK oil exploration stocks. Clyde alone accounted for almost 60m of
the daily total.
Other features of the days's trading activity included the sale of a block
of 5m RTZ shares by Cazenove, the influential broking house.
Conflicting views by leading food retailing analysts led to heavy two-way
trading in Asda while the integrated oil stocks continued to attract keen
interest.
Trading got under way in shares of Ashanti, the Ghanaian gold mining group,
where Lonrho retains a 43 per cent stake, with London traders reporting
strong support for the stock which settled at a good premium to the Dollars
20 a share issue price.
The head of marketmaking at one big integrated securities firm said the
London market's performance was 'unimpressive; there is a feeling around
that London will go down if we get a rate change and go down if we don't'
Chart analysts pointed out, however, that the emergence of strong support
for the UK equity market as the FT-SE 100 hit the 3,115 was a big bull
point. 'As long as we keep bouncing off that level the market should be able
to make progress,' said one.

FT  20 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lonrho steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mining group Lonrho held firm as Ashanti, the world's richest goldfield and
the group in which Lonrho has a 43 per cent stake, made its market debut.
The shares opened at Dollars 20.60 and, shortly after the official market
closed, they were trading at between Dollars 20.85 and Dollars 21, almost a
dollar above the market forecasts.
That leaves Lonrho with about Dollars 715m (Pounds 490m) against forecasts
of Dollars 600m. However, the market had already prepared itself for the
good news and Lonrho shares closed unchanged at 154p.
Investment interest burgeoned in Rolls-Royce after powerful figures from
Pratt and Whitney painted an optimistic picture for aerospace spare parts.
The fact that the US engines manufacturer reported a jump in sales of spare
parts after pushing up its prices by 5 per cent fuelled excitement among
aerospace analysts.
One said: 'Aerospace stocks are very sensitive to news on spare parts. The
fact that the market has absorbed a price rise by Pratt and Whitney and
sales have increased is very encouraging.'
Turnover of 14m shares passed through the market and Rolls improved 7 to
193p.
A market watcher said that, since aerospace companies were very
inter-related, shares of Rolls could not fail but get a large boost from the
Pratt figures. The optimism was compounded by recently reported good air
traffic figures from BAA, which itself enjoyed further positive sentiment in
the market following traffic figures for March. The shares improved a penny
to 983p.
Food retailers remained under a cloud, with NatWest Securities reiterating
its cautious stance on the sector. The broker underlined continuing concerns
over margins, pointing out that with sales increases proving difficult, cost
cutting remains the main route to growing profits.
Particularly vulnerable, according to NatWest, are Argyll, down 4 at 240p,
and J Sainsbury, off 6 at 359p. The broker is more positive over prospects
for Tesco, down 1 1/2 at 212p and Asda, off 1 3/4 at 56 1/4 p, although the
latter was said to be undermined by a Hoare Govett downgrading.
Discount food retailer Budgens weakened a further 2 to 27p following
Monday's profit warning.
Mostly positive comments from First Leisure on current trading helped the
shares add 2 to 318p. But Smith New Court, fretting over the continuing
weakness in the group's ten-pin bowling business, suggested investors turn
their attention to Rank Organisation, the shares jumping 12 to 430p on 2.3m
traded.
Among stores stocks, Argos was said to have benefited from a buy note from
SG Warburg. The shares climbed 4 to 364p. Similarly bullish noises on
Vendome, up 2 at 460p, were said to be coming from NatWest Securities.
Storehouse steadied after Monday's shock announcement of the resignation of
the Mothercare chief executive. The shares added a penny to 219p, with
NatWest, UBS and Warburg among those pointing out that the groundwork for
recovery had already been laid.
The awarding of a Portuguese bridge contract to a consortium led by
Trafalgar House helped move the shares ahead 2 1/2 to 104p.
Conglomerate BTR gained 7 to 386 1/2 p on unusually heavy turnover of 12m
shares as NatWest Securities added the group to its list of most highly
favoured stocks.
The house now forecasts group profits of Pounds 1.96bn in 1996, up from
Pounds 1.65bn in 1995 and Pounds 1.38bn this year. Dealers said BZW was also
a buyer.
Talk that it was poised to sell its loss-making parcels division helped
transport group NFC add 3 at 241p.
London International fell 8 to 121p after announcing it was to restructure
and refinance. The group said its share of the US branded condom market had
fallen by about 2 per cent over the past year. However, analysts said
pressure on the shares was mitigated by the result of the impending sale of
LIG's photo-processing business, which is expected shortly.
Hong Kong related banks HSBC and Standard Chartered dipped 10 to 757p and 26
to 1054p respectively following a sharp slide in the Hang Seng Index. Cable
and Wireless slipped 10 to 453p.
Merchant bank SG Warburg fell 14 to 738p on a downgrading from BZW.
RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, shed 15 to 835p on turnover of 12m
after Cazenove, the agency broker, confirmed that it had placed a line of 5m
shares in the company at 830p a share.
Encouraging figures from Merck, the big US pharmaceuticals group, gave some
heart to a despondent UK health sector. Merck announced that sales for its
first quarter were up 19 per cent after adjustments. Glaxo bounced 6 to 564p
and SmithKline Beecham improved 8 to 367p ahead of figures tomorrow.
Leading oil stocks held steady in spite of a weaker crude oil price and
market. BP, boosted by company presentations in Scotland, ended the day
unchanged at 386p while Shell Transport dipped 2 to 723p.
Advertising group WPP lifted 3 to regain a two-year high of 129p. The SG
Warburg media team, which had the group as its pick of the year, pointed out
that WPP had outperformed the All-Share Index by 87 per cent over the year
and 20 per cent over the last quarter.
Mobile telecoms group Vodafone was again weak with dealers blaming a stock
overhang. The shares slid 16 to 496p with 5.5m traded.

FT  20 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy turnover in Clyde
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clyde Petroleum was the most heavily traded stock in the London market as
one broker sold 30m shares, equivalent to 7.5 per cent of the company.
The sale was carried out by Clyde's broker, Hoare Govett, and the shares
were taken on at 33p to be placed at 33 1/2 p. After the market closed, it
was announced that George Weston Holdings - the private investment company
of Mr Garry Weston, the chairman of Associated British Foods - had reduced
its stake to 6.86 per cent. The investment group bought a 15.8 per cent
stake from TMOC, the Australian oil company in 1987.
The sale comes just days after US fund management group Fidelity sold 13m
shares, or 3.4 per cent. Clyde's underlying share price held steady at 36p
with final turnover for the day recorded at 58m shares.

FT  20 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fierce volatility threw equity derivatives into turmoil as massive swings of
sentiment coursed through the market, writes Christine Buckley.
The head of derivatives at one broking house said that volatility was
'staggering' and had not been seen in such a frenzied form since the last UK
general election.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 began ascending its rollercoaster track
quite firmly, adding 14 points in early trading after it had opened ahead of
the previous day's close. The big plunge came on upset in the bund market
with the selling so fierce that the contract fell from its intraday high of
3,157 to 3,104 in about two hours.
It mustered a pre-lunch rally before an optimistic opening on Wall Street
sent the next surprise and the contract bounced to 3,150. But nervousness
was quick to return and June fell back to finish at 3,127, trailing the cash
market by several points after taking the fair value carrying costs into
consideration.
Institutions are said to be wary of the extreme volatility with the climate
likely to be enjoyed by only hedge funds. But one market expert cautioned:
'It is impossible to call this market at the moment. No-one knows which way
it is going.'
Options were comparatively quiet with about half of the activity in index
products. Turnover was 35,580 lots.

FT  20 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow in small fall after a
fluctuating session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
After fluctuating through the afternoon, blue-chip stocks showed little
change by yesterday's close, but slumping technology issues pushed the
Nasdaq deep into negative territory, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.60 at 3,619.82, and the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dipped 0.08 to 442.54 on heavy
volume of 323m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite
was 2.90 lower at 431.10, while the Nasdaq composite dropped 7.60 at 712.85.
At the opening bell, investors seemed willing to put the previous session's
41-point decline behind them, despite lingering uneasiness over Monday's
move by the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates for the third time in 10
weeks.
Stocks made steady headway during the morning, buoyed by improvement in the
US Treasury market, which suffered a sharp setback in the wake of the Fed's
tightening move. The benchmark 30-year government security was showing
moderate gains for most of the session.
The turnround partly reflected a favourable interpretation of a widening of
the US trade deficit in February. With a decline in exports contributing to
the trend, it suggested a slowdown in economic growth and an easing of
inflationary pressure, a happy development for fixed-rate investors.
But even the improvement in bonds could not stem the tide of bearish
sentiment in equities. Cyclical issues, linked to the health of the economy,
began to give ground near midday, dropped to nearly 30 points down by
mid-afternoon and then shifted course once again. The Dow components were
nearly evenly divided between winners and losers. Cyclical stocks were
generally weaker. Alcoa fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 65, Caterpillar
Dollars 2 to Dollars 108 3/8 and International Paper Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 62 7/8 .
Encouraging earnings reports buoyed other blue chip issues, including
Disney, up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 41 5/8 and Philip Morris, Dollars 1 5/8
ahead at Dollars 51 5/8 . Union Carbide added Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 25
after releasing its first-quarter results.
But the difficulty in pleasing the high expectations of market was
underlined by Chrysler, which lost Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 48 3/8 , in
spite of posting slightly better-than-expected results. The stock dragged
General Motors down Dollars 2 to Dollars 54 7/8 and Ford Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 56 1/4 .
In telecommunications, Sprint gained Dollars 1 to Dollars 36 on news of a
double-digit increase in operating income. AT&amp;T was Dollars 1 1/4 higher at
Dollars 50 3/4 .
Semiconductors resumed last week's slide. Micron Technologies was down
Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 32 7/8 and Texas Instruments lunged Dollars 3 3/8
to Dollars 66 5/8 .
Among the decliners on the Nasdaq, Intel slipped Dollars 1 to Dollars 57 1/2
and Wellfleet Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 66 1/4 . Canada
Toronto prices continued to fall with the rise of interest rates. The
TSE-300 composite index tumbled 52.99 points, or. 27 per cent, to 4,115.07
compared with a fall of 1.7 per cent on Monday.
The Bank of Canada rate rose 42 basis points to 6.26 per cent today
following the rise in US short-term rates.
Declines swamped advances 656 to 178, volume of 75.26m shares was up
from55.11m, and trading value was CDollars 850.5m compared with CDollars
601.0m.
Mexico
Equities plunged to their lowest close this year on expectations of further
increases in domestic interest rates. The IPC index finished down 72.85
points, or 3.41 per cent, at 2,064.77 points, less than a point above its
session low.
The market's dramatic fall was exacerbated by light volume of 59.6m shares.
More than half the day's turnover reflected trades in heavily-weighted
Telefonos de Mexico, which closed down 3.02 percent in both its A and L
series.

FT  20 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Bad news from Balkans, tax measures hit
Athens - The recent slide in Greek equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bad news from the Balkans and a furore over the Greek government's plans for
fiscal reform are sending tremors through the Athens Stock Exchange.
Last week the general index bottomed at 954.39, down by 20 per cent from its
high of 1,194.58 on January 18, recovering to 992.47 on Monday and easing
slightly again yesterday.
In the Balkans, it was not just NATO air strikes in Bosnia, signalling that
peace in the former Yugoslavia is still far off, which affected the index. A
border incident with Albania, where Greek textiles companies are starting to
transfer production, added to investors' anxieties; and the European Union's
decision to start legal proceedings against Greece over its blockade of the
former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia was another blow.
On top of that, equities have also been troubled by aspects of the socialist
government's fiscal package. In particular, a proposal to tax dividends on
mutual funds' holdings of treasury bills at 15 per cent took the bourse by
surprise.
While earnings on bank deposits are taxed at 15 per cent, interest on
government debt is still tax-free. Greece's flourishing mutual funds, with
assets of Dr1,500bn (Dollars 6bn), are heavily invested in government
securities, currently paying real interest of around 8 per cent.
Apart from upsetting fund managers' investment plans, the measure is
expected to stall mutual fund growth. Fixed income funds, which invest
almost all their assets in treasury bills, are especially hard hit, as there
are few other suitable instruments available locally.
Although not aimed directly at the equity market, the tax proposal has
affected sentiment there. Mr Peter Doukas of Citibank said: 'It's a rather
amateurish way of raising revenues that's going to hold the market back for
a while.'
Still, beneath the outrage voiced by fund managers, the conviction remains
strong that Greece will perform well in the medium term. The queue of
companies waiting for listings has never been longer, with several sectors
of the economy about to be represented for the first time.
Listings by more than 20 companies in the first six months of this year are
forecast to raise over Dr60bn in fresh equity. Rights issues by companies
already listed are projected to total Dr 80bn in the same period.
Following the example of Credit Bank, which raised Dr31bn earlier this
month, including a Dr7.5bn international tranche placed by Barings, Ionian
Bank is planning a similar-sized rights issue.
Intracom, the telecoms equipment manufacturer, also plans to raise at least
Dr20bn, while Intrasoft, its software subsidiary, is to be floated on the
bourse.
However, construction companies are still setting the pace, with more than a
dozen due to be listed by mid-year. They seem undeterred by persistent
rumours that funds from the EU's new structural assistance package may be
delayed, bringing postponements of infrastructure projects in preparation.
Mr Victor Pisante of Telesis Capital says: 'The trend is for other companies
in the same sector to seek listings once someone takes the plunge.
Maintaining competitiveness is an important consideration.'
Other companies preparing for a listing include passenger shipping lines,
software manufacturers, textile producers, a media group and a fish farm.
The biggest issue of all, the listing of 25-30 per cent of OTE, the Greek
state telecoms monopoly, is starting to take shape, with advisers due to be
appointed this month.
Planned for October, the flotation is projected to raise over Dr300bn, of
which the Athens bourse could absorb around Dr100bn, according to government
advisers. The remainder would be offered to European, American and Japanese
investors.
The flotation was originally set for last autumn but fell through when the
conservative government collapsed. The socialists' advisers claim that, with
international appetite for telecoms stocks increasing, the timing is now
better than before.

FT  20 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): US interest rate move
leaves region lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stocks weakened but closed off session lows on afternoon index-linked
buying, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Trading remained quiet throughout the day following a steep fall on Wall
Street after the US Federal Reserve announced a further tightening of
monetary policy.
The Nikkei 225 lost 85.02 to 20,192.34, after a low of 20,119.42 and a high
of 20,300.66.
The Topix index ended down 6.23 at 1,637.01 and the Nikkei 300 shed 1.36 to
299.55. Volume was estimated at 320m shares, down from 387m on Monday.
Traders said that buying by foreign institutions and orders placed by
domestic institutions prevented shares from slipping more sharply.
The 20,500 level is currently regarded as a major barrier for the Nikkei and
investors are waiting for news which could encourage them to drive shares
above that level.
Declining issues outstripped advances with 687 lower, 336 higher and 152
unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.94 to 1,388.41.
Airline, mining, automobile, service and banking sectors led the gains.
Pioneer Electronic rose on bargain-hunting, gaining Y100 to Y2,600 in heavy
turnover. Shares were sought on a perception that they had been left behind
in the recent rally among multimedia-related issues.
Roundup
The rise in US short-term interest rates left the region almost uniformly
lower.
Ms Joanna Shi at Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia noted that the impact on
the Asian economies would be mixed. For Hong Kong and Thailand, the move was
bad news as both countries were effectively pegged to the US dollar and
interest rates would rise automatically in line with those in the US.
'The likely interest move in these two markets,' she said, 'will drain
excess liquidity from the stock market.'
Ms Shi added that for Malaysia, the impact would be minimal as interest
rates were on a different cycle. Singapore's strong economic growth would
lead to interest rates rising regardless of what happened in the US.
'In general, real economic growth is still exceptionally strong in the Asian
region and thus sound fundamentals will support these markets after their
initial fall.'
HONG KONG fell 2.1 per cent, although late bargain hunting by institutional
investors helped to pare losses.
The Hang Seng index sank 202.93 to 9,303.36, having dipped to a low of
9,203.09. Turnover rose to HKDollars 4.30bn.
BANGKOK declined nearly 3 per cent, attributed both to the news from the US
and to profit-taking following a gain of nearly 7 per cent over the last
week. The SET index fell 38.31 to 1,274.02 in turnover of Bt8.2bn against
Monday's Bt9.3bn.
AUSTRALIA was driven down by weaker bonds and futures and bearish overseas
markets. The All Ordinaries index lost more than 20 points in the first 10
minutes of trade before ending 34.5 down at 2,061.4.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index fell 18.07 to 2,221.00, prompting
the view that the market was likely to consolidate in the short term,
although it will remain underpinned by a strong economy and healthy
corporate earnings growth.
SEOUL finished down in very thin trade after brief early gains were
overwhelmed by a round of profit-taking in blue chips. The composite index
lost 6.30 to 885.85 in volume of 24.6m shares, compared with the recent
average of 35m.
TAIWAN edged slightly lower in active trade on profit-taking after Monday's
rally. The weighted index fell 14.38 to 5,675.75 in turnover of TDollars
58.9bn. Profit-taking was seen in financials and steels, which gained most
recently.
NEW ZEALAND took its lead from falls in other markets and the NZSE 40
Capital index fell 37.41 to 2,104.70 in moderate turnover of NZDollars 45m.
BOMBAY ended lower ahead of a public holiday today and the end of the
account tomorrow. The BSE 30-share index fell 36.62 to 3,830.29.
MANILA finished higher in spite of a fall during the morning session. The
composite index added 5.82 to 2,825.93.
Gains were led by Manila Electric B shares which jumped 12.50 pesos to 510
pesos.
Volume eased to 838.2m shares compared to Monday's 1.3bn shares, while
turnover increased to 1bn pesos from 966.5m pesos.
KARACHI rose on the first day of the new account with most of the activity
concentrated on the major blue chip issues. The KSE 100-share index rose
28.01 or 1.1 per cent to 2,525.48 as volume rose to 12.2m shares from 9.8m.

FT  20 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses in rebound after
intraday drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An early rally on Wall Street repaired some of the damage sustained by
bourses earlier yesterday after the Fed's latest rate increase, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT offered a delayed, but severe reaction to the Fed as June bund
futures fell though a key support level. In addition, rumours flew late in
the session about Deutsche Bank, its employees and the conditions under
which loans to the Jurgen Schneider property concern were made.
The Dax index, unworried in the pre-bourse, fell 56.36 or 2.5 per cent to
2,172.42 on the session as turnover eased only slightly from DM11.9bn to
DM11.2bn.
A rebound in bunds, short covering and bargain hunting allowed the Dax to
recover, after hours, to an Ibis-indicated 2,193.89. Deutsche Bank first
fell DM30.50, or 3.9 per cent to DM748 and then recovered to DM758.50 in the
afternoon.
Meanwhile Allianz, the insurer, was unsullied by rumour but depressed by its
reputation for high volatility, financial sector unfashionableness and its
sheer weight in the Dax index. The shares dropped DM140, or 5.3 per cent to
DM2,520 on the session, recovering to DM2,575 after hours.
PARIS saw the CAC-40 index fall to a session low of 2,117 before it closed
off 24.08, or 1.1 per cent at 2,135.98.
Pechiney International saw one of the steepest losses, losing FFr19.50 to
FFr180 as the packaging group disappointed with its 1993 results and
expectations of no improvement in prospects this year.
Gan fell FFr15.90 to FFr406.10, also affected by negative reaction to its
1993 figures. The market had been looking for profits between
FFr500m-FFr700m and the insurer came in with FFr414m.
AMSTERDAM remained uneasy following Monday's news from the Fed and the AEX
index shed 4.98 or 1.2 per cent to 416.45. However, the market picked up
after a late recovery in bond markets.
CS First Boston issued an overweight recommendation on Dutch equities, and
said that it was looking at a possible 11 per cent rise in the index by
year-end. Its reasons included: the prospect of low inflation; and higher
economic growth than previously forecast, leading to an upswing in corporate
earnings.
Philips, which bore the brunt of heavy selling in the options exchange,
recovered from a day's low of Fl 54.50 to close off Fl 1.60 at Fl 55.40.
MILAN picked up from its lows as some tentative domestic buying emerged
after Monday's profit-taking. The Comit index fell 16.42 or 2.1 per cent to
765.18.
The market's recent weakness prompted Actinvest, the independent research
group, to reduce the equity weight of its portfolio further from 50 per cent
to 35 per cent, having come back from 60 per cent last week. The group noted
that the market had increased swiftly, peaking close to its target for 1994,
before taking a much needed pause. However, negative news on the formation
of the government could transform the technical rest into a significant
correction.
Against the trend, Ferruzzi rose L115 or 4.5 per cent to L2,444. Fiat,
viewed as a barometer of the market, picked up from lows to finish L29 down
at L6,309.
Ciga, the hotel chain, soared L79 or 5.6 per cent to L1,239 on expectations
that a public offering will be made for Ciga shares in the near future.
ZURICH was led lower by weak banks, under pressure from falling interest
rate futures, although the market steadied as Wall Street opened. The SMI
index finished down 32.0 at 2,837.1 after a low of 2,826.6.
UBS lost SFr32 or 2.6 per cent to SFr1,212, SBC dropped SFr9 to SFr425 and
CS Holding fell SFr12 to SFr621.
Roche certificates finished SFr65 lower at SFr7,020, having tested the
psychologically important SFr7,000 level, in spite of its announcement that
1993 group net profit advanced 29 per cent, in line with expectations, and
that it planned to raise the dividend.
Ciba bearers lost SFr27 to SFr918 francs, while Sandoz dipped SFr20 to
SFr3,855, its 1 per cent rise in first quarter sales disappointing some
analysts.
MADRID moved from sickness to precarious health as the general index
recovered 2.80 to 313.60 after a low of 305.47. Turnover was Pta34.6bn.
In banks, Popular rose Pta570, or 3.9 per cent to Pta15,140, lifted by its
first quarter results and its decision not to bid for Banesto.
WARSAW rallied for the second consecutive session, with the WIG index
showing a 6 per cent gain to 1,124.9.

FT  20 APR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar fails to rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continued trade and political uncertainty in Japan put a dampener on the
dollar yesterday despite the 25 basis points increase in US short-term
interest rates on Monday, writes Philip Gawith.
The US currency closed in London nearly two pfennigs lower at DM1.701 from
DM1.7202 on Thursday. It was also weaker against the yen, finishing at
Y103.215 from Y103.625.
Most analysts remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the dollar,
but sentiment is becoming increasingly uncertain as investors despair at
what is required to boost the US currency.
The D-Mark was the beneficiary of dollar weakness. Today the German currency
may come under pressure when the Bundesbank announces the extent to which it
has allowed the repo rate to fall in the weekly securities repurchase
auction.
Elsewhere, the Bank of Portugal lowered its emergency lending rate to 12 per
cent from 13 per cent, signalling the beginning of a return to normality
following a few weeks when the escudo was under attack.
The dollar has remained under pressure ever since the resignation earlier
this month of Japan's prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa. Delay in
appointing a successor has aggravated concerns about whether a new
government will be able to make progress in resolving Japan's damaging trade
dispute with the US.
Sentiment was not helped by the release of US February trade figures showing
that the overall deficit, including goods and services, widened to Dollars
9.7bn from a revised Dollars 6.6bn in January.
Dealers said the dollar was also under pressure from Japanese exporters
selling the dollar to meet yen requirements. Some had held off converting
their dollar receipts as the US currency weakened recently, but decided to
change them when it appeared the dollar's downside risk had risen.
Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, said: 'What the dollar needs is
the conviction in the bond and equity markets that the Fed is doing enough
to combat inflation.' Currently, there was confusion both about what the Fed
was doing, and what it was achieving.
Mr Mark Austin, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, said the risks
for the dollar are on the downside. 'People are starting to say: What else
do we need to take the dollar higher, and there is nothing obvious on the
horizon.'
The weak dollar spilled over into D-Mark strength across the board.
Investors often return to the D-Mark in times of uncertainty.
The French franc closed at FFr3.429 against the D-Mark from FFr3.422, but
was later trading at FFr3.4350, below its old ERM floor of FFr3.4305. Part
of this weakness is attributable to anticipation that the Bank of France may
cut interest rates at its council meeting on Thursday.
Mr Brian Hilliard, senior international economist at SGST, said recent
industrial relations setbacks had also knocked some of the shine off the
policies of Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister.
The amount of any French rate cut is likely to be determined by the extent
to which the Bundesbank cuts the repo rate today. Call money remained fairly
easy yesterday at 5.50/5.60 per cent, below the current repo rate of 5.7 per
cent. Market predictions are that the repo rate could fall by as much as 10
basis points.
In the futures market the June euromark contract finished three basis points
firmer at 94.69, but the longer contracts lost ground.
Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International, said by cutting
rates the Bank of Portugal was 'testing how much of an interest rate cut the
currency can tolerate.' She said the central bank had chosen a slightly
awkward day, as the peseta was weaker and the two currencies normally track
each other.
With the escudo having stayed fairly stable yesterday - it closed at Es102.1
against the D-Mark from Es101.8 - the IBJ analyst predicted further cuts as
the central bank tries to return to pre-crisis interest rates. The emergency
rate was then at 10 per cent.
Sterling finished over a pfennig down against the stronger D-Mark, closing
at DM2.5144 from DM2.5288. In the money markets, the Bank of England
provided late assistance of about Pounds 415m after declaring a revised
shortage of Pounds 1.15bn. Earlier it had put Pounds 522m of liquidity into
the system. Overnight rates were in the 5-10 per cent range.
In the futures market, the June short sterling contract closed 4 basis
points up at 94.75, but the prices of longer contracts fell.
Investors responded enthusiastically to news that the mainly Zulu Inkatha
Freedom Party has decided to contest next week's elections in South Africa.
The commercial rand firmed by 3 per cent to R3.5575 against the dollar from
R3.6605. The financial rand, the investment currency, closed 8 per cent
higher at R4.915 from R5.345.

FT  20 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ farmers find life after
subsidies surprisingly rewarding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farming without subsidies can be good for farmers and the environment, as
well as the taxpayer and the consumer.
That is the message that New Zealand farmers, who have operated without
subsidies for 10 years, will take to the World Farmers' Congress in Istanbul
next month.
It is timely for agriculture worldwide, given the requirement under the
Uruguay Round agreement that trade-distorting domestic support for farmers
be cut by up to 20 per cent over six years.
Mr Graham Robertson, president of Federated Farmers of New Zealand, the
national farmers' organisation, explained the sea-change in agricultural
policy and farmers' attitudes during a visit to London yesterday.
He said government support had become anathema to rural New Zealand. 'The
real challenge in the long run is for farmers to get government right out of
the job. . . Markets are more reliable than politicians and governments.'
New Zealand is an agricultural powerhouse, and Mr Robertson stressed that
reform in other countries would be different. It exports 50 per cent of the
world's trade in sheep meat. Agricultural produce accounts for 60 per cent
of exports, and farming and agribusiness employ 11 per cent of the
workforce.
Subsidies, which accounted for nearly 40 per cent of farmers' gross income,
were withdrawn in 1984. The consequences, exacerbated by deep recession,
were painful, though less so than expected.
About 800 farms, or 1 per cent of the total, failed, against predictions
that 8,000 would go under. Farmers leaving the land were given a one-off
'exit grant' equivalent to about two-thirds of their annual income.
The number of full-time farm workers fell from about 22,800 in 1984 to
19,600 in 1987, but then recovered to 23,300 in 1991.
The withdrawal of subsidies, coupled with labour deregulation, pushed down
farm costs. Stripping out interest rate cuts, net costs to sheep farmers had
risen by only 1.2 to 1.5 per cent a year in the past three years, said Mr
Robertson.
Meanwhile, prices for produce rose. Last season farmers earned NZDollars
35-NZDollars 45 for a 13.5kg lamb carcass, compared with NZDollars
18-NZDollars 20 in the mid-1980s. The improvement had come mainly from more
efficient processing and better marketing.
Mr Robertson said the reforms had also been good for the environment, ending
wasteful use of fertilisers.
Subsidies had encouraged production on unstable hill country. 'One of the
consequences of the withdrawal of support is that agriculture has
intensified on the better land and the higher hills have now been planted
with trees,' he said.
Public derision of farmers had changed to 'respect and even admiration'.
Some sectors, such as dairying, had fared better than others. Agricultural
supply industries had had 'a blowtorch put on them'.
Meat processing, once heavily regulated and licensed, had found adaptation
hard. But it had moved from being the least efficient national meat industry
in the world to second most efficient, Mr Robertson said.

FT  20 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lac withdraws from Chilean
copper mine bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING and KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Codelco, the state-owned Chilean mining group, yesterday faced further
embarrassment over the sale El Abra, one of the world's biggest undeveloped
copper deposits, when Lac Minerals of Canada withdrew from the project.
Lac said it would transfer its interest in El Abra to its partner, Cyprus
Amax Minerals of the US, if the partners' bid for 51 per cent of El Abra was
successful.
Nevertheless, Mr Juan Villarzu, Codelco's new president, said his group
would continue to negotiate with Cyprus.
Cyprus-Lac last year offered Dollars 555m for the 51 per cent stake and
estimated it would require investment of Dollars 1bn for a mine to produce
225,000 tonnes of copper a year. But in February the partners delayed
signing the contract, saying test work showed ore grades at El Abra might be
significantly lower than originally estimated.
Mr Juan Villarzu said yesterday that Cyprus still had until May 15 to
continue testing, by which time the US group would have to make its position
clear. He did not rule out the possibility of Codelco accepting a lower bid.
'If they made an alternative offer, we would have to evaluate it at that
time. . . when the bid is on the table,' he said
Mr Villarzu backed away from earlier statements by Codelco, threatening to
sue Cyprus-Lac if they reneged on the original offer.
He stressed that 'no contracts have been signed by either side'.
However, Codelco will come under pressure from Magma Copper of the US and
Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's biggest company, if the deal with
Cyprus is not concluded. Mr Burgess Winter, Magma's president, said recently
that, under the rules of the tender, failure to conclude a deal with the
highest bidder was to have resulted automatically in the start of
negotiations with the underbidder.
Magma-BHP bid Dollars 240m for the El Abra stake, Dollars 10m ahead of RTZ
of the UK. He said the gap between the two highest bids reflected the fact
that Magma-BHP's test work suggested that El Abra could support annual
output of 160,000 tonnes, against the 225,000 tonnes looked for by the
highest bidders.
Yesterday's withdrawal by Lac suggests the Canadian company has come to a
similar conclusion about El Abra's production potential. As a gold company
attempting to jump into base metals mining, it may well feel that El Abra no
longer looks big enough. Cyprus, meanwhile, already has copper, coal and
gold as core operations.
Mr Villarzu said that Codelco had not yet decided whether to begin
negotiations automatically with Magma-BHP or to start a new round of bidding
if the Cyprus offer proved unacceptable.
Controversy has dogged the El Abra sale, the first disposal of a big ore
body by the group and supposed to set a pattern for other privatisations. Mr
Villarzu admitted that there were shortcomings to Codelco's auction process,
in which consortia were publicly ranked, and negotiations started with the
top-placed bidder. 'The experience we have had. . . suggests that, if we had
to do it again, we would revise the procedure in some respects,' Mr Villarzu
said.
Lac said the financial cost of its withdrawal was 'not material'. It
suggested Cyprus would complete further technical studies by May 15, in time
for further negotiations with Codelco.

FT  20 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbean growers stand by
their bananas - EU sales are threatened but other crops hold little
attraction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the face of continuing challenges to the European Union's banana regime
by Latin American exporters, Caribbean producers, who benefit from a
protected market, are preparing for an uncertain future by trying to
increase their efficiency.
The governments of the four Windward Islands - Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia
and St Vincent - the major suppliers to the UK, are seeking Dollars 60m to
cut production costs and put their industry in a better position to compete
with more efficient Latin American producers.
Farm leaders and trade ministers in the region are examining the more
intractable problems that have bedeviled efforts to promote agricultural
diversification in an attempt to reduce the islands' dependence on bananas
by replacing the fruit with crops that can find an equally lucrative market.
It is readily admitted, however, that there will be no immediate relief,
either through improved productivity or alternative products, if the four
islands were to quickly lose their preferential access to the European
market. Economic planners say agriculture, and mainly bananas, will continue
to be the basis of several of the islands' economies. The factors that have
made Windward Island bananas more costly than the Latin fruit are the very
reasons diversification is proving difficult.
The governments are hoping that if they can get the funds to increase
productivity and improve marketing, they will be able to lift farm yield
from the current levels of eight tonnes of exportable produce per acre and
closer to the average 18 tonnes in Latin America.
'As it now stands, even though the Windward Islands have preferential access
to the European market, they are one of the highest cost producers, and if
something is not done to reduce those costs, they are going to lose the
market,' says Mr Marius St Rose, a vice president of the Caribbean
Development Bank.
Funding for the programme is being sought by the Windward governments from
the bank and from the European Union. The intention is to improve the
quality of bananas and reduce the cost of production by 20 to 25 per cent
over three years.
Improving productivity of bananas now appears an easier task than getting
the islands' farmers to turn to other crops. Attempts at diversification
have met with little success. Farmers are reluctant to change to new crops
with which they have had little experience and for which they might not be
able to find a market as lucrative as that for bananas.
'One of the problems with farming bananas in this part of the world is that
the entire industry can be flattened overnight by a storm or a hurricane,' a
St Lucian government official explains.
But he points out that bananas 'are the only crop we know of which can be
replanted immediately andproduce for export in a few months'.
Farmers operate on small plots in often difficult terrain not serviced by
basic infrastructure such as farm roads. Transportation costs are high, and
production costs are compounded by the inability of the farmers to achieve
any benefits of scale in purchasing inputs such as chemicals.
'There is insufficient interest in non-traditional crops and this has
constrained efforts at diversification,' says Mr Collin Bully, programme
manager for the Agricultural Diversification Co-ordinating Unit of the
Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States. 'Diversification is not
necessarily meant to replace dominant crops. Successful diversification
needs macro-economic framework including comprehensive land settlement and
institutions to provide extension services, marketing and technical
services.'
Farmers' reluctance to change is also rooted in their conviction that no
alternative crop will be able to provide them with the level of earnings
they have been getting from protected bananas.
They are yet to be convinced that there is a market in either North America
or Europe for an alternative product that would allow them to maintain their
standard of living. For most of the non-traditional crops that have been
suggested, ranging from mangoes to horticulture, the major markets are
already being supplied.
Changing from being primary producers to processors also presents the
islands with a similar problem. 'Small eastern Caribbean islands cannot
compete with large scale producers in other countries,' says Mr Ken Boyea,
managing director of the East Caribbean Group of Companies, which owns
several agribusiness ventures. 'We have been moving into processing and
getting out of primary production, but is difficult to get people to leave
bananas and do anything else. They fear changing to a product for which
there is no market.'

<TEXT>
COCOA futures dropped sharply at the London Commodity Exchange, pressured by
heavy investment fund liquidation in New York. The July position closed at
Pounds 900 a tonne, down Pounds 18.
At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices staged a late rally as an earlier
fall fuelled by fund liquidation revealed strong support near Dollars 1,800
a tonne for three months delivery. The price ended after hours 'kerb'
trading at Dollars 1,892 a tonne, up Dollars 7.
The precious metal sector's complexion changed dramatically when the
Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party agreed to participate in next week's South
African elections. London GOLD closed Dollars 4.90 down at Dollars 372.80 as
troy ounce, the lowest since early December.

FT  20 APR 94 / Government Bonds: European sector falls as traders digest US
rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's government bond markets fell sharply yesterday morning, as traders
and investors continued to digest Monday's unexpected rise in US interest
rates.
Although the European markets edged up slightly at the opening, government
bond futures quickly reversed direction and tumbled again, breaking through
key support levels which then triggered further selling.
The German government bond futures contract on Liffe, which opened at 95.51,
tumbled more than a point in the morning as it dropped from its early high
of 95.62 to a mid-morning low of 94.40.
However, the bund market gradually clawed back some of the losses, ending
the day at around 94.93.
Given that the bund market is choosing to take its direction from the US at
present, bond analysts pointed out that the Bundesbank's repo today may not
make much difference to market sentiment.
Mr Kit Juckes, international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, said
that he expected a cut of between 5 and 8 basis points at the repo.
Other analysts pointed out that a small cut, for example in the region of
only 3 basis points, could simply provide more bad news for the European
markets.
Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets in
London, said: 'There's a lot of nervousness. Investors are not even looking
for the troughs for buying opportunities at the moment (and) there's not
even any bargain-hunting on fundamentals.'
French government bonds ended half a point down on the day, with the Matif's
notional futures contract falling from its opening level of 121.50 to a low
of 120.36 before settling at 121.04.
The weakness of the French franc against the D-Mark is proving an additional
worry for the French government bond market.
Traders point out that the Bank of France is far less likely to cut interest
rates this week if the French franc remains weak, especially since at 3.4315
francs to the D-Mark, it is now outside its former ERM band.
'The European bond markets are geared up for a rise in US interest rates,
and the fact that Europe is behind (the US) in the business cycle means they
are expecting to see a follow-through eventually, with rises in European
interest rates,' said Mr Michael Burke, economist at Citibank.
UK government bonds performed better than the other European markets, helped
primarily by a favourable auction announcement. In spite of a volatile
trading session, which at one point saw gilt futures down by more than a
point, the market ended little changed on the day.
The Bank of England announced that it would auction Pounds 2bn of the 6 per
cent Treasury stock due 1999 next Wednesday, April 27.
Gilt analysts said the market was relieved at the smaller than expected size
of the auction. They added that there should be good demand for this
particular stock, both from UK and foreign investors.
The 6 per cent gilt due 1999 is currently trading at around 93, giving a
yield of 7.46 per cent.
The US Treasury market was firmer in light trading yesterday as traders
sifted through the implications of Monday's interest rate increase and the
subsequent sell-off in bonds.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/2 better
at 86 9/16 . The yield slipped to 7.366 per cent, still 8 basis points
higher than at the opening of trading the previous session. The two-year
note was unchanged at 98 31/32 , with the yield holding at 5.673 per cent.
With US bonds slumping in London before trading opened in New York, prices
showed further erosion as the session got under way. Traders were reluctant
to step in and buy on the heels of the central bank's third increase in its
target Federal Funds rate in the last 10 weeks.
But the market began to pick up support at mid-morning after a shred of
favourable economic news was released.
The Commerce Department said the US trade deficit had widened in February to
Dollars 12.36bn, from Dollars 10.17bn in the previous month. A big drop in
US exports was partly to blame. Traders interpreted the decline as a good
signal for bonds because it suggested a slowing of economic growth during
the month and an easing of inflationary pressure.
Many traders are now expecting an additional increase in short-term rates
sometime before the next meeting of the Fed's policy-making arm on May 17.

The London Stock Exchange yesterday made a strong pitch for Chinese
companies to consider dual listings in both Hong Kong and London.
Mr Nigel Atkinson, head of listings in London, said in Beijing that Chinese
companies seeking capital abroad could 'get two listings for the price of
one' in Hong Kong and London, since listing requirements on the two
exchanges were complementary.
The London Stock Exchange conducted a one-day seminar, attended by Chinese
stock regulators and securities representatives, to promote its attractions
as a centre for international listings.
London lists 480 international companies, three times as many as New York
and four times as many as Tokyo. It accounts for 60 per cent of world trade
in international securities, Mr Atkins said.
Mr Atkinson said the London Stock Exchange was open to various options,
including primary, secondary or dual listings. No Chinese company has yet
listed in London, but three bond issues are being traded.
The Beijing listings seminar follows a visit to China last month by Sir
Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the London Stock Exchange. Sir Andrew signed
a memorandum of understanding with the Shanghai Stock Exchange aimed at
facilitating contacts and exchanges of information.
China's Securities Regulatory Commission has approved the listing abroad of
22 companies, of which several are expected to seek listings in New York.
Over the past year six mainland companies have been listed in Hong Kong.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Bonds: L-Bank in DM2bn global issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
L-Bank defied volatile bund market conditions to issue its long-awaited
five-year global bond yesterday.
The recently renamed development agency of the German state of
Baden-Wurttemberg launched DM2bn of bonds due May 1999, to be priced today
at a spread of 34 to 37 basis points above the Treuhand notes due January
1999. Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Salomon Brothers were joint leads.
'I was a bit surprised they decided to come to the market while it was still
so choppy,' said one Frankfurt syndicate manager. However, he added that,
after the issue had been widely flagged in roadshows earlier this year, 'the
whole thing would have lost momentum if it hadn't come soon'.
Another dealer welcomed L-Bank's decision to issue DM2bn, rather than the
widely expected DM3bn. Most syndicate sources deemed the pricing of the deal
to be very fair, although they warned that the ongoing buyers' strike could
make it slow to place.
Despite widespread investor abstinence, the lead managers reported a steady
flow of orders, especially from east Asian and US accounts.
In the Canadian dollar sector, the Kingdom of Sweden issued CDollars 200m of
8 1/4 per cent bonds due December 1999. The bonds closed at 99.59, just
below their 99.62 fixed re-offer price, but the spread widened to 31 - 33
basis points over the corresponding Canadian government note, from 28 basis
points at issue, traders said.
Lead manager Daiwa Europe reported good demand from European and east Asian
investors attracted by the high coupon. However, some dealers felt the deal
was badly timed, with many investors avoiding the dollar bloc amid
nervousness over US interest rates.
Dewan Salman Fibre, Pakistan's biggest producer of polyester fibre and its
second-largest listed company, issued Dollars 45m of seven-year convertible
bonds via Citicorp and Crosby Securities. The bonds carry an indicated
semi-annual coupon of 4 3/4 to 5 per cent with a conversion premium of 8 to
12 per cent. According to one of the lead managers, this compares favourably
with recent Indian convertibles carrying 2 1/2 to 3 per cent coupons and
premiums of around 15 per cent.
Argentina plans a Dollars 2bn global bond, Euronote and peso note borrowing
programme later this year, writes John Barham from Buenos Aires.
Mr Joaquin Cottani, finance under-secretary, said the government 'will
follow last December's successful Dollars 1bn global bond with a new Dollars
1bn global bond in the second half of the year, a mid-term Euronote or
Treasury bill programme and Dollars 500m in peso T-bills.'
Mr Cottani said the government will this year target Argentina's domestic
investor base more than international investors as in previous years.
Private pension funds, which will begin operating in July, are expected to
be big buyers of government paper.
He said the government will spend about Dollars 7bn this year servicing its
Dollars 70bn debt, most of which is in dollars.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong has begun the search for corporate regulators to replace the two
most senior officials at the Securities and Futures Commission, the colony's
corporate watchdog, both of whom have decided to step down.
Mr Robert Nottle, SFC chairman, will leave the commission at the end of this
year when his contact expires and return to Australia. Mr Robert Gilmore,
his deputy, plans to return to the private sector next year.
Mr Michael Cartland, secretary for financial services, said the government
hoped a local Chinese could be found to replace Mr Nottle. The government
hoped to be able to announce an appointment by October this year.
However, if the government wants its candidate to serve beyond mid-1997  -
when China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong - it will have to consult
Beijing on the appointment. At present, the SFC chairman has wide powers to
investigate corporate wrong-doing.
A commission spokesman said an international search would be conducted.
'Much of the chairman's work is focused on the integration of Hong Kong's
financial market with the mainland. An ability to speak Chinese would be an
asset,' he said.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: PaineWebber drops 22% in first
term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PaineWebber, the big US securities house, yesterday reported a 22 per cent
decline in first-quarter profits to Dollars 55.6m, or 70 cents a share. The
fall in earnings was attributed to lower revenues from trading and
investment banking and higher employee compensation and other expenses.
Like many other Wall Street firms, PaineWebber's earnings power has been
diluted in recent months because volatile financial markets and higher US
interest rates have eaten into trading and underwriting profits.
The firm reported a 9 per cent decline in principal transactions (trading)
revenues to Dollars 183.8m, and a 4 per cent drop in investment banking
revenues to Dollars 97.6m. On the trading side, sharp increases in US
interest rates during the quarter took a particular toll of fixed-income
revenues.
Other lines of business, however, remained strong. Brokerage commissions
rose 16 per cent to Dollars 280.6m, and revenues from asset management
jumped 25 per cent to Dollars 91.4m. Growth in asset management revenues and
in total assets under control - which rose 11 per cent to Dollars 136.9bn -
helped boost recurring fees by 25 per cent over the year, so that 54 per
cent of the firm's fixed costs are now covered by recurring fee income,
compared with 47 per cent a year ago.
PaineWebber's total profits, however, declined in the latest quarter, partly
because of a 14 per cent increase in non-interest expenses to Dollars
659.3m. The increase was linked to the hiring of more employees, especially
brokers.

quarter

<TEXT>
Lockheed, the US defence group, yesterday reported a 21 per cent increase in
first-quarter net earnings.
It attributed the improved performance mainly to good results in its
aeronautical systems and electronic systems divisions.
The company made Dollars 92m, or Dollars 1.45 a share, compared with Dollars
76m, or Dollars 1.22 a share, in the same period of last year.
Revenues totalled Dollars 3bn, up 21 per cent on last year's Dollars 2.5bn.
Mr Daniel Tellep, chairman, said that the company had also produced
'significant positive cashflow and continued the rapid improvement in our
financial position'.
The company had generated net free cashflow after dividends of more than
Dollars 240m. At the end of the period, its net debt-to-capital ratio was 38
per cent, down from 48 per cent a year ago.
Programmes which had particularly strong first-quarter results included the
F-16 fighter, the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and the F-22, the
new-generation fighter under development.
The total backlog at the end of the quarter was Dollars 28.2bn, down from
Dollars 28.9bn at the end of December.
Business other than US defence contracts rose to 39 per cent of sales at the
end of the quarter, compared with 34 per cent a year ago.
This amount included the group's sales to foreign governments, which made up
16 per cent of total revenues, compared with 10 per cent a year ago.

Anglovaal
</HEADLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The continued improvement in the rand gold price helped compensate for lower
yields in the Anglovaal group's four gold producers, as after tax profit for
the quarter to end-March increased to R70m (Dollars 19.1m)) from R67.1m in
the preceding three months.
The group's mines received an average price of R41,525 a kg compared with
R39,691 in the December quarter.
Total gold output declined slightly to 10,162kg from 10,609kg.
The bulk of profits again came from group flagship Hartebeestfontein, which
raised its taxed income to R62.9m in the quarter, despite a dip in yield and
higher unit costs.
The results were helped by the state's share of profit no longer being
payable in the January quarter.
Loraine, the group's marginal mine, continued to struggle. After-tax profit
dropped to R440,000 following a R2.9m profit in the previous quarter as the
mine suffered from a decline in output when its continuous work week had to
be broken for the Christmas holidays.
The amount of gold produced declined to 1,454kg from 1,535kg.
Eastern Transvaal Consolidated boosted working profit to R10.3m from R9.2m
but taxed income declined to R5.9m from R6.1m in the previous quarter,
largely as a result of an increased tax burden,
The group's smallest producer, Village Main, benefited from its lack of
forward commitments and improved profit after capital expenditure was
reduced to R799,000 from R671,000.
Chief executive Mr Rob Wilson said that he was generally satisfied with the
group's performance but stressed the need for further cost containment at
Eastern Transvaal Consolidated.
He added that he was optimistic that the situation at Loraine would soon
improve once technical problems had been solved and recently uncovered
higher grade ore could be properly exploited.
The company continued to make extensive use of hedging, but Mr Wilson noted
that the additional use of gold option transactions, which allow mines to
receive 70 per cent of any further increase in the rand spot price, gave the
group greater flexibility in dealing with price fluctuations.

Reliance Industries, the chemicals and textiles conglomerate which is
India's biggest private sector company, yesterday announced a 79 per cent
increase in net profits to Rs5.76bn (Dollars 184m) for the year to March 31,
due to sharp increases in sales and production capacity.
Reliance, which completed a Dollars 300m global depository receipt equity
issue in February, its third international offering, posted a 30 per cent
increase in sales to Rs53.46bn from Rs41.06bn.
Operating profits increased by 20 per cent to Rs10.59bn from Rs8.81bn, and
cash profit to Rs8.28bn from Rs6.02bn. Total expenditure rose to Rs44.04bn
from Rs32.93bn.
Mr Anil Ambani, joint managing director, said the company's results, which
had shown 'an improved performance on all major indicators', also reflected
the changes in depreciation norms recently announced by the Indian
government which, he said, were 'now in line with international standards
prevalent in this industry. Thus these changes will truly reflect the life
of our assets and a fair charge on the profit and loss account in our
business.'
The company - which has more than 2.6m shareholders, the largest
shareholding group in India - reported that earnings per share would
increase by 60 per cent to Rs21.24 from Rs13.24 in spite of a 12 per cent
growth in equity capital to Rs2.71bn from Rs2.42bn.
The Bombay-based company started 35 years ago as an integrated textiles
business, adding synthetic fibres, fabrics, chemicals and plastics, and most
recently, oil and gas production.
The group launched India's largest corporate fundraising exercise last year.
Reliance raised Rs8.6bn from the Indian public, the first slice of a
Rs21.7bn convertible bond issue for a new company, Reliance Petroleum, which
plans to construct a Rs51.4bn oil refinery, India's largest private sector
investment to date.

Perlis Plantations, the diversified Malaysia-based group controlled by
Malaysian Chinese businessman Mr Robert Kuok, has announced pre-tax profits
for the year ending December 31 1993 of MDollars 268m (USDollars 99m), a 14
per cent rise on the previous year's figure, writes Kieran Cooke.
Group turnover in 1993 rose 3.5 per cent to MDollars 3.45bn. Perlis has been
moving out of the plantations business and using much of its large land bank
for housing projects.
It is also developing a number of big leisure complexes in Malaysia.
Last year Perlis became involved in a multi-million dollar project to build
a power station in Malaysia under the country's independent power producer
programme.
However, the company withdrew from the project after certain unspecified
disagreements with the venture's partners.

Falcon Cable TV of the US has acquired a 40 per cent stake in Asianet
Satellite Communications, a Madras-based television network, to help expand
the Indian company's Rs1.2bn (Dollars 38m) multi-channel regional language
cable network, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi.
Falcon will invest nearly Rs600m in Asianet and provide state-of-the-art
technology to expand Asianet's year-old network to 50 channels, primarily in
three south Indian regional languages.
Asianet beams its programmes off Russian satellite Ekran M, and has a unique
cabling system, which uses Kerala state's electricity poles for trunk
cabling.
Falcon, the 12th largest cable company in the US with 1.1m subscribers in 27
states, hopes to bring its expertise in the latest fibre optic cable
technology to India eventually.
Although the Indian government has not officially deregulated television,
satellite networks such as Star TV from Hong Kong have captured nearly 20m

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Five-minute film service planned
for next year
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A company that can download a full-length feature film in five minutes by
satellite to specially-adapted video recorders is planning to launch its
movie service in Japan, the US, and Europe next year.
Mr Will Graven, chairman of EMC3 International Holdings, said yesterday he
has signed letters of intent with seven Japanese and Korean video recorder
manufacturers, with three more agreements in the pipeline.
Mr Graven has been working on his concept of creating an 'electronic video
store in the sky' for more than six years, and now believes he is close to
pulling it off.
Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics group, is the latest video recorder
manufacturer to sign a letter of intent, express excitement about the idea
and agree to explore and finalise a standard before preparing to
manufacture.
Under the EMC3 concept of providing 'near real-time' videos, a customer
orders a title from a catalogue by telephone or key pad and it is delivered
by satellite in a digital 'electronic burst'.
The machine, which is likely to cost around Dollars 250 more than a
conventional video recorder at the outset, slows down the 'five-minute'
recording to provide 100 minutes of viewing time.
Macrovision, the anti-piracy specialist, is a minority shareholders in EMC3
and its system will be used to prevent illegal copying.

Two of south-east Asia's wealthiest businessmen, Mr Robert Kuok and Mr Liem
Sioe Liong, are teaming up to develop a series of sugar plantations and
refining operations in the south of the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
Mr Kuok, a Malaysian Chinese, controls a global business empire with
interests ranging from housing schemes and beach resorts to ownership of a
controlling interest in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper
group.
Mr Liem, an Indonesian Chinese, is generally regarded as Indonesia's richest
businessman with interests ranging from cement manufacturing to noodle
making. The Salim group, Mr Liem's main company, had turnover of more than
Dollars 9bn last year.
The fortunes of both Mr Kuok and Mr Liem were founded on the commodities
business.

CSL, the Australian drug company which was formed as Commonwealth Serum
Laboratories in 1916 and is owned by the federal government, is to be sold
off in a ADollars 260m to ADollars 312m (USDollars 186m to USDollars 224m)
stock market flotation next month.
Mr Kim Beazley, finance minister, announced yesterday that 130m shares would
be offered at a price range of ADollars 2 to ADollars 2.40.
Private investors can apply at the upper price of ADollars 2.40, while
institutional investors can apply at prices within this range.
The institutional bidding process will determine the final price, and
private investors will then receive a refund if the final price is less than
ADollars 2.40.
The flotation will not be underwritten, and Mr Beazley claimed that the
pricing arrangements provided 'the greatest flexibility to withstand
changing market conditions'.
The government statement said that CSL has forecast an after-tax profit of
Dollars 20.4m for the year to end-June 1995, and sales of ADollars 219m.
Exports will account for around 10 per cent of this revenue. Expected
spending on research and development is put at ADollars 27.6m.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Four Seasons pushed into loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four Seasons Hotels, the luxury hotel chain which is presently up for sale,
has reported a strong improvement in operations, but was pushed into a hefty
1993 loss by write-downs on several properties.
The write-downs, totalling CDollars 117m (USDollars 84m), resulted in a net
l993 loss of CDollars 119.2m, or CDollars 4.30 a share, compared with
earnings of CDollars 7.7m, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier.
Operating earnings grew to CDollars 35.1m from CDollars 12.3m, due partly to
the acquisition in August 1992 of Regent International Hotels.
The company, which manages 38 Four Seasons and Regent hotels, with another
seven under construction, said the final quarter of 1993 and early 1994
'provide the first tangible evidence that our business is solidly recovering
from the prolonged reces-sion'.
Luxury hotel reservations were up 12 per cent and group sales bookings up 24
per cent in the fourth quarter.
Mr Isadore Sharp, Four Seasons' founder and controlling shareholder,
recently put the entire company up for sale.
An official of the company said yesterday that the process was likely to be
a 'deliberate, slow' one.
Seven properties, including the Four Seasons in London (formerly Inn on the
Park), are also on the block, although Four Seasons will continue to manage
the hotels.
These sales are expected to be completed over the next 18 to 24 months.

<TEXT>
Honeywell, the US electronic control systems group, reported a drop in net
income and revenues for the first quarter as the company's space and
aviation controls business continued to decline.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 47.7m, or 36 cents a share, in line
with expectations. For the same period last year, net income was Dollars
57.3m, or 42 cents.
Revenues for the quarter were down 6 per cent at Dollars 1.35bn, compared
with Dollars 1.44bn.
Sales of Honeywell's home and building controls unit increased to Dollars
576m, up 6 per cent from the first quarter of 1993.
Operating profit was Dollars 45.5m, up 10 per cent.
However, sales of industrial control products declined 5 per cent to Dollars
390.7m, reducing operating profits for that division to Dollars 39.7m, down
9 per cent. Excluding sales of a keyboard business, which was sold in July
1993, sales were flat.
The space and aviation control business reported operating profits of
Dollars 24.6m, down 36 per cent from the first quarter of last year. Sales
declined 21 per cent to Dollars 351m from Dollars 446.8m.
'Space and aviation results were in line with our expectations, and reflect
lower aircraft production rates and reduced government spending,' said Mr
Michael Bonsignore, Honeywell chairman and chief executive.
'We expect market conditions to remain challenging in the near term. We have
aggressively sized our business to meet these conditions, while maintaining
high levels of research and development investment in next-generation
avionics.'
Honeywell said that it had established a wholly-owned affiliate company
during the quarter based in Tianjin, China.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: New Banesto owner due to be
named on Monday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spain's banking authorities are likely to name the new owner of Banesto on
Monday, the deadline for delivery of the sealed bids.
Mr Miguel Martin, deputy governor of the Bank of Spain and chairman of the
eight-member committee which will award Banesto to its new owner, has told a
parliamentary commission the price will be the sole deciding factor in the
auction of the financially-stricken bank.
'The likelihood is that it (the sale) will all be sewn up next Monday' - the
day when the bids are to be delivered, the Bank of Spain said yesterday.
The three contenders are Argentaria, the state-controlled banking
corporation partially privatised last year; Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, a leading
domestic bank which has lent senior executives to run Banesto in a caretaker
capacity; and Santander, the smallest of the trio in terms of market value
but the most international and profitable of the domestic institutions.
The authorities say they will view favourably the acquisition of Banesto by
any one of the three.
At stake is the opportunity to acquire an institution with an estimated 10
per cent share of Spain's financial market, a banking presence in Argentina,
Chile and Uruguay, a stake in Banco Totta, a leading Portuguese bank, and an
industrial portfolio that includes some of Spain's best-known corporations.
The risk for the buyer is the burden of taking on a bank that required Bank
of Spain intervention at the end of last year to avert a bankruptcy which
might have endangered the entire domestic system. Independent audits have
established that Banesto had gross financing needs of Pta605bn (Dollars
4.3bn), part of which was met by a Bank of Spain rescue plan, and part
through the transfer of Banesto's entire reserves to provisions.
In a hint that fuelled speculation of a winning bid by Argentaria, Mr
Francisco Luzon, chairman of the banking group, has said that 'the price of
Banesto is a different one for the different banks'. Argentaria, which has a
smaller banking network than those of BBV and Santander, is viewed by
analysts as the most interested buyer of Banesto's 2,400 branches.

<TEXT>
Rockwell International, the US aerospace-to-electronics group, lifted
second-quarter net income to Dollars 154.7m, an increase of 13 per cent over
the Dollars 136.9m of the corresponding period.
Mr Donald Beall, chairman and chief executive officer, said: 'Earnings per
share for the second quarter were 70 cents, up 11 per cent over last year's
63 cents per share, marking the fifth consecutive quarter Rockwell has
recorded a double-digit increase of earnings per share.'
Sales for the second quarter rose to Dollars 2.76bn, up Dollars 67m from the
same fiscal 1993 period.
Mr Beall attributed the strong 1994 second-quarter results primarily to
record quarterly earnings at the largest business segment, elec-tronics.
Automotive, aerospace and graphics earnings were also ahead of last year's
comparable period.
For the first six months, net income was Dollars 304.2m, a 15 per cent
increase over 1993's first-half net income of Dollars 264.7m.
Earnings per share were Dollars 1.38, up 14 per cent over 1993's Dollars
1.21. Sales totalled Dollars 5.4bn, against Dollars 5.2bn a year ago.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Xerox, the US document processing company, yesterday announced plans to step
up its assault on the conventional printing market with a series of products
and industrial alliances aimed at encouraging the digital transmission and
printing of documents.
The group intends to capture a big slice of the markets created as
electronic technology is increasingly used for printing business and other
documents. Xerox said the segment of the offset printing market (in which
metal plates and ink are used) which could switch to digital methods
totalled about Dollars 93bn worldwide.
'Today, you can pick up a telephone anywhere and reach anywhere,' said Mr
Peter van Cuylenberg, Xerox executive vice-president. 'It should be the same
with documents and publications.'
Xerox announced:
New software called DocuSP to integrate document services from printers,
personal computers, scanners and storage devices.
Xerox said this would eventually make integration of document processing
equipment as easy as plugging in a telephone;
A new grouping of more than 50 information technology companies to speed up
the development of new systems, open to all suppliers, and applications for
electronic publishing on demand to save time and distribution costs.
This alliance includes AT&amp;T, Sun Microsystems and Novell;
High-speed document printers and scanners for easier printing of documents
manuals, educational books and other texts, with specific groups of users
which form the market for digital printing.

Union Carbide, the US chemicals group, yesterday reported a 52 per cent
increase in first-quarter net income, which it attributed mainly to cost
reduction and improved results from joint ventures.
The company made Dollars 61m before accounting changes, or 37 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 40m, or 28 cents a share, in the same period last
year. The figures for 1994 included non-recurring items which cut earnings
per share by 5 cents.
Sales totalled Dollars 1.13bn, compared to Dollars 1.19bn a year ago. The
company said improved volumes were largely offset by slight margin declines
in commodity products compared to the first and fourth quarter of last year.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Pratt &amp; Whitney helps UTC to 66%
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Technologies, the US technology group, reported a 66 per cent
increase in first-quarter net income, powered by a sharply improved
performance at Pratt &amp; Whitney, its aero-engine manufacturing subsidiary.
The group reported earnings of Dollars 106m, or 71 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 64m, or 42 cents, in the same period last year on revenues down
from Dollars 4.86bn to Dollars 4.84bn.
Pratt's operating income was Dollars 84m, compared with Dollars 24m, and the
underlying improvement was even greater since the 1993 quarter benefited
from a Dollars 75m fee from a company wishing to participate in Pratt's
PW4000 engine programme.
Pratt has been hit hard over the past two years by the downturn in the civil
aviation business, which has cut demand for lucrative spare engine parts.
The company said the improved performance was due to higher commercial
spares sales, lower research and development spending, and continued cost
improvements. This was partly offset by lower shipments of commercial
engines.
Commercial spare parts orders in the first quarter averaged Dollars 140m a
month, compared with a monthly average of Dollars 124m for all of 1993.
The group's flight systems segment had operating income of Dollars 47m, down
from Dollars 71m, as income growth at the Sikorsky helicopter group was more
than offset by results at Hamilton Standard and Norden.
Carrier, the air conditioning unit, reported operating income of Dollars
18m, up from Dollars 8m, as results continued to strengthen in North
America, Asia-Pacific and Carrier Transicold. This was offset partly by
European weakness.
Otis, the elevator group, made Dollars 97m, up Dollars 3m, while automotive
turned in Dollars 44m, up from Dollars 37m, due primarily to higher
production of American-built cars and trucks and greater penetration in
Europe.

Dollars 617m in record quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intel, the world's largest maker of computer chips, reported strong growth
in revenues and earnings for the first quarter, its seventh consecutive
quarter of record results.
Revenue for the quarter totalled Dollars 2.66bn, up from Dollars 2.02bn a
year ago. Net income was Dollars 617m, or Dollars 1.40 per share, compared
with Dollars 548m, or Dollars 1.24, in last year's first quarter.
Growth was driven by a 'steady migration of computer buyers toward higher
performance (personal computer) systems,' said Mr Andrew Grove, president
and chief executive. First-quarter orders set another company record, he
said.
Intel is the leading supplier of microprocessor chips to the personal
computer industry. Strong demand for personal computers, together with a
slight increase in the average price of microprocessors, is driving the
company's growth.
Intel is 'on the most aggressive processor (production) ramp in our history
in order to deliver Pentium processors in high volume for mass market PCs',
said Mr Grove.
The Pentium is Intel's latest and highest performance microprocessor.
The company aims to produce between 6m and 7m Pentium chips this year, with
Pentium sales expected to represent 25 per cent of fourth-quarter sales to
the PC industry, Intel said.
Of the first-quarter revenues, 51 per cent came from the Americas, 27 per
cent from Europe, 8 per cent from Japan and 14 per cent from the
Asia-Pacific region.
The company said its latest fiscal quarter included an extra week to bring
end-of-quarter dates more in line with the calendar dates. The extra week
had an immaterial effect on first quarter revenue.

<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, reported record
revenues for its third fiscal quarter, although earnings were reduced by a
Dollars 120m charge for litigation.
Net earnings for the quarter were Dollars 256m, or 84 cents a share, after
the litigation charge, against Dollars 243m, or 80 cents. Revenues were
Dollars 1.24bn, a 30 per cent increase over the Dollars 958m for the same
period last year.
In February, a Los Angeles jury ordered Microsoft to pay damages to Stac
Electronics for infringement of patents covering data-compression
technology. Microsoft said it would seek a reversal of the verdict and
would, if necessary, file an appeal.
Excluding this charge, net income for the quarter would have been Dollars
336m, up 38 per cent from the same quarter last year, with earnings a share
of Dollars 1.11, well above Wall Street expectations of about Dollars 1.01.
'This is another record-breaking quarter for the company,' said Mr Mike
Brown, vice-president of finance and treasurer, 'with revenues reaching an
all-time high. While we've had good results across our product line,
Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office continue to lead the way.'
Windows is Microsoft's widely-used personal computer operating system, while
'Office' is a suite of applications products.
For the nine months, revenues were Dollars 3.36bn, up from Dollars 2.71bn in
the same period last year, while net income advanced to Dollars 784m, or
Dollars 2.58, compared with Dollars 688m, or Dollars 2.28.

The remainder is traded on the Buenos Aires stock exchange.
Socma owns companies such as Sevel, Argentina's biggest car company.
It also has interests in services, construction and energy companies.
Analysts said Canale had suffered from poor management and fallen into debt.
It reported sales of Dollars 41m in the six months to last December, up 11
per cent over the second half of 1992.

<TEXT>
Rising production and lower costs helped American Barrick, the Toronto-based
gold producer, to a 31 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings.
Net earnings rose to USDollars 60.4m, or 21 cents a share, from Dollars
46.1m, or 16 cents, a year ago. Revenues climbed to Dollars 187.3m from
Dollars 144.1m.
Gold output jumped to 451,981 ounces from 354,839 ounces, reflecting rising
production from the Betze-Post deposit at Barrick's flagship Goldstrike mine
in Nevada. Unexpectedly high throughput at Goldstrike also contributed to a
drop in operating costs to Dollars 160 an ounce from Dollars 174 an ounce.
Due to an active hedging programme, the average price of gold received was
well above prevailing market prices at Dollars 403 per ounce, but lower than
the Dollars 410 average a year earlier.
Barrick has markedly expanded its offshore activities in the past year. It
reported that drilling on the Corona property in northern Peru points to
'good mineralisation' at a depth of 400 metres. Eleven drills and close to
100 people are working on the site.
Total production this year is forecast at about 1.8 ounces, rising to 2m
ounces in 1995. Another mine on the Goldstrike property is due to reach full
production of 400,000 ounces a year in late 1996.

war

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, is showing signs of recovering
from the effects of cuts in the prices of its premium cigarettes.
Net income for the quarter until March, excluding the effect of an
accounting change last year, was down by just 3.5 per cent, to Dollars
1.17bn, from Dollars 1.21bn in the comparable period last time. The figure
was struck on sales up 2 per cent at Dollars 15.5bn.
The fall in earnings per share was still smaller because of the company has
been buying back its stock. Excluding accounting changes, it was down 2.9
per cent to Dollars 1.34.
The results were better than analysts had expected, and the shares, recently
depressed by an outbreak of hostility to the US tobacco industry from
anti-smoking activists and politicians, put on Dollars 1 5/8 to close at
Dollars 51 7/8 in New York.
Yesterday's figures were the last to show an adverse comparison with the
more buoyant results reported before the round of price-cutting in US
cigarette prices a year ago. Philip Morris slashed the price of its Marlboro
cigarettes to defend falling market share against competition from low-cost
products.
It said its strategy had succeeded in lifting Malboro's share of the
domestic cigarette market back to 27.3 per cent, up 5.2 percentage points
over last year. Operating income was still down - by 24.5 per cent to
Dollars 769m - in domestic tobacco because of lower pricing. International
tobacco was up 17.4 per cent to Dollars 791m.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Steady performances from Merck
and Warner Lambert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Recent acquisitions and joint ventures contributed to steady first-quarter
performances by Merck and Warner Lambert, two of the biggest US
pharmaceutical companies. American Home Products, a third leading drug
concern, showed little improvement during the period.
At Merck, net income in the first three months of 1994 climbed 10 per cent
to Dollars 675.2m. Earnings per share were flat at 54 cents a share, due to
the dilutive effect of stock issued to complete the acquisition of Medco
Containment Services, a drug distribution business.
It was the first quarter in which the Medco operation was included in
Merck's results.
Dr P. Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive, linked the growth in
profits to strong unit volume gains in US and international markets. Merck's
most profitable products include Vasotec, an enzyme for treating
cardiovascular disorders, and Proscar, a treatment for benign prostrate
enlargement.
Dr Vagelos said the unfavourable effects of foreign exchange rates, higher
tax rates and other factors were offset by cost controls and better
productivity.
Revenue growth, thanks largely to Medco's contribution, was even more
impressive. Sales reached Dollars 3.5bn, up 48 per cent.
If the effect of the acquisition and the sale of the Calgon water-management
business is taken into account, sales were up 19 per cent.
Warner Lambert, which markets personal care products and confections as well
as pharmaceuticals, said net income advanced 5 per cent to Dollars 190m, or
Dollars 1.42, compared Dollars 182m, or Dollars 1.35, a year ago.
Worldwide sales were up 10.5 per cent at Dollars 1.47bn. The company said
the gains reflected growth strategy last year, which included the
acquisition of the Wilkinson Sword operations and alliances with Wellcome,
Glaxo and Jouveinal.
By comparison, American Home Products had a lacklustre first quarter. Net
income edged 4 per cent ahead to Dollars 415m, or Dollars 1.34 a share on
sales up 2 per cent at Dollars 2.14bn.
The company blamed 'competitive conditions' in the US and certain foreign
markets.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Two divisional managers set to
leave Apple Computer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two of Apple Computer's five divisional general managers, who report
directly to chief executive Mr Michael Spindler, are to leave the company.
Mr Gaston Bastiaens, general manager of Apple's Personal Interactive
Electronics (PIE) division - which develops and markets Apple's Newton
technology - will be leaving Apple to set up his own business activities,
the company said.
Mr Morris Taradalsky, general manager of the Apple Business Systems (ABS)
division, which develops and markets high-performance 'servers' for office
networks, has resigned to join MicroNet Technology, a privately-held
developer of data storage systems, as president and chief executive. Before
joining Apple in 1989, Mr Taradalsky worked at IBM for 18 years.
Apple described the departures as an 'unfortunate coincidence'. They were
unrelated, it said.
Mr Bastiaens' departure follows a statement by Mr Spindler, last week,
publicly acknowledging for the first time that sales of the Newton hand-held
'personal digital assistant' had failed to live up to the company's
expectations.
Newton was introduced last year by Mr John Sculley, former Apple chairman
and chief executive, who has since left the company. 'We believe that Newton
will be seen as the defining technology of the digital age,' he said at the
product launch.
Instead, Newton has become the butt of jokes about its inaccurate
hand-writing recognition technology, and has been widely-criticised by
industry analysts for its limited communications capabilities. In January,
Apple said 80,000 units had been shipped. It declines to update the sales
report.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Creditable quarter for US banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three large US banks reported growth in first-quarter earnings yesterday,
confirming that the industry performed creditably between January and March
in spite of the deterioration in the interest rate and trading environ-ment.
Topping the list was Chemical Banking, the nation's third largest bank,
which posted a 16 per cent increase in profits to Dollars 319m. The results
included a Dollars 48m pre-tax restructuring charge relating to the closure
of 50 branches in the New York area.
Although the yield on Chemical's interest-earning assets declined -
primarily because of higher interest rates - the group's net interest income
was virtually unchanged at Dollars 1.14bn.
Non-interest revenues rose by Dollars 6m to Dollars 931m, as increased fees
from corporate finance, revolving credit and asset management activities
offset a 27 per cent drop in trading revenues to Dollars 185m.
Chemical said results from the trading of securities, currencies and risk
management products were mixed, but, like most of the industry, its emerging
markets trading business performed poorly.
Banc One, the eighth-largest US bank, reported profits of Dollars 313m, up
from Dollars 287m a year earlier.
Growth in commercial and retail loans helped the bank post a modest increase
in net interest income to Dollars 1.06bn.
Once again, Banc One's use of interest rate swaps helped protect its margins
from rising interest-rates, but the positive contribution of swaps to the
net interest margin - which fell from 6.56 per cent a year ago to 6.14 per
cent in the quarter - declined.
Non-interest income at Banc One was Dollars 384m, up from Dollars 342m a
year earlier, as higher earnings from trust, securities and credit-card
securitisation business offset lower earnings from its insurance, investment
banking and merchant processing operations.
At Wells Fargo, the San Francisco-based bank, profits almost doubled to
Dollars 202m, up from Dollars 108m a year earlier, although the bulk of the
gain was attributable to a sharp decline in loan loss provisions, which fell
from Dollars 210m a year ago to Dollars 60m.
Net interest income slipped 5 per cent to Dollars 642m following a 34 basis
point drop in the bank's net interest margin to 5.56 per cent.
Loan balances, however, grew slightly in the quarter, the first increase
since 1990. Non-interest income rose 16 per cent to Dollars 200m.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Citicorp hit by heavy fall in
trading income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trading income at Citicorp tumbled by nearly Dollars 400m in recent weeks as
the US bank took an unexpected hit in the world's turbulent foreign exchange
and fixed-income markets.
The debacle cut the US bank's trading revenues to just Dollars 71m during
the first three months of the year, from Dollars 457m a year ago.
The news was surprising, given that Citicorp is not known for taking big
bets on the direction of financial markets. In the past, much of its income
has come from handling trades for customers in the foreign exchange markets,
where it is the world's biggest trader.
Foreign exchange trading income fell to Dollars 66m from Dollars 240m a year
ago, while the bank's trading account - principally comprising fixed-income
securities - turned in income of just Dollars 5m, down from Dollars 217m.
Speaking at the bank's annual meeting in New York yesterday, Mr John Reed,
chairman, described the results as 'very poor'. He added that trading 'is
important, but it is not the dominant part of our business.'
The bank did not provide details of trading losses, except to say:
'Interest-rate and currency environments in Europe and North America were
volatile, and market prices declined in Latin American securities.'
Other banks active in the emerging securities markets have also reported
poor trading results in the area, with First Chicago putting its loss in the
markets at Dollars 54m.
Other parts of Citicorp's operations performed above market expectations
during the period, continuing the turnround of recent quarters and
off-setting the poor trading results.
Before accounting changes in both periods, after-tax profits of Dollars
609m, or Dollars 1.12 a share, were up from Dollars 370m, or 67 cents, a
year before. They were broadly in line with market estimates.
Loan-loss provisions for the period fell to Dollars 415m, from Dollars 689m
a year before and Dollars 571m in the final three months of 1993.
Citicorp continued to report growth in consumer banking around the world,
with revenues of Dollars 2.49bn, up 11 per cent from a year before. With
expenses rising by only 5 per cent, and lower loan-loss provisions, the
consumer businesses recorded net income of Dollars 427m, up from Dollars
296m.
The poor trading results, meanwhile, cut revenues in the wholesale banking
area to 1.2bn, 17 per cent below the level of a year before.
Net income in these operations was Dollars 264m, down from Dollars 380m.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: GTE steals march on rival
telephone services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GTE, the second largest cellular telephone operator in the US, said
yesterday it planned to launch a cut-price pocket telephone service later
this year.
The move should steal the march on rival personal communications services
(PCS), which are not due to be introduced in the US for at least two years.
The company, the biggest US local telephone company, confirmed that it
planned to launch its Telego service nationally.
It has been testing Telego for the past two years in Tampa, Florida, with
3,000 customers, in the largest test of consumer-oriented wireless services
in the US.
Telego will try to broaden the cellular customer base beyond the business
community by offering lower prices and a lightweight, versatile mobile
phone.
The GTE unit can be used inside the home as a limited-range cordless phone,
transmitting signals through a normal wire telephone line. Outside the home,
it automatically switches mode and becomes a cellular phone. However, it is
not designed for customers who want to 'roam', that is use their phones when
travelling long distances.
Customers in Tampa are being charged a fee of Dollars 25 a month, plus 25
cents for each minute of calls. This is much cheaper than cellular rates in
many cities.
GTE yesterday declined to say how much the service would cost when it was
launched nationally.
The service could pose a challenge to PCS, which also use small lightweight
phones, and should offer a much cheaper service than cellular.
However, the Federal Communications Commission, the government watchdog
overseeing the communications industries, has yet to fix a date for an
auction of PCS licences, and PCS services are unlikely to get off the ground
before 1996-1997.
Separately, GTE yesterday unveiled first-quarter net income of Dollars 504m,
or 52 cents a share, against Dollars 460m, or 48 cents, in the same period
last year.
Revenues and sales were Dollars 4.75bn, down from Dollars 4.83bn last year.
Last year's figure included Dollars 86m of revenues from properties which
have since been sold. Telephone access lines grew 4.3 per cent and
long-distance calling was up 6.6 per cent. The mobile-cellular business had
a 41 per cent jump in revenues.
Sprint, the long-distance and local telecommunications group, reported
first-quarter net income of Dollars 337m, or 65 cents, compared with a net
loss of Dollars 413m, or Dollars 1.21, in the same period of last year.
The 1994 figures were affected by a one-time gain of 6 cents a share and the
1993 figures by Dollars 1.66 a share of non-recurring special charges.
Excluding special items, income from continuing operations rose 33 per cent
to Dollars 205m, while revenues were up 12 per cent at Dollars 3.03bn, as
the company saw an 11 per cent rise in long-distance revenues and minutes of
use. Long-distance operating income rose 19 per cent to Dollars 143m.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: GAN static at FFr414m and
restructures bank unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Groupe GAN, the French insurance group, yesterday confirmed that it
experienced another difficult year in 1993 with static net profits of
FFr414.3m (Dollars 70.2m). It has restructured a banking subsidiary by
removing FFr18.4bn of non-performing property loans from the balance sheet.
GAN's shake-up of its property interests, which includes transfering
FFr12.6bn of loans from its Union Industrielle de Credit (UIC) subsidiary to
a shell company and FFr5.8bn to another subsidiary, follows similar moves by
other French financial groups.
Credit Lyonnais, the ailing state-controlled bank, last month disclosed a
FFr44.9bn rescue package that involves the transfer of FFr40bn of
non-performing property loans. A number of insurance groups, including Union
des Assurances de Paris, have been forced to bale out their troubled banking
interests by moving property loans to less vulnerable subsidiaries.
Mr Francois Heilbronner, chairman of GAN, which is France's third largest
state-controlled insurer, said it was on course for 'very strong' growth
following the restructuring. He added that the group should be ready for
sale later this year.
GAN has been regarded as the weakest of the large French insurers, because
of its relative tardiness in adapting to the recession and its heavy
exposure to the precarious property sector.
These difficulties resulted in a steep decline in net profits to FFr402m in
1992 from FFr2.32bn in 1991. However, conditions in the insurance market
improved last year.
GAN last year saw consolidated sales increase by 17 per cent to FFr154.5bn
from FFr131.9bn in 1992 and the board has frozen the dividend at FFr4.00.
Net profits from French insurance rose by 28 per cent to FFr360m from
FFr282m over the same period. The group returned to the black in foreign
insurance with a contribution of FFr65m against a FFr52m loss in the
previous year.
However, GAN's banking interests were more problematic. UIC last year fell
into the red with a net deficit of FFr856m from net profits of FFr152m in
1992. Its difficulties forced GAN to make a provision of FFr3.3bn to cover
restructuring costs, although the group was able to counter this with a
FFr3.3bn net credit from a change in accountancy methods for its life
insurance business.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Volvo set to issue strategy
statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo will today make an important statement on its future strategy,
including details of further disposals, following the collapse of plans to
merge with Renault last year.
Mr Soren Gyll, group chief executive, is expected to emphasise at a meeting
with shareholders that many of the group's activities not directly linked to
car and truck manufacturing are to be sold.
His speech at the group's annual general meeting in Gothenburg is also
likely to make it clear that the group is not seeking a Renault-type
alliance with other vehicle manufacturers.
The strategy represents a break with the era of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, who
resigned as Volvo chairman in December after the plan to merge with Renault
broke down.
Volvo has already sold a number of non-core businesses this year. These
include a 25 per cent stake in Custos, an investment group, for SKr1.74bn
(Dollars 219m), and a 4.6 per cent holding in Norway's Saga Petroleum for
NKr458m (Dollars 62m). Last week the company sold a 26 per cent holding in
the Hertz car rental group to Ford for Dollars 145m.
The group retains a large number of other operations outside its main
businesses. They include a 100 per cent stake in Alfred Berg, the
stockbroker, 25 per cent of the real estate group, Pleiad, and 22 per cent
of the investment company, Cardo.
One of the main points of focus will be the company's involvement in BCP, a
consumer products company where it has 74 per cent of the shares, and
Pharmacia, the pharmaceuticals group in which it holds 25 per cent. It
inherited the stakes after the Procordia group - jointly controlled by Volvo
and the state - was broken up last year.
The group committed itself to bidding for the outstanding shares in BCP last
October before the collapse of the Renault deal.

Roche, the Swiss pharma-ceuticals group, has again fulfilled its investors'
high expectations by reporting a 29 per cent rise in 1993 consolidated net
income to SFr2.48bn (Dollars 1.7bn).
The directors have proposed a 30 per cent rise in the dividends to SFr48 per
share and participation certificate.
The group had earlier reported an 11 per cent rise in 1993 sales to
SFr14.3bn, with all divisions contributing to the increase.
Roche said its operating income had considerably increased, due to greater
use of production capacity and cost management.
Exact figures will be published with the annual report on May 10, but the
group indicated that its operating margins had improved.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Pechiney tumbles into the red

<TEXT>
Pechiney, the French state-owned aluminium group, fell into a net loss of
FFr980m (Dollars 167m) last year, compared with a profit of FFr203m in 1992.
The group was hit by the depressed state of the aluminium market and an
exceptional charge to cover losses on forward purchases of metals.
In spite of the losses, Mr Jean Gandois, chairman, said he hoped the group
would be privatised this year, claiming that the conditions for the sale of
the company could be set this summer.
Mr Gandois saw signs of encouragement for 1994, pointing to improved
economic conditions in the US and Europe and a strengthening of aluminium
prices. 'Recovery to break-even for 1994 is within our reach,' the chairman
said.
Group sales, which fell to FFr63.03bn last year from FFr65.37bn in 1992, had
risen by between 9 and 10 per cent in the first two months of this year, the
company.
Pechiney is one of the 21 companies slated for privatisation by the
government. However, it is not on the list of the next three companies being
prepared for sale. Pechiney's privatisation has been complicated by its
earnings performance and by the government's desire to create an alliance
with Compagnie Nationale du Rhone, the hydroelectricity producer, before
privatising the group.
The plan has drawn opposition from Electricite de France, the state-owned
utility, which has a virtual monopoly on the French electricity sales. As a
result, industry observers believe the project could be delayed.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: SGS-Thomson increases chip
stakes - The Franco-Italian group's move will intensify competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition in the strategically important microprocessor segment of the
semiconductor business, worth about Dollars 5bn a year, is certain to
intensify after the announcement last week that SGS-Thomson intends to sell
industry standard microprocessors under its own name.
The Franco-Italian concern, the world's 13th largest manufacturer of
semiconductors, makes microprocessors designed by Cyrix, a small,
Texas-based, semiconductor company at its Carrollton, Texas, plant. It
intends to spend about Dollars 300m to equip and commission another facility
in Phoenix, Arizona, to manufacture Cyrix-designed chips under its own name
and in direct competition with Intel, the industry leader. Cyrix chips are
functionally similar to Intel's 80/486 and Pentium chips.
Mr Keith Chapple, Intel's director of strategic development for Europe, said
the SGS-Thomson move would intensify competition, but represented little
threat in the short term: 'We are all for competition if it is fair
competition,' he said.
SGS-Thomson's decision follows the news earlier this month that Internation
Business Machines, the world's largest semiconductor and computer
manufacturer, has agreed to make copies of Intel chips designed by Cyrix.
However, analysts believe that the decision will not lead to a price war of
the kind which has damaged the personal computer business. They point out
the market is large and growing and there is plenty of scope for competitors
to improve market share without cutting prices unduly. Intel has at least 80
per cent of the market for PC microprocessors, while Cyrix has less than 3
per cent.
IBM and SGS-Thomson were encouraged to enter the market for Intel
microprocessor clones after Intel last month dropped patent infringement
claims against the Texas chip designer, opening the way for companies with
licences to Intel's patents to clone its microprocessors. SGS-Thomson
qualifies though its acquisition of Mostek in the 1980s.
SGS-Thomson's decision is part of its strategy to expand in advanced
semiconductors and raise its ranking to the world's 10th largest producer,
the company said.
The group refused to give further details of the size of the investment or
the timing of the launch, but said the company would make copies of Intel's
80/486 chip as the first of a family. It is expected that Cyrix-designed
copies of Intel's top-of-the-line Pentium chips and its successors will
follow.
Mr Bipin Parmar, an analyst with Dataquest, the US-based market research
company, who has been advising SGS-Thomson on its strategy, said while the
company led the world in power semiconductors, too much of its business
depended on products selling for 2 cents to 20 cents a unit.
Microprocessors, by comparison, sold for Dollars 30-Dollars 60 each.
The company is enjoying a sharp increase in profits. Last year's results
have not yet been announced, but Mr Pasquale Pistorio, chairman, confirmed
forecasts that net profits would rise to about Dollars 160m compared with
Dollars 3.4m in 1992. Industry observers expect a further rise in 1994.

<TEXT>
Krupp Hoesch, the German steel and engineering group, yesterday reported
1993 net losses of DM590m (Dollars 347m), but said it hoped to break even
this year.
Mr Gerhard Cromme, chief executive, said that although the steel division
would be the only loss-making unit this year, capacity cuts and productivity
gains meant that prospects for steel were improving.
His mild optimism was confirmed by the German Steel Federation, which said
production and incoming orders for German steelmakers in the first quarter
were 10 per cent higher than the year before.
Turnover at Krupp Hoesch fell to DM24bn, from DM27.8bn the previous year.
The company said the machine tools division reported a slight loss while
steel losses had been the main reason for the result.
The other four divisions made profits but Mr Cromme would not give further
details before the 1993 results, the first year after the merger of Krupp
and Hoesch, which will be presented in mid-May.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Minister warns on Schneider
crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and DAVID WALLER

<DATELINE>
   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's banking system is facing a self-inflicted 'crisis of confidence'
in the wake of the bankruptcy of the Jurgen Schneider property empire, Mr
Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, warned yesterday.
His remarks, following yesterday's cabinet meeting, came as a leading German
newspaper claimed to have discovered the whereabouts of Mr Jurgen Schneider,
the 59-year old entrepreneur whose disappearance earlier this month
triggered the property crisis with debts at an estimated DM5bn (Dollars
2.9bn).
According to today's edition of the Berlin-based Die Welt newspaper, Mr
Schneider is living in a rented villa on the small island of Siesta Key,
south of St. Petersburg on the west coast of Florida in the US.
Mr Schneider is quoted in the article as saying he was 'going through a bad
patch' and had been ordered by his doctors to take a month-long break from
business affairs.
German banks were yesterday in discussions with the receiver appointed on
Monday to wind up the affairs of Mr Schneider, his wife and officials of the
Schneider group.
The banks are keen to avoid a hasty sell-off of the group's 85 property
developments in Germany.
Mr Georg Krupp, director of the Deutsche Bank, the failed group's biggest
creditor, told a German newspaper yesterday that the banks planned to
complete Schneider's unfinished projects.
Mr Rexrodt took the highly unusual step of calling on the big banks to take
swift and 'unconventional' measures to protect the small creditors
threatened by the collapse of the property group, in order to protect their
own reputation.
He was speaking after the German government discussed the bankruptcy at its
weekly cabinet meeting, and called for a comprehensive report on the
consequences by next week.
Mr Rexrodt said it was up to the banks, in the first place, to take measures
to support their clients, particularly the small suppliers worst hit by the
Schneider bankruptcy.
It might also be possible to use funds set aside in the government's job
creation programme to provide relief, he added.
Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, said members of the cabinet had
expressed their concern about the Schneider affair, and particularly about
the plight of the small suppliers.

<TEXT>
Net consolidated profit at Italgas, the Italian gas and drinking water
distributor, rose by 6.2 per cent to L86bn (Dollars 50.1m) in 1993, compared
with L81bn in 1992.
After a standstill in 1992, gas sales rose to 6.92bn cubic metres last year
from 6.42bn. Profits have yet to return to their 1991 peak of L91bn, but the
company, which held its dividend at L100 per share last year, is
recommending an increased pay-out of L110 per share this year.
In 1994, the company should benefit from the 1.4 per cent increase in gas
tariffs fixed by the government price commission. The decision - which took
effect on January 1 - was the first tariff increase for 18 months. Italgas
turnover rose to L3,897bn last year from a restated L3,614bn.

FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Gartmore chairman receives Pounds 945,000 -
Executive Pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore, the fund management company, received
a total of Pounds 945,000 in 1993, about half of which represented loyalty
payments to senior staff promised when Banque Indosuez bought the company in
1989.
Last November, Banque Indosuez sold a 25 per cent stake in the company in a
public flotation. The staff retention scheme, which paid Mr Myners Pounds
425,000 in 1992 has since expired and been replaced with an alternative.
Gartmore's first annual report to shareholders shows Mr Myners' 1993 basic
salary as Pounds 241,000, against Pounds 228,000. He also received a
performance-related bonus of Pounds 205,000 last year, up from Pounds
98,000.
In 1993, Gartmore reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 24.6m, against a loss
of Pounds 2.1m in 1992, reflecting non-recurring items. Assets under
management rose from Pounds 12.8bn to Pounds 21bn in 1993.

FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: GKN lifts Westland stake to 91%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN, the engineering and industrial services group, yesterday said it had
won control of 90.8 per cent of Westland following its revised offer for the
helicopter manufacturer.
The 335p cash offer, which values Westland at Pounds 577m, was accepted by
shareholders controlling 126.8m ordinary Westland shares.
GKN has also agreed to buy a further 1.1m ordinary shares, which will take
its total interest to 91.6 per cent.
The near-complete takeover should enable GKN to derive the tax advantages
that, it could be argued, first prompted the bid.
By integrating Westland into its own defence business, the proportion of
GKN's sales originating in the UK should exceed 40 per cent.
This would allow it to recover more advance corporation tax to set against
its mainstream tax liability.
The engineering group, however, has been forced to scale back its partial
share alternative - worth 194.7p in cash and a quarter of a new GKN share -
after it was almost 30 per cent oversubscribed.
Institutions applied for 33.6m shares, against the 26m available, after
calculating the partial share offer was worth almost 3 per cent more than
the cash alternative.
GKN has, meanwhile, received valid acceptances for 92.47 per cent of
Westland's convertible preference shares and 86.24 per cent of the warrants.

Mr Tom Farmer, chairman and chief executive of Kwik-Fit, the tyre, exhaust

the cut he took in the previous period, writes Paul Taylor.
The annual report shows he received pay and benefits totalling Pounds
350,000 in the 12 months to February 28, up from Pounds 234,000 the previous
year when his pay was cut from Pounds 342,000 as profits slumped. Profits,
down from Pounds 32m to Pounds 17.1m in 1992-93, rebounded by 49 per cent to
Pounds 25.4m last time.
Mr Farmer's total remuneration package, including pension contributions of

from Pounds 501,000.

FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: BTR chief's salary revealed for first time
 -Executive Pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The salary of Mr Alan Jackson, chief executive of BTR, has for the first
time appeared in the industrial conglomerate's annual report.
It shows Mr Jackson earned between Pounds 510,001 and Pounds 515,000 in the
year ended December, compared with between Pounds 460,001 and Pounds 465,000
in 1992.
Previously Mr Jackson's salary had not been shown in the accounts because
his duties were considered by BTR to be discharged mainly outside the UK.
The 1985 Companies Act requires only the salary of the chairman and UK
executives be published. The act also states this information 'need not be
given in respect of a director who discharged his duties as such wholly or
mainly outside the UK'.
BTR last year published the salaries of its three non-UK directors after
analysts and institutional investors expressed surprise that Mr Jackson was
deemed to come into this category. Last year about 75 per cent of BTR's
turnover came from outside the UK.
The annual report says BTR is still not complying with the Cadbury
recommendation that companies should have an audit committee confined to
non-executive directors who should have a discussion with the auditors at
least once a year, without executive board members present, to ensure that
there are no unresolved issues of concern.
BTR's audit committee comprises all directors, including executives. The
report says: 'BTR believes all directors should be aware of and accept
responsibility for matters dealt with by this committee. The auditors may
raise any relevant issue with any of the directors, just as all directors
have access to the auditors.'

143,000 profits previously.
The announcement of the results was brought forward to provide further
ammunition for the current directors in their attempts to fight off Mr
Shiraz Malik-Noor, the former chairman, who is trying to regain control of
the board.
The company saw sales drop by 43 per cent at the interim stage to Pounds
683,000 (Pounds 1.19m).
Losses per share were 0.19p compared with 0.09p earnings.
Mr Malik-Noor was removed in March and is pushing for reinstatement at an
extraordinary meeting on Monday.
The company's problems, however, appear to have started long before he
joined.
It has lost close to Pounds 7m in the last four and a half years, of which
Pounds 5m was suffered before Mr Malik-Noor took any executive
responsibilities.

FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Caradon chief gets Pounds 0.25m bonus -
Executive Pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive of Caradon, the building products group,
received a bonus of Pounds 246,000 in 1993, taking his remuneration to
Pounds 538,000, up from Pounds 369,000 in 1992 when his bonus was Pounds
77,000, writes Maggie Urry
The bonus reflected the Pounds 100.3m profit Caradon made on selling its
25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the packaging group, which resulted
in a doubling of earnings per share including the exceptional profit.
Mr Jansen's basic salary rose from Pounds 291,000 to Pounds 312,000, while
his pension contributions were unchanged at Pounds 156,000.

FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Boosey ahead and splits shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boosey &amp; Hawkes, the instrument maker and music publisher, increased profits
by 3.6 per cent over 1993 and announced a 5-for-1 share split.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 4.38m (Pounds 4.23m). Exchange gains of Pounds
250,000 helped to offset reorganisation costs of Pounds 530,000 incurred in
Japan, Germany and France.
Earnings per share were ahead 14 per cent at 76.8p (67.5p), following a tax
charge of Pounds 1.38m (Pounds 1.58m). The lower charge of 31.5 per cent
(37.4 per cent) resulted from the utilisation of tax losses in Germany, the
UK and the US and was not expected to be repeated this year.
A final dividend of 19p is proposed, giving a total for the year of 25p
(22p).
The shares yesterday closed at Pounds 12.75p, up 12p on the day. Mr Richard
Holland, chief executive, said the board was proposing the split as the
price was 'a bit weighty for a company this size'.
Mr Holland described the results as a considerable achievement in the face
of difficult market conditions, especially in Japan which accounts for 20
per cent of group sales.
Turnover rose from Pounds 59.4m to Pounds 66.5m through marginally higher
volumes and favourable exchange gains. The instrument division, which
accounted for 80 per cent of turnover, suffered a slight fall in operating
profits after the reorganisation charge.
In January the group, which makes mainly brass and woodwind instruments,
paid Pounds 390,000 for Karl Hofner, a German string instrument and guitar
maker with annual sales of DM10m (Pounds 4m). Mr Holland said the
acquisition would strengthen the group's position in the instrument market.
Sales of Gorecki's Symphony No 3 continue to help the publishing division,
which also has Rakhmaninov, Britten and Stravinsky on its books. The group
expects the EU's lengthening of the term of copyright from next year to 70
years from the death of a composer to bring long-term benefits.
Publishing turnover rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 13.6m, and operating
profit by 12 per cent to Pounds 4.3m.
Group borrowings fell by Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 13.2m, giving gearing of 58
per cent (68 per cent).

FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Weak clothing sales leave Bodycote lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Bodycote Inter-national fell 13p to 292p yesterday as the metal
technology, packaging and textiles group blamed weak clothing sales for a 13
per cent decline in profits.
Falling demand for Bodycote's workwear range - produced by EHCO-KLM, its
Dutch subsidiary - pushed pre-tax profits down from Pounds 13.6m to Pounds
11.8m in the year to December 31.
Citing shrinking margins in continental Europe, the company said it had been
forced to close one of its two Dutch plants.
The Pounds 435,000 cost of closing the Haaksbergen plant, where there were
70 redundancies, contributed to a reduction in operating profits to Pounds
12m (Pounds 13.7m).
Mr Roger Green, finance director, said: 'Pricing has been cut-throat and we
were disappointed with the figures, particularly in Holland.'
Although profits fell from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 511,000 at EHCO-KLM, which
manufactures protective clothing and uniforms, Mr Green said that orders had
picked up in recent months.
The industrial division, meanwhile, reported reduced profits of Pounds 2.37m
(Pounds 2.45m) following a management reorganisation at Stockpack, its
packaging subsidiary.
That flat performance was offset partially by Metal Technology, Bodycote's
main forging and reinforcement business, where profits rose from Pounds
9.25m to Pounds 9.77m.
Mr Green said the metals division had been boosted by increased demand for
its 'hot isostatic process', which strengthens and reinforces aluminium and
steel cast-ings.
Of the group's Pounds 15m investment programme last year, Pounds 5.2m was
spent on HIP facilities and he predicted it would be the mainstay of future
growth.
Although the division reported increased sales of Pounds 41.4m (Pounds
38.2m), it failed to stem a 6.6 per cent decline in group turnover to Pounds
75m.
Nevertheless, Mr Green expressed optimism about sales this year and said
acquisitions were likely.
Earnings per share fell from 15.8p to 14.1p, but Mr Green said confidence
about future prospects justified a final dividend of 3.25p, making a total
of 5.25p (5p).

FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: London International closes three plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nick Hodges, the chief executive of London International Group, yesterday
announced the closure of three UK plants: a condom plant in Chingford, near
London, with 600 jobs going; a surgical gloves facility at Llanelli, south
Wales, with 240 jobs going, and the health and beauty aids plant in Dundee,
Scotland, cutting 60 jobs, Maggie Urry writes.
Another 100 jobs will be eliminated at the group's head office.
The redundancies and other costs will amount to Pounds 19m in cash, but LIG
hopes to recoup this from the sale of some of its health and beauty brands.
Savings are expected to amount to Pounds 6m in the first full year and
Pounds 8m in the second.
Mr Hodges said that in future the UK condom market would largely be supplied
from plants in Spain and Italy, where automation kept costs lower.
Surgical gloves would come from south-east Asia; Mr Hodges blamed pressure
on margins from the health service for the shift to lower cost production.

FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Expanding Asda Property lifts net asset
value by 42% to 111p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asda Property Holdings, the property investment group headed by Mr Manny
Davidson, yesterday announced a 42 per cent increase to 111p in undiluted
net asset value per share over the 1993 year.
Pre-tax profits rose 4 per cent to Pounds 6.25m (Pounds 6.02m) despite the
impact on the previous year's figures of the sale of the residential
portfolio.
The company has been expanding at a rapid pace, acquiring Pounds 33m of
properties in 1993, partly funded by a Pounds 16.3m rights issue last July.
These properties achieved an average increase in value of 40 per cent at the
year end, compared with a 12 per cent increase from the existing portfolio.
Mr Davidson, chairman, said: 'The strong increase in investor demand in the
latter part of the year led us to change from an aggressive buyer to, in
some instances, an aggressive seller, with the consequence that borrowing is
at a lower level than may have been expected 12 months ago.'
Including the Pounds 14.9m of preference shares as debt, the group had net
borrowings of Pounds 72.1m, representing gearing of 83 per cent. Finance
charges dropped to Pounds 5.94m (Pounds 10.7m).
In December, it acquired the Wheatley Retail Park in Doncaster from the
receivers for Pounds 5.1m. The property was only half let, with income of
Pounds 450,000, but Asda has already boosted rental income to Pounds 1m.
Total net rental income amounted to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 11.2m), while
profits on disposal of trading properties were Pounds 2.95m (Pounds 7.94m).
The rent roll is now running at Pounds 13m, and the company said that given
current voids, this figure could increase by a further Pounds 1m.
A proposed final dividend of 1.5p makes a total of 2.2p (2.1p), payable from
earnings of 6p (7.7p) per share.

FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Chelsfield back in the black with Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chelsfield, the property company headed by Mr Elliott Bernerd that joined
the stock market in December, yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds
3.2m for 1993, against losses of Pounds 18m last time.
Net assets per share increased from 147.3p to 160p and after adjusting for
last December's share issue, there was a 15 per cent rise in shareholders'
funds over the year.
The company has put off plans to list its Atlanta residential apartments -
in a joint venture with P&amp;O - as a Real Estate Investment Trust on the New
York Stock Exchange, as a result of the volatility of the US equity market.
However, Chelsfield said it was still seeking 'progressive realisation of
value' from the portfolio, which it acquired when it bought Laing Properties
with P&amp;O in 1990.
Chelsfield said it was beginning redevelopment on a Pounds 4m scheme in New
Bond Street, London. It also expects to begin work on the redevelopment of
Wool House, south-west London, later this year. The company has planning
consent to build 115,000 sq ft of offices to a design by the late Sir James
Sterling.
Since the year end, the company has sold about Pounds 10m of property.
Operating profits increased from Pounds 1.38m to Pounds 17.3m, mainly
because of an increase from Pounds 7.76m to Pounds 13.7m in net income from
properties, and a turnround in fixed asset investment income from a Pounds
2.07m loss to a Pounds 6.51m profit.
Costs relating to the reorganisation of Pall Mall Properties fell from
Pounds 5.35m to Pounds 866,000. Net finance costs fell from Pounds 16.7m to
Pounds 13.9m.
Net borrowings at the year end totalled Pounds 143.4m, leaving net gearing
at 57 per cent.
Earnings per share were 4.1p, compared with losses of 26.6p. As anticipated
at the time of listing, the group has not paid a dividend for 1993, but 2.4p
is expected for the current year.

FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Richmond Oil wins more time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richmond Oil and Gas, the natural resources company whose shares have been
suspended at 4 1/2 p since September, has been given a temporary reprieve
from delisting following an appeal to the Stock Exchange Quotations
Committee.
The company, which has lost or sold virtually all of its original assets
since flotation in 1989, now has six months in which to fulfil conditions
relating to its business if it is to retain the quote. At the annual meeting
in February the company had said it expected the shares to resume trading
within weeks.
If the suspension is eventually lifted, Richmond will have to submit
detailed financial information as if coming to the market for the first
time. This is likely be an expensive process for the lossmaking company.
Two previous applications to have the suspension lifted were rejected on the
grounds that Richmond was unable to demonstrate 'it had a business
sufficient to support its expected market capitalisation'.
The company's main asset is an interest in a Siberian joint venture to
enhance oil production. Richmond has not been forthcoming on details of the
venture, although it said letters of intent had been signed for projects in
two eastern European countries. In March, the company issued shares to
repurchase its interest in the venture from Northstar Energy, a Panamanian
company owned by Annum International, a Luxembourg vehicle for Lithuanian
and US interests.
Richmond has been beset with difficulties in recent years. In 1992 creditors
foreclosed on its main asset, while the sale of certain properties has been
revised and delayed several times. Transactions surrounding its flotation
and a subsequent rights issue are under investigation by the Serious Fraud
Office.
The company said this week it was confident it would meet the Stock Exchange
conditions.

<TEXT>
BDA Holdings, the property investment and services group, reported increased
activity in the year to the end of January resulting in a turnround from
losses of Pounds 1.16m to profits of Pounds 152,000 pre-tax.
Turnover improved from Pounds 1.33m to Pounds 1.98m. The result was helped
by a release of provisions on carrying value of properties of Pounds
100,000, against provisions last time of Pounds 1.2m.
On prospects, Mr Brian Duker, chairman, said: 'We are finding that
transactions are price sensitive at all levels and therefore believe that
margins will remain constrained.'
Earnings per share were 0.8p (6.4p losses).

FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Go-Ahead pathfinder sets Pounds 4m profit
target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Go-Ahead Group, a Gateshead-based bus service operator to be floated
soon with a market value of more than Pounds 40m, has forecast that it will
make operating profits - before exceptional costs - of more than Pounds 4m
for the current financial year.
The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, also said operating margins
for the first half to January 1 showed further improvement.
The flotation is by way of a placing with institutions and offer of 5 per
cent of the equity to the 3,500 employees. It is being sponsored by Hill
Samuel, with Panmure Gordon as broker to the issue. Impact day will be next
week.
Go-Ahead plans to focus on urban transport and has recently acquired the
Brighton &amp; Hove Bus and Coach Company and the Oxford Bus Company. The group
operates more than 1,000 buses, with an annualised turnover of more than
Pounds 75m. The proceeds of the placing will be used to repay Pounds 12m of
debt.
Mr Trevor Shears, finance director, said exceptional costs would be about
Pounds 1m, mainly in respect of payments for changing conditions of
employment and redundancies.

FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Reduced Pounds 19m loss at Ibstock Johnsen
 -Reorganisation costs responsible for deficit but outlook optimistic for
1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ibstock Johnsen, the UK's third largest brick maker, yesterday reported a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 18.7m for 1993 after further reorganisation costs of
Pounds 20.7m, but said both its brick and pulp businesses should now benefit
from a gradual increase in demand.
The loss represents an improvement over the Pounds 27.6m deficit recorded in
1992 when reorganisation and closure costs totalled Pounds 26.6m.
The bulk of the 1993 reorganisation costs related to the closure of one of
the group's two Portuguese pulp mills and were disclosed at the interim
stage. These costs were partly offset by a Pounds 4.51m profit on disposals.
Losses per share were reduced to 5.69p (9.86p) and the proposed final
dividend is held at 0.5p, making an unchanged total of 1p.
The shares closed up 1p at 86p.
Group turnover fell to Pounds 235.5m (Pounds 277.4m), but the decline
entirely reflected discontinued operations.
Turnover from continuing operations advanced by 6 per cent, from Pounds
176.6m to Pounds 186.9m.
'For most of the year the group continued to experience depressed markets
and distressed prices, although in the final months there were some signs of
more favourable conditions,' said Mr Colin Hope, chairman.
At the operating level, the UK brick operations improved from Pounds 2.74m
to Pounds 3.03m on sales of Pounds 57.8m (Pounds 54.7m) in spite of the
adverse effect of limit-ing production to reduce stocks.
In the US the building materials operations achieved a modest turnround with
profits of Pounds 808,000 compared with a Pounds 1.64m loss while the
Portuguese building products and sanitary ware activities reported a decline
in operating profits to Pounds 619,000 (Pounds 1.48m) reflecting
deteriorating market conditions.
Uneconomic prices for pulp resulted in the forest products operation
reporting a larger Pounds 4.22m loss on continuing operations compared with
losses of Pounds 2.8m on turnover down to Pounds 37.4m (Pounds 42.3m).
Pre-tax profits were further depressed by net interest costs of Pounds 2.94m
compared with receipts of Pounds 660,000 in 1992.
Group debt fell from Pounds 42.9m to Pounds 35.6m, equivalent to gearing of
18 per cent.
COMMENT
Having completed the reorganisation of the brick and pulp businesses,
Ibstock should now begin to benefit from the steady improvement in demand
for bricks in the UK, higher capacity utilisation and possible price
increases later this year. However, it is difficult to see margins returning
to the heady levels of the late 1980s. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 7m look
likely this year producing earnings of about 2p, but even based on a peak
profit estimate of say Pounds 30m at the top of the cycle the shares look to
be fully valued.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Pittencrieff demerger to be
delayed by a week
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The demerger of Pittencrieff, which is splitting its natural resources
division from its US-based telecommunications business, is to be delayed by
a week following a Dollars 51.8m (Pounds 35.4m) deal in the US.
Pittencrieff Communications, which is 54 per cent owned by the UK quoted
natural resources group, announced on Friday that it is buying 600 mobile
radio channels in the south-west US which will more than double its
subscriber base.
As a result, documents detailing the demerger due to be posted on Thursday
will not now be sent before next week. 'It is a bit annoying,' said one of
the company's advisers yesterday. 'It is like going through divorce
proceedings and suddenly finding out that your partner is really good in
bed.'
The company said the financial structure of the demerger remains unaffected,
although it is likely the acquisition will have to be approved by the parent
company's shareholders.
Pittencrieff is proposing to change its name to Pittencrieff Resources and
will apply for a London listing.
Pittencrieff Communications will be sold through a placing and open offer
and quoted both on Nasdaq in the US and in the UK.

FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Vymura Pounds 10m placing to repay backers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vymura, the wallcoverings company which is floating next month with a value
of about Pounds 40m, is looking to raise about Pounds 10m via a share
placing handled by BZW and UBS.
Just over half the money will be used to repay preference shares held by
institutions who backed a management buy-out in 1992.
Vymura's operating profits rose by almost 40 per cent to Pounds 3.96m last
year and the pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, reveals that sales
to DIY superstores have seen 'significant increases' in the first quarter.
Mr Tom Smail, chief executive, said: 'We budgeted for strong sales and have
seen them, though we still have to see what the real impact of the tax
increases will be.'
He believes the company has room to grow in the UK, where it has some 14 per
cent of the market, and even greater opportunities overseas.
The placing price is expected to be announced on May 5.

FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Keller flotation price set at 130p for
Pounds 72.8m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Keller Group, an international ground engineering group, are being
floated at 130p, giving the group a market capitalisation of Pounds 72.8m.
Keller specialises in improving ground for the construction industry, using
a variety of drilling, grouting and piling techniques. Projects outside the
UK account for more than 80 per cent of sales.
Because Keller makes most of its profits outside the UK, it intends to
become one of the first companies to employ foreign income dividends, which
should reduce the group's unrelieved advance corporation tax problem.
A placing and intermediaries offer will raise Pounds 15.3m, which will be
used to repay existing borrowings and help fund further overseas expansion.
About Pounds 27.7m will be raised by the sale of shares by existing
shareholders.
A former engineering offshoot of GKN, Keller was bought by its management
for Pounds 26m three years ago, backed by funds led by Candover Investments.
In spite of recession, Keller has increased operating profits by 46 per cent
since 1991 from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 9.2m on turnover up by 30 per cent to
Pounds 148m. It has benefited from the recent building boom in Germany,
which accounted for 43 per cent of last year's sales.
The issue has been underwritten by Kleinwort Benson Securities, sponsors and
brokers to the issue.
Applications for the intermediaries offer close next Wednesday, and dealings
are expected to start on May 5.
COMMENT
Niches do not come much more obscure than Keller's, but the group has a good
reputation in the arcane world of ground engineering and a solid record of
profits growth and cash generation. The shares have been priced not in line
with the UK construction sector, where ratings assume a great deal of
recovery, but on a prospective multiple of 13, putting them on a discount to
the market as a whole. Concern that the German building boom will eventually
falter can be set against growth prospects in the US, where Keller has just
made a Dollars 9m (Pounds 6m) acquisition. Overall, the unaggressive pricing
should ensure a good platform of support for the shares.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Christian Salvesen makes FFr57m
frozen food buy
</HEADLINE>

   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christian Salvesen, the international distribution, specialist hire and food
services group, has expanded its French distribution business in a deal
worth FFr56.5m (Pounds 6.5m).
The Edinburgh-based group is paying FFr36.5m for the assets of the Gel
Service group, which specialise in frozen food distribution, and is also
assuming debt of FFr20m.
Gel was founded more than 30 years ago and operates from two sites close to
Lille and Lyon, distributing frozen food for retailers and caterers.
Salvesen will inherit the existing management and 160 employees.
Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, said: 'This acquisition forms part of our
strategy of actively growing our international distribution business. Added
to our existing facilities in France, Gel Service will allow us to offer a
national network of multi-user sites and services to existing and potential
customers.'

Newarthill, the holding company for Sir Robert McAlpine, the civil engineer,
made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.38m in the year to October 31, against
losses of Pounds 20.7m.
Turnover fell to Pounds 221.5m (Pounds 268.1m) and operating losses were cut
to Pounds 3.05m (Pounds 18.4m). Behind the pre-tax gain were exceptional
profits of Pounds 9.64m (Pounds 3.13m) and reduced net costs for interest

Earnings emerged at 6.2p (losses 152.4p).

FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: St Ives falls 33% to Pounds 7.1m - Printer
hit by losses on disposal of two non-core businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses on the disposal of discontinued businesses led St Ives, the UK's
largest independent printer, to yesterday report a 33 per cent contraction
in interim pre-tax profits, despite an improvement at the operating level.
Profits before tax fell to Pounds 7.11m in the 26 weeks to January 28, down
from Pounds 10.5m last time.
The decline came after exceptional costs of Pounds 4.93m - representing
goodwill previously written off to reserves - on the disposal of two
non-core businesses, Talbot Publishing Systems in December and Nelson
Packaging last month.
Earnings per share slipped to 3.02p (7.24p), but the interim dividend is
increased by 27 per cent to 1.9p (1.5p). This is the first increase in the
interim dividend since 1990 and Mr Miles Emley, chairman, said it
represented a move towards 'a more conventional' one third to two thirds
split between the interim and final.
The shares dipped 6p to 400p.
Operating profits increased to Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 9.86m) despite a Pounds
118,000 loss on discontinued activities. Mr Emley described the results as
'a satisfactory outcome in trading conditions which have shown only a patchy
recovery and remain extremely competitive'.
In the group's core magazine printing business, some growth in sales, partly
as a result of increased paginations, and the replacement of low margin work
resulted in firmer margins and an improved performance.
Meanwhile the launch of a number of supplements by national newspaper
publishers has taken up significant printing capacity in the industry as a
whole.
Volumes were flat in the group's book business, although sales in the US
bible market have increased considerably.
The group ended the period with net cash of Pounds 22.5m.
COMMENT
St Ives' underlying results were in line with market expectations. Despite
the chairman's cautious remarks, it is clear that the group is already
benefiting from a modest upturn in volumes. Capacity utilisation in the UK
print plants has edged up to about 80 per cent and overall pre-tax margins
have increased from 10 per cent to 10.7 per cent. Providing this improvement
is sustained, pre-tax profits should climb to about Pounds 25m this year,
producing earnings of about 16.6p. The shares are trading on a lofty
prospective multiple of 24, but are worth holding.

FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Golden Vale up 14% as
acquisitions hit margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Golden Vale, the Irish dairy group, reported a 14 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits from IPounds 16.7m to IPounds 19m (Pounds 18.5m) for the
year to December 31.
Turnover rose 42 per cent from IPounds 298m to IPounds 423.2m, including
IPounds 47m from acquisitions. Exports accounted for IPounds 297m of the
total.
Operating margins fell as a result of a series of acquisitions made during
the year, according to Mr Jim O'Mahony, chief executive.
He anticipated a return to 'historically higher than average margins' from
rationalisation measures being carried out in the new companies. However,
'profit maximisation' from the acquisitions would not occur before 1995.
The acquisitions of Leckpatrick Dairies in Northern Ireland, and Vonk and VM
in Denmark and the Netherlands respectively, contributed significantly to
higher net borrowings of IPounds 94.8m at the year end, compared with
IPounds 7.5m a year earlier.
A total of IPounds 83.3m was spent on acquisitions in 1993 including
assumption of debts.
Year end gearing was 139 per cent after a goodwill write-off of IPounds
30.2m, against 8.8 per cent at the start of the year. Total net assets
increased from IPounds 87.5m to IPounds 93.3m.
Mr Liam Irvine, finance director, said that although gearing seemed high,
the company was comfortable with the level of borrowing, an interest cover
of 7.3 and cash flow generation of IPounds 25m during 1993.
The company plans further expansion into the European market and the
development of new products to achieve greater value-added on its primary
dairy products. Turnover of primary dairy products fell from 25 per cent to
18 per cent of the total in 1993.
Earnings per share were up 9 per cent at 10.02p (9.2p) and a final dividend
of 1.35p is recommended for a total of 1.95p (1.63p).

FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Lombard Insurance coming to market with
Pounds 65m valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The forthcoming flotation of Lombard Insurance Group will value the company
at more than Pounds 65m, compared with the Pounds 32m at which it was
purchased from Continental Inc in a management buy-out last May.
Lombard is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.65m for the year to June
1994, up from Pounds 5.68m in the previous 12 months, as a result of
increased investment income and steady growth in gross premium income.
The company is emerging from what has been an exceptionally tough period for
the industry, having lost money on underwriting in both 1991 and 1992.
However, in the three years to December 1993, it achieved underwriting
margins - underwriting profit/loss as a percentage of net premium income -
significantly better than large insurers, such as Commercial Union and Sun
Alliance. Underwriting income grew by 67 per cent during that period.
Lombard is a regional insurance company which has avoided the volatile
London insurance market and concentrated on low to moderate risk insurance.
In 1993, some 65 per cent of premiums were for personal insurance with the
remainder from small and medium-sized businesses.
It has concentrated on short tail business, where the claims are likely to
emerge within the period of cover. However, it has an indemnity from
Continental, covering any claims from business undertaken before the May
1993 buy-out.
The company will issue shares through a placing and intermediaries offer.
The proceeds, after costs and the redemption of outstanding preference
shares, will be Pounds 16m.
The company said the flotation would raise its profile, and the proceeds
enable it to achieve a solvency margin similar to other listed insurers.
The pricing of the issue will be announced on May 5, and dealings are
expected to commence on May 18.

FT  20 APR 94 / Restructuring charge set to wipe out LIG's net assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London International Group faces the near elimination of its net assets by a
'very substantial' restructuring charge for the year to March, according to
a statement issued yesterday.
In March 1993 shareholders' funds stood at Pounds 119.1m. The group, which
makes Durex condoms and Biogel and Marigold gloves, yesterday confirmed the
need to refinance. Its shares fell 8p to 121p.
The restructuring, foreshadowed in December, includes the closure of three
UK plants and the loss of 1,000 jobs at a cost of Pounds 19m, followed by
another 1,000 job losses worldwide.
LIG said it had appointed Mr Michael Moore as chairman to replace Mr Alan
Woltz, who is retiring. Mr Moore is chairman of Tomkins, Quicks Group and
Linx Printing Technologies, and of the NSPCC, the children's charity.
The group said it had sold its Buttercup, Liqufruta and Galloway's cough
mixture brands to Pfizer of the US for Pounds 11.2m, compared with a book
value of Pounds 500,000. It had also made progress towards disposing of its
ColourCare International photoprocessing activity.
The photoprocessing business, built up through acquisition at a cost of
Pounds 65m, has a book value of about Pounds 28m. One analyst said: 'It's
not so much what they can get for it, as how much it will cost to get rid of
it.'
As a result of the expected exceptional losses, Mr Nick Hodges, chief
executive, confirmed that the group would need a sizeable equity injection
through a refinancing. But this could not be finalised until the terms of
the photoprocessing sale had been agreed. New equity could come from
existing shareholders, a debt into equity swap or both.
The group's debt was Pounds 127.7m in the last accounts, but rose to Pounds
153.9m by the interim stage. Shareholders' funds dropped to Pounds 109.4m
following an after-tax loss of Pounds 7.5m for the six months. Analysts
expect the group to make a small pre-exceptional loss for the year.

FT  20 APR 94 / Bankers Trust hit by market turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The turmoil in international financial markets in February and March all but
wiped out reported trading profits at Bankers Trust, the US commercial bank
which has been one of the pioneers of the derivatives markets in recent
years.
The bank said trading income was Dollars 14m (Pounds 9.5m) in the first
quarter, down from a record Dollars 449m in the previous three months and
Dollars 346m in the first quarter of 1993.
It added that this did not represent a complete picture of its overall
trading results. Some Dollars 177m, reported as net interest income, had
been earned on holdings of bonds. If this is added in, overall trading
income was Dollars 191m, compared with Dollars 463m last year. The bank
blamed the decline on 'sharply lower revenue from proprietary trading and
positioning activities'. Trading in foreign exchange, government bonds and
emerging market debt and equity securities suffered the most, it added.
The fall in trading income was offset in part by higher income from selling
derivatives and other risk management instruments, Bankers Trust said.
These activities are under a cloud following threatened legal action last
week by Procter &amp; Gamble, which incurred after-tax losses of Dollars 102m on
two interest rate swaps contracts it bought from Bankers Trust.
Mr Charles Sanford, Bankers Trust chairman and chief executive, told the
annual meeting: 'We will win if they (Procter &amp; Gamble) want to sue us.' He
declined to comment further other than to say Bankers Trust has no legal
liability.
Despite the deteriorating trading results, the bank limited the fall in its
after-tax profits to Dollars 164m, or Dollars 1.90 a share, from Dollars
230m, or Dollars 2.64 a share, a year ago (before accounting changes).
Bonuses paid to staff tumbled by Dollars 109m, to Dollars 162m. Other
sources of income, such as fund management fees and other fees and
commissions, rose by around Dollars 100m.
Citibank also reported a sharp drop in its trading revenues in the first
quarter. It earned Dollars 71m, down from Dollars 457m a year before.
Gibson Greetings, a US greetings card and gift-wrap producer, said it had
taken a Dollars 16.7m charge against first-quarter earnings from unrealised
losses on interest rate derivatives transactions with Bankers Trust, Reuter
reports. 'The company should never have been put in a position like this as
we relied on Bankers Trust to advise us on these transactions,' Gibson said.
Bankers Trust said its actions had been legal and proper.

FT  20 APR 94 / Ashanti valued at Dollars 1.7bn: Shares priced at
top-of-the-range Dollars 20 and move to 3% premium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Ashanti Goldfields of Ghana, which owns one of the world's great
gold mines, were priced at Dollars 20 yesterday, at the top of the Dollars
17 to Dollars 20 range indicated in the March prospectus.
In conditional dealing, which started in London yesterday afternoon, the
shares immediately went to a premium of 60 cents, or 3 per cent, showing how
precisely the price had been fixed by Ashanti and its advisers James Capel
and Morgan Grenfell. Shortly after the market closed the shares were trading
at between Dollars 20.85 and Dollars 21.
At Dollars 20 a share, Ashanti is valued at Dollars 1.67bn. The Ghanaian
government, which sold shares to reduce its holding from 55 per cent to 31.3
per cent, will collect Dollars 316m. Ashanti, which issued new shares, will
bank Dollars 57m.
The price values the 43 per cent Ashanti stake owned by Lonrho, the UK-based
conglomerate, at about Dollars 720m - five times its present book value of
Pounds 90m. Lonrho's shares have risen strongly as the likely success of the
Ashanti offer became clear and they closed unchanged yesterday at 154p.
In spite of gold's lacklustre price performance, applications were received
for more than 100m Ashanti shares compared with the 20.2m offered globally.
This followed an international 'roadshow' which included more than 100
interviews in three weeks. The UK, North America and the rest of the world
each accounted for about a third of the applications.
James Capel, the 'global bookrunner', said each of the five international
syndicate managers would receive roughly the same number of shares. The
managers would consider the quality of the institutional investors, as well
as the quantity of shares they asked for, before deciding on the final
distribution. 'We want the biggest spread of high-quality, long-term
investors we can get.'
Of the 21.4m shares on offer, 17.9m are being sold by the Ghanaian
government and issued by Ashanti. Some 4m shares have been reserved for
Ghanaian investors. Unconditional dealings in London are planned to start on
April 26 when Ashanti will be included in the new Financial Times Gold Mines
Index.

FT  20 APR 94 / World-beating UK funds shift their focus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suddenly British fund managers can beat the world. At least, according to
the two leading pension fund measurement services, the Pounds 100bn overseas
equity portfolios of UK pension funds outperformed the FT-Actuaries World
ex-UK Index by between 11.3 per cent (as measured by WM) and an amazing 16.5
per cent (according to Caps).
Clearly there is something freakish about that, but another intriguing
statistic is that after underperforming in the US market for 10 years in a
row - on average undershooting the index return by 2.9 per cent annually -
the UK funds' portfolios outperformed in 1993, if only by 0.8 per cent.
Arguably the long unrewarded faith of UK-based managers in smaller
capitalisation US stocks had to pay off eventually.
Given the way that the overseas equity exposure of UK pension funds has
built up to 25 per cent of total assets, and almost a third of overall
exposure to equities, the poor long-term performance by UK-based managers in
running overseas equities has been a nagging weakness.
Seriously negative observations could be made, too, about Japan, where the
UK-based funds also lagged by nearly 3 per cent a year on average over the
10 years to 1992.
Such damaging statistics have been the basis of attempts by US and Japanese
managers to win specialist mandates from British funds, on arguments of
superior local management. And a marketing platform was created for
index-tracking funds.
British-based managers have certainly been open to criticism of the style in
which they have been running overseas equities. Trading activity has often
been around 100 per cent of portfolios, implying that half the holdings are
turned over each year, even though dealing costs can be higher than in the
UK where activity is typically only half as great.
Perhaps investment managers regard the UK equities as core holdings, whereas
overseas equities are managed on an aggressive hit-and-run basis. But that
is looking an out-of-date approach. Darker suspicions focus on the 0.5 per
cent turnover charges which several leading pension fund managers impose on
dealings in overseas equities, these days surely quite unjustifiably, except
perhaps for awkward emerging markets. The more the international portfolios
are churned, the bigger the managers' fees, but at a performance cost.
However, performance is improving. There was serious mid-1980s weakness
against the World Index. But in the past five years it has been beaten by 5
or 6 per cent a year; managers have surpassed index returns in Japan,
continental Europe and the Pacific (ex-Japan) and have trailed only
marginally in the US.
One explanation could be that the UK-based managers have been beefing up
their skills in order to cope with their increasing responsibilities in
global equities.
But since the beginning of 1990, when the Japanese market cracked, the World
Index has been a very undemanding target. By underweighting troubled Tokyo,
global managers have made huge relative gains. They have also been helped by
the weakness of financial stocks.
In fact the low exposure to Tokyo failed to pay off in 1993, because the
sluggishness of share prices was offset by the strength of the yen. London
managers gained heavily, however, from another strategy - to be underweight
in the US, the worst-performing main market last year.
At the end of the year the World ex-UK Index had a combined exposure of 71
per cent to the US and Japan, but British pension funds only had a
corresponding 33 per cent weighting. Those were big, big bets, and in 1994
many fund managers have been scrambling to restore their exposure to Japan,
where the index is up 22 per cent in sterling terms so far. They are
meanwhile exiting from south-east Asia, where in 1993 the 95 per cent return
meant that each percentage point of exposure produced almost a point of
outperformance, whereas this year Hong Kong and Thailand spell trouble.
As the world's markets swing wildly we may discover how much these
institutional managers have really profited from skill and judgment, and how
much from old-fashioned good fortune on the swings and roundabouts.

FT  20 APR 94 / Chrysler record shows strength of US recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysler yesterday underscored the strong recovery taking place in the US
vehicle market with a 77 per cent increase in underlying first-quarter
earnings and its most profitable quarter ever.
However, the results were only a little ahead of the Wall Street forecast
and Chrysler shares slid to Dollars 48 7/8 at lunchtime, down Dollars 2 1/4
.
Chrysler is the smallest of Detroit's Big Three motor manufacturers and the
first to report first-quarter figures.
Rivals General Motors and Ford are also expected to announce big
improvements in earnings, thanks to a boom in US sales of both cars, which
were up 15.5 per cent in the first quarter, and light trucks, which rose
22.9 per cent.
Chrysler, which faced financial difficulties in the early 1990s, has
benefited in particular from its range of new models, improvements in
production efficiency, and its strength in high margin products, such as
mini-vans and four-wheel drive sports utility vehicles.
The company reported net earnings of Dollars 938m (Pounds 642m), or Dollars
2.55 a share, compared with Dollars 530m, or Dollars 1.57 a share in the
same period of last year, excluding a Dollars 4.9bn non-cash charge taken in
1993 for a change in accounting practice. Sales and revenues rose from
Dollars 10.9bn to Dollars 13.2bn. Until now, Chrysler's highest quarterly
net earnings were Dollars 801m, made in the second period of 1984.
The group's first-quarter car sales in the US and Canada rose 8 per cent to
243,229 units, while truck sales were up 26 per cent at 382,066.
Its overall share of the market was 15.7 per cent, unchanged from the first
quarter of 1993. International sales rose 27 per cent to 28,305, with Europe
up 22 per cent to 16,882.
Chrysler Financial, the financial services arm, had net earnings of Dollars
47m, up from Dollars 37m last year before the effects of accounting changes.
Mr Robert Eaton, chairman, said he saw the steady improvement in industry
sales continuing and this, coupled with the strength of the company's
business, had persuaded Chrysler to approve capacity increases and new
hirings over the next three years. Chrysler announced last month it would
spend Dollars 1.8bn on increasing capacity by 500,000 units a year, to 3.5m
vehicles.

FT  20 APR 94 / British Coal offers Pounds 6,000 per miner for shift changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal is offering miners lump sums of Pounds 6,000 for radical
changes in working practices which will for the first time oblige them to
work weekends and extend the maximum rostered shift from 7 1/2 to 12 hours.
The offer - one of the most generous of its type in British industry - is
being opposed by unions, including the Union of Democratic Mineworkers which
says it provides inadequate compensation for the loss of opportunities for
miners to apply for generous redundancy payments.
Separately, miners at Tower colliery in south Wales yesterday abandoned
their fight to save the mine only four days after winning a reprieve. The
decision resulted from fears they could miss a British Coal redundancy
scheme which ends on April 30.
British Coal has told union leaders nationally that from next month the
maximum redundancy payment will be Pounds 27,000, against the existing
Pounds 44,000.
But even that will depend on their accepting the package including the
working hours deal. Failure to accept the deal would lead to 'state
redundancies only', with a maximum payment of less than Pounds 7,000.
Mr Mick Stevens, UDM general secretary for Nottinghamshire, yesterday
accused British Coal of blackmail. The offer was also condemned by Mr Arthur
Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers.
British Coal says basic annual working hours including holidays will remain
the same, but miners may be required to work at weekends, for which they
will be paid time-and-a-half.
The UDM is balloting members.

FT  20 APR 94 / US trade deficit soars as pace of partners' growth lags
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US trade deficit soared in February, reflecting faster economic growth
in the US than in most of its trading partners, the Commerce Department
reported yesterday.
The overall deficit on trade in goods and services rose to Dollars 9.7bn
(Pounds 6.6bn), against a revised Dollars 6.6bn in January. Most Wall Street
analysts had predicted a decline to Dollars 6bn or less.
The poor figures are likely to increase domestic political pressure on the
Clinton administration to take an aggressive stance in talks with Japan on
opening its domestic market.
The deficit on merchandise trade, on the customs basis, rose to Dollars
12.4bn, against Dollars 10.1bn in January, the highest monthly total since
the economic boom of the late 1980s. The deficit on trade in goods on the
new 'balance of payments' basis rose to Dollars 13.9bn. The surplus on trade
in services fell from Dollars 4.7bn to Dollars 4.2bn.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the deterioration was 'substantial'
and affected all categories of US trade. The figures would have a 'dampening
effect on first quarter GDP' and illustrated the risk to the US recovery
posed by slow growth in Europe and Japan.
Mr David Wyss, chief economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, the forecasting group,
said the higher deficit would reduce growth in the first quarter by about a
percentage point. However, gross domestic product was still likely to grow
at an annual rate of about 4 per cent, reflecting the buoyancy of other
components of demand. Other analysts revised down estimates of growth in the
first quarter to about 3 per cent at an annual rate. The poor February trade
figures reflected the combined impact of a 2.7 per cent rise in imports from
January and 2.6 per cent decline in exports.
Part of the deterioration reflected special factors. Exports of capital
goods were depressed by a sharp fall in aircraft exports. Oil imports rose
because of exceptionally cold weather.
The overall US trade deficit was Dollars 76.7bn last year, nearly double the
Dollars 39.7bn shortfall in 1992. Mr Wyss predicted the deficit would rise
to about Dollars 125bn this year, or about 2 per cent of GDP.

FT  20 APR 94 / Building sector recovery proves 'painfully slow'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The construction industry will never return to the peak levels of output and
employment seen in 1989, warned Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building
Employers Confederation yesterday.
Speaking as the confederation published its latest quarterly survey on work
prospects in the industry, Sir Brian said that in spite of further evidence
of a recovery, the pick-up was proving painfully slow.
'With the amount of spare capacity in the industry, higher productivity
through new technology, and the current low level of growth, it is hard to
see how the industry could reabsorb all the 500,000 workers lost since
1989,' he said. 'We are just not going to need as many people.'
'Historically, recoveries have brought greater construction investment than
we are now seeing,' said Sir Brian, who yesterday in his capacity as
chairman of the Construction Industry Employers Council met Mr John Major,
the prime minister, to discuss the state of the construction industry.
The Department of the Environment yesterday reported a 31 per cent increase
in construction orders in the three months to February 1994, compared with
the same period the previous year. The latest figures were boosted
considerably by about Pounds 500m of construction orders for the Jubilee
line Tube extension, many placed in December.
But there was evidence of an underlying growth trend. Private housing orders
rose 33 per cent in the three months to February compared with a year
earlier, although public housing and housing association orders fell 15 per
cent, taking the overall rise in housing orders to 19 per cent.
However, the building confederation said it did not foresee a return to the
industry's peak levels of output. Only 17 per cent of the companies surveyed
by the confederation were operating at close to capacity in the first three
months of 1994, and the organisation expected only gradual growth of around
2 per cent in 1994, and the same again in 1995.
About two-thirds of 600 companies questioned by the confederation last month
said their output was the same in the first quarter of 1994 as in the final
quarter of 1993, while a further 19 per cent reported a contraction in
output over the same period.
The survey revealed some recovery in confidence, with 42 per cent of
companies expecting more work in the second quarter. But only 15 per cent of
companies predicted an increase in jobs.

FT  20 APR 94 / The Lex Column: London International
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The story of London International Group is really one of two different
businesses. The photo-processing side, built up in the early 1980s when
condoms seemed to be going out of fashion, has brought it to the brink of
disaster. LIG's net assets will be more or less wiped out by the cost of
disposal. The condom and surgical gloves business is in theory now a growth
activity in a market in which LIG is a world leader. That represents value
which LIG and its advisers will surely be anxious to stress during the
looming restructuring.
The trouble is that LIG's condom business is not actually thriving at the
moment. Net operating margins slid below 3 per cent in the first half.
Italian pharmacists have been de-stocking as extra healthcare charges bite
and there have been other local difficulties in the US. On the most
optimistic assumptions, it will be the year after next before margins
recover to a more reasonable 15 per cent.
At the present level of sales, that would give operating profit of only
around Pounds 37.5m, less than the group has generated since 1989. The
multiple implicit in yesterday's closing price of 121p thus looks heroic.
Those anxious to look on the bright side might prefer to value the business
at twice sales given LIG's valuable condom brands. After adjustment for
debt, that would value the shares at over Pounds 2. But the price/earnings
multiple would then defy gravity, especially given the massive dilution
existing holders are likely to suffer in the restructuring.

Last year's full-year loss shows why Pechiney has not been in the vanguard
of French privatisation. While investors have been offered shares in other
cyclical companies, privatising the aluminium group while it is loss-making
would be politically sensitive.
That logic may explain Pechiney's enthusiasm for its proposed merger with
Compagnie Nationale du Rhone, the electricity generator. In addition to
making earnings less volatile, an early deal might help Pechiney report a
profit this year and open the way for privatisation.
In other respects, though, merger with CNR might harm Pechiney's case.
Adding utility earnings to the mix would dilute the group's recovery
potential just as aluminium prices are starting to turn. In an era of
demergers, international investors in particular could view the exercise as
unnecessary. Pechiney's previous attempts at diversification have not
changed its essentially cyclical nature. A large part of Pechiney's swing
into loss arose from problems at American National Can, acquired in 1988 as
part of a wider move into packaging.
Without CNR, Pechiney's prospects turn on action now being taken to relieve
overcapacity. The aluminium price will only sustain its recent rise if cuts
promised by large producers are seen to stick. The timing of recovery is
thus uncertain. But that should not in itself be a hurdle to eventual
privatisation if Pechiney has the patience to wait.

FT  20 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Property valuation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Any professional body which examines its working practices and recommends
that its members should work harder to produce vaguer conclusions should be
treated with suspicion. For that reason, it would easy to dismiss the Royal
Institution of Charterered Surveyors' review as a charter for fatter fees
and greater obfuscation. It certainly seems odd that the authors felt it
necessary to make 43 densely argued recommendations if their chief aim was
to encourage greater credibility, reliability and clarity.
The need for surveyors to justify their valuation techniques was plain to
see following the Queens Moat Houses fiasco. To its credit, RICS has faced
up to that challenge and consulted widely with its clients and other related
professions. The recommendations encouraging the wider dissemination of data
and the principle of greater disclosure are particularly welcome. It would
be a fine thing indeed if surveyors could provide fuller and more regular
explanations of their valuations in company accounts.
RICS is also candid enough to admit that the supreme objective of valuation
 -accuracy - may always elude the surveyor's grasp. Yet that does not
matter. After all, if everyone agreed about a property's precise value there
would be no market. It is the very imperfections in valuations which produce
both buyers and sellers. The task of the valuer must be to produce
comprehensive and objective data about which investors can honourably
disagree.

FT  20 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Just kidding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are red faces at Kidder Peabody over its phantom Dollars 350m profits.
Though the US investment house does not appear to have lost money as a
result of the scam, the fake earnings helped mask a poor performance in the
business as a whole. Kidder is now in the unhappy position of having to
report first-quarter losses of roughly Dollars 140m. Top management has been
quick to blame its predicament on Mr Joseph Jett, the firm's former chief
bond trader who has now been fired. But it seems that Kidder's controls and
incentives were not best designed to minimise the risks of this sort of
scam.
Part of the problem is that top management did not question the wonderful
trading strategy that was generating such fabulous profits. Now that it has
done so, it has discovered it was based on exploiting a glitch in Kidder's
accounting system which allowed Mr Jett to book profits that did not exist.
The suspicion is that Mr Jett's colleagues, happy that his contribution was
helping turn around the overall business, were too willing to suspend
disbelief.
Kidder's remuneration system may also have played a part. Mr Jett's salary
and bonus - Dollars 9m last year - were closely tied to the profitability of
his unit and most of it was paid in cash. The trend in the industry is away
from cash bonuses and towards paying in shares that can only be cashed after
a period of years. The main motive is to deter stars from jumping ship to
rival firms. But Kidder's embarrassment should provide another motive. The
closer an individual's interests are aligned with those of his firm, the
less incentive that person has to book profits that are not sustainable in
the long run.

Inkatha's 11th hour decision to take part in the elections has created
daunting practical problems - not least how to get its name on 80m ballot
papers writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg.
Regional and national ballot papers have already been printed and there is
no plan to pulp them.
Tens of thousands of officials from the Independent Electoral Commission
will have to spend their weekend affixing to the papers adhesive stickers
bearing Inkatha's name, logo and Chief Buthelezi's photograph.
To cater for the increase in expected voters in KwaZulu/ Natal province, a
further 700 polling booths will have to be set up and monitors hired and
trained to staff them.
Not only does Inkatha have to submit candidates to the IEC by tomorrow
night, but legislation to pass the constitutional amendments has to be drawn
up by the multi-party negotiating council, ratified by the governing
Transitional Executive Council and then approved by parliament as its final
act next Monday.

FT  20 APR 94 / They've really got a hold on EU: US investment banks are
increasingly dominant in European financial markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Along Fleet Street, where Britain's national newspapers used to dominate the
skyline, a new set of institutions has moved in. By taking the place of the
Daily Telegraph and others, US investment banks such as Goldman Sachs are
changing the face of the City. It is not the only way in which they are
upsetting traditions in financial centres across Europe.
The boom in securities markets over the past two years has allowed the
American 'bulge bracket' firms - so called because they have the lion's
share of the US investment banking business - to strengthen their grip in
Europe. They have achieved it so effectively that European merchant banks
which once dismissed them as a competitive threat are increasingly
struggling to keep up.
Perhaps more than anything, what the US banks have brought to London is the
blueprint for life after the Big Bang deregulation of the City in 1986. 'The
Americans brought us the integrated securities house,' says Mr Nick Verey,
director at investment bank SG Warburg, one of the UK firms which itself has
set out to follow the blueprint.
The US model of investment banking - combining stockbroking, underwriting,
trading, corporate advisory and fund management services under a single roof
 -was unheard of in London before deregulation. This model has been imitated
by many European firms, but some are still struggling to combine the roles
of different financial specialisms.
The US push into Europe has been well-rewarded in the past year. Their
corporate finance arms that advise on acquisitions and help companies to
raise capital have gained business from the wave of cross-border
transactions and privatisations. At the same time, the securities broking
operations of US firms have made windfall profits in buoyant trading
conditions.
This is in sharp contrast to the late 1980s when several US investment banks
arrived in London after Big Bang. Some made costly errors competing with
established players in gilt-edged market-making and corporate bond
underwriting. They also found it hard to dislodge old loyalties between
companies and their merchant banks.
Yet few European banks now underestimate the force of the competition from
the US. The difficulties encountered by US firms in London forced them to
build pan-European operations. 'For us, European work was everything, so we
went at it with intensity,' says Mr Richard Sharp, Goldman Sachs' chief
operating officer for European investment banking services.
The question is whether US investment banks will maintain their commitment
to Europe in harder times. The tightening of US monetary policy in the past
two months has disrupted capital markets while European privatisations and
corporate restructuring are likely to subside in the long term. 'The US
partners of these firms may get sick of Europe pretty fast as soon as
profits flag,' says a director of one European bank.
A number of reasons lie behind the strong push into Europe by the US firms
in the 1990s:
The control exercised by 'bulge bracket' firms over equity and bond
underwriting in the US market brought them strong profits from which to
finance expansion. Despite fierce competition, the US markets are more
profitable for investment banks than those in Europe. Equity underwriting
fees in the US range between 5 per cent and 7 per cent of the value of the
transaction, compared with about 1 per cent in Europe, and the volume of
capital market issues is far higher.
This gives them two advantages. One is strong capital with which to
underwrite securities transactions. A second is that they have cash to
expand - and can even afford to make errors. 'They have got extremely deep
pockets, and they can devote resources of the highest quality,' says Mr
James Sassoon, a director of SG Warburg. US firms' influence with investors
in the US means that European companies raising capital - and governments
privatising enterprises - often need their help. 'Governments tend to hire
the flagship local bank first, and then a US firm to make sure the
transaction gets done,' says Mr Kevan Watts, head of investment banking in
Europe for Merrill Lynch.
The large number of graduate business schools gives US firms access to a
wide pool of trained staff. 'It helps to have a lot of skills, and that
needs mass,' says Mr John Studzinski, managing director of Morgan Stanley's
financial advisory arm in London. US firms pioneered techniques of valuing
companies and their subsidiaries during takeover battles in the 1980s, and
retain an edge over some European firms. 'We tend to have a different
approach to valuation and tactics from some Europeans. We are more
free-thinking, and we fight for the highest price,' says Mr Alan Gillespie,
a managing director of Goldman Sachs.
The US firms brought with them expertise in the design and trading of
derivatives. The growth of the London Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe)
coincided with the rise of US firms in London, and although futures and
interest rate and currency swaps were well established, trading in these
products was largely engineered by the US houses.
European derivatives trading exchanges have gained trading volume from US
participation. 'Before the Americans, there was no such thing as a 'local'
on the floor of Liffe,' recalled the head of one commodities house. Locals
are individuals who trade financial futures purely for speculative purposes
and are credited with providing much of the liquidity and momentum needed
for trading.
Although the US banks remain selective - concentrating on advising the
biggest blue chip companies and trading only in selected bond and equity
markets - these factors have led to their rapid growth in Europe. Goldman
Sachs' operation in London has grown from 150 staff a decade ago to 1,750
today. Last year Merrill Lynch made 20 per cent of its pre-tax profits in
Europe and the Middle East compared with 10 per cent in 1991.
US firms still carry out advisory and underwriting work mainly in
cross-border transactions, but they have established some hold in domestic
markets from which they were earlier excluded. Even in Britain, which has a
long merchant banking tradition, banks such as Schroders and SG Warburg face
a threat to their traditional monopoly of large industrial companies.
Mr Gillespie of Goldman Sachs says big UK companies now tend to employ a US
firm as well as their merchant bank. 'For a while the merchant banks fought
against it, but they accept it now,' he says. 'Having someone in the room
who does not think just from the perspective of south-east England can be a
useful stimulus,' says Mr Watts of Merrill Lynch.
Yet the US banks face obstacles to reinforcing their hold in Europe. One
difficulty is that they are costly operations which recoup expenses by
charging high fees. There is still some resistance to this among European
companies. 'Americans accept fees as a fact of life. Europeans have to be
convinced of the value they are getting,' says Mr Studzinski.
A second difficulty is that European banks can learn the techniques which
give US banks an edge. An example is the US practice of bookbuilding -
canvassing institutional funds to establish the best price for an equity
issue - which has now been copied in Europe by banks such as SG Warburg.
Perhaps most important, European banks can still play effectively on the
perception that US firms lack commitment to European markets, and fail to
understand them fully. Mr Guy Dawson, head of corporate finance at Morgan
Grenfell, the UK merchant bank owned by Deutsche Bank, says that German
companies may still harbour doubts about US rivals.
'All other things being equal, European companies prefer to deal with
European banks, if they are credible institutions. A German company knows
we're there to stay,' he says. US banks argue perceptions are changing since
some have now been around for several decades. 'The new kid on the block
argument wanes after a few years,' says Mr Sharp of Goldman Sachs.
Yet the argument will resurface if the unhappy turn in the bond and equity
markets leads US banks to retrench in Europe. Some Europeans argue that
their US rivals remain relatively unstable institutions, driven by a trading
ethos rather than commitment to long-term client relationships, and
vulnerable to defections by highly-paid staff in bad times.
'On the whole, the American firms are very fragile. They are run on an
explosive mixture of fear and greed, and are hard to hold together when
things get tough,' says one director of a European bank. US firms'
commitment may be more enduring this time, but increased competition in less
stable capital markets will test their appetite for Europe.

FT  20 APR 94 / Leading Article: Hope for South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Once again, South Africa's leaders peered into the abyss and stepped back
from the brink. The collective sigh of relief at yesterday's agreement
between the National party, the African National Congress and the Inkatha
Freedom party, allowing the latter to participate in next week's elections,
was almost audible. Provided the spirit as well as the letter of the accord
is respected by all parties, it will rank as a milestone on South Africa's
bumpy road to democracy.
The country's deep-rooted political violence will certainly not end, but it
can now at least be curbed. Notwithstanding the prospect of a tense campaign
in Natal, the intolerant atmosphere in parts of the eastern Cape, and the
hostility of many white farmers to campaigners from the ANC, South Africa
now has a reasonable chance of conducting an election which will reflect the
wishes of most of its citizens.
Since Mr Nelson Mandela's release from prison in February 1990, tragic and
violent events have repeatedly come close to derailing the transition to
democracy. None of them, however, posed quite the same destabilising threat
as that of Chief Mangosuthu's Buthelezi's stand over the status and powers
of KwaZulu-Natal. The mayhem in central Johannesburg three weeks ago, the
imposition of a state of emergency on Natal and the subsequent collapse of
the financial rand threatened a disastrous start to the new South Africa.
Yesterday's agreement offers a real chance of defusing this conflict, so
long as all three parties draw appropriate lessons from it. The most obvious
is that the fundamental constitutional issue at the heart of the crisis can
not now be brushed aside. Chief Buthelezi may have made almost all the
concessions to achieve yesterday's deal, but that does not mean he did not
have a point in demanding a greater measure of devolution than is provided
for under the constitutional principles agreed thus far.
The powers of Natal and the eight other provincial assemblies, and the
extent to which these powers can be overidden by central government, will
continue to be a critical factor in South African politics. It will be for
the National Assembly elected next week to find a more satisfactory way of
squaring this circle when it draws up the final constitution.
Second, there are at least some grounds for hope that a healthier political
climate can now develop, in which the ANC, rather than indulging in
winner-takes-all triumphalism, will face real electoral competition - not
least in Natal. If the result is more substantial political checks and
balances than hitherto appeared likely, that will be all to the good.
Third, yesterday's agreement - due in part to the good offices of a Kenyan
negotiator - showed the potential worth of international mediation. It may
well be needed again after the election to assist with the constitutional
problem. South Africa's political crisis has been defused, but not yet
resolved.

Not even John Patten's alma mater likes his ideas very much. As education
secretary, Patten has spearheaded the government's policy of persuading
Britain's state schools to opt out of local authority control. But parents
at Patten's old school - Wimbledon College, a Catholic boys' school in
London - have voted against parting company with the Labour-
controlled borough of Merton. Last year John Major was similarly embarrassed
when his old school, Rutlish, also voted against opting-out.
Patten was flogged by the Jesuits who run Wimbledon College for his poor
performance in mathematics. Inhuman or degrading corporal punishment is now
illegal under the 1993 Education Act; fortunately there is as yet no ban on
public humiliation of former pupils.

Spain's Repsol oil company is sounding defensive over the choice of Ronaldo
Schmitz for its new international advisory board. Schmitz's recent claim to
fame is, of course, as supervisory board chairman of Metallgesellschaft, the
German company that teetered on the brink of collapse after dropping DM2.3bn
on oil futures.
Repsol invited him to join several months ago on the grounds of his
experience in the chemical industry and as a board member of Deutsche Bank -
'not as an oil specialist'. Schmitz does speak Spanish, and headed BASF's
Barcelona subsidiary in the mid-1970s.
The new board, which includes Cookson chairman Bob Malpas and the Catalan
head of Nestle's food division Ramon Masip, has so far met only once.
Schmitz, as it happens, was unable to attend since he was at a pressing
meeting - with Metallgesellschaft.

The world of advertising can breathe more easily; the sensitive souls of the
Advertising Standards Authority can sleep more easily in their beds at
night; and the feature writers of the world's press will have to turn
elsewhere for whacky Italian copy.
For photographer Oliviero Toscani, 53, says he has resigned from Benetton,
going in a huff after clashing with Aldo Palmeri, managing director of
Benetton's unusual magazine Colors.
Toscani was behind Benetton's controversial advertising campaigns which
featured such things as human genitals and a dying AIDS patient. Apparently
he's fed up because 'like all accountants (Palmeri) knows nothing of
creative work. He has stuck me with a small-time publisher that can't even
get the office toilets to work'.
The feeling is mutual it seems. Says Palmeri: 'To understand business
management, you need an education, you need to read books, but Toscani's
cultural level is simply sub-human.' Boys, boys - it's only advertising,
after all.

Mike Bett, former deputy chairman of BT and current president of the
Institute of Personnel Management, has just taken on one of the most
delicate missions of his career; he is to head the UK government's review
body into military pay and conditions.
He's been on duty for less than a month but a few clues to his campaign can
already be gleaned from the latest issue of Personnel Management Plus
magazine. It could turn out to be explosive stuff.
'If the civilian organisations are developing flatter structures with fewer
layers, perhaps we should be asking whether the same should be happening in
the forces,' he says in the magazine. What does that mean - farewell to
captains, colonels and the officers' mess? Bett refuses to put his head
above the parapet on that one.
More intriguingly, Bett has also been put in charge of looking at
performance-related pay for the armed forces. So let's welcome the new model
army: bonuses rather than medals for especial valour; extra cash for
particularly smart saluting; an army marching on its share options;
empowered lions; redundant donkeys.
'I'm only 18 days into the thing . . .,' says Bett, who insists that he's
only following orders, in his case the terms of reference of the review.
If you thought Sir Patrick Sheehy's report on police pay and conditions was
controversial, wait for this one.

FT  20 APR 94 / Leading Article: Russia's CIS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia has waited 2 1/2 years, but its patience is being rewarded. Its
surrounding peoples, many of them long accustomed to its domination, are now
willing to trade a diminution of their new-found independence for what they
hope will prove a less rigorous economic regime.
At the summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States last Friday, Russia
considerably advanced what it sees as its interests. All the CIS states are
now in the economic union, though terms vary. All have agreed to work
towards a customs union. Most have agreed that Russian troops can guard
their external borders.
We have not returned to Soviet days. The meetings are not mere shows of
unanimity: the leaderships of Kazakhstan and Ukraine have substantial
differences with Russia, and say so - if less forcefully than they once did.
But it has become fashionable for the Russian political class to refer
contemptuously to the 'romantic period' after the fall of the Soviet Union,
when Russians and others believed a rapid transition to democracy and market
economics would save them all.
Yet it is not romantic to believe that Russia will not thrive while it
remains both imperially-minded and authoritarian. It is also not romantic to
argue that Russia cannot afford to support economies in worse shape than it
own; that it courts still greater violence by intervening in every
surrounding theatre of war; and that it should show its determination to
become a normal state by encouraging the formation of healthy statehood in
its weaker neighbours.
The romanticism lies, instead, in the return to an undefined but strongly
felt 'great power' status, increasingly peddled in Russia. As the dwindling
band of democrats has stressed, the re-emergence of imperial Russia would
vitiate its fragile new political institutions and break the back of any
rational financial policy. That Russia is an important state is in no doubt:
that it has large interests is beyond question; but that it should respect
the sovereignty of its neighbours is a sine qua non of both its and everyone
else's security.
The decisions of the CIS member states on Friday were not yet to
reconstitute the Soviet Union. Even the closest union agreed so far, between
Russia and Belarus, may not reach that point. In any case, creation of
rational economic links among countries seriously engaged in reform would be
highly desirable. A judgment needs to be formed on whether the current
development of the CIS offers such economic links or rather a collective
effort to evade the need for reform.
Russia's behaviour towards its so-called 'near abroad' has again become a
central issue in defining the country's relations with the west. In response
the west will need to draw lines, on the scale of economic assistance and in
terms of its military and diplomatic posture. These are now difficult, but
inescapable judgments.

FT  20 APR 94 / Leading Article: Fudging the Post
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The so-called 'BP option' for privatising the British Post Office seems to
be gaining ground. This, it may be recalled, would involve the government
floating a minority stake in the Post Office while retaining majority
control, as it did with BP until the 1980s.
According to the Post Office, this would satisfy two conflicting objectives.
On the one hand, the public is mostly hostile to full privatisation, on the
grounds that it might jeopardise the service. On the other, the Post Office
seems to be winning converts to its argument that public ownership prevents
it from investing in new forms of electronic and computer mail, without
which it risks becoming a dinosaur.
The BP option, it is argued, would free it financially while leaving
responsibility for its operations with the government. Thus, the more timid
Tory backbenchers might be induced to vote for it on the grounds that it is
neither quite one thing nor the other.
Financial freedom certainly seems justified. Last year, the Treasury allowed
the Post Office to invest only three-quarters of what it wanted to. This may
seem bizarre for a consistently profitable operation which has no debt and
over Pounds 500m in cash. But in the curious world of the Treasury any
investment is undesirable, since it contributes to the nation's budget
deficit. Meanwhile, the annual dividend which the Treasury extracts from the
Post Office - currently Pounds 181m, or virtually the whole of its net
profit - is by private sector reckoning imprudently high.
The other side of the argument is less satisfactory. It is by no means clear
that majority government ownership would in fact offer safeguards to the
opponents of privatisation.
Doubtless, the government would nominate a couple of directors to the board.
Certainly, the Treasury would have to settle for a more realistic dividend.
But privatisation is an all-or-nothing process. Once the government had
brought in outside investors on a commercial footing, it would find it very
hard to interfere with the Post Office's operations on anything other than a
commercial basis. This would be as true if it sold 10 per cent as if it sold
the lot.
On a slightly cynical view, this is an argument in the BP option's favour.
One need only look at the mechanics of even a partial privatisation to see
the benefits. The prospectus would have to set out the Post Office's
ambitious plans to invest in new technology and expand overseas, thus
submitting to objective scrutiny a strategy whose outlines have so far been
left studiously vague. It would have to set out the terms on which the Post
Office would be regulated. Above all, it would have to specify how far the
Post Office's monopoly would be left in place.
As an attempt to fudge the issues, the BP option is questionable. As a means
to an end, it might just work.

FT  20 APR 94 / Overworked and over here
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the days before Big Bang, before US investment banks launched their
assault on London, a contemporary joke went like this:
Question: Why does a stockbroker never hold meetings on Wednesdays?
Answer: Because that would ruin two weekends.
British bankers say the joke would fall flat today - when the Americans
arrived they brought a work ethic that quickly ended three-hour lunches with
wine, and a work day lasting from 10am to 5pm.
Mr Bob Gibson, chief executive of ESN Pension Scheme, the UK's second
largest scheme, says US investment banks have no such thing as a social
lunch. 'It could be a five-course lunch, but they are continually handing
you documents while you get cabbage all over them,' Mr Gibson says.
British clients of the US banks have now adopted some of their more ascetic
and businesslike customs. 'We were told you had to offer alcohol to the
Brits,' said one American investment banker. 'But now we find that they also
don't drink it.'
The change in ethos has been under way since the late 1980s, but it is now
solidly entrenched in City custom. Beyond the visible trappings of corporate
behaviour - the mineral water, the fascination with squash courts - London
bankers say they have had to adopt the robust American approach to
competition and conducting business.
For instance, unlike some European counterparts, US investment banks do not
think it unseemly to say how keenly they are seeking business, and are adept
at aggressive sales pitches to investors.
Calpers, the California state employees retirement fund which is the largest
US public sector pension scheme, gives prospective fund managers only 15
minutes for a sales pitch. 'After that, it's like the old-fashioned
burlesque shows - a big sack comes down and you're out,' one fund manager
says.
The importing of US business culture has had other effects. The Wall Street
practice of taping telephone conversations on trading desks - useful in a
dispute about what deal was struck - has now been adopted by most London
houses.
And while some US firms have been aware their style can grate on clients and
competitors, most have taken pains to preserve elements of their corporate
culture.
'When we came here we didn't want to be the Ugly American,' said a Goldman
Sachs partner. 'But every European we hire we send to the States for between
three and nine months. We want them to be Goldman Sachs employees.' A major
aspect of this staff management is to develop a team ethos, integrating
various specialities.
Mr Walter Gubert, head of Europe for JP Morgan, says US firms venturing
abroad must learn to mix their approach to markets with an understanding of
local culture.
'Over time, the firms that will win are those that do not just import
techniques, but adapt them to the local culture,' he says. 'Banks need a
multi-cultural group of people. The management challenge is to motivate them
and make them work together even though they are English, Italian and German
and sit in different offices.'
But most banks do not allow such bows in the direction of cultural
sensitivity to undermine the aggressive pursuit of business.
Mr Alan Gillespie, Goldman Sachs managing director for UK investment banking
services, says: 'We do a lot of initiating of ideas, whereas if a chief
executive wants advice from his merchant bank, he often has to ask them to
come round'.
US investment bankers can also be less willing to take no for an answer.
'The European attitude if you do not get a piece of business is, 'I'm
terribly sorry. How could we have done better?' The Americans often send
another Concorde load over from New York to argue,' says one European
banker.
Perhaps, some bankers argue, the nature of the marketplace in London has
changed significantly since Big Bang, and US investment bankers are better
suited to thrive in it. Mr Richard Sharp, Goldman Sachs chief operating
officer for investment banking services in Europe, says US firms have an
advantage because they have years of experience in similar conditions.
Since Big Bang and the arrival of integrated securities firms, investment
bankers have had to think not only about making a specific sale but whether
that sale could also lead to business in other parts of the bank. US
investment banks' longstanding team approach gave them a head start over
those still viewing the markets in a fragmented fashion.
'It is not to do with being American, but with a culture of trading and risk
taking,' Mr Sharp says. 'The liquidity of the US markets gives us the
experience and self-confidence to build businesses here. We know the profits
that can be made'

FT  20 APR 94 / Talking shop soon open for ideas: European works council
legislation strikes a nerve among employers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A European committee for informing and consulting employees shall be
established in every Community-scale undertaking.' It sounds harmless enough
but the planned extension to the European Union's employment legislation,
discussed by ministers yesterday in Brussels, has provoked an angry reaction
from European business.
'The way some businessmen talk, you would think we were proposing to
establish Soviets of workers and peasants in every European company,' says
Mr Willy Buschak of the European Trade Union Confederation in Brussels.
The committees, or works councils, are back in the limelight because an
attempt to reach a deal on a voluntary consultation procedure between the
confederation and Unice, the European employers body, broke down this month.
An EU directive should be passed by October, and will become law two years
later, with a further two years for works councils to be set up.
About 1,000 multinational companies, those with at least 1,000 employees in
Europe and with operations in at least two EU countries, will be affected.
The works councils, of about 30 management and employee representatives in
total, will meet at least once a year, although a sub-committee may meet
more often in the event, for instance, of a merger or redundancy
announcement.
British companies are not directly affected, because the government won an
opt-out from some aspects of social legislation during negotiation of the
Maastricht treaty. But about 100 UK-owned multinationals will be covered
through their continental European operations, and many are likely to
include their British employees in the works council system. Some UK
government critics claim that this inclusion illustrates the limited
effectiveness of the opt-out.
But because the UK is no longer formally involved in formulating the
legislation, a big obstacle to the directive becoming law has been
eliminated. The other 11 member states are happy to support the initiative
and it is only British objections which have stalled it over recent years.
But why, if EU governments appear sanguine about the issue, are European
businesses antagonistic? And what effect will the works councils have on
European multinationals?
The debate about worker consultation goes back 20 years, but has taken on a
new lease of life since the arrival of the internal market last year and the
growth of cross-border mergers within Europe.
Statutory systems for informing and consulting workers exist within larger
companies in most individual EU member states, with the notable exception of
the UK. To Commission officials and European trade unions it seems logical
to extend such mechanisms to the European level in multinationals.
Further, there has been a feeling in parts of the Commission that much
recent legislation, such as the single market, has benefited business, 'and
it is about time we did something for labour to balance things out', as one
Commission official puts it.
Mr John Monks, general-secretary of the British Trades Union Congress, says
unions have long supported the notion of the 'stakeholder' company, in which
employees have the legal right to be consulted about matters which affect
them. They have also seen European works councils as the first step towards
Europe-wide collective bargaining and, perhaps most useful from their point
of view, as an opportunity for trade union networking at employers' expense.
The Commission has calculated that the cost of travel, interpreters, and so
on, could amount to Ecu10 per employee a year, or several hundred thousand
pounds a year for larger companies.
But cost is not the main objection from Europe's employers. There is anxiety
about the vagueness of what 'consultation' will mean and about the number of
meetings that will, in practice, be required each year. IBM Europe says that
if any management proposal with 'serious consequences' for employees is the
criterion under which a meeting should be convened, more than 3,000 meetings
would have been needed last year.
But the biggest problem with the scheme, employers say, is its
inflexibility. Mr Alan Wild, employee relations director at Guinness, the
international drinks group, says there would have been far less hostility if
the Commission had demanded companies should inform and consult employees
but had left the method to the companies themselves.
'At Guinness, for example, we do not take decisions at a European level, so
we will have to create a new management layer to participate in the works
council discussions,' he says. A further anomaly will arise at GrandMet's
Burger King subsidiary, which includes Africa and the Middle East in its
European management responsibilities.
Mr Peter Reid, of the British Engineering Employers Federation, says central
management involvement in works councils at European level, when so many
experiments in consultation take place at local level, will be 'unhelpful'.
He rebuts the proposition that British employers are uniquely worried about
the legislation because, unlike their continental counterparts, they are not
familiar with statutory consultation systems. Mr Howard Davies,
director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, the UK employers
body, adds that the record of British companies in consulting their workers
is improving year by year.
It is not only UK companies which are complaining. Mrs Regine Matthijsen,
head of international industrial relations at Philips, the Dutch electronics
group, says: 'The directive is the wrong, static approach. It will certainly
slow down decision-making.'
But in its home base of the Netherlands, Philips has learned to value a
statutory works council system for negotiating with employees. That makes
Philips more relaxed about consultation than some of its UK rivals.
So are the fears of European employers exaggerated? The pending works
council legislation has struck a nerve because, unlike most social
legislation, it creates a high-level corporate structure rather than
refining existing systems, such as those which operate health and safety or
maternity provisions.
But the experience of the 35 European works councils which have been
established voluntarily in multinationals such as the German car group
Volkswagen and Bull, the French computer group, suggests they can be useful
forums for communication.
'It really does help us understand what the company is doing, and that makes
employees readier to accept management decisions,' says Mr Brian Revell, an
official of the TGWU general union. He is a member of the Nestle works
council, and recently attended the Swiss food company's annual meeting for a
overview of company strategy. He says the company has been responsive to
ideas arising from the councils, such as investigating how to get more women
into senior management.
Most unions, however, take a more sceptical view. They see consultation as
at best a means to delay unpopular decisions and do not expect to be able to
challenge management prerogatives. But in their current weakened state amid
high unemployment Europe's unions are happy to enjoy the 'institutional
presence' that the legislation will give them.
And, privately, many senior managers admit that the councils will be more of
a nuisance than a serious obstacle to their corporate plans. 'We will be
able to manage the system so that it has relatively little impact,' said
one.

<TEXT>
Sir, I am somewhat confused by Martin Wolf's arguments ('A fortress would be
no defence') against Labour protection. He argues for lower levels of
protection so that European workers can 'compete' in a world market, parts
of which employ child labour or adult workers at a fraction of European
labour costs.
I would be surprised if an article in the FT said anything else. Yet can
this be the same Martin Wolf writing in the recent issue of Demos? His
article on unemployment in that magazine states: 'The best possibility,
however, would be to imitate the Japanese . . . The Japanese solution was
the highest rate of formation of physical and human capital in the
industrial world, combined with a labour market that gave new opportunities
to outsiders and job protection to insiders. This is the only route towards
the trio of higher output, higher employment and better jobs.'

<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER INGRAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'A fortress would be no defence' (April 15), argues that
the EU's economic viability depends on liberal trade and less distorted
labour markets. In the UK, labour market reform is regarded as having made a
positive contribution to the efficient operation of the economy. Such
'flexibility' has become synonymous with shorter job tenures, insecurity of
employment and the belief that the further removal of market restrictions
will boost productivity and provide economically consistent wages.
Further destabilisation of the UK labour market could prove
counter-productive. The future source of UK productivity growth and
competitiveness is unlikely to be reinforced by reforms which cause
insecurity and instability in the workplace. Instead, the appropriate
competitive response is to foster a functionally flexible, high
productivity, multi-skilled workforce. Where job tenures are more enduring,
employers have the opportunity to realise returns on investments in training
and human capital.
The benefits of stable interaction between management and employees lie
behind the pronounced flexibility found in Japanese firms with their
emphasis on relational contracts and long-term employment. In Britain this
flexibility has been assisted by the reform of trade unions which has
allowed management to consolidate control over workplace organisation. In
the interests of future productivity and competitiveness, the fashion for
increased instability in 'freer' labour markets should be tempered in favour
of more beneficial forms of flexibility. Seeking to compete on price with
low-wage economies is an incorrect labour market response to the free trade
challenge.

FT  20 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: No easy money in libraries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROSS SHIMMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, So 'anyone can play with the idea of running a library' can they?
('Libraries up for grabs', April 13).
Public libraries are among the most popular and most heavily-used of public
services. They are an essential element in the quality of life of local
users.
They support the educational, leisure and business activities of their
communities. They are not political footballs or the playthings of 'bookish
entrepreneurs, management consultancies, retired librarians or leisure
companies'.
It is true that the government wishes to find out whether parts of public
library services or even whole services can be contracted out. We at the
Library Association are extremely sceptical as to whether they can be,
without adversely affecting the services they provide. The Brent initiative
is one of five schemes currently in progress and subject to monitoring by a
steering committee set up by the Department of National Heritage.
However public libraries are delivered in the future, the legal requirement
for local authorities to provide a 'comprehensive and efficient' library
service to all who live, work and study in the area remains - and the core
services have to be free at the point of delivery. So a contractor will be
required to ensure that they continue to provide such a service.
Nor is there a quick buck to be made in renting CDs or videos as mooted by
your correspondent - copyright legislation will prevent that.

FT  20 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Time ripe for review of utility
regulatory system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr DIETER HELM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your editorial, 'Sizing up the watchdogs' (April 15), you rightly
assert that 'there is a premium on predictability and the reduction of
regulatory risk'. However, it is far from obvious that the existing system
of utility regulation meets this criterion.
Fearful of political interference, utility regulators have been given
considerable discretion in carrying out their duties. The personality
matters greatly. Witness, for example, the change in tone in the gas and
telecoms industries with the change in incumbent. Under a different
government, simply changing the personalities would have a big impact.
The multiplicity of regulatory bodies adds to the problem of discretion.
With the convergence of many utility businesses likely to gather pace after
the periodic reviews in the water and electricity industries this summer,
the competition between regulators which you promote as being a healthy
feature of the current system becomes critical in determining market
outcomes. The most graphic example arises in the electricity and gas
industries in the run-up to franchise abolition in 1988. The merger of two
bodies, Offer and Ofgas, would increase regulatory certainty, and save
public money by reducing administrative costs.
The time is ripe for a thorough review of the system. After a decade it is
worth reflecting on the lessons of experience. However, your suggestion that
such a review should be conducted by the Office of Fair Trading is
disingenuous. Given that the director general of the OFT has publicly
defended the merits of the current system and argued against change, it is
hardly appropriate for the OFT to conduct such a review.
The right place is the Department of Trade and Industry, responsible as the
sponsoring ministry for most of the utility regulatory bodies. For, although
the ideal of a purely technical solution has attractions, there are
inevitably political issues at stake in utility regulation. To pretend
otherwise is either naive or dangerous.

protect themselves, let alone the 'safe areas' which they were mandated to
protect.
In a common-sense world one of two things would now happen. Either Unprofor
would be built up to a strength allowing it to fulfil its mandate, or it
would be withdrawn. Actually, neither of those things will happen, because
both are considered incompatible with its 'humanitarian role'.
Again and again we are told that Unprofor has saved thousands of lives, by
enabling aid convoys to get through to beleaguered populations, and by
securing a ceasefire at least in parts of the country. Its withdrawal would
put those lives in jeopardy again: aid would no longer get through, and
fighting would resume on a much broader front.
But, the argument goes on, giving Unprofor the troops and the orders to
resist Serb attacks on the 'safe areas' would also jeopardise those lives.
Until last week's crisis, 75 per cent of the aid was coming in through
Serb-held territory; and, if the UN became a belligerent in Gorazde, it
would no longer be able to maintain the ceasefire in Sarajevo or elsewhere.
Thus, yet again, humanitarian arguments are used to explain the failure of
governments to make clear strategic decisions. The question that has to be
asked is whether humanitarian work should have been entrusted to UN troops
in the first place.
Of course, troops do often play a useful role in disaster relief, even when
the disaster is a natural one and no element of coercion is required. Armed
forces are - or should be - well organised, disciplined groups of people,
available to governments at short notice, trained to perform arduous tasks
with calm efficiency.
But when people with weapons are sent into the middle of a war, there is a
natural presumption that they may be expected to use those weapons. If
relief work is being impeded by violence, then the obvious role of armed UN
troops is to protect the relief convoys and to remove, disarm or
'neutralise' the people who are obstructing the convoys.
Such was the mandate given to the UN force in Somalia. It was not to take
sides among Somali factions, but simply to ensure none obstructed famine
relief. That made some sense in that the threat to relief in Somalia came
from general anarchy and looting. Even so, the UN found it difficult to
remain neutral and got bogged down in a conflict with one of the factions.
Unprofor in Bosnia did not have such a clear mandate. But even if it had it
would probably not have worked. For in Bosnia the humanitarian problems were
not the result of a general breakdown of order. They were caused quite
deliberately by the determination of the Serbs (and for a time also the
Croats) to dismember the country and uproot a large part of its population.
If force had any role to play in relieving human suffering in Bosnia, it
should have been used to protect the population against the armed thugs who
were massacring, raping, looting and driving people away from their homes.
But that was never attempted. Instead the UN sought the consent of the Serb
and Croat leaders, at local as well as national level, for the passage of
relief convoys. Those leaders allowed aid through only when it suited them,
usually taking a large share for their own troops.
In those circumstances the advantage of having armed escorts for the convoys
is far from obvious. Many civilian aid workers say they never sought such
protection. If deals had to be made with local military and paramilitary
forces, they could make such deals themselves. Having Unprofor there, with
its ostensible (but unfulfilled) mandate to protect the population, has
simply made it harder for aid workers to convince anyone that they
themselves are playing an impartial and non-political humanitarian role.
That is especially hard for employees of the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees, but the problem also affects the Red Cross and other
non-governmental organisations (NGOs).
Many NGOs wish governments would leave humanitarian work to them, and
concentrate on the proper tasks of government, which are political and
military. In the former Yugoslavia, aid workers have been better placed than
anybody to see that humanitarian problems have political causes. They
deplore the fact that governments have failed to deal with those political
causes, and they see the use of Unprofor in a humanitarian role as a
disastrous cop-out, whereby governments give themselves the appearance of
'doing something' while failing miserably to do anything effective in the
politico-military sphere.
The point is eloquently put by Alain Destexhe, general secretary of MSF
International - perhaps the most thoughtful as well as the bravest of all
the NGOs - in a recent book.* 'No doubt,' he writes, 'Sarajevo and several
other towns have been fed. No doubt the impressive humanitarian deployment
has kept tens of thousands of people alive. No doubt the presence of blue
helmets on the ground has helped calm things down a bit. But can we be proud
of this? Must we congratulate ourselves because refugees whom we refused to
welcome, and who had nowhere to go, have not been allowed to starve to
death? Must we be proud of having doled out flour in refugee camps to people
whose style and standard of living used to be close to our own?'
Those are what linguists call rhetorical questions. They do not expect an
answer.

<TEXT>
Sir, The problem with the English National Opera ('Contrasting fortunes at
the opera', April 19) is that productions have in the past decade become
'unreliable', while the musical performance has remained consistently high.
For many years l was told that my taste was too old-fashioned, but the
abysmal 56 per cent attendance record now shows that I was not alone in
wanting realistic productions.
I have written to its director, Mr Dennis Marks, with a solution: tell
potential audiences exactly what sort of production they are going to see,
so they will not be in for a nasty surprise. That way some confidence may be
restored. The seat price reductions are probably less significant.

FT  20 APR 94 / Arts: Star turns and preposterous poses - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In times of national decline and international horror it is tempting to
brood on what we still excel at. The performing arts have been Britain's
great success story since the war, and the past week has provided nicely
contrasting reminders of recent glories in the field.
Omnibus (BBC1) celebrated Sir John Gielgud's 90th birthday with fascinating
archive film, professional and personal testimonials, and presentation by
Kenneth Branagh who modestly spoke of 'sharing the stage with a living
legend' in tones that suggested it takes one to know one. A virtual history
of modern British theatre emerged - West End, Coward, Old Vic, Stratford,
modernity at the Royal Court, not to mention increasing film work from the
1960s and TV commercials for Paul Masson wine. No mention of the
preposterous Caligula, though a glimpse of fashionable intellectual kitsch
from Peter Greenaway, with its splashy nudity, oddly resembled what one had
heard of the Playboy dip into high culture. Throughout, Sir John was urbane
and mischievously self-deprecating, charmingly illustrating Irene Worth's
verdict that 'he takes us as we are'. Our good fortune is that he gives as
well.
How different, how very different, from Omnibus's tribute to Joan Littlewood
a week later. Miriam Karlin's 'You love the woman but you can't bloody well
trust her' was a not untypical judgment. Littlewood, a pug-faced gnome in a
peaked cap, was equally affectionate towards old colleagues, 'that bugger'
Richard Harris and 'silly bitch' Barbara Windsor. And that was just the
people she liked.
Littlewood contributed more than mere direction to the triumphs of the East
End-based Theatre Workshop. A Taste of Honey, The Quare Fellow, The Hostage:
'If anyone wrote them, it was Joan,' declared an actor still bemused after
30 years. Her contempt for writers could be fruitful. Lionel Bart cackled
his way through the unexpurgated 'Fings ain't wot they used t' be',
originally the complaint of out-of-work tarts. Nemesis struck when
Littlewood 'tore up the script' in rehearsals of Twang], the sumptuously
financed West End musical on Robin Hood, longing to return to 'a dozen
actors and a few old props'. Disaster resulted.
Devised and produced by John Hough, directed by Alan Lewens, the totally
gripping programme evoked the bumpy exhilaration of working with this
maddening woman, unpredictable even in her non-conformism (decrying Peter
Brook's 'old art stuff', disowning the class struggle: 'I didn't like any
bloody class; just people with talent'). 'You have to be ruthless,' she
claimed; but rehearsed in pink light that caressed her actors. 'I loved
them, the bastards. I never told them so.' Ruthless, my eye. There's a softy
underneath. We were mad to exile her to France.
The Frost Programme (ITV) trotted out Sir Anthony Hopkins, preceded by
dreadful jokes delivered on glazed-eyed autopilot by Frost, sagging and
crumpled like an empty glove puppet. Hopkins was genuinely nice and nicely
genuine, faintly embarrassed at his host's remorseless prompting to
anecdotal luvviness. 'An audition with Olivier?' Frost nudged knowingly as
the thesp took on a hunted look. 'You're on the most - fantastic - roll,'
groped the international wordsmith, even venturing an artistic opinion on
Hopkins' latest film: 'It's doing fantastic business.' Of such aesthetic
values are media moguls made.
The craft was seen in practice in BBC 2's Screen Two 'by the award-winning
writer David Livingstone', according to a more than usually vacuous-sounding
continuity announcer who presumed wrongly. Had Return to Blood River been
written by the sage of Blantyre instead of mere Douglas Livingstone it might
have generated an atmosphere more redolent of Africa than North Peckham. The
timely story of a white liberal Afrikaner returning home after years in
England to take up his murdered father's business ultimately wasted a
promising situation. A case of double-bluff - the honourable black was in
fact guilty - copped out with a melodramatic ending and sketchy
characterisation. Lavishly cast, it also wasted some fine actors, notably
Barbara Jefford, reduced to a baleful presence; Frances Barber, alternately
radiant and blazingly angry; and Warren Clarke's leeringly genial, racist
Boer.
We may be good at acting but in recent years British architecture and
life-style leave something to be desired. Such is the message of the
three-part Heaven, Hell and Suburbia (C4) which kicked off with an ominously
heavy-handed fantasy for the opening credits. Presenter Jonathan Glancey has
the boyish, whimsical look of a young Tom Stoppard, but his loonier flights
are intended seriously.
Suburbia can mean many things: villages swallowed up by the city (Hampstead,
Chelsea), self-contained areas retaining their identity in a metropolitan
context (Kew, Richmond), or such great developments away from the city
centre as Edinburgh's New Town or Bristol's Clifton and Hotwells. The
director Bob Bee should have asked hard questions about definition. But it
transpires that Glancey has it in for Metroland and its descendants.
Stunningly commonplace observations on mock-Tudor alternated with strange
obiter dicta like 'stained glass speaks of cosiness and crumpets for tea' (I
shall look at Chartres Cathedral with new eyes).
Glancey commented on sundry English characteristics like suburban DIY while
forgetting that most English of all characteristics, sneering at things
English. He seemed amazed that people chose to move from the city and
outraged that they should 'want to be with their own kind,' adding 'and
that's what they get' in tones that implied bubonic plague. As one who has
been robbed once at knifepoint and once at gunpoint in front of my South
London front door, I could enlighten him.
The pleasant, aesthetically unremarkable inhabitants of pleasant,
aesthetically unremarkable homes in both England and America spoke of
escaping vandalism, crime, violence and fear, but Glancey steamrolled on
regardless.
A colleague was recently ejected from a press gathering for the South Bank
Show starring Dawn French for representing a magazine that had been less
than positive about Ms French's Murder Most Horrid. Fearful of offending
television's PR boys and girls, I shall consider my words carefully before
pronouncing last Sunday's SBS (ITV) interminably witless, repetitive,
cliche-ridden and self-indulgent. An alleged blow for the bigger woman (Ms
French is generously built), it wheeled out all the old observations on the
disadvantages of being a big girl today when the ideal is anorexic
willowiness, though a woman who, like La French, aligns herself with Marilyn
Monroe and Olympic athletes among others does not seem to have any problems
with self-confidence. Rubens was mentioned, Camille Paglia theorised, Jo
Brand told jokes, a war artist fresh from Bosnia conceded that painting Ms
French was 'a total change', and a fashion photographer waxed historical on
fleshy ladies with 'they wore tents in those days . . . In modern words,
there was a lot of celluloid there.'
There was a lot of celluloid here too; I had to pinch my cellulose to keep
awake. Dawn French posed for photographs in the style of old masters, was
reduced to a flurry of glottal stops at her (imagined) nude portrait while
Britten's Midsummer Night's Dream played in the background, whether
identifying the reclining actress with Titania or Bottom I am unsure.
It is surely time the South Bank Show gave up pretensions to being an arts
programme. These are few enough, and likely to get fewer; their precious
space must not be squandered on woolly-minded superficiality calculated to
show merely that even if opera singers are no longer fat, prima donnas still
are.

FT  20 APR 94 / Arts: Sunset Boulevard revised - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is Andrew Lloyd Webber's new version of Sunset Boulevard superior to his
original? Is cyanide more effective than arsenic? If you gotta go, you gotta
go. This way is quicker and more intense.
The main difference now is that Betty Buckley plays the diva role, the
bygone star Norma Desmond. She brings it more energy and more bite; and she
wears umpteen suitably repulsive over-the-top outfits, turbans, and wigs.
Patti LuPone, who launched the role here last year, seemed to have -
Spiderwoman-like - more belief in Norma's own self-myth, and her vibrato was
less tremulous; but she had fewer frocks to wear. LuPone, whose voice opens
so powerfully at its top and can swell a phrase, reminded us that Lloyd
Webber seemed to have composed the role for Barbara Streisand; Buckley,
whose face has been made up like a staring pale mask, reminds us that he
revised Norma for Glenn Close (in Los Angeles) - in her hammy, lethal,
Dangerous Liaisons mode.
This exercise in compare-and-contrast, with its wealth of dull detail, is
not a task that can interest intelligent adults. The most curious thing is
that Lloyd Webber had to revise Sunset Boulevard at all. Though he is crass
and corny as a composer of popular music drama, he is terrific as an
inventor of blockbuster tourist attractions - usually. His canniness in
finding the right theatrical formulas for his era, and in marketing them, is
mightily impressive - usually. Like Eurodisney, however, Sunset Boulevard
was not doing good enough business. Hence revisions.
But oh] revise it altogether. Lloyd Webber's tinkerings cannot disguise the
ghastly unoriginality of his mind. Other composers borrow material, but they
make something personal from their borrowings. Lloyd Webber, however, simply
presses musical feel-good triggers in your mind. His scores have no
intention of doing anything new. He means simply to remind you
subconsciously of ways you have enjoyed yourself before.
If, alas, you become conscious of this, his method becomes eminently
resistible. The title song here harps on a phrase and a rhythm that are
crucial to a Piaf song, 'La Foule'; the central phrase of 'The Greatest Star
of All' uses material that works better in either the Warsaw Concerto or
Rachmaninov (I wish I could remember which); and the 'Let's Have Lunch'
number is merely a Sondheim pastiche. And as you get to hear each of these a
zillion times during the course of Sunset, you cannot miss how little he
makes of them.
In the original movie Sunset Boulevard you cannot miss how, when Joe escapes
from Norma to write scripts (and fall in love) with Betty, he is escaping
from a mausoleum to a world of spontaneity. Not so here. Betty's milieu is
as musically repetitious as Norma's. More so, in fact. At least Norma's New
Year's Eve party breaks out of a tango into a waltz; Betty's stays stuck in
a tango.
More important, in the movie, you cannot miss the appalling moral collapse
of Joe, as he falls reluctantly into Norma's power. Yet here he is little
better than a gigolo. Superficially, John Barrowman is an improvement on the
musical's previous Joes - especially in his virile, all-American looks.
(Visually he is a mix of Tom Cruise, Christopher Reeve, and Montgomery
Clift.) But just look how smoothly he enters into Norma's clutches; he
actually dances the tango, which should be too dated for Joe, with
considerably more flair than she. And he sounds and acts not like an
individual but like a formula.
This is the worst staging I have ever seen by Trevor Nunn. Why does Norma
roam around constantly during her first number? And Joe during the title
song? Why are the lines of spoken dialogue paced with such predictable
rhythm? When Joe and Betty fall in love (1, 'What happened?' 2, 'You did.'
3, they kiss) it sounds like emotion By metronome.
At the Adelphi Theatre, WC2.

FT  20 APR 94 / Arts: A most bizarre bazaar - The Milan Antiques Fair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will Italy ever realise its potential as a major international art market?
On the evidence of Milan's 12th Internazionale dell'Antiquariato, the notion
of even an Italian international antiques fair remains something of a
contradiction in terms.
Italian art and antiques fairs are quite unlike any other. No dealer would
dream of exhibiting exceptional stock - anything that stood the remotest
chance of being 'notified' as of national importance by the Soprintendenza
alle Belle Arti. Vetting is perfunctory; descriptive labels are rare
commodities, and listed prices unheard of. An attribution might depend on
how much the client knows, the price on from where the money is coming. At
these most bizarre of bazaars, there is a positive reluctance to do serious
business. That is done elsewhere, and invariably not in Italy.
Crucially, despite the removal of trade barriers within the EC, it is no
easier legally to export works of art from Italy. No foreigner can be sure
he has the right to take his purchase home.
Unsurprisingly, most of the relatively few outstanding works of art at the
Milan fair were shown by foreign dealers who can import works on a temporary
licence. Italian trade fielded far better applied and Oriental arts than
pictures, reflecting the Belle Arti's relative lack of interest in the
former. Visconteum offered impressive silver; Emil Mirzakhanian a ravishing
Khmer female torso in Angkor Wat style, dated to the first half of the 12th
century; and Milan boasts a surprising number of the world's leading rug and
textile dealers.
With a question mark hanging over the future of its rival antiques fair at
the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, Milan could have pulled out the stops to
establish itself as the pre-eminent Italian antiques fair. The city is,
after all, the country's financial capital and its purpose-built fairground,
like the exhibition centre used by the hugely successful European Fine Art
Fair at Maastricht, provides almost limitless flexible space.
Unlike the Maastricht fair, however, there is no foundation or board to run
the Milan fair. The overall quality of the exhibits was mixed, organisation
was eleventh hour, and the presentation undistinguished.
Arguably, these are the least of the problems facing the Italian art trade.
If the unbelievably complex Italian art market is to become more ethical,
decades of punitive taxation, ponderous bureaucracy, and the effective
'criminalization' of the dealer will have to be reversed. The old communist
notion that the possession of works of art by the individual is a crime
against collectivity still lingers on in Italy.
A perfect example is provided by the empty display cases in the fair itself.
These were to house a choice selection of applied arts and musical
instruments from the renowned collections at Milan's Sforza Castle. The
evening before the fair's gala opening, the Ministry of Culture in Rome
declared it unsuitable for a public collection to be exhibited at a
commercial venue. The Russians had no qualms about lending treasures from
the Hermitage to the Maastricht fair earlier this year.
Dealers - and collectors - are subject to police-state scrutiny by the
combined forces of the Belle Arti and the tax authorities. The former are
obliged to pay VAT at 19 per cent, a rate also charged on both imports and
exports. The Belle Arti not only monitors these and the sale of 'notified'
works of art from one individual to another, but exercises the right to buy
for the given price. If VAT were reduced to 6-7 per cent, one dealer assured
me, half of the more creative methods of accounting and moving works of art
would disappear overnight.

FT  20 APR 94 / Arts: Two Parisian Hamlets - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Helas] pauvre Yorique. Je l'ai connu, Horatio . . .' Right now, Paris has
two French-language stagings of Hamlet - Georges Lavaudant's at the
Comedie-Francaise (with Redjep Mitrovitsa), and Terry Hands's at the Marigny
(with Francis Huster as Hamlet). The hero's name is pronounced 'Hum-lett' at
one theatre, 'Am-lett' at the other.
Naturally, the compare-and-contrast exercise is rife. To a British observer,
however, what they have in common is equally striking. French actors are
full of old-fashioned virtues: no one comes onstage as if by accident, all
of them know how to let their faces catch the light, each of them knows how
to project his or her voice into the auditorium in fluent phrases. Though
both stagings were heavily cut (running at just over three hours), both were
played with liberal supplies of calm and silence. In the closet scene, both
Gertrudes kept their tears pianissimo or silent. Above all, both Hamlets
were spoken with marvellous clarity, and performed with physical authority.
One goes to see the French perform Hamlet, not to catch some reproduction of
what has succeeded in English stagings, but for whatever the French can
reveal in it. And it is the Comedie-Francaise Hamlet (no interval) which is
the more French and, to this Briton, the more remarkable. I have never seen
Hamlet performed with so much stillness and economy; or so constant a supply
of vocal beauty. These actors know how to stand and how, without gesturing,
to project physically to the other people onstage (as well as to the
auditorium), so that a scene for three people creates a visually compelling
triangle. The tall, elegant, bronze, box set (by Jean-Pierre Vergier), with
a door at the rear and two further entrances downstage, never changes,
except as Lavaudant's lighting sets it in different hues. Vergier has
costumed it in 16th-century garb; Gertrude and Ophelie might have stepped
out of Holbein. As for the melodramatic pomposity which can be so deadly at
the Comedie-Francaise? Confined to the peripheries. The core of this Hamlet
is serious and fresh.
Redjep Mitrovitsa - an actor at the same time classic, Romantic, and modern
 -is the main reason for this. He is slight but commanding. The small head
is dominated by massive, downward-slanting cheekbones, and large, deep-set
eyes; the hair, like Olivier's in the movie, is dyed white-blonde; the voice
is a full, deep baritone so perfectly projected that a fortissimo was
employed only two or three times, and even then without any kind of
shouting. He can quickly alternate between anguish, philosophical enquiry,
and sardonic wit.
What one remembers most is his sheer stillness. The first third of the 'Etre
ou non etre' soliloquy, spoken at the front of the stage, is delivered
without movement. During the second third, he simply raises his arms, holds
them during a climax, and then lets them drop. The last third is again all
stillness. The auditorium hangs upon his eyes and his voice - and upon the
agony of mind which is Hamlet's legend and is vividly present here.
Terry Hands's Hamlet, taken at a brisker lick, has altogether more movement.
Not, however, more naturalism. 'Etre - ' says Francis Huster's Hamlet; then
tumbles to the floor; where he lies supine and says ' - ou non etre'. He
rises, gestures, and then says 'Voila le question: est-il plus noble . . .'
Huster, who must be well into his 40s (and often brings Michael Pennington
to mind), is a star who has assembled this company and organised this
Marigny season. Cid). He emphasises Hamlet's rhetoric. A light, dry
baritone, he has energy, charm, and edge without great depth.
Hamlet at the Comedie-Francaise is in repertory with other plays until June
30. Hamlet at the Marigny is being given until May.

I bet you have already forgotten 1988: the launch of Red Nose Day; Ronald
Reagan's first visit to the (then) Soviet Union; Ben Johnson's Olympic 100m
race which ended in disgrace. The Rock 'n' Roll Years - the 80s (7.00 BBC1)
may remind you - and if you switch over afterwards you can play
spot-the-difference between its curious characters and the ones in Who
Framed Roger Rabbit (8.00 ITV), a comedy film starring Bob Hoskins which
mixes humans and animated action. No prizes for guessing when the movie was
made (1988).
Otherwise a pretty skimpy evening, including a Lib-Dem Party Election
Broadcast (9.00 BBC1, 9.55 ITV, 10.30 BBC2 - heaven help us) and a couple of
so-so sitcoms, Last of the Summer Wine (8.00 BBC1) and Luv (8.30 BBC1).
For real humour, Screen Two: Henri (9.30 BBC2) is a charming comedy set,
believe it or not, in Northern Ireland. Henri is a 10-year-old country girl
who comes to the big city to play her accordion at a music festival, but if
accordion -playing sets your teeth on edge you can find Maggie Cole playing
Purcell, Couperin and Bach at 9.40 on Radio 3.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business and the Environment: Strapped for cash in Hungary -
Green issues are taking a back seat / World wide waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Hungary's Dorog Incinerator there is more embarrassment in the air than
fumes from the chimney. 'Actually, the furnace is idle today,' confesses
Gyorgyne Otrok, managing director of the plant. 'We're short on waste.'
Something is awry. While four decades of communist economic management
produced many shortages, industrial rubbish was not one of them. And the
waste incinerator, majority owned by France's Sarp Industries and located in
an industrial town northwest of Budapest, is advanced for Hungary, and for
eastern Europe for that matter.
Hungary produces about 2m-2.6m tonnes a year of hazardous material, the
government estimates, and deals with just 40 per cent of that. 'The
treatment of the rest, more than a half of the total, has remained unsolved
right up to the present day,' a government report admits.
It is not for lack of public and political awareness of environmental
issues. Protests over a barrage on the river Danube helped bring down the
country's former communist regime, and built environmental consciousness
into the post-communist political system.
Nor is it for lack of regulation. Hungary introduced an environmental law as
far back as 1976 and has modelled its policy on Germany. Limits on emissions
from incinerators, for instance, are said to be the third toughest in the
world.
But tough rules have minimal effect. In 1991 the government decreed that
companies could store on the premises up to one year's worth of hazardous
waste. Dorog Incinerator expected a glut of refuse but it did not come. 'The
regulation is a dead letter. It's only if someone has a conscience that they
abide by it,' says Otrok.
One weak link is enforcement. About 1,000 employees at the county and
national supervisory authorities cover a country of 10m inhabitants, a lower
proportion than in western Europe. 'They constantly complain they have too
much work,' says Denes Olessak, the leading official for environmental
protection at the industry ministry.
A vital ingredient is also missing: cash. Investment in environmental
protection has fallen from 1 per cent of GDP in 1987 to about 0.6 per cent
at the latest count and the corporate sector accounts for all of the fall.
Hungary's economy has shrunk by over a fifth since 1990, most state
companies live financially from day to day, and they pay salaries and the
electricity bill before they send toxic waste to be burnt at Dorog. 'Many
companies sign contracts so they have some paper to show the supervisors
when they come round to do a check,' says Otrok. 'But when it comes to
carting over the waste they tell us they have no money.'
Often refuse just piles up on site. And when Hungarian companies face the
problem they often do so on the cheap. They are aided by the market economy,
which has thrown up a variety of environmental entrepreneurs. Some, even
Dorog Incinerator admits, are decent. Others undercut by cutting corners.
One company offered 'biological treatment' which involved no more than
airing the contaminated soil.
Nor are manufacturers the only impoverished, and delinquent, polluters.
Municipalities are often worse offenders. The industry ministry reckons that
a mere 5 per cent of Hungary's 2,700 landfills meet official standards.
Budapest, the capital, will run out of landfill capacity within two years on
current trends.
Central government is in no position to help. Hungary's budget deficit will
rise to an estimated Ft330bn (Pounds 2.2bn) this year, about 8.5 per cent of
GDP. State spending on environmental projects has risen gently in real terms
but Olessak concludes: 'The aim is to do as many projects as possible with
outside help.'
Much western aid has flowed back into the pockets of western consultants.
Olessak opens a cupboard in his office to show a whole library of western
reports. 'They don't tell me anything I didn't know 10 years ago,' he says.
'What we really need is funding for concrete projects.'
That, belatedly, is coming. The Swiss government has given a grant of
SFr4.4m (Pounds 2.1m) to modernise two Hungarian metal galvanisation plants
and expand their waste processing capacity. Japan has provided a Dollars
100m (Pounds 68.4m) official credit to finance the environmental
rehabilitation of Varpalota in western Hungary, which has the misfortune to
host a particularly polluting combination of aluminium, chemical and paper
factories.
Private western investors have also brought resources to bear on pollution.
Electrolux, the Swedish white goods group, bought Hungarian refrigerator
manufacturer Lehel in 1991. About half of the Dollars 50m purchase price has
been ploughed back into cleaning up toxic sludge, oil and heavy metals.
General Electric of the US has begun to recycle fluorescent tubes produced
at Tungsram, the lighting manufacturer which GE acquired in 1990.
More comprehensive environmental rehabilitation depends, as does so much
else in Hungary, on recovery lifting the corporate sector as a whole.
Banking on that prospect, among others, is the western green industry.
EMC-Services of France and a subsidiary of Italy's Ansaldo are planning to
construct two more incinerators. An Austrian company has invested in a
long-term waste storage centre in Aszod. All they need is someone to put out
the rubbish.

FT  20 APR 94 / Business and the Environment: Arctic weather on the job -
Building designers may have overestimated air-conditioning needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Air-conditioning became almost a standard feature of building design during
the construction boom of the 1980s. But evidence is emerging that the
designers of this latest generation of buildings seem to have greatly
overestimated the heat produced by the new electronic equipment that litters
modern offices.
Introduced to draw off surplus heat from electronic equipment in the
computer-crammed offices of central London, air-conditioning's popularity
spread widely. But the fans, pumps and refrigeration plant soak up enormous
amounts of energy - perhaps as much as one-fifth of a building's power bill.
And now there are serious doubts that such powerful systems are necessary.
The UK government is attempting to reverse the trend of air-conditioned
offices as part of its campaign to reduce CO2 emissions. Revised building
regulations are due to come into force by 1995, in which, for the first
time, designers and developers will have to justify the need for
air-conditioning.
This has produced protests from some developers who say that occupiers
demand air-conditioning.
However, Stuart Lipton, who led the development of the Broadgate complex in
the City of London, says buildings are over-specified. In other words,
occupiers are paying for air-conditioning they do not need.
The miscalculation in requirements by designers occurred during the building
boom of the 1980s. Peter Hill of the Building Research Establishment's
Energy Conservation Support Unit argues that office equipment consumes far
less energy than anticipated by the developer teams. Tenants are paying a
hefty price for air-conditioning systems that can cope with up to five times
the real amount of heat generated, he says.
'Such a cooling system will always be operating inefficiently, vastly
increasing energy consumption and costs,' he says in a paper presented to
Clima 2000, the international energy and environment convention recently
held in London.
These over-indulgent systems are, according to Hill, a result of fear and
ignorance. Equipment contributes only 10 per cent of overall office heat but
designers build in hefty safety factors, he says. They do this to protect
themselves against potential complaints from occupiers over failure to cool
buildings sufficiently. At other times, Hill warns, they simply do not check
the heat output of individual machines.
Hill's research indicates that simply adding up the potential items likely
to be used in an office and multiplying that by the manufacturers' ratings
does not work. One personal computer tested in Hill's research was rated at
90 watts but consumed only 30W. A laser printer used an average of 75W
compared with a rating of 850W, while a photocopier took 126W rather than
the rated 1250W.
Another important factor in heat production is how often equipment is used.
A room full of executives, for instance, would create less heat than a
typing pool. A survey of 74 UK companies with a combined workforce of 3,500
showed that 10 per cent of managers never touched a PC and 45 per cent were
only intermittent users. Typists, however, were 100 per cent users.
Figures also vary for different professions. Some 40 per cent of draughtsmen
are regular PC users compared with 78 per cent of accountants.
Surveyors, who have a leading role in planning the capacity of services in
any building, might look to their own work patterns for a hint of where they
may be going wrong. Only 23 per cent are regularly in front of their PC and
a quarter never go near one.
Designers cannot simply calculate the number of staff in a building,
multiply that by the likely pieces of equipment and come up with a heat
output. But they can produce a 'usage diversity factor' compiled from the
type of staff and the minimum number per machine - ranging from perhaps one
person per PC to 20 per fax.
Office size and occupation density are also important. A big telesales or
financial services floor will have far more staff and machines crammed into
each square metre of space. On the other hand, a small office with a few
staff will still need a standard range of equipment, so energy use per head
may be relatively high. This means power consumption can vary between 50W
and 250W per person in large offices.
Most speculative developers would maximise the letting potential for a
building by aiming for the top of this range, and some occupiers will end up
paying for an air-conditioning system five times as powerful as they need.
If designers continue to cater for the most energy-hungry potential user,
this burden of over-capacity could get worse for less exacting users.
Research by Brecsu shows that as extra and more powerful equipment is
introduced, power consumption could rise over the rest of the decade to
around 300W per person in larger offices and to 350W in those with around 50
staff.
From 2000, even the energy guzzlers may find themselves paying too much for
heat extraction, as conservation measures will steadily reduce demand to
200W per person. The computer industry is already adjusting to new demands,
as Jacques Roturier, professor at Bordeaux University, pointed out at Clima
2000.
The majority of the 30,000 PCs sold in Sweden each year now have automatic
turn-off monitors providing a stand-by capability of less than 8W. The US
Environmental Protection Agency has signed an agreement with leading
manufacturers for a 'star' rating for computers and printers with automatic
turn-offs and a stand-by mode of less than 30W.
But perhaps most significantly, US President Bill Clinton has ordered the
federal government - perhaps the world's biggest computer purchaser - to buy
only energy-efficient equipment. This could lead manufacturers to adopt
energy-saving controls as a standard feature of all equipment.
In the meantime, Hill and Roturier say substantial energy savings could be
achieved by closer examination of the real effects of office equipment
loads, and by avoiding over-estimation for air-conditioning and cooling
systems.

FT  20 APR 94 / Management: MCA tips growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's top management consultancies have a recruitment headache, according
to the body that represents them.
Commenting on the latest quarterly survey of business trends conducted by
the Management Consultancies Association, executive director Brian O'Rorke
says its members are having difficulty attracting 'individuals of the right
calibre'.
He adds: 'With fee rates tight consultancies are finding it difficult to
persuade suitably qualified managers to leave their existing employment.'
O'Rorke's warning - which he says could affect the ability of consultancies
to react to client demands - comes on top of encouraging figures from the
MCA, whose 34 members collectively account for more than 50 per cent of
fee-earning management consultancy work in the UK. Earnings in the first
quarter of 1994 were 3.8 per cent higher at Pounds 235m than in the previous
three months. It is the sixth quarter running that has shown growth and the
second in succession marked by a significant increase.
'The trend in order books is very pleasing,' says MCA president Keith
Burgess. 'I continue to expect growth in the consultancy industry to
outstrip growth in GDP, which is forecast at 2.5 per cent year-on-year in
coming years.'
While MCA members are cautious of short-term growth prospects, nearly 80 per
cent expect increased volumes of new orders during the next six months. They
also expect increased activity in most industry sectors during this period,
with financial services offering the best prospects.
Work in the construction/property, manufacturing and overseas sectors is
described as 'ponderous', but most sectors are expected to experience a
'slight improvement'. Retailing is also singled out and the MCA says 'some
major re-engineering projects are under way'.

FT  20 APR 94 / Management: Sugar daddy - In a second article on ownership,
Christopher Lorenz examines Nestle's acquisition of Rowntree
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unprecedented event occurred at Easter in the cathedral city of York, in
northern England. The managing director's seat in what for 90 years was the
proud headquarters of Rowntree, Britain's biggest maker of chocolate and
other confectionery, was taken for the first time by a manager from
Swiss-based Nestle.
The man in question, David Harris, is a Briton. But he is very much a
'Nestle man': he has 30 years of experience with the group as a marketing
expert in its coffee, milk and drinks businesses.
The multinational acquired Rowntree six years ago this spring after a battle
over the latter's loss of British nationality. Given the continued
sensitivities among the 4,500 employees at York - most of whom were loyal
Rowntree people - and the watchfulness of many outsiders over the
commitments made by Nestle during the 1988 bid battle, one might have
expected a fuss over the appointment.
Not a bit of it. Even Neil Moore, the chief representative for unionised
office staff at York, who regrets the gradual removal of various aspects of
managerial decision-making to Nestle's Swiss and UK headquarters, says he
has 'no strong feelings'. One former Rowntree director fears that York is
'being moved towards branch factory status', but he declines to be named.
Behind this general equanimity lie three factors. First, Nestle, an old hand
at acquisitions, has handled the integration of Rowntree with even more than
its customary care. Whereas some predators assimilate acquisitions within
months, Nestle usually takes two or three years to start the process in
earnest. With Rowntree, it waited for four.
Second, York has emerged, in several respects, as a significant force within
the giant multinational. This is in spite of the fact that not all of
Nestle's commitments have been kept: some have proved impracticable with
time.
The biggest casualty was the plan to run Nestle's global confectionery
strategy from York, not Switzerland. This had to be dropped two years ago,
partly because of the amount of travel involved, and also because the
strategy unit became subsumed within a far-reaching reorganisation of
Nestle's entire corporate HQ, which was designed to make the group
faster-moving. This involved co-locating at head office all but one of its
product divisions: its mineral water interests, including Perrier, are based
in Paris.
The most visible aspect of Nestle's commitment to York - its largest factory
complex - has been its capital investment of Pounds 120m made there since
the takeover. This is far more than Rowntree could have afforded on its own
in so short a time. Part of this investment, such as a newly-opened Pounds
28m KitKat plant, has expanded capacity and helped double Nestle Rowntree's
total exports from its seven UK plants to Pounds 150m. This has pushed its
export ratio from 15 per cent in 1988 to 25 per cent last year.
Other parts of the investment have boosted labour productivity. For
instance, a heavily automated Pounds 7m plant, opened in 1993, has helped
cut the labour required for Aero bar production by almost a quarter, to 165
people.
Though some office jobs have also gone, higher factory productivity is the
main factor behind a fall in the total Nestle Rowntree labour force at York
 -from almost 6,000 at the takeover to its current 4,500. Of these, 3,300
are production workers.
Former Rowntree managers argue that this fall cannot be attributed to
foreign ownership: it is the continuation of a productivity drive which the
UK company began in the late 1970s. Without Nestle's extra sales outlets
around the world, the fall could have been steeper still.
Arguably even more important than York's production role is that Nestle has
retained the site as what Graham Millar, Harris's Rowntree-schooled
predecessor, calls 'an intellectual resources centre'.
At a cost of more than Pounds 6.5m above the Pounds 3.5m which Rowntree had
already committed, the original UK R&amp;D operation has doubled in size to 80
highly skilled people, and become Nestle's leading worldwide research centre
for confectionery. This involved closing Rowntree's former research and
development centre in France, and slimming Nestle's in Switzerland. A
quarter of the York centre's staff now come from outside the UK, and this
proportion is expected to rise to a third.
York has also become a specialist support services centre for the whole of
Nestle UK, providing consumer relations, information technology, and quality
and scientific services. This has involved moving jobs north from Nestle
UK's head office in south London almost as quickly - but not quite - as
Rowntree's former corporate functions (finance, pensions, legal and
communications) have gone south.
The third reason why the appointment of Harris has drawn so little internal
comment goes to the heart of why the takeover has been successful. In the
words of trade unionist Moore, 'it's two-way traffic. We can't complain
about Nestle people coming in, because we've had Rowntree people going the
other way. Six years on, that's inevitable.'
From the start, Nestle took care not merely to leave Rowntree people in
charge of the UK management - Harris is the first very senior exception -
but also to move them into senior jobs elsewhere within Nestle. So far more
than 30 have won jobs outside the UK, half at corporate HQ, in both its
divisional and geographic organisation. They include the head of the
confectionery strategic business unit, which replaced the York-led strategy
group.
In the UK, the two most senior ex-Rowntree managers are Peter Schroeder,
head of the York research centre, and Peter Blackburn, who since 1992 has
been executive chairman of Nestle UK. Schroeder says: 'Rowntree integrated
into Nestle with enthusiasm partly because the Rowntree managers were left
in charge. In one sense it was easy: Nestle had neglected its chocolate
business and wanted Rowntree to bring it into the modern world.'
He remembers meeting one Nestle chocolate manager who said: 'Ah, you're from
Rowntree - it's you who took us over.'
'Some Nestle people would say that we've had a very good deal indeed,' says
Blackburn - and not because he has been an obvious beneficiary. The two-way
traffic that is now affecting York flows from this; Blackburn says he
intends to foster it in order to develop a 'one-company' culture. After any
merger or acquisition, he says, this does not emerge 'unless you really do
mix people up'.
The series concludes next week.

FT  20 APR 94 / Management: Little knowledge goes a long way - Cancer of the
prostate need not be a killer / Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROL COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Earlier this year, 13-year-old Andrew Steele from Wales died from cancer of
the bladder and prostate. His death is a grim reminder that no male should
consider himself immune from waterworks trouble.
The prostate, a gland about the size and shape of a chestnut, lies deep in
the pelvis just below the bladder. Because it surrounds the urethra, it has
the potential to block the flow of urine completely. Like the breast and
womb, the prostate is under hormonal control; unlike them, the prostate
enlarges throughout adult life, and most men give it little thought until it
starts causing trouble.
Benign enlargement (known as benign prostatic hypertrophy, or BPH) affects
about one in three men over 50 and gradually causes outflow obstruction.
Even then, many are remarkably tolerant of symptoms such as trouble starting
to pass water, trouble stopping, reduced stream, urgency and changed
frequency, all of which can be extreme. Eventually, pressure on the system
may damage the kidneys. Since BPH is curable, prompt action is better than
waiting until life is dominated by the location of the nearest toilet, or
until total blockage forces admission to hospital.
Many men regard plumbing problems as an inevitable part of ageing, and some
are reticent about discussing intimate symptoms.
While drugs such as alpha-blockers and finasteride can relieve early
symptoms of BPH, the principal treatment for prostate disease is surgery.
The two main operations are transurethral resection (done without incision
through the tip of the penis) and open prostatectomy (which needs an
incision above the pelvic bone).
After surgery, sperm will flow the wrong way so sterility can be expected.
Impotence is unlikely, though it can happen if delicate nerve bundles are
destroyed during the operation.
Newer therapies for BPH include cryotherapy, laser treatment, microwave
therapy and balloon dilatation, but these have yet to be evaluated fully.
Malignant disease of the prostate is surprisingly common. The second most
common cancer in men, it kills around 8,000 a year in Britain - or four
times as many victims as cancer of the cervix. The cause is unknown, but it
is rare under the age of 40. The incidence increases with age, so that about
40 per cent of men over 65 are found to have cancer of the prostate at
post-mortem.
It can also be an incidental finding during life. Studies show that up to 10
per cent of prostates removed during an operation turn out to be malignant
when examined under a microscope. In fact, the disease can only be
positively diagnosed by laboratory examination, though there can be strong
clues. For instance, it is possible to pick up some small tumours from a
blood test and some larger ones from rectal examination. Both procedures are
essential when assessing prostate symptoms, but they could also be used to
screen the rest of the population for cancer of the prostate.
The British Prostate Group of surgeons believes this cancer to be one of the
most treatable if spotted early, and that lives could be saved by screening.
Others point out that prostate cancer is often slow-growing, or even dormant
 -according to one adage, men die with it rather than from it. They say
there is no point picking up cancers if they are virtually harmless.
Studies are under way in the UK and in the US to clarify the issue, since
there is no firm evidence that lives would be saved by universal screening.
Less contentious is the point that many men would benefit from being more
aware of their prostate before it starts running and ruining their lives.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Patrick McTighe, chairman of CI Group, the Wolverhampton-based engineering
company, died on Sunday after a recent illness.
McTighe, who was 65, had been a board member for four years at CI Group,
which makes industrial steel flooring and other products, and chairman for
the past two and a half years.
He was known mainly for his long association with Davy, the engineering
contractor. After joining Herbert Morris in 1970, he became a director of
Davy Corporation in 1977, and later chairman and chief executive of Davy
Engineering Industries before becoming deputy chief executive and, in 1990,
chief executive of Davy Corporation. A year later, he was instrumental in
the takeover of Davy by Trafalgar House.
CI Group says McTighe had been very active in planning its strategic
direction. In recent months the board had been seeking a new non-executive
director as chairman elect, and a further announcement will be made soon.

FT  20 APR 94 / People: Another flotation for Allen?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Leon Allen, a US businessman who led the successful Pounds 230m management
buy-out of Del Monte Foods International in 1990, has been appointed
chairman of the British Printing Company.
Allen, 54, is chairman of Devro International, the sausage-skin-maker which
came to the stock market last year. His arrival at BPC, which used to be
known as BPCC before its 1989 management buy-out from the late Robert
Maxwell's business empire, is another sign that Britain's largest commercial
printer may also be considering a flotation.
BPC, which employs 5,300 staff and has annual sales of over Pounds 300m, has
been without a chairman for more than six months. Brian Garraway, a former
deputy chairman of BAT Industries, died last September only a few months
after taking up the post.
Allen has spent most of his career in the consumer goods industries. He
worked for Procter &amp; Gamble for 18 years, and did three years with The
Clorox Company before joining RJR Nabisco in 1982. He came to the attention
of City investors following the Del Monte MBO. In little more than two years
he reshaped the business, improved the earnings and sold it to South
Africa's Royal Corporation for Pounds 370m in 1992.
Although he is a well regarded manager, his time as a company chairman has
not been without controversy. Shortly before Devro, a Pounds 108m management
buy-out from a US healthcare group, came to the stock market, it was forced
to cancel plans to appoint an outsider as a chief executive following
institutional pressure. As a result Devro had to pay out Pounds 390,000
compensation to the unsuccessful candidate. Allen, who was appointed
non-executive chairman of Devro in February 1993, received a Pounds 200,000
bonus for presiding over the company's flotation in June 1993.

FT  20 APR 94 / People: Ralfe joins Anglo board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gary Ralfe, who headed the negotiations which drew the former Soviet Union
formally into the world's diamond cartel, has joined the board of the Anglo
American Corporation of South Africa. He became managing director of the
Central Selling Organisation, the London-based business through which De
Beers controls about 80 per cent of the world's trade in rough (uncut)
diamonds in January.
Ralfe, 49, was born in South Africa and joined Anglo American in 1966. He
was appointed a director of De Beers, Anglo's sister group, in March 1990.
That was the year he signed a Dollars 5bn, five-year contract with the
former Soviet Union, which gave the CSO exclusive marketing rights to most
of the Soviet rough diamond production. At the same time De Beers advanced a
Dollars 1bn loan to the Soviet Union and moved some diamond stocks from
Moscow to London as collateral. Ralfe has been at the forefront of
subsequent negotiations - successful so far - to keep the deal in place
following the break-up of the Soviet Union.
Anglo has also appointed Nap Mayer, managing director of its gold and
uranium division, an alternate director.

FT  20 APR 94 / Recruitment: Two-way communication helps employee relations
 -Better news ahead for personnel managers and redundant executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two weeks ago we ran a jobs column which questioned the validity of human
resource management, suggesting that the latest personnel techniques did
nothing to improve employee-management relations.
Perhaps the most controversial finding was that workplaces with personnel
specialists had worse employee-management relations than those without. Sue
Fernie and David Metcalf of the centre for economic performance, London
School of Economics, concluded that personnel specialists and directors on
the board did not improve employee-management relations and probably
detracted from it.
The findings caused some incredulity among HRM specialists and some doubt
about the interpretation of the research. Job evaluation, merit pay, profit
sharing and employee share ownership schemes were all surprisingly given the
thumbs down for their promotion of employee-management relations.
Metcalf admits that the way the findings were presented may have been
somewhat unfair to human resource people in that they concentrated on
industrial relations, but he defends the results that were produced using a
relatively new statistical technique called ordered probit.
A closer look at the figures shows that some of the newest HRM
communications methods aimed at better employee relations were indeed
welcomed by employees. Problem solving groups, meetings and suggestions
schemes were valued far more highly than, say, briefing groups and the use
of delegating chains.
Metcalf notes that those companies which place HRM at the core of their
business appear to achieve more effective results than those adopting it as
an add-on tool.
What prompted the report, he said, was an irritation with what he called the
self-serving way in which human resource management was presented in many
journals and newspapers. He and Fernie are now carrying out research into
the economic benefits of human resource mangement. Watch this space.
You are an executive and last year you lost your job. The chances are you
are a man, aged 44, had 10 years service with your last employer and earned
Pounds 43,300 a year before you got the boot.
This, according to Drake Beam Morin, the outplacement consultancy, is the
profile of the typical redundant European executive in 1993.
What is more, if you were a client of DBM, there was a good chance you
worked in marketing or sales for a company in computers and electronics,
food and beverage or chemicals and oil. Nearly half of the company's clients
came from shrinking operations in these sectors across Europe. Banking and
pharmaceuticals were also widely affected. General management and
engineering jobs were among those badly hit.
Just to add to your woes, if you recognise yourself and live in Portugal,
the UK, France, Germany or Norway, you might like to know that you probably
received less on leaving than you would have got the previous year.
Payments declined from 1992 to 1993 in six of the countries surveyed
(France, Germany, Portugal, Norway, US and UK). The highest payer with six
weeks for every year of service is Portugal, followed by Spain (5.6 weeks),
Sweden (4.9) and Belgium (4.8). The UK, with 3.3 weeks, just creeps into the
bottom half of the table under the Netherlands (4.2). The countries paying
the least to departing executives are Switzerland (2.4), Germany (2), France
(1.9) and the US (1.8).
Both the DBM survey and another by Coutts career consultants suggests that a
declining number of executives who lose their jobs are returning to full
employment and that more are moving into self employment.
What does all this mean for outplacement consultants? Predictably both DBM
and Coutts found that networking - the art of making personal contacts,
promoted by outplacement specialists - proved the best way of finding a new
job.
British Coal Enterprises, formed to help redundant miners find new jobs, has
spread its expertise, offering a full outplacement service that operates
under the title Grosvenor Career Services in competition with private
outplacement companies. Grosvenor has had contracts with a number of energy
sector companies.
The large private outplacement companies are complaining that the
competition is unfair because BCE receives a European Community grant. The
Association of Outplacement Consulting Firms International, a body that
represents the biggest outplacement firms, says it intends to complain to
someone in government, probably Michael Heseltine, the Trade and Industry
Secretary.
Grosvenor says that it sees none of the EU money itself and has to operate
as a profit-making organisation. Indeed it argues that the success of its
service lessens the burden on taxpayers to support BCE.
Philip Andrew, the chief executive of BCE, said that he expected the
outplacement service to be fully privatised within a year although he did
not yet have a schedule.
Finally, the graphs on the right supplied by the MSL recruitment consultancy
show that there is some heartening news for redundant executives. Advertised
demand for executive posts is picking up.

FT  20 APR 94 / Building societies 'face savings blow'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building societies are coming under further pressure in the competition for
personal savings this year, and could end 1994 with their lowest increase in
retail savings balances for more than 10 years, says a forecast by
stockbrokers UBS.
Figures compiled by UBS and the Council of Mortgage Lenders show societies
set for a lower share of the market in the main forms of retail savings for
the third year running, as savers put more money into National Savings
products and interest-bearing bank accounts.
This intensifying competition will be underlined later this week with the
publication of personal savings figures for building societies and banks in
March.
Societies are expected to have suffered a significant outflow in net
receipts - possibly amounting to Pounds 500m - for the fifth month in a row.
In February, the equivalent figure was Pounds 404m. Even though societies
have suffered several such monthly outflows in net receipts, interest
credited automatically to accounts has in most cases led to increases rather
than reductions in balances.
The withdrawal of funds in order to pay fuel bills in advance of the
imposition of value added tax, and the continuing popularity of the
pensioners' guaranteed income bond, are among the factors contributing to
savers' desertion of societies.
UBS forecasts that there will be an increase of Pounds 24bn in the amounts
held in these forms of personal savings in 1994, compared with a rise of
Pounds 22.8bn in 1993. On the basis of the forecast, societies are set to
attract only Pounds 10bn of the total - the smallest rise since 1981.
While the amounts held in banks' interest-bearing accounts actually fell
slightly - by Pounds 27m - last year, these accounts are estimated to grow
by some Pounds 2bn in 1994, giving banks an 8 per cent share of this market.
Even though that would be a significant advance on their share last year, it
is still sharply lower than their market share in recent years.
Mr John Ecklin, director of statistics at the British Bankers Association,
said that amounts in non-interest bearing current accounts, excluded from
these savings-market figures, rose by Pounds 742m in 1993.
Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at UBS, said: 'The banks appear to
have been in and out of the mortgage and savings market according to how
profitable it is in any one year in the cycle. They do not appear to have
any long-term strategic commitment to either market.'
The UBS forecast shows unit trusts having another successful year with 33
per cent of the market, albeit down slightly from the steep rise of 40 per
cent in 1993.
National Savings are set to gain market share from 13 per cent to 17 per
cent.

FT  20 APR 94 / Demand for executives rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand for executives has sharpened markedly, says the latest quarterly
survey by MSL, the recruitment consultant, Richard Donkin writes.
The number of executive job vacancies advertised in quality national
newspapers rose by 30 per cent in the first three months of this year, says
the survey, which is published today.
The rise reflects an upward trend in the past three quarters.
Vacancies rose 22 per cent compared with the same period a year earlier.
Recruitment has become a useful economic indicator.
The MSL report shows that advertised demand for executives between January
and March was the highest in that period for three years, but it was still
running at only slightly more than half its 1990 level.
Retailing recruitment showed some of the most marked activity with a 25 per
cent increase on the quarter and a rise of 67 per cent on the year before.
Executive advertisements in high-tech industries more than doubled compared
with the year before.
Advertised accounting and finance posts rose 42 per cent in the January to

FT  20 APR 94 / Call for Teeside industrial strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Teesside has the potential to continue developing as a significant European
manufacturing base into the next century, but to do so it needs a
co-ordinated, focused strategy, the Confederation of British Industry said
yesterday.
A CBI report, Teesside at the Crossroads, argues that the decline of mature
industries should be seen as a natural consequence of production life
cycles.
It acknowledges that the decline of large industries has created feelings of
betrayal, with the community often seen as the victim of big business. But
it says the area has a number of fundamental strengths, linked to its
manufacturing and engineering base, on which it can build economic success
and jobs.
The report says the public and private sectors, economic development
agencies and local people must collaborate to develop a shared vision and a
manufacturing strategy. In this way, Teesside can support and improve its
best industries and identify potential growth areas, concentrating on
development of small and medium-sized businesses.
The report is by CBI Teesside chairman Mr Arthur Dicken, engineering manager
of ICI's Teesside operations, and Mr Julian Kenyon, CBI assistant northern
region director. It comes against a background of heavy job cuts in recent
years by Cleveland's two dominant employers, ICI and British Steel. Together
with Merseyside, Cleveland's unemployment is the highest county rate in
mainland Britain.
The CBI report cites as Teesside strengths, energy supply and experience in
oil, gas and nuclear power, fresh water supplies, a strong engineering and
process industry base, strong local technical training and excellent
infrastructure.

FT  20 APR 94 / MPs criticise mental health care policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Serious criticisms of the government's policy of caring for mentally ill
people in the community were made yesterday in a report by the Commons
health committee.
Services for severely mentally ill people were inadequate, unco-ordinated
and underfunded, the report said. Many people were being failed by care in
the community.
The report comes after a series of violent attacks by mentally ill patients
discharged from institutions.
The MPs found that emergency and crisis services were poor, there was little
day care and more services were needed for mentally disordered offenders.
The number of homeless mentally ill people was on the increase, they said.
The report said the current funding formula for community care 'very
substantially' under-estimated the extra need for mental health services in
deprived inner-city areas.
Ms Marion Roe, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, criticised the
lack of information on community care for mentally ill people. Much data was
incomplete and inaccurate and there was no record of the numbers cared for.
The committee said lack of co-ordination and arguments between government
departments were partly to blame. It urged the government to set up a
permanent inter-departmental advisory group on mental health to review
policy and ensure that adequate resources were made available.
A second inter-departmental taskforce was needed to improve housing
provision for mentally ill homeless people, the report said.
Mr John Bowis, health minister with responsibility for mental health, said
the report would be studied carefully.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the report reflected the
failure of Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, to accept
responsibility for care in the community. 'She should legislate to ensure
that resources are in the right place and that the network of comprehensive
care advocated by the select committee is implemented throughout Britain,'
he said.

FT  20 APR 94 / Official chemicals statistics shunned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chemicals Industry Association has abandoned official government
statistics on investment in favour of its own surveys.
Its estimate of chemicals industry capital spending last year, published
yesterday, is more than 10 per cent lower than that from the government's
Central Statistical Office. In 1992 the association adopted the CSO figures
only to find them later revised down.
Its 29th annual survey of its members' investment intentions indicates that
the industry's capital spending is continuing to fall in real terms. The CSO
figures suggest a rise.
'We have been concerned (about CSO figures) for some time, but when the
difference gets as high as this we can't ignore it,' said Mr Keith Wey,
senior economist at the association. He added that the association was in
talks with the CSO about the discrepancies.
The CSO said it 'had not been made aware of any criticisms from the
Chemicals Industry Association. We are happy with the figures we have
published and are happy to listen to the CIA.'
The association's members include pharmaceuticals companies as well as
chemicals manufacturers. They invested Pounds 1.92bn last year, according to
the association's survey, a 10 per cent fall on 1992 in real terms. The CSO
figure is Pounds 2.12bn.
The association's forecast for this year's investment is Pounds 1.97bn
'which, allowing for inflation, represents a further small decline on 1993,'
said the report. The decline was a response to 'difficult economic
conditions'.
Dr Robin Paul, managing director of chemicals manufacturer Albright and
Wilson, speaking yesterday at the association's national conference, said
the UK's investment levels were 'about on the median trend for Europe as a
whole'.
More than two-thirds of the new capital spending is on high profit margin
goods such as speciality chemicals and pharmaceuticals, as opposed to the
traditional bulk chemical side, much of which has been suffering from
overcapacity.
The report also forecast that the cost of plant would rise at 3.7 per cent a
year between now and 1996.
Spending on environmental protection would rise from 14 per cent of total
capital spending now to 20 per cent by 1996.
In a boost to Mr Michael Heseltine's style of running the Department of
Trade and Industry, the report said: 'A growing number of companies have
stressed the importance of a supportive and competitive government.'

FT  20 APR 94 / Call to boost lead in genetics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's leading international position in human genetics must be
reinforced through more public and private investment, a government advisory
committee said yesterday.
The Committee on Human Genome Research expressed concern about the likely
impact of National Health Service reorganisation - both on gathering family
information for mapping genetic diseases and on providing genetic screening
for patients.
'There is increasing difficulty in obtaining information and samples from
extended families, as hospitals and GP fund-holders become concerned to
identify and restrict activities which fall outside their contractual
obligations,' the committee's report said.
Professor Malcolm Ferguson-Smith of Cambridge University, a committee
member, said the planned abolition of regional health authorities, combined
with the NHS's new purchaser-provider arrangements, threatened the research
and screening services carried out at Britain's 14 regional genetics
centres.

FT  20 APR 94 / North produces pattern of faltering recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A pattern of faltering economic recovery appears to be emerging in the north
of England, following publication yesterday of the third northern economic
survey in five days - covering Cumbria and the north-east.
Domestic sales fell back sharply in the first quarter but export deliveries
showed their strongest upward movement for five quarters. The pattern for
orders was similar, although the dip in home markets was less than for
sales.
The survey of 634 companies was carried out by the Northern Development
Company and the Teesside and Tyne and Wear Chambers of Commerce. It mirrors
similar surveys published on Friday and Monday by chambers in north-west
England,Yorkshire and Humberside.
Although profit forecasts fell slightly, only 8 per cent of companies expect
turnover to fall and only 22 per cent said cash flow was worsening.
Confidence, which had dipped in the fourth quarter of last year, was
therefore largely restored.
This was reflected in increased investment in buildings, as well as plant
and machinery, although two-thirds of companies left their investment plans
unchanged.
There was also a pick-up in employment trends, with 29 per cent taking on
staff compared with 17 per cent shedding labour. Only 9 per cent of those
surveyed said they planned to cut jobs in the current quarter, although 63
per cent planned to stay the same size.
Recruitment difficulties remain, with 22 per cent of manufacturers reporting
skill shortages.
The trend in training expenditure fell back slightly, but was still
positive. Companies that increased their spending on training outnumbered
those that had made cuts by 25 per cent.
Mr Bob Tilmouth, chief executive of Tyne and Wear Chamber of Commerce, said:
'Things do appear to be improving, but it certainly is a long haul.'

FT  20 APR 94 / CSO promises more data on regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to provide detailed regional breakdowns of economic data
such as the monthly retail sales and industrial production figures.
An official of the Central Statistical Office, the government agency which
collects and publishes economic and social data, acknowledged that there had
been 'an obvious gap in our statistical coverage as interest in
manufacturing industry has declined and the service sector has come more and
more into focus.
'There has also been a feeling for some time that Britain was quite
deficient in its regional accounts.'
He was unable to say when the more detailed breakdowns would be available.
In its first programme strategy - required under its new status as a
Whitehall executive agency - the CSO promised 'a significant shift in
priority towards service-sector statistics and an increased attention to
regional economic statistics'.
It also said it intended to reduce the workload it places on the people it
questions when compiling statistics, and to publish more quarterly rather
than annual data. It also promised that it would 'add more value' to its
statistics.
The move is the latest in a series of initiatives the CSO says will ensure
that official statistics provide the British citizen 'with both a picture of
society and a window on the work and performance of government'.
Last year the CSO issued a statement to define its purpose: 'Our mission is
to improve decision making, stimulate research and inform debate within
government and the wider community by providing a quality statistical
service.'
It also pledged itself to 'inform debate' by producing a new UK statistical
yearbook and collection of social statistics to 'give a picture of society
and of the trends in the way we live'.
The CSO said: 'We are listening more and more to the people from whom we
derive the statistics and who are also the ones who have need of them.'

FT  20 APR 94 / Vauxhall halves dealer margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vauxhall is halving dealer margins for its new Omega executive car range in
an aggressive move aimed at reducing the official list prices.
The company is seeking to make the Omega, which will be launched on Friday,
the best-selling executive car in the UK ahead of the Rover 800. Its sales
target for next year is more than 19,500.
Vauxhall said yesterday that dealer profit margins were being cut from 10
per cent to 5 per cent for the Omega, the first time that a carmaker in the
UK has reduced margins to such a low level on a mainstream car range.
The company first led industry moves to reduce dealer margins in 1991, when
it cut margins on its Astra small family car range from 17 per cent to 10
per cent.
Low dealer margins greatly narrow the scope for discounts and haggling over
car prices. The move does not cut final transaction prices but brings them
closer to the official list price.
Most carmakers have since followed Vauxhall's initial move to 10 per cent
margins.
Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, said the move to
cut dealer margins for the Omega was a response to recent changes in the
company car tax regime, which now relates tax scale charges to car list
prices rather than to engine sizes and transaction prices.
Some 80 per cent to 90 per cent of Omega sales are expected to be company
purchases. Omega prices will range from Pounds 15,995 to Pounds 26,950.
The company said that it had no plan to extend the lower dealer margins to
other cars in its range.
Vauxhall's move confirms the trend to lower dealer margins started by some
carmakers in recent weeks on special entry-level models where they have
reduced the official list prices of their cheapest models.

FT  20 APR 94 / Ozone on ground is growing hazard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amounts of low-level ozone are increasing steadily, bringing a risk of
breathing difficulties and damage to crops and buildings, says a government
report published yesterday.
Measures to curb low-level ozone, much of which is produced by cars, may not
be enough to enable the UK to meet international air quality targets for the
year 2000, the report argues.
Ozone is beneficial to people and plants when it occurs in the upper reaches
of the atmosphere because it absorbs harmful radiation from the sun, but is
'an aggressive pollutant' when it builds up near the ground, the report
says.
The environmental effects of high concentrations at low levels in the UK
'may currently be more important' than the loss of stratospheric -
high-level - ozone, it adds.
Southern England suffers more from smog caused by ozone than the north or
Scotland, it found. Low-level ozone is formed by the action of sunlight on
nitrogen oxides and organic compounds, much of which are emitted by cars.
At high concentrations ozone can damage human respiratory tracts and reduce
crop yields. Ozone also damages buildings: the effects have been estimated
to cost Dollars 2.5bn a year in the US, according to the report.
The document is the third in a series on air pollution prepared for the
Department of the Environment by its working group on photochemical
oxidants. It draws on data from a new network of ozone-monitoring stations
set up throughout the UK by the government.
Concentrations of low-level ozone in Europe are increasing at between 1 per
cent and 2 per cent a year, the report says.

FT  20 APR 94 / More ITV mergers urged: Carlton chief wants liberalisation
of media ownership rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Green, one of the most powerful men in British television, last
night called for further consolidation in ITV and a liberalisation of
cross-media ownership rules.
Mr Green, who is chairman and chief executive of Carlton Communications
which owns Carlton and Central, the two largest ITV franchises, was making
his first public speech on the industry.
He said recent ITV mergers were a first step towards building a partnership
between business and broadcasting.
'I make no apology for arguing that consolidation in ITV must continue and
that companies must be allowed to grow naturally within the normal
boundaries of competition law,' he said in the Fleming Memorial Lecture at
the Royal Institution in London.
He said he did not know whether there would ever be a one-company ITV system
but there should be a clear division of responsibility between programme
regulation and the rules on media ownership.
Ownership issues should be left to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and
market share should be the yardstick. The development of global media
markets meant the game was up for the government's 'old nursery approach to
media ownership, whereby our Whitehall nanny placed each of us in our neatly
fenced playpen'.
Mr Green said he would not be frightened if the Daily Mail wanted to buy a
slice of Carlton. 'I hope that no newspaper group would be frightened if
Carlton wanted to buy a piece of them.
'If the government is serious about wanting British companies to compete
globally in the media industry, then yesterday is not too soon to liberate
the restrictions upon media ownership,' he argued.
But the same rules should apply to all. Successive UK governments had
'conceded News International (Mr Rupert Murdoch's group) a scale of
influence and reach which they have consistently denied to anyone else'.
It might be unrealistic to suppose that any government was going to compel
News International to divest itself of any of its existing newspaper or
satellite interests, he said, 'but at least allow the rest of us to compete
on that famous level playing field'. He hoped the government would soon
accept that 'all mainstream broadcasters' should honour the quota requiring
51 per cent of programmes to be of European origin.
Mr Green, who is also chairman of Independent Television News, emphasised
that ITV had just a few years to rationalise to face growing competition.
'So television now needs business skills as well as creative skills. There
is no longer any protective cushion.'
He said a healthy ITV was essential to the British production industry and
last year it invested Pounds 670m in UK-produced programmes for the network
and its regional services.
In spite of increased competition there had been no plunge downmarket and
ITV had increased its proportion of ABC1 viewers last year.

FT  20 APR 94 / Equitable Life backs watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect private
investors, received a boost yesterday with the announcement that Equitable
Life has applied to join it.
But Mr Roy Ranson, Equitable's managing director, made it clear that the
life insurer still had reservations about the new regulator.
At a time when some life companies, banks and others - including Allied
Dunbar and Lloyds Bank - have not yet decided whether to apply to join the
PIA, the expression of support from a company seen as having a good record
on compliance will be valuable to the authority.
The PIA has suffered from uncertainty about whether it will attract enough
industry support to win credibility, and has also come under fire from a
cross-party committee of MPs looking at financial regulation. The Commons
Treasury committee continues its inquiry today with evidence from TSB, which
has already applied to the PIA, and from Halifax building society, another
important potential dissident.
The PIA has received about 2,350 applications so far, out of a total
potential membership of about 6,000.
Mr Ranson said that whatever the long-term direction of regulation might be,
Equitable Life believed the PIA was 'the next practical step', and that it
would build on the work done by Lautro, the existing regulator for the life
insurance industry.
However, he criticised the PIA's planned fee structure, in which
subscriptions will be based on amounts of new business. He called for a new
approach in which the amounts paid were related to the amount of regulatory
effort a company required.
This could mean, for example, a structure in which the size of sales force
and the company's record on compliance might be factors in setting fees.

FT  20 APR 94 / Christie's announces sale of Bacon's Study From Portrait of
Pope Innocent X by Velasquez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christie's yesterday announced the sale of Francis Bacon's Study From
Portrait of Pope Innocent X by Velasquez, Susan Moore writes.
The 1959 canvas, expected to fetch about Pounds 2m, belongs to the artist's
most famous series in which he used the 17th century Velasquez portrait in
the Galleria Doria-Pamphili in Rome as a starting point for some of the most
disturbing images of the 20th century. Bacon thought the Velasquez was one
of the greatest paintings in the world and said it had 'haunted and obsessed
(him) . . . by its perfection' for more than a decade. Other sources of
inspiration included a photograph of Pope Pius XII carried in a sedan chair,
a blurred snap of a baboon in motion and a film still of the bloody face of
the nurse in Eisenstein's film Battleship Potemkin.
The painting, which has been in the collection of its present owner for more
than 20 years, is to be offered for sale in London on June 30.

FT  20 APR 94 / Blair urges action to curb crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday called for urgent action to develop a national crime
prevention strategy as the party tried to take some credit for the first
fall for five years in the recorded crime statistics for England and Wales.
With crime providing the main battleground for yesterday's local election
campaigning, Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said one explanation for
the fall was the new approach to crime prevention being pioneered by some
police services and local authorities.
Mr Blair gave examples of startling reductions in the level of crime in a
number of Labour-controlled areas where the new approach had been tried and
he urged ministers to 'get behind this strategy and enable it to be spread
across the country'.
Under the new approach, the police became 'not just a law enforcement
agency, but a key element of prevention,' he said.
Mr Blair joined Mr David Maclean, Home Office minister, in emphasising that
yesterday's 1 per cent fall in recorded crime levels was no cause for
complacency.
The crime figures remained unacceptably high, Mr Blair said. The true level
of crime was at least three times that of recorded crime. The increase in
violent crime and robberies was especially alarming.
Yesterday's figures showed that the number of notifiable offences recorded
last year by police in England and Wales fell to 5.53m from 5.59m in 1992.
This followed increases of 16 per cent in 1991 and 6 per cent in 1992 and an
average annual rate of increase over the past decade of 5.5 per cent.
The overall figure masked a 4 per cent increase in violent crime and a rise
of 2 per cent in violence against the person.
The largest fall - 3.4 per cent - was in theft and handling of stolen goods.
Smaller reductions were recorded in fraud and forgery offences and car
crime.
Mr Maclean said the message from yesterday's figures was that there was hope
and that people were not condemned to see crime continually rising.
They showed the measures the government was taking were absolutely vital. He
was absolutely convinced the figures would have gone up rather than down if
additional police officers had not been recruited and other recent
law-and-order measures had not been implemented.
But Mr Maclean took pains to emphasise that ministers were still not
satisfied that enough had been done to deal with crime and criminals.
Mr Robert Maclennan, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, welcomed
the fall but underlined the need to increase community policing 'in order to
turn this year's blip into next year's trend'.
Mr Blair urged the government to drop the 'disastrous' plans for
centralising policing contained in the police and magistrates' court bill.

FT  20 APR 94 / Surveyors group seeks to improve valuations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors yesterday published a
wide-ranging list of recommendations intended to improve the credibility of
commercial property valuations.
The institution called for an explanation of property valuations to be
included in the published accounts of companies which have a significant
interest in property.
The institution also proposed greater co-operation between valuers and
auditors. Valuers should have direct access to audit committees, it says.
The institution is responding to increasing criticisms concerning the
reliability of property valuations, which have led to a series of legal
actions and some high-profile disputes.
Among these is the case of Queens Moat Houses, where two firms of valuers
differed by nearly Pounds 500m in valuing its portfolio at the end of 1991.
Most of the recommendations published yesterday are intended to tighten the
institution's regulatory powers, to improve valuers' technical skills and
the clarity of their reports, and to increase liaison between valuers and
auditors.
Under the proposals, the institution would have new powers to examine and
comment on controversial valuations.
It would also establish clear powers to discipline members for 'blatant
disregard' of the institution's advice about valuations.
The report also calls for more widespread comment by valuers on the risk
factors attached to valuations, price trends, and economic indicators.
The institution also believes there should be greater communication between
valuers and their clients, leading to clearer instructions. A summary of
these instructions, it suggests, should accompany the final valuation.
Mr Clive Lewis, institution president, said it was important that valuers
dispelled the mystique surrounding commercial property valuations. Clients
should be offered more information and explanation about valuations, he
said.
The report was written by an institution working party and will be the
subject of a consultation process until July next year.

FT  20 APR 94 / Police swoop on suspected funding sources for IRA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British and Irish police yesterday carried out a series of raids as part of
an unprecedented co-ordinated security crackdown on suspected funding of the
IRA.
Scotland Yard said a substantial quantity of drugs, cash, stolen property,
and fraudulent financial instruments - thought to be used for money
laundering - were recovered from 41 addresses in the Irish Republic,
Northern Ireland, north-west England, London and Surrey. There were eight
arrests. The raids involved 1,000 officers drawn from police on both sides
of the Irish border, including the Royal Ulster Constabulary's
anti-racketeering squad, the Metropolitan Police's anti-terrorist squad, and
three UK regional squads.
They are part of a continuing joint operation code-named Operation Madronna.
The raids followed a year-long covert investigation, also involving the
British security service MI5, into suspected sourcing of millions of pounds
of funding for the IRA's operations.
A joint police statement last night described the raids as the first time
the RUC's anti-racketeering squad had mounted an operation involving so many
forces. 'It is an indication of the common objective that all police forces
have of defeating terrorism,' it said.
However, security officials will need to examine the evidence thrown up by
the seized documents before gauging what damage, if any, they have caused
the IRA.
Irish police said three people had been arrested in the Dublin area and that
'a large amount of documentation' had been seized. But the Irish government
appeared to play down the political significance of the raids by describing
them as part of an campaign against 'criminal racketeering'.

FT  20 APR 94 / Warning on lack of telecom standard
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The growing band of telecommunications carriers were warned yesterday to
agree common standards for the technology which makes it possible to
identify the telephone number of an incoming call.
Mr Don Cruickshank, director-general of telecommunications regulator Oftel,
said he had no power to enforce a single standard for calling-line
identification. Yet if the industry did not respond to his warning he would
find other ways of ensuring customers were neither confused nor exploited by
a multiplicity of incompatible equipment.
Calling-line identification, which should benefit users by making it
possible to recognise familiar or welcome calls and avoid nuisance or
malicious ones, has been possible for some time. But the industry has so far
failed to work to common standards so that all customer equipment will work
with all networks.

FT  20 APR 94 / Minister assures veterans on D-day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday sought to defuse the row over the 50th anniversary
of the D-day landings by assuring veterans' organisations that the planned
celebrations would not undermine the solemnity of the event, Philip Stephens
writes.
Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, told leaders of the Royal British
Legion and the Normandy Veteran's Association that the government would not
trivialise the commemoration of the allies' invasion in June 1944.
His meeting with the veterans followed complaints from former participants
in the Normandy landings that the government's support for street parties
and other celebrations were an inappropriate way to mark an event which saw
the deaths of 37,000 allied soldiers.
It was followed by a firm defence by Mr John Major in the Commons of the
government's commemoration plans. The prime minister insisted that the
veterans had been consulted.
However, after their talks with Mr Brooke the veterans' representatives
insisted that they remained unhappy with the plans. They said they would be
sending a list of recommendations to the government calling for a national
day of mourning on June 6 - the anniversary of the landings - and the
cancellation of a planned extravaganza in London's Hyde Park.

FT  20 APR 94 / Dedicated followers of factions: The confusing array of
candidates in Liverpool's elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Politics is rarely straight-forward in Liverpool and next month's local
election contest will be no exception. What ought to be a simple
head-to-head fight next month between Labour and the Liberal Democrats for
control of the city council is instead a confusing melee.
Including independents and Greens, there appear to be 11 parties involved -
but even then some with one appellation are disowned by others with the same
name.
The outgoing council's composition is the best starting point for analysis.
Labour holds 39 seats of which 13 are being contested. The Liberal Democrats
have 38 and are defending seven. But there is another bloc of 17 councillors
who call themselves 'Liverpool Labour'. The 11 seats up for election in this
latter group hold the key to who will win control on May 5.
The 99-seat council also has two other minority parties: the Conservatives,
who have two seats and have to defend one, and the Liberals, who hold one.
Two seats are vacant, one formerly Labour, the other Liberal Democrat.
Most of the 17 Liverpool Labour councillors started off in the Labour party,
but fell out after Mr Harry Rimmer, the council leader, embarked on a
programme of redundancies and cuts in services to balance Liverpool's
budget.
The city's finances had been in yearly crisis since the mid-1980s, when
Militant Tendency, a Trotskyist grouping, had accumulated enough influence
to push the city into damaging confrontation with the Thatcher government.
Militant ringleaders were expelled from the party and 47 councillors were
disqualified in 1987, but their legacy lived on: deliberately induced budget
deficits had been bridged with foreign borrowings, making successive budget
crises worse as loans fell due years later.
'Official' Labour is being challenged in 13 out of 33 wards by candidates
calling themselves variously Ward Labour, Ward Independent Labour, Militant
Labour, and Broad Left Labour. For good measure, Ward Labour and Ward
Independent Labour candidates are also fighting each other in two seats.
Some of these have the backing of the 17 Liverpool Labour councillors - four
of 11 who have to defend their seats have been endorsed as acceptable. They
are the 'official' Ward Labour candidates. But 'the other two Ward Labour
candidates are nothing to do with us,' says Mr Tony Jennings, leader of the
Liverpool Labour councillors.
Most of the other retiring Liverpool Labour councillors are dropping out. An
exception is Ms Cathy Wilson, a former Labour member who was once among
those trying to deselect Mr Frank Field as MP for Birkenhead. She is
switching to an inner-city ward and standing for Militant.
Another Militant candidate is Ms Lesley Mahmood, who also stood for Militant
in the Walton parliamentary by-election nearly three years ago after the
death of Mr Eric Heffer. Mr Heffer was one of the last senior Labour figures
to believe that ultra-left factions could be retained in the party.
Meanwhile, Mr John Hamilton - the moderate Christian socialist who was the
notional leader of the council in the Militant era although the effective
leaders were Mr Derek Hatton and Mr Tony Mulhearn - is seeking election
again after serving his five-year disqualification.
The Liberal Democrats believe they have most to gain from the confusion.
Labour has imposed the biggest council tax rise in Britain and,
theoretically, did too well in 1990 to gain more seats now. Split Labour
votes could let the Liberal Democrats through the middle in several wards.
But Labour may regain some Liverpool Labour seats because they are being
defended by unknown leftwing candidates with no record of office. And, for
good measure, there are 15 'Liberal' candidates with potential to split
Liberal Democrat votes.
Mr Jennings thinks the Liberal Democrats will end up as the biggest party
but that Labour will do a deal with the remaining six Liverpool Labour
councillors and any of the four 'official' Ward Labour candidates who get
back.
This might keep Labour in control. The price, however, might well be the
readmission of the rebels into the party - too high, perhaps, for Labour's
national executive to accept.

FT  20 APR 94 / Labour hints at utilities clampdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour was yesterday edging towards proposals for a radical overhaul of
utilities regulation after the party leadership endorsed parts of a leftwing
pamphlet urging the sacking of the present regulators.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, used an afterword in the
document to argue that the status quo was 'unacceptable' and that Labour
needed to devise 'a fresh approach'.
Mr Cook said he was 'persuaded of the case' for some of the changes
advocated by the pamphlet, but not of others. He did not specify which
proposals he was prepared to back.
The document - written by Mr Peter Hain, the leftwing Labour MP for Neath,
and published by the GMB general union - calls for the appointment of a
commission to bring the four utilities regulators under one umbrella.
It urges primary legislation to switch the determinants of policy away from
'competition-at-all-costs'. The new law would amend the objectives of each
regulator to 'ensure that policies to advance strategic national and social
interests always take precedence over promoting domestic competition or
shareholders' profits'.
The document urges the establishment of a Commons committee to scrutinise
the utilities. While it accepts that 'nationalisation is a thing of the
past', the pamphlet argues that the government could retain or take a
'golden share-type ownership stake' in some utilities, as well as appoint a
director and exert influence at board level.
The proposed utilities commission would be seen as an alternative to
renationalisation, the pamphlet argues.
According to Mr Hain, the activities of some of the regulators are 'at best
politically convenient. In some ways they seem to be pointing towards sleaze
factor.'

FT  20 APR 94 / Merger of general unions in trouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The planned merger between Britain's two main general unions - the TGWU and
the GMB - has run into serious trouble.
Last week the GMB executive council decided to recommend to its annual
conference in June that the unions should have only 'a closer working
relationship'.
Both unions had been expected to give firm backing to specific merger
proposals at their conferences this summer. Although a full merger is still
possible, it is likely to happen more slowly than originally envisaged.
GMB officials are des-cribing the merger talks as stalled rather than broken
down. Opposition to the merger within the union is being led by Mr Ernie
Hughes, secretary of the Lancashire region, and Mr Nick Anderson, secretary
of the northern region.
Mr John Edmonds, GMB general secretary, still strongly favours merger, but
is not likely to press the issue until he is safely re-elected as general
secretary next year.
The five joint working parties which reported at the end of last month were
all positive about the merger, but union officials and lay activists on both
sides have become more aware of the large cultural divide between them.
The TGWU is activist-led and the GMB is official-led. Also, the TGWU is
politically well to the left of the GMB. Many GMB officials fear being
swamped by the bigger TGWU.
The TGWU's dominant left group also has reservations about the merger.

FT  20 APR 94 / Delay to milk market reform denied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reorganisation of the Pounds 3.3bn milk market in England and Wales is
still on course for November 1, Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister,
said yesterday.
Mrs Shephard was responding to speculation that the planned liberalisation
might be delayed a second time because of fresh proposals from the dairy
trade to the revised reorganisation scheme put forward by the Milk Marketing
Board.
Speaking after a meeting with Mr David Naish, National Farmers' Union
president, she dismissed suggestions that it would be impossible to achieve
the timetable proposed by the board for turning itself into Milk Marque, a
voluntary farmers' co-operative.
However, a ministerial decision on the board's scheme, pencilled in for the
end of this month, is not now expected until the middle of May because of
the 'major' proposals from the Dairy Trade Feder-ation last week, an
official said.
The federation, which has consistently opposed aspects of the board's plans
as monopolistic, proposed a 'milk forum' under independent chairmanship to
set the prices at which Milk Marque would sell to dairy companies.
This was rejected by Mr Andrew Dare, the board's chief executive, who said
the federation appeared to be trying to delay the reorganisation and
re-create a buyers' cartel.

FT  20 APR 94 / Ulster peace 'within a year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There could be an end to terrorist violence in Northern Ireland within a
year, Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, predicted
yesterday.
Mr Molyneaux, speaking in Washington, added to a series of upbeat
predictions about an end to terrorism made by politicians and security
forces in the province since the IRA's three-day ceasefire two weeks ago.
In a particularly optimistic forecast which caused some surprise in Ulster
last night, Mr Molyneaux said he believed violence would begin to decline.
He said: 'If you ask me where we will be this time next year, I stick my
neck out and say . . . we are going to see the ice breaking up even more, we
are going to see an end to violence as far as the main forces are
concerned.'
Mr Molyneaux did not rule out 'the occasional Mafia-type operation' but said
that once terrorism was over the 'united community in Northern Ireland -
Protestant, Catholic, no religion at all - will sit very firmly on anyone
who seeks to disturb the settlements which are now beginning'.
Sir Hugh Annesley, Ulster's chief constable, has in recent weeks privately
suggested that violence could end within three years. Last weekend, Dr John
Alderdice, leader of the Alliance party, predicted peace in the province by
the end of this decade.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Four surfers have been granted legal aid to investigate the possibility of
lodging personal injury claims against South West Water for damages over
health problems they allege were caused by polluted seawater.
The surfers plan to seek a High Court writ for damages when the
investigation is completed.
South West Water said it had not been informed of any proposed action. It
added: 'Until we do it is too early to speculate.'

FT  20 APR 94 / Compensation for bogus food claims
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Most food companies sent compensation to researchers who sent bogus letters
of complaint.
Researchers at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology wrote false letters of complaint to 233 companies and 83 per cent
replied with postal orders, cheques or goods.
Dr Vince Mitchell said: 'As the recession continues more and more people are
exploiting companies and their desire for good customer relations. Some
companies estimate they are sent hundreds of fraudulent claims every year.'
The main targets for false claims were sweet and chocolate bar manufacturers
such as Mars, Cadbury and Rowntree MacIntosh.
Each company was sent a vague letter of dissatisfaction which did not state
the date or location of the purchase but most wrote back and sent
compensation equal to the cost of the alleged goods.

FT  20 APR 94 / CBI chief hits at 'risible' Euro laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry plans to develop a Europe-wide
business agenda to unite EU business leaders in resisting intrusive social
legislation, Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of
British Industry, said last night.
Attacking 'ill-conceived', 'disappointing', and 'risible' policies in
Brussels and among EU member governments, Mr Davies told the annual dinner
of the Yorkshire and Humberside regional CBI that EU legislation on social
policy was being brought into disrepute.
It was time for the European business community to act in its common
interest and force politicians to take notice. The CBI's business agenda
would be published next month.
Mr Davies said recent 'disappointing developments' in Europe include:
EU member governments' discussions of a white paper on growth,
competitiveness and employment by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission
president, were focusing on new social policy initiatives and running
counter to the document's original themes.
A green paper on social policy which had focused on ways of increasing the
cost of employing labour instead of how to get Europe's 20m jobless back to
work.
Failure by the EU and the Council of Ministers to prevent a proliferation of
state aid for steel, telecommunications, energy and air travel, putting
British companies at a disadvantage. The failure of the EU to get to grips
with its spending. Auditors had produced 'dismal catalogues of fraud and
waste', yet the commission took little interest.
All large European employers opposed the European Works Council Directive -
discussed yesterday by the Council of Ministers - said Mr Davies, because it
would cut across existing satisfactory consultation arrangements, impose new
administrative burdens, push up costs and slow down decision-making.
Britain was not obliged to follow it because of its opt-out from the
Maastricht social chapter, but 90 UK companies would be affected in mainland
Europe and the EU was funding a union campaign to persuade companies which
were not affected by the directive to follow it voluntarily.
He dismissed the commission's claim that the directive would increase
identification of employees with their companies and increase productivity.

FT  20 APR 94 / Disaster centre for City banks opens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A disaster recovery centre allowing banks and other financial institutions
to continue trading with only a brief break if the City of London is bombed
was unveiled yesterday.
The centre has been built by Syntegra, the systems integration arm of
British Telecommunications.
The Pounds 15m centre, which has 500 trading positions, will be able to
start within an hour if trading operations of banks are interrupted by
incidents such as the IRA's Bishopsgate bomb of a year ago.
Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, disclosed that it would be the first
client of the Docklands-based centre. Its decision follows a contingency
planning exercise after the Bishopsgate bombing.
The centre, which will be able to operate independently for 10 days even if
Docklands power supplies and services are disrupted, will also act as a
back-up in case of electricity or telecommunications breakdowns in the City.
Syntegra said its decision to build the centre was partly based on the huge
risks to securities settlement operations. Trading operations might be
unable to carry out back-office clearing and settlement operations in the
event of a bombing.
Mr Michael Cowan, chief administration officer for Merrill Lynch Europe,
said 'years of hard-earned trust and goodwill could be lost in a few
seconds' if the business was unable to execute a securities trade for a
client. Merrill Lynch has arranged for 2,500 telephone lines to be switched
to the centre in an emergency.

FT  20 APR 94 / Surge in part-time work hits tax take
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury is losing as much as Pounds 700m a year in tax revenues as a
result of the switch from full-time to part-time jobs in the labour market,
according to figures published today by the Trades Union Congress.
The fall in the number of registered unemployed during the past 12 months
has been caused by the creation of part-time jobs - 200,000 in the year to
the autumn of 1993. But part-time workers pay far less in tax and National
Insurance contributions than those in full-time jobs.
The TUC said a part-time worker earned an average of Pounds 80 a week but
would pay no more than Pounds 320 a year in tax and National Insurance,
whereas a full-time worker on an average weekly wage of Pounds 300 would pay
about Pounds 3,900.
'The difference between the revenue produced by 200,000 part-time jobs and
the same number of full-time jobs would be equivalent to a penny on the
standard rate of income tax,' the TUC said.
'These figures suggest the revenue gain from each full-time job is at least
10 times greater than a part-time job,' added Mr John Monks, TUC general
secretary. 'The switch to part-time working has big implications not only
for workers and employers but also for the government.'

FT  20 APR 94 / Watchdog praises Treasury debt sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Audit Office told parliament yesterday that the Treasury's sale
of debt in British Telecommunications and the privatised electricity
companies 'represented a great measure of success in a novel and complex
transaction'.
The Treasury raised Pounds 1.3bn in 1992 through a complex auction of its
remaining holdings of debt in privatised UK companies.
The public-spending watchdog recommended that, in future sales, the Treasury
should 'continue to explore the scope for further restructuring of the
remaining debt'. Only one restructuring of the debt - a conversion of BT
debt from domestic to Eurobond form - was undertaken last time. The watchdog
also recommended that investors should be allowed to bid for parts of
issues.
'We are clearly focused on these two aspects and are thinking through how we
can incorporate these features,' said Salomon Brothers, the US investment
bank appointed to advise the Treasury on the next debt sale. This is due to
take place later this fiscal year.
The government still holds a total of Pounds 2.86bn of debt - Pounds 1.22bn
of BT debt and Pounds 1.64bn of electricity company debt - which was left on
the companies' balance sheets at privatisation. However, some of that debt
is very short-dated and unlikely to be sold.
Although the watchdog was 'happy with almost everything', the Treasury was
criticised for assuming that BT's refinancing costs would be refinanced in
the sterling bond market, so that the continuing stream of tax deductions
allowable for interest payments on the new debt would be lower than on the
original debt. Instead, the debt was repurchased by BT from cash reserves.
However, the methodology for calculating the baseline prices was
'technically incorrect'.

FT  20 APR 94 / Opt-out from EU rules on child labour blocked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's opt-out from a European law limiting the number of hours children
can work has been denied for the time being by an unexpected move by Greece,
which holds the EU presidency.
The UK secured a controversial four-year exemption last year to allow
children under 15 - such as paper boys and girls - to work more than 12
hours a week. This gave the UK a six-year breathing space, including the two
years allowed to pass the directive into national law.
Since then the Geneva-based International Labour Organisation has complained
that the special treatment for Britain flouts international conventions on
child labour, and the European parliament has voted to take the British
dero-gation out of the directive.
The European Commission accepted the parliament's amendment, so that, under
EU voting procedures, only a unanimous vote of the 12 labour and employment
ministers yesterday could safeguard the British exemption. Countries that
remain unhappy with the package, such as Ireland, Italy and Spain, were
expected to abstain to allow the opt-out through.
But Greece, without any warning, announced it would vote for the
parliament's amendment. The directive will come back to the next Social
Affairs Council in June, but the controversy surrounding the provisions for
Britain looks set to intensify.
'The more it goes on, the more it is likely to unravel,' a commission
official said yesterday. Mr Michael Forsyth, junior employment minister,
nevertheless said: 'We've today succeeded in preventing the European
parliament proposal to remove the UK opt-out, so I'm very relaxed.'
Greece's change of heart seemed to be caused by annoyance with Britain for
supporting German objections to the EU's fourth poverty programme, an
Ecu122m (Pounds 96.1m) programme to help the estimated 52m union citizens
earning less than half the average income of their countries.
Germany said that under subsidiarity this was a matter for national
governments. The UK, which has no objection of principle, backed Bonn.
In spite of this expression of solidarity, the gulf between Britain and its
partners on social policy gaped anew when the 11 forged ahead with the
directive setting up elected works councils in large trans-European
companies.

FT  20 APR 94 / Nixon in hospital after serious stroke
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Former President Richard Nixon was reported to be in stable condition in a
New York hospital yesterday after suffering a serious stroke at his New
Jersey home while preparing for dinner on Monday evening.
Doctors reported that he was alert, but unable to speak and paralysed down
the right side of the body. They promised a clearer public prognosis within
24 hours. His wife, Pat Nixon, died last year.
Mr Nixon, now 81, left office in August 1974 ahead of expected impeachment
proceedings because of the Watergate scandals, becoming the only one of the
42 US presidents forced to resign. He was elected in 1968, narrowly beating
Vice-President Hubert Humphrey, and in a 1972 landslide over Senator George
McGovern.
He has spent much of the last 20 years seeking to recover from that
disgrace, writing several books, mostly on foreign policy, and speaking and
travelling extensively. He was in Moscow last month, but a planned meeting
with Mr Boris Yeltsin was cancelled after the Russian president expressed
annoyance that Mr Nixon had met opposition leaders.
There are five living US ex-presidents, an unusually high number. Mr George
Bush is living in Texas and Maine, keeping a mostly low profile, as is Mr
Ronald Reagan in California. Mr Gerald Ford spends much time playing golf.
Mr Jimmy Carter, the only Democrat among them, has remained active in public
life, through his domestic projects building low-income housing and his
international mediation.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr James Woolsey, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said
yesterday more cases of Americans selling secrets to foreign agents were
about to unfold, Reuter reports from Washington.
He told NBC's Today Show that the CIA was not the only agency penetrated by
the Soviet Union and cases were being made against present and former
officials based on information obtained from abroad after the collapse of
communism.
CIA official Mr Aldrich Ames has been charged with being a Soviet 'mole' in
the CIA and blamed for the deaths of US secret agents in Russia. He and his
Colombian-born wife, Rosaria, are awaiting trial on espionage charges.
Mr Woolsey said there were similar cases in the works and indicated that Mr
Ames had yet to co-operate with government investigators, despite reports
that he is willing to help if the government promises leniency for his wife.
'As communism collapsed in East Germany and in the Soviet Union as well as
in eastern Europe and other countries, the CIA has come across a good deal
of counter-intelligence information,' Mr Woolsey said. 'We have shared this
as appropriate with law enforcement agencies in the US.' he said.
'People should not have the impression that the Aldrich Ames case is the
only counter-intelligence case,' he added. Even if Mr Ames refuses to tell
the full story of his alleged involvement with the Soviet Union in return
for cash, Mr Woolsey said, US investigators will be able to find out what
happened.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The kidnapped president of Banamex-Accival, Mexico's largest financial
institution, has begged his business partners to pay the required ransom as
soon as possible.
In a letter sent to the Mexican press, Mr Alfredo Harp Helu asked Banamex
directors to arrange a credit to pay the ransom demand, reported to be
Dollars 50m (Pounds 34m). He urged his partners not to use professional
advisers in negotiations on the ransom, and promised to repay loans made on
his behalf.
'Why do you not respond? What is the point of keeping me in this situation?
Why prolong my captivity further? Sadly I realise the idea prevails that my
life is not in danger and that I am under pressure to write, which is not
true,' the letter said.
'The idea of being executed worries me terribly when I have the wealth to
guarantee payment of the ransom.'
Mr Harp, whose fortune is estimated at about Dollars 1bn, was kidnapped on
March 14. The letter is the second from him that has been given to the
press. Last week, the kidnappers threatened to kill Mr Harp unless the
ransom was paid.
He is understood to have been insured by Banamex against kidnapping. The
insurance company is reported to have hired US specialists to carry out
negotiations. In an earlier communication, the kidnappers had rejected an
insurance company's offer of ransom as insufficient.
The kidnapping had sent Mexico's stock market plunging and continues to
concern the country's close-knit financial community. In a separate letter,
Mr Harp said the only motive for his kidnapping was financial.

FT  20 APR 94 / World Trade News: UK-S Korea in power agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The nuclear power companies for South Korea and for England and Wales
yesterday sealed agreement for a significant exchange of information,
expertise and staff.
The agreement comes ahead of a virtual tripling by Korea of its nuclear
power capacity to about 20,000MW by the year 2006. Nuclear Electric, the UK
company which generates about a quarter of England and Wales's electricity,
hopes for a significant involvement in this expansion.
Its chances of significantly increasing its UK output are restricted by a
moratorium on nuclear power construction in the UK. Although it is pressing
to build Sizewell C, a nuclear station on the Suffolk coast, its ability to
do so depends on a forthcoming government review of the nuclear industry.
Nuclear Electric is already part of a consortium with Westinghouse hoping to
build a power station of the Sizewell C design in Taiwan.

<TEXT>
The Clinton administration is to provide Dollars 50m (Pounds 34m) in
guarantees for a Dollars 70m fund to direct private capital to environmental
businesses working in developing countries. This is the first of a series of
business-related initiatives for Earth Week.
The guarantees will be issued by the US Overseas Private Investment
Corporation for medium-term notes to be placed by J P Morgan, the investment
bank. The fund will be managed by Global Environmental Emerging Markets
Fund, a limited partnership, which has raised Dollars 20m more.
Mrs Ruth Harkin, Opic president, said the fund could eventually make loans
totalling some Dollars 500m-Dollars 700m. It is a prime example of the kind
of 'public-private' initiatives the administration will support to develop
new technologies and boost exports. It requires private sector companies
also to put their own money at risk.
The environmental fund is the fifth private equity fund Opic has supported.
Two more region-specific funds are to be announced and more are in the
pipeline.
Mr H Jeffrey Leonard, president of Global Environment Management
Corporation, said the growth areas for trade in environmental technology
were clean water and clean energy. 'Rapidly industrialising countries in
Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe need to increase dramatically the
production of electricity to maintain economic growth.'
The US Commerce Department is for the first time taking a big role in Earth
Week activities, which are taking place globally this week and are aimed at
focusing attention on environmental issues. It yesterday briefed journalists
on its work to develop a 'green GDP', a statistical analysis of the
environment as it relates to the economy.

<TEXT>
International business leaders believe China will rank among the world's
four most competitive economies in the year 2010, alongside those of the US,
Japan and Germany.
This is according to the Swiss-based International Institute for Management
Development and the World Economic Forum.
Selected results of its survey of 1,747 top executives around the world,
published today, show that the US and Japan are expected to head the
competitiveness league table early in the next century.
Germany is the only European nation among the predicted high performers,
with China followed by two other Asian nations, South Korea and Singapore.
The full results of the survey will be published in September as part of the
IMD/WEF annual World Competitiveness Report.
Business leaders regard the US and Japanese governments as most active in
promoting competitiveness, followed by those of Singapore. In Europe,
Germany and Switzerland are seen as having governments most supportive of
business.
Asked where they would ideally choose to live and work, nearly half the
executives put the US in their top three, regardless of where they lived
when responding. East Asians favoured Australia, while Europeans were more
attracted by Switzerland, France or Britain.

FT  20 APR 94 / Chile to take healthcare medicine: Reforms to provide a
service the country feels it deserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When an economist, not a physician, was named as Chile's health minister, it
seemed that the 'profound health reforms' promised by the new administration
might be more than just words.
Last week the new minister, Mr Carlos Massad, took the first tentative steps
in making good that pledge by setting efficiency targets, introducing a new
system of budget allocation and making decentralisation a priority.
Like many Latin American health ministers, Mr Massad faces the challenge of
rebuilding a service that was grossly underfunded throughout the 1980s.
Furthermore, he must deal with the problems of regulating competing private
and public services and of satisfying pent-up demand for more sophisticated
treatment.
'Because Chile started earlier with deregulation, market imperfections in
the health sector have developed earlier,' says Mr Jorge Katz of the UN's
Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. 'Chile heralds some
of the problems to come in Latin America generally.'
Those problems are plain to see. Chile's creaking health sector is
associated by the public with bad service, strikes, outmoded technology and
long waiting lists.
Dr Julio Montt Vidal, director of Santiago's Calvo Mackenna paediatric
hospital, does not believe things are so bad. He points out that Chile,
which spends less than 6 per cent of gross domestic product on health, has
achieved a life expectancy index of 72 and an infant mortality rate of 17
per thousand. In the US - which spends more than 10 times as much per person
 -results are only marginally better at 76 and 9 respectively.
Dr Montt argues that present difficulties relate to rising expectations.
'Our crisis is one of success. We've already solved most of our basic
problems.'
But satisfying those expectations has not proved easy. Resources have gone
largely to restoring salaries and repairing crumbling hospitals. 'It has had
hardly any noticeable effect because there was so much to do,' says Dr
Francisco Peragallo, medical director at Santiago's Salvador Hospital.
Mr Massad has promised to generate new funds by cracking down on non-payment
of personal contributions to the public health system. By the end of 1994,
he expects 60 per cent of outstanding payments to be cleared up.
The public sector is only part of his problem. In Chile, as in much of Latin
America, the 1980s saw the growth of private health provision as the public
system deteriorated. Nearly a quarter of Chileans now have private health
insurance and ultra-modern clinics have sprung up to compete with often
dilapidated state hospitals. But critics say private health insurers
(Isapres) are being unfairly subsidised by the state.
First, many Isapre affiliates (who usually have to pay a percentage of
hospital fees) opt for state hospitals when they need expensive treatment
and cannot afford their share of private fees. In effect, they are
defrauding the state system to which they do not contribute.
Mr Massad has promised to tighten up on such cases through better
record-keeping. 'An Isapre affiliate who receives public attention cannot be
identified as such. . . which results in a cross-subsidy in which the
poorest subsidise the most well-to-do.'
But closing loopholes does not address the fundamental problem that millions
of Chileans, not rich enough for adequate private coverage yet not content
with declining state provision, are falling between two stools.
Second, Isapre premiums are prohibitively expensive for most old people or
those with chronic diseases. 'Between 25 and 40, people are good business.
But after 45 or 50 years of age the treatment of disease inevitably becomes
more expensive,' says Dr Montt.
'The old and sick abandon the private system and re-in-
corporate themselves into the public sector even though their earnings
during their most productive years have gone into private hands. That is
unjust,' he says. He believes Isapres should be obliged to introduce
additional insurance coverage for severe illness and old age.
Another concern is costs, boosted by higher wages and stricter laws on
pharmaceutical patents which reduce local pirating of expensive drugs. Mr
Katz says prices have also escalated because of a rise in unnecessary
treatment. 'A large proportion of increased expenditure has gone into higher
profits, not better healthcare,' he says.
Dr Juan Giaconi, professor of public health at the Catholic University, says
costs can be reduced and efficiency raised by greater decentralisation,
allowing hospitals to diagnose problems and seek their own solutions.
Mr Massad has indeed created a management support division of the Health
Ministry with the express purpose of facilitating decentralisation. 'To
decentralise one has to help institutions to improve their ability to manage
themselves,' he says.
The announcements last week are merely a first step in reforming not only
institutions but 'some of our ways of thinking as well', Mr Massad says.
Over the next months, he will begin to tackle the more complex problems of
making health provision more responsive to patient demands, as well as
regulating against soaring costs and cross-subsidies.
Chile is a fast-growing economy with pretensions to leave the
'underdeveloped' world and its population wants a health service to match.
Mr Massad will need all his economic acumen if he is to meet such high
expectations.

FT  20 APR 94 / World Trade News: Progress by poorest countries still weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The world's poorest countries notched up average output growth of 2 per cent
last year, up from 0.4 per cent in 1992 but still not enough to stem the
decline in income per head.
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, in its latest
report* on the least-developed countries, published today predicts economic
expansion of 2.8 per cent this year, 'assuming normal weather'. That would
slightly outpace population growth.
Despite the dismal overall picture, Unctad notes that about a quarter of the
47 UN-defined LDCs show welcome, if halting, signs of progress - a revival
of growth, deepening economic reform and better governance (improved
management and less corruption).
Most of these nations are in Asia, where output of LDCs grew by 4.7 per cent
in 1993. Similar growth is expected this year. Asian LDCs have benefited
from the general economic dynamism of the region, though some African
nations have also performed better than the LDC average.
Overall, however, African LDCs showed little or no growth in 1993, after
three consecutive years of GDP decline. Unctad predicts another year of
stagnation in 1994.
Many African nations have been ravaged by war which has halted development.
The continent's predominantly agrarian economies have also been hit by poor
weather, including drought.
Unctad notes that falling output per head has taken a terrible human toll in
terms of reduced calorie intakes, increased mortality and sickness, lower
school enrolment and further immiseration of women and children, society's
weakest members.
Most LDCs have responded with further policy reforms, but the extra
financial support from donor nations needed to underpin those reforms, has
not been adequate, the report says. More vigorous debt relief measures are
also needed.
Unctad is particularly concerned that many cash-strapped countries have been
unable to improve or even maintain basic health and education services
essential for development. These services, free to users, must be a priority
for LDCs and aid donors, the report says.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars this week stepped up its assault on China's growing
luxury car market with the appointment of Inchcape, the UK marketing and
services group, as its exclusive distributor in China.
At a lavish signing ceremony held on the Great Wall, 70km north of Beijing,
Inchcape announced it would establish a series of regional dealerships in
southern China, before expanding to Shanghai and Beijing. A new company,
named Rolls-Royce Motor Cars of China, will be formed to help build sales,
service and parts facilities - complete with training centres to train its
service staff.
More than 50 Rolls-Royce cars have been sold in the Chinese market since
1992, including 30 units in 1993 and 11 in the first quarter of this year.
Customers consist of private entrepreneurs, large joint venture companies
and five-star hotels.

FT  20 APR 94 / World Trade News: UK-led group to construct Lisbon bridge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal yesterday chose a group led by Trafalgar House of Britain to build
and operate a Es180bn (Pounds 714m) toll bridge over the river Tagus near
Lisbon, one of Europe's largest privately-financed infrastructure projects.
The consortium, Lusoponte, is to complete the 12km bridge, Europe's longest
continuous fixed river-crossing, by March 31 1998, in time for Expo '98,
which is to be held in Lisbon.
The group's proposal for a 30-year concession remains to be ratified by the
Portuguese cabinet.
Mr Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral, public works minister, said the European
Union was committed to pay about half the cost of the project, which has
been calculated at projected 1998 prices, out of the cohesion fund for
aiding the development of poorer EU member states.
The remainder of the investment will be made by Lusoponte, which has the
financial backing of five Portuguese institutions and 11 international
banks. The contract for the new bridge includes a concession to operate the
existing April 25 toll bridge in Lisbon.
Lusoponte was chosen over one other short-listed consortium led by Bouygues,
a French construction company. 'Small differences over the technical
specifications of the bridge clinched the deal,' said Mr Jose Manuel Serrao
of Gattel, the state-owned concession company. 'The two proposals were
otherwise very similar.'
Trafalgar House, owns 25 per cent of Lusoponte. H. Hagen, a Portuguese
subsidiary of the French company Campenon Bernard, also holds 25 per cent
and will handle construction.
Bento Pedroso Construcoes of Brazil owns 13 per cent of the consortium. The
remainder of the capital is divided equally among four Portuguese companies:
Edifer, Mota &amp; Companhia, Somague and Teixeira Duarte.
The four-lane bridge will cross the Tagus estuary from Sacavem on the
eastern outskirts of Lisbon to Montijo on the southern bank, where the river
is 10km wide. The central section will be a cross-stayed span 400m long and
35m-high between two towers. Lusoponte will build 6km of approach roads as
well as the 12km bridge.
Shares in the Portuguese companies with a stake in Lusoponte rose sharply on
the Lisbon bourse yesterday.

FT  20 APR 94 / World Trade News: Concern at Japan surplus crosses Pacific -
Asia now surpasses the US on the wrong side of that trade balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan has become used to its troublesome trade surplus causing ructions. For
the most part the complaints have come from the other side of the Pacific.
But the latest set of figures released this week look set to cause concern
closer to home: last year, for the first time, Japan's trade surplus with
the rest of Asia surpassed that with the US. It grew 25.1 per cent during
the year ending March 31 to reach Dollars 55.95bn, compared with a surplus
with the US of Dollars 51.14bn.
The headline figure was heavily influenced by the 12.2 per cent appreciation
of the yen against both the dollar and the Asian currencies pegged to the US
currency. Even so, in yen terms the surplus rose 8.5 per cent.
A 16 per cent increase in Japanese exports to Asia, which reached Dollars
139bn, was mostly responsible. Exports to Singapore and Malaysia grew by 24
per cent each while those to the Philippines expanded 30 per cent.
China was the fastest-growing export market, up 42 per cent to Dollars 18bn.
Officially, Japan ran a Dollars 3.48bn trade deficit with China last year,
but the published figures exclude trade via Hong Kong with which Japan had a
Dollars 20.9bn surplus.
Mr Jiro Saito, Japan's vice finance minister, said the increase in Japanese
exports was partly caused by Asia's rapid economic growth. Certainly, Asia's
continuing economic growth is dragging in Japanese finished products.
Exports of Japanese electrical machinery to Asia were up 24 per cent at
Dollars 39.5bn last year, while exports of vehicles increased 18 per cent to
Dollars 15.2bn.
China and the countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations were
particularly important export markets for Japanese vehicle manufacturers.
Exports rose 46 per cent and 29 per cent respectively.
Mr Saito said the growth of the surplus with Asia had also been generated by
Japanese companies' rapid expansion in the region. Motivated by the
appreciating yen and high domestic manufacturing costs, Japanese groups
invested increasing amounts in production overseas in the late 1980s.
According to the Japan external trade organisation (Jetro), Japanese direct
investment in Asia increased from Dollars 4.87bn in 1987 to Dollars 8.26bn
two years later.
These new Japanese-owned factories, which have recently started full
production, are now having a significant impact on trade flows. The reason
is that most assemble products using imported Japanese components.
A recently published study by Jetro showed that in 1992 only 17 of the 114
responding Japanese companies operating in Singapore used eight or more
local sub-contractors. Exports of Japanese integrated circuits to the newly
industrialised Asian nations increased 30 per cent last year, while those to
the Asean countries rose 64 per cent.
'Ultimately we want to use local components,' said Sanyo, the Japanese
electrical and electronics group which has recently built a video recorder
factory in Malaysia, a battery plant in Singapore, and a home refrigeration
plant in Indonesia. 'It makes us more flexible and helps us respond to
market needs. But in the first few years that's difficult. It takes time to
build up local suppliers.'
This wave of investment, principally in newly-industrialised countries such
as South Korea and Taiwan, and in Asean nations such as Thailand and
Malaysia, has peaked. Japanese companies are now turning their eyes to
China. Direct investment collapsed after the Tiananmen square massacre in
June 1989, but from a low of Dollars 296m in 1988, Japanese investment
reached Dollars 1.07bn in 1992. More Japanese money was put into China
between April and September in 1993 - the last period for which figures are
available - than into any other Asian country.
The investments cover a wide variety of sectors. Honda, the automotive group
has announced four investments in China worth more than Dollars 77m since
1992. In the last year, Sanyo, which already had 10 plants in China, has
built three new factories capable of making commercial refrigeration units,
compact disc player components and non-CFC refrigerating chemicals.
Matsushita, the electronics group, is building a Y10bn (Pounds 65.8m) plant
to manufacture 1.5m video recorder units.
Economists believe that in the longer term Japan's surplus with Asia should
decline as its domestic economy recovers and pulls in imports. The problem
of Japanese component exports to overseas plants should also become less
acute as they increasingly use local parts. But in the short term that will
do little to pacify the critics.
The Japanese government looks as though it will have to become used to
reproaches from both sides of the Pacific for some time.

FT  20 APR 94 / South African Elections: God - and realpolitik - bring in
Buthelezi / What lay behind Zulu leader's decision to end his poll boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'It's just like a dream. Really like a dream.' For years, Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu has spoken for the South African nation at great
moments in its history, and yesterday was no exception.
Outside the room where South Africa's top political leaders had just signed
a last-minute peace deal bringing the Inkatha Freedom party into next week's
elections, he was unashamedly moved: 'To all of us, it just seemed totally
impossible that this would happen. What words can we use except just to say,
thank God?'
He might have added that God moves in mysterious ways - and that so does
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader, who yesterday executed a
dramatic climbdown on virtually all of his constitutional and political
demands and agreed to fight an election at less than a week's notice,
despite the huge practical and logistical disadvantages which that imposes
on his party.
Inkatha negotiators involved in the talks, which were completed at lightning
speed after months of fruitless wrangling, are at a loss to offer a fully
coherent explanation for Chief Buthelezi's change of heart. Speaking
privately, they cite two factors as central: the role of religion (the chief
is a devout Christian, as are most South Africans); and the intervention of
a deus ex machina in the form of Prof Washington Okumu, the Kenyan mediator
who brokered the deal, and who is also deeply religious.
Chief Buthelezi delivered a eulogy to Prof Okumu just before signing the
agreement, which will entrench the position of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini
in the constitution, but in only the vaguest of terms. All other
constitutional issues - including Inkatha's demand for federalism - will be
left to international mediation only after the election.
Those present at the talks said much of the credit goes to Prof Okumu, a
close friend of Chief Buthelezi for more than 20 years (they met at a prayer
breakfast in the US) who also knows the other two main protagonists - Mr
Nelson Mandela, African National Congress leader, and President FW de Klerk
 -and is a fellow African with a healthy working knowledge of the
continent's disaster stories.
'Okumu read him the African future. He told him, you're staring into the
abyss,' said one participant. Others said it was their shared religion which
explains the deal. And Chief Buthelezi himself cited the intervention of
God, saying he would not have met Prof Okumu to hear his mediation proposals
if the Zulu leader's aircraft returning him to Natal had not been forced to
turn back last Friday to Lanseria airport near Johannesburg where the
professor was waiting. 'It was as though God had prevented me from leaving -
as though Jonah had been brought back from the whale,' he said.
His advisers give a similar mystical explanation. But there seems a fair
chance that shrewder political cal-culations were also involved.
'Chief Buthelezi was thoroughly receptive when someone came along and
offered him a way out,' says a participant. 'The ground was already fertile
for Okumu,' he adds, noting that Chief Buthelezi may have come under
pressure from King Goodwill to secure his position or lose the king's
backing for the boycott.
Prof Okumu was a member of the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy, a
coalition of Kenyan opposition parties which led the calls for President
Daniel arap Moi to accept a multi-party system.
Chief Buthelezi yesterday outlined a flurry of meetings and phone calls
between Prof Okumu and the three protagonists to the conflict which
culminated at a 'Jesus rally' held in Durban on Sunday to pray for peace in
Natal. This was attended by Chief Buthelezi, Mr Jacob Zuma, ANC negotiator,
and Mr Danie Schutte, government negotiator, who took the occasion to study
a draft of yesterday's accord.
Mr Mandela and the ANC were initially said to be lukewarm about the
mediation effort. ANC hardliners - and, strangely enough, some members of
the South African government - seemed disappointed by the deal, on the
principle that Chief Buthelezi ought to have been crushed rather than
accommodated.
'The coup de grace was about to be delivered to Chief Buthelezi,' says one
of those close to the talks. 'Some wish it had been.'
This fact, and the prospect of electoral competition from Chief Buthelezi in
Natal, could explain the rather grim faces of most ANC and government
negotiators at the victory press conference.
Inkatha will certainly take votes away from Mr de Klerk's National party in
Natal province which includes Chief Buthelezi's KwaZulu 'homeland' - though
there is a chance that the two parties could form a post-election pact to
deny the ANC control of the province; and the ANC itself will be denied the
victory there which an IFP boycott would have guaranteed.
Inkatha will be disadvantaged by its short election campaign, but it could
still get 30 per cent or more of the vote in Natal. It is a disciplined
organisation which can get its message out rapidly through the system of
village chiefs which it controls. And King Goodwill's endorsement of the
elections - delivered yesterday - will be heeded by many of his 9m subjects.
The Inkatha leader has, after all, already been campaigning for months: he
has been in the news almost daily stoking ethnic loyalty to Inkatha, and
this could still pay off.
This may have been Chief Buthelezi's game plan all along: to hold out until
the very last moment, cornering as much publicity as possible along the way.
If so, it was a strategy which cost at least 500 lives in the past six
weeks.
Violence is likely to continue - probably at undiminished levels -
throughout the polling and even afterward. Indeed, Archbishop Tutu's dream
could still turn to nightmare: Chief Buthelezi could refuse to accept the
election result, citing the intimidation which will certainly occur.

Protesters ran riot through factories yesterday in Medan, north-western
Indonesia's industrial centre, tearing apart a doll-clothes factory and
wrecking cars in the sixth day of labour-related protests, Reuter reports
from Medan.
Labour activists said two of their leaders had been arrested and branches
across the country were warned against launching sympathy strikes. 'Many of
our branch leaders were approached by soldiers making threats and
frightening them into not taking part in action, particularly in the Jakarta
area,' said one unionist at the independent Indonesia Labour Welfare Union
(SBSI).
Several factories in Tanjung Morawa, near Medan, were badly damaged by
youths. Citra Sandang Graha, a doll-clothes factory, was gutted while a
motorcycle parts manufacturer was also damaged.

FT  20 APR 94 / ADB tightens lending policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Asian Development Bank has tightened its lending policies in order to
overcome resistance from shareholders, particularly the US, to a capital
increase.
The Manila-based institution says in its annual report, published today,
that it will seek through 'appropriate portfolio diversification' to reduce
the present concentration of loans among a few borrowers.
The ADB, which has admitted to an 'approval culture' under which the
emphasis was on meeting annual lending targets, says it will strengthen
country risk assessment, taking into account both the risks of individual
countries and the concentration of loans.
It also details explicit policies on delinquent loans. If any payment is
overdue by 60 days, no new loan to the borrower's country will be signed.
After a further 30 days, all disbursements to that country will be
suspended. The bank will be more rigorous about making provisions for loan
losses.
The toughening was carried out as part of talks on the bank's capital needs,
with the US calling for big changes to lending policies. Consensus on
doubling capital from the present Dollars 23bn was recently reached by
shareholders after Washington softened its resistance.
The bank, which is running up against lending limits and has three new
members among the former Soviet central Asian republics, will hope to clinch
agreement at its annual meeting in Nice next month.
Indonesia accounts for Dollars 8.26bn, or 33.6 per cent of outstanding loans
made out of the bank's ordinary capital resources. India, the Philippines,
China and Pakistan account for a further 53.6 per cent between them.
Only 13 countries have loans outstanding, of which one is South Korea as it
pays off old loans, and three - Burma, Nepal and Bangladesh - account for
0.01 per cent or less of total lending. The four economic 'tigers' of
southeast Asia - Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore - have become
too rich to qualify for new loans.
Uncertainty over the bank's capital and policies contributed to a slowing in
loan growth last year. Approvals of loans from ordinary capital resources
rose only 0.7 per cent to Dollars 3.98bn, but concessional loans from the
Asian Development Fund rose 12.3 per cent to Dollars 1.3bn, mainly because
of resumption of lending to Vietnam as the US lifted its embargo on
business.
Concessional financing is also quite concentrated. Of 25 countries with ADF
loans outstanding, Pakistan accounts for Dollars 4.2bn, or 30 per cent,
Bangladesh 28 per cent and Sri Lanka 10 per cent. India and China are not
eligible because other international development institutions are supposed
to meet their needs, since their size would mean them taking a very large
proportion of ADB concessional resources.

FT  20 APR 94 / Watanabe drops bid to be PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's opposition Liberal Democratic party averted a break-up yesterday
when Mr Michio Watanabe, a veteran faction leader, formally dropped his bid
to be prime minister.
Mr Watanabe cited policy differences with the ruling coalition as the reason
for his decision to drop plans to defect and run for the leadership.
The LDP will now follow normal party practice and propose its president, Mr
Yohei Kono, as prime ministerial candidate. He is nearly certain to lose
against Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister, in a parliamentary vote in
the next few days.
Senior coalition officials yesterday continued to inch towards agreement on
a joint policy platform, required before the formation of a new government.
By yesterday evening, they had settled almost all the points on a 10-point
policy plan, with the exception of a proposal backed by the Japan Renewal
party, which dominates coalition policy, to increase indirect taxes.
The Social Democratic party, the coalition's largest partner, wants to avoid
a firm commitment on raising sales tax, for fear of alienating its
diminishing electoral support.
Little argument is expected, by contrast, over the line-up of the new
cabinet. Mr Hata said yesterday he wants few changes in the present cabinet,
to allow incumbent ministers to defend this year's budget as it passes
through parliament. Only two jobs are likely to be vacant, those of foreign
minister and of chief cabinet secretary - the government's spokesman.
Parliamentary officials said they were working on the assumption that there
would be a coalition accord on tax in time for a parliamentary vote on the
leadership this week.

Mr Alan Bond, former Australian tycoon, yesterday abandoned a request for a
hearing into his mental fitness and agreed to appear at a bankruptcy
examination next month, writes Nikki Tait.
On Mr Bond's admission to a private hospital in Perth in February, a
psychiatric report said he was suffering from depression, and would be put
on Prozac, the anti-depressant drug. But yesterday Mr Michael Barnett, Mr
Bond's lawyer, told the Federal Court in Sydney Mr Bond did not want to air
intimate details on his mental health in public, or subject family and
friends to scrutiny on the subject.

FT  20 APR 94 / Bank loan problem 'over the peak'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The problem of non-performing loans which has weighed down Japan's banks
over the past few years and contributed to economic slowdown is about to
peak, the country's central bank governor said yesterday.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, said that while Japanese banks
were still mid-way in their efforts to clear bad debts, the write-offs they
have made and a slowing rate of emergence of new loan difficulties indicate
that 'the bad debt problem is over the peak'.
Speaking to the press before a meeting on Sunday of finance ministers and
central bankers from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, Mr
Mieno indicated he expected this turning point in bank bad debts to help
sustain economic recovery in Japan by making banks more open again to
extending loans.
'The experience of US commercial banks shows us that even if the problem of
non-performing loans is not completely resolved, when about half of the
banks' bad debts have been written off, and they begin to see light at the
end of the tunnel, they begin to take a very positive lending stance. We
believe Japan's financial institutions will take a similar path,' Mr Mieno
said.
Mr Mieno pointed out that the amount of bad debts Japanese banks have on
their books amounted to Y14,000bn (Pounds 91.7bn) at the end of March, or
just 3 per cent of their overall loans.
The top 21 banks had annual net earnings of Y3,000bn to Y4,000bn and
unrealised income on equity of Y21,000bn.
Mr Mieno's remarks add an encouraging note to recent evidence that Japan's
economy may be near to to recovery.
Although he was cautious about whether recent positive indications would
lead to inflation-free growth, he noted 'the foundations for recovery are
being laid'.
Mr Mieno said he had no intention of lowering the official discount rate
from its historically low level of 1.75 per cent and warned that additional
macroeconomic measures might lead to inflation and overheating without
solving Japan's persistent current account surplus.
Japan's benchmark money supply grew 2 per cent in March from the previous
year, marking the twelfth consecutive monthly rise, according to a
preliminary report from the Bank of Japan. M2 - measuring cash in
circulation and demand and time deposits - showed the fastest expansion
year-on-year since December 1991.

FT  20 APR 94 / Pretoria gets economic lift from Europe: Developing-nation
status granted to S Africa on market access
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union foreign ministers yesterday agreed in principle to add South
Africa to the generalised system of preferences (GSP) under which developing
nations are granted virtually tariff-free access to the European market for
their manufactured goods.
The move should go ahead soon after South Africa's first universal suffrage
elections on April 26-28, when the EU should have finalised its 10-year
review of the GSP system, held up until the recent completion of the Uruguay
Round of world trade talks.
'This is aimed as a substantial gesture of support for the elections,' said
an aide to Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner. 'This is what both the
government and the African National Congress have been asking us for.'
But ministers resisted a British-led move to get the EU to commit itself now
to a fully-fledged trade and co-operation agreement with South Africa as the
next stage in closer links. France, Spain, Italy and Belgium prefer a more
evolutionary approach, and got reference to yesterday's decision as an
'interim' agreement struck out of the Council of Ministers' conclusions.
Behind their lukewarm enthusiasm is reluctance to treat South Africa as a
developing country, although its relatively high average earnings mask huge
income gaps within its population. Nevertheless, all 12 EU states agreed to
treat South Africa as a special case.
The EU runs a substantial trade deficit with South Africa, from which it
largely imports minerals and precious metals, most of which already enter
duty-free. In 1992, the Union had an Ecu3.7bn (Pounds 2.84bn) deficit on
imports from South Africa worth Ecu9.1bn, over two-thirds of which were raw
materials. For the first nine months of last year imports were Ecu6.7bn,
against exports to South Africa of Ecu4.1bn, for a deficit of Ecu2.6bn.
Because of the small flows of finished goods that South Africa exports, GSP
treatment will at first be of limited benefit, even with, as ministers also
agreed in principle, flexible rules on so-called accumulated rules of
origin, or treating as South African goods which include components from
neighbouring countries.
However, along with recommendations that member states conclude bilateral
investment protection and promotion pacts with South Africa, and a request
to the European Investment Bank to extend its development financing to the
republic, 'we are creating the climate for investors to take South Africa
more seriously,' as a British official put it.

FT  20 APR 94 / Asia to spend Dollars 950bn on infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asia will need to spend up to Dollars 950bn (Pounds 646bn) on infrastructure
by the year 2000 to meet the demand created by rapid economic growth and
growing populations, the Asian Development Bank estimates today, writes
Alexander Nicoll.
The bank's annual report says developing member countries - virtually all
Asian countries except Japan and North Korea - put 5 per cent of their gross
domestic product each year into physical infrastructure. This 'will have to
rise by another 2 per cent over the next decade if supply is to keep pace
with demand,' it says.
It estimates the needs of the power and transport sectors at Dollars 300bn
to Dollars 350bn each, telecommunications at Dollars 150bn and water supply
and sanitation at Dollars 80bn to Dollars 100bn.
The ADB says this cannot be financed from traditional sources so it suggests
wider application of user charges, tighter commercial discipline on
utilities, and greater private sector involvement.

FT  20 APR 94 / Israel rounds up Hamas supporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RAMALLAH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel yesterday rounded up over 200 supporters of the Hamas Islamic
resistance movement in the Gaza Strip and West Bank in an effort to curb
more bomb attacks threatened by the militant group, which opposes
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, writes Julian Ozanne in Ramallah.
The crackdown has piled intense pressure on the Palestine Liberation
Organisation and could derail hopes for an Israeli-PLO agreement on
Palestinian self rule, expected to be signed next week.
Palestinians said soldiers and plain-clothes intelligence agents raided
homes across the occupied territories, breaking into houses and putting
Hamas sympathisers on to waiting buses. Yesterday's arrests brought the
number of Islamists detained since last week to more than 400.
Hamas has carried out two suicide bomb attacks this month, killing 12
Israelis, and has threatened three more attacks to revenge the February 25
Hebron Mosque massacre.
'We will fight those who continue terror with all the means that are
available to us,' Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said yesterday.
Islamic movement supporters at large yesterday warned the Israeli crackdown
would fuel further violence. In Gaza City Dr Omar Farwana, one of those
temporarily deported to south Lebanon in 1992, said: 'I am afraid instead of
peace and peaceful days there will be more revenge because of this mass
punishment.'
The Hamas issue is becoming a big obstacle in the peace process. The PLO,
which claims to speak for the entire Palestinian nation and is afraid of the
power of Hamas in the occupied territories, has increasingly been forced to
defend Hamas. This week two senior PLO negotiators left peace talks in Cairo
after Israel refused to accede to PLO demands for release of Hamas
prisoners. Israel is deeply concerned by any PLO-Hamas link and Mr Rabin has
warned the PLO that local PLO-Hamas co-operation agreements could sabotage
the peace accord.
'The recent Hamas attacks are directed equally at Israel and at the PLO to
remind the PLO Hamas has substantial power on the ground which cannot be
ignored by the PLO leadership,' said Mr Ziad Abu-Amr, a Palestinian
specialist in Islamic fundamentalism.

FT  20 APR 94 / Japan rethinking use of plutonium in power stations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan is considering reducing the use of plutonium as a fuel for commercial
power stations, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry announced
yesterday.
Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, minister responsible for Miti, said 'discussion is
proceeding in that direction' in a ministry advisory panel on energy,
expected to produce an interim report in June and a final opinion by the end
of the year. 'Discussion so far by the committee seems to be convincing,'
said Mr Kumagai.
He gave no detail, but Mr Kumagai's statement confirms rumours Japan is
having second thoughts about the scope of its controversial billion-yen
nuclear recycling programme.
This could help defuse North Korean allegations that Japan is stockpiling
plutonium to make nuclear bombs. The Tokyo government has frequently denied
having nuclear weapons ambitions, pointing out that this would contravene
its own constitution. Yet the North Korean regime frequently cites its
nuclear suspicions of Japan as a reason for not divulging full information
about its own suspected nuclear weapons programme.
Mr Kumagai's announcement could also make it easier for the Social
Democratic party to co-operate with the rest of the government coalition.
The socialists are environmentally sensitive and espouse a soft line on
North Korea.
Japan's Atomic Energy Commission plans to lift Japan's dependence on nuclear
generated electricity from 28.2 per cent of the total now to 40 per cent in
the next 20 years.
Until recently, it planned to reach that target partly by using
plutonium-fuelled fast breeder reactors, which produce more fuel than they
burn.
A prototype fast breeder named Monju, based on the west coast, began a
self-sustaining nuclear reaction early this month. For the time being, it
uses plutonium supplies from reprocessing plants in France and Britain.
The most recent delivery of French plutonium, halfway round the world to
Tokyo by sea, raised an international outcry. On present energy policies,
the next delivery will come from British Nuclear Fuel's Thorp reprocessing
plant and Cogema's La Hague plant in northern France in three years.
Japan's own reprocessing plant, to extract plutonium from spent fuel from
conventional uranium-fed reactors, is due, on present government policies,
to come into operation early next century. However, the unexpectedly low
price of plutonium on the world market has provided an economic as well as
political reason for a rethink on fast breeders.

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The financial rand, South Africa's main barometer of investor sentiment,
soared yesterday on news that Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom
party had decided to participate in next week's election.
The volatile currency, which last week hit a record low of R5.71 to the
dollar, rose steadily during the day and closed in London at R4.915, up 43
cents on the day.
The commercial rand, the main trading currency, also shrugged off its recent
slide to finish at R3.5575 to the dollar against R3.6605. South African
gilts firmed significantly on the news, with long bond yields down 0.25 per
cent.
On the stock market, gold shares declined as the gold price weakened on
reduced fears of mine disruptions, but industrials finished up 166 points at
5,924. The all-share index at one stage rose 141 points before profit-taking
left it 110 points up at 5,080. The day's gains almost completely made up
losses suffered last week after the initial failure of talks with Inkatha.
Trading was relatively thin as local institutions held on to their stocks
while foreigners were looking for new investments. The combination of the
financial rand's rise and stock market strength meant that, in dollar terms,
some blue-chip shares saw gains of around 8 per cent on the day. 'Everyone's
turned buyers again,' said Mr Nick Pagdon, director of Smith New Court
Securities in London.
'The sentiment's still all politically driven,' remarked another broker,
'but at least this time the movement is up.'
Mr Cedric Savage, president of the South African Chamber of Business, said
the move would help create a positive investment climate. However, analysts
warned against undue optimism about foreign investment.

FT  20 APR 94 / Golf success leaves VW at risk: Economic Watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Volkswagen Golf/Jetta was the best-selling car in western Europe last
year - as in the last 11 years - but the German carmaker remains dangerously
dependent on the success of its leading model range as it has no other
models in the top 10 best-sellers. General Motors and Ford dominate the
list, each having three models in the top 10.
The biggest sales gain was achieved by the Ford Mondeo, which replaced the
outdated Sierra early last year. In a year when the overall new car market
fell 15 per cent, sales of the Mondeo/Sierra jumped 44 per cent, making the
Mondeo the best-selling large family car. The success of the Mondeo is
crucial to Ford of Europe, as it seeks to recover from three years of heavy
losses. Sales of its other two main model ranges, the Escort and the Fiesta,
both plunged last year.
France's merchandise trade surplus was FFr5.40bn (Pounds 630m) in February,
according to seasonally adjusted figures released yesterday by the Customs
Office. It also reported a revised January surplus, of FFr2.68bn from
FFr2.71bn. Unemployment in Sweden fell to 7.8 per cent in March from 8.3 per
cent in February, the Central Bureau of Statistics said yesterday.
Switzerland's real gross domestic product is expected to rise 1 per cent
this year and 1.8 per cent in 1995 according to Basel Economics, a leading
Swiss economic think-tank.

FT  20 APR 94 / EBRD shelves Gdansk project: European News Digest

<TEXT>
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has suspended its
backing for an Ecu68m (Pounds 53m) water treatment project in Gdansk after
allegations that the local water company was operating on land confiscated
from a Jewish family by the Nazis. The bank's decision follows a two-year
campaign by Mrs Ewa Szpicberg, a Polish Holocaust survivor, who says that
some of the water company's facilities in the Polish port city are on
property which was owned by her family before the second world war. Mrs Anne
Wibble, chairwoman of the bank's governors, wrote to Mrs Szpicberg: 'In my
view it is very important that the legal aspects concerning property rights
are clarified before approval of possible EBRD participation in projects of
this kind.'

<TEXT>
Greece's Socialist government, facing a widening budget deficit, yesterday
introduced a 15 per cent tax on earnings from repos - fixed-term repurchase
agreements - in a last-minute amendment to fiscal legislation. The fiscal
package is due to be voted through parliament this week. It includes a
controversial 15 per cent tax on dividends from mutual funds' investments in
government securities. The measure triggered protests from fund managers
because interest on government bonds otherwise remains tax-free. With growth
in tax revenues running at around 12 per cent for the first quarter, against
a target of 22 per cent, the government is trying to boost income from other
sources. Projections by private sector economists indicate the government
borrowing requirement will rise to 17 per cent of gross domestic product
this year, against a target of 12.8 per cent.

FT  20 APR 94 / Siemens chief in nuclear plea: European News Digest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western companies and countries should work together to help Russia improve
safety standards at its nuclear power stations, Mr Heinrich von Pierer,
chairman of Siemens, the German electrical group, (above) said yesterday.
'There is no need for any further studies, it's like an alibi for not doing
anything,' he said. The issue was too important for normal competitive
factors to have priority, and he would not be against co-operation with Asea
Brown Boveri, Siemens' big European rival in power generating equipment, to
modernise Russia's nuclear stations. Mr von Pierer estimated that it would
cost DM12bn-DM15bn for Russia to modernise its newer nuclear stations, of
which DM5bn would have to be financed abroad. He said gas-fired power
stations were the cheapest and fastest way for Russia to replace its older
nuclear stations. Siemens has a joint venture in St Petersburg, Interturbo,
which is to build four gas turbines for a nearby combined cycle power
station and four more for a plant in Kazakhstan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Parliament is heading for a financial crisis as a result of its
decision to bow to French pressure for a new parliament building in
Strasbourg, according to an unpublished report by the parliament's
secretariat. Draft budget estimates for next year, produced by Mr Enrico
Vinci, the parliament's secretary-general, show that the strain of financing
the building will help push the parliament's running costs from Ecu692m
(Pounds 544m) next year to Ecu819m in 1997. The extra costs will increase
the parliament's share of the Union's Ecu4bn administrative budget from
17.96 per cent to 20.02 per cent, breaching a 20 per cent limit agreed with
the Commission and the Council of Ministers.
The report forecasts that if nothing is done the budget will continue to
rise, reaching Ecu874m, or 20.83 per cent of the administrative budget, by
1999. The financial crisis was triggered by a controversial decision last
month by the parliament's administrative committee to go ahead with a Pounds
300m building to replace its existing chamber and offices in Strasbourg,
which are used for one week each month.
The decision, which followed French threats to disrupt the June elections to
parliament, follows an earlier controversial decision to replace the
parliament's main debating chamber in Brussels. It has been heavily
criticised by MEPs from both of the main political groupings, which would
prefer to centralise parliament's activities in Brussels.

FT  20 APR 94 / France to increase defence spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government and President Francois Mitterrand are today expected
to approve a framework defence programme, which calls for about FFr650bn
(Pounds 76bn) of expenditure between 1995 and 2000.
The spending plan, due to be presented to the National Assembly this month,
reflects the French government's commitment to maintaining a strong military
as well as a nuclear deterrent despite the ending of the cold war.
In contrast to reduced defence expenditure in much of Europe and the US, the
plan involves a real increase of 0.5 per cent each year during the six-year
period.
Despite the increased spending, the programme is expected to include delays
or cost-cutting measures for several important projects.
Programmes affected are expected to include a delay in the introduction of
the long-range M5 nuclear missile, which was due to enter into service in
2005, but which is likely to be pushed back until 2010.
The French government is also expected to seek a 20 per cent cut in the
costs of developing the NH-90 transport helicopter and a delay in the
delivery of Rafale fighter aircraft to the airforce.
The plan will include a commitment to maintaining France's land-based
nuclear deterrent and is expected to give approval for a viability study to
determine whether the submarine- based M4/M45 missile can be adapted for
terrestrial use.
The government's agreement to study the proposal represents a concession to
Mr Mitterrand, a strong supporter of a land-based deterrent, and is expected
to smooth approval of the defence package.
The defence programme is also expected to call for cuts in troop levels.
Ground forces are likely to be reduced by more than 10,000, from the current
level of 240,000, possibly involving the closure of one division.
Despite the reduction in certain programmes and in the level of manpower,
the expenditure plan reflects the thinking of a white paper on defence
policy published in February.
The white paper spelled out an ambitious defence policy into the next
century and dismissed the idea that France could reap a peace dividend
following the end of the cold war.
France's 1994 defence equipment budget, which has been set at FFr100.4bn
(Pounds 11.75bn), is already higher than that of its European allies.
The plan for the period 1995-2000, which will be re-examined in 1997,
implies that expenditure will amount to about 3 per cent of gross domestic
product, slightly less than the 3.4 per cent currently spent.

FT  20 APR 94 / Brussels heads for clash on Orly monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France appears to be heading into a new row with Britain and the European
Commission following a Commission report which says Air France is abusing
its monopoly position at Orly airport, Paris.
The report, after a seven-month investigation, says Air France's refusal to
let rival airlines such as TAT operate from Orly on routes to London,
Marseilles and Toulouse has broken community law on equal access to air
routes.
The European commissioners were due to adopt the report, which demands that
France open Orly to rival airlines, yesterday. But with France now lobbying
to block the report, indicating it will fight any attempt to force it to
open Orly, the commissioners yesterday stepped back from a decision, citing
lack of a voting quorum.
The Commission is now expected to adopt the report, next week. If France
refuses to comply, the Commission could take the case to the European Court
of Justice, which could fine the airline.
With the Commission also embroiled in a row over FFr20bn (Pounds 2.34bn)
state aid recently provided to Air France, officials admit the issue has
left the Commission in an increasingly sensitive political position,
reluctant to begin a full-blown fight.
'The French have threatened that they will simply not implement any
decision. . . they have said that they attach as much importance to this as
to Gatt,' claims one diplomat.
The battle centres over a complaint from TAT, the private French regional
airline, which is 49.9 per cent owned by British Airways, that Air France
has refused to provide slots at Orly on two routes - the lucrative
Paris-London route, where TAT could be a strong rival to Air France, and the
southern routes between Orly and Toulouse and Marseilles, currently the
third and fourth busiest routes in the European Union, where Air Inter, a
subsidiary of Air France, has a monopoly.
The Commission's report has largely accepted these complaints, concluding
that 'the French authorities. . . were wrong to refuse and to continue to
refuse TAT European Airlines permission to exercise traffic rights on the
Paris (Orly)-London route'.
The French government denies this breaks EU law, arguing that Orly is
saturated, and already allows Greek, Spanish and Portuguese carriers to
operate some services from the airport.
Faced with the political sensitivities, some sectors of the commission's
legal services are now arguing that the matter should be referred to the
European Court of Justice.
Any such 'soft' option is likely to provoke a furious response from the
British, who have stepped up lobbying in recent weeks, with Mr John
MacGregor, UK transport minister, personally pressing Mr Abel Matutes, the
outgoing EU transport commissioner, on the matter and seeking support from
the British commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan.

FT  20 APR 94 / UN and Nato in search of a strategy / Reviewing the options
left after the Gorazde debacle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK and EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the debacle at Gorazde, policy-makers at UN and Nato headquarters, and
in the capitals of the main member states, are reviewing a range of options.
It is much easier to suggest different strategies that might have been tried
at earlier stages in the Yugoslav conflict - for instance, a show of force
in late 1991 to halt the shelling of Dubrovnik and Vukovar by the Yugoslav
armed forces, or a lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia as soon as its
independence was recognised in April 1992 - than to propose one which could
plausibly be implemented now
The starting-point now has to be the presence of the UN protection force
(Unprofor). On the one hand, tens of thousands of Bosnians have become
dependent on it for relief supplies, and it is unlikely the ceasefire in
Sarajevo or many other parts of the country would survive if it was pulled
out. On the other hand, Unprofor itself is in some degree dependent on Serb
goodwill. Besides the 150 or so military observers and other personnel who
have actually been detained behind Serb lines, the whole Unprofor garrison
in Sarajevo (some 4,700 people) is virtually surrounded by Serb forces.
Unprofor was not conceived or constructed as an intervention force. Its
deployment has always been based on the assumption that all sides would
accept its presence, and few if any of the contributing governments would
allow their men to remain if it were to be reconfigured as a combat force.
But pulling it out is not an easy option either, politically or even
militarily. In the worst case, parts of it might actually have to fight
their way out, or be rescued by air.
For most imaginable new strategies, therefore, Unprofor would be more a
liability than an asset. The only other existing asset which the UN has in
its hands is the regime of sanctions imposed on the rump Yugoslavia. These
have had a devastating effect on the Serbian economy and President Slobodan
Milosevic is clearly anxious to have them lifted.

FT  20 APR 94 / Berlusconi gives evidence in bribes inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate turned politician, yesterday gave
evidence for three hours to Turin magistrates investigating alleged bribes
paid by his Fininvest group and French investors to secure a large shopping
development in the city.
His appearance was a reminder that the man most likely to become Italy's
next prime minister still has questions to answer before the law.
His questioning coincided with the severest criticism to date of people
interrogated in the two-year-old corruption scandals. Mr Antonio Di Pietro,
the most prominent of Milan's investigative magistrates, yesterday claimed
none of them had volunteered information and had only co-operated when
confronted with irrefutable evidence.
Mr Di Pietro's statement underlines what has long been suspected - the full
scale of corruption and personal enrichment in the elaborate system of
bribes established by businessmen and politicians has yet to be revealed.
Summing up as public prosecutor in the first corruption case to be tried, he
told the court in Milan: 'In this case there have been no pentiti. Not one
(of the 117 people questioned) has come and confessed.' The term pentiti
usually refers to former members of the Mafia who co-operate with justice.
Mr Di Pietro added that in all the the other cases information had only been
acquired when people had been confronted with evidence they could not deny.
The implication was that the five former party secretaries (including the
Socialist Bettino Craxi and Christian Democrat Arnaldo Forlani) called to
give evidence plus countless businessmen and intermediaries had been
economical with the truth. One witness, Mr Carlo Sama, former chief
executive of Ferruzzi-Montedison and married into the Ferruzzi family, was
called back on four occasions to have his memory refreshed in court.
'In every case, what was said to have been paid out, does not correspond
with what was said to have been received. . . . In other words if 100 is
paid out, only 50 is reportedly received.' Here again Mr Di Pietro went
further than any other magistrate in suggesting that the court had only
heard half the story.
In explaining the system of corruption to the court, Mr Di Pietro said it
was vital to appreciate that it had become a sophisticated 'engineered'
process. The businessmen paying the bribes, like the politicians, dealt
through intermediaries, enabling them to say they 'knew nothing of the
system or had no dealings with it.'
Meanwhile in Turin, Mr Berlusconi was being questioned about the granting of
permits for the Le Gru shopping development which he opened late last year.
Le Gru was developed on a 60/40 basis by the French group Trema with
Euromercato, part of Fininvest's Standa stores group. In early March Mr
Roger Flamant and Mr Maurice Bansay, respectively chairman and managing
director of Trema, were arrested and reportedly admitted paying L2bn (Pounds
833,000) in bribes to secure the development.
Yesterday Mr Berlusconi when asked about this after seeing the magistrates,
said: 'You must understand the Trema group was involved in its first Italian
venture at Le Gru and thus had to come to terms with an unknown world.'

FT  20 APR 94 / EBRD slimming called into question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ST PETERSBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
This has been the conference of sweetness and light for the European Bank of
Reconstruction and Development as speaker after speaker has praised the
bank's new president Mr Jacques de Larosiere and staff for re-ordering
priorities and re-organising the bank's baroque internal structure.
But close questioning of senior bank staff at the EBRD's annual meeting in
St Petersburg this week reveals a less shining picture. There is concern
that the cost cutting has left the re-focused institution without the
staffing capacity to do the job properly.
Since taking over from Mr Jacques Attali last September the new president
has cut costs by 8 per cent. Most savings came from cutting bank staff by 10
per cent to 720 and merging the formerly separate merchant and development
banking departments into a unified banking department.
The new department, headed by Mr Ron Freeman, has been strengthened by
bringing in an extra 24 per cent professional banking staff who had been
employed elsewhere under the old structure.
But the bank is soon to lose Mr Mario Sarcinelli, the former head of
development banking who helped set up the new bank and make it operational
in record time. After his departure senior bank officials question whether
the organisational structure of the reformed bank will be able to keep track
and give direction to an institution which operates in 26 disparate
countries and has been saddled with a daunting, and ever-growing, variety of
complex tasks.
At present there are no plans to replace Mr Sarcinelli, who is due to take
over as president of Italy's troubled Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. But senior
officials fear that without the appointment of a replacement vice-president
to manage the five 'southern tier' country teams ranging from Hungary to
central Asia, Mr Freeman - a deal-making merchant banker, not a bureaucrat,
by nature - will be swamped.
Until now Mr Freeman has concentrated on the 'northern tier' countries
ranging from the Czech and Slovak republics through Poland and Russia and
the Baltic states but including Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, the two central
Asian states most attractive to private foreign investors and hence to the
bank's new focus on co-financing private sector deals.
The 'northern tier' is where the bulk of the EBRD's deals to date are
concentrated, because it includes the fast track reforming central European
states and one country, the Czech republic, which enjoys triple-B investment
grade status. It thus stands out as the former communist country most able
to attract foreign investment on its own account.
'In the Czech republic the market is already sifting out the priorities,
leaving the EBRD to co-finance the very large transactions which require
additional financing,' says Mr Jiri Huebner, the EBRD's Czech and Slovak
team leader.
But this is a far cry from countries such as Ukraine and the more obscure
central Asian states where foreign investors need the most additional
'comfort' from the EBRD and other international financial institutions and
where the need for big, long-term infrastructure, energy and environmental
projects is greatest.
The southern tier is where the EBRD's development banking skills are most
needed and where the bank has been more heavily committed by Mr de
Larosiere's promise to set up EBRD projects in every post-communist member
state. He also promised to bring the bank closer to the grass roots by
strengthening the banks presence in the client countries.
As the bank's disbursements and commitments grow in size and complexity the
need for a stronger senior level management team in the bank's London
headquarters is likely to become more apparent.

FT  20 APR 94 / Russia vents fury on Bosnia Serbs: Outraged politicians
claim agreements have been betrayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian politicians yesterday turned in fury on the Bosnian Serbs, outraged
by what they see as a betrayal of agreements made between them which
humiliates Russia in the highest-profile foreign mediation undertaken since
the fall of the Soviet Union.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, warned the Bosnian Serbs 'not to
test the patience of the world community' - though he added that the Serbs
continued to promise him that they would not capture the besieged city of
Gorazde, would stop shelling it and would agree on security zones controlled
by the UN.
In a telephone conversation with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany,
President Boris Yeltsin said Russia was using 'maximum efforts' to stop the
escalation of the crisis. But it would continue to support 'peaceful
initiatives to resolve the conflict', a continuation of the Russian aversion
to the use of force against the Serbs.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, the special envoy to former Yugoslavia, had expressed
himself much more strongly on Monday, saying he had reversed his previous
position and was now prepared to advise Moscow to support the use of force
against the Serbs. 'Russia is now stopping all its attempts to mediate,' he
said yesterday.
A senior Foreign Ministry official, speaking anonymously, supported the
Churkin line yesterday, saying the Russian ambassador to Belgrade should be
recalled and that the Bosnian Serb leadership, including Mr Radovan Karadzic
and General Ratko Mladic, were 'mad'.
'The Serbs are cheating on the world community, and we can no longer believe
them,' said the official.
'This is exactly the situation at the beginning of the last two world wars,
when one of the two sides found itself faced with a choice between two very
bad alternatives.'
The Russian state duma, or lower house, debates Bosnia in a closed session
today, with the liberal politicians for once in the moral ascendancy against
the more numerous forces who generally side decisively with the Serbs.
The outrage expressed by Mr Kozyrev and Mr Churkin is in part aimed at
convincing parliament that the Foreign Ministry has tried its best and been
betrayed. They are trying to release the head of steam building up against
Nato for air strikes, and thus against the Partnership for Peace agreement
which Russia is delaying signing because of internal disagreements.

FT  20 APR 94 / Vote of confidence for revamped European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development

<TEXT>
The revamped European Bank for Reconstruction and Development received a
'unanimous vote of confidence' from its board and a raft of expensive new
commitments at the close of its annual meeting, write Anthony Robinson and
Chrystia Freeland in St Petersburg. Mr Pedro Solbes, Spain's finance
minister, was also appointed chairman of the board.
Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the bank's president, promised 'a robust approach'
to cutting costs and 'value for money' by co-financing projects aimed at
developing private sector banks and businesses. But several governors,
including Mr Kenneth Clark, UK chancellor, urged a further cut in costs by
reducing the 23-member board which accounts for 12 per cent of the bank's
costs. Others called for the appointment of more east European
representatives to the senior management structure.
The president underlined that financing infrastructure projects remained a
key part of the bank's activities despite the elimination of a separate
development banking department. The new commitment to operate in all 26
client states, including less devloped areas like Ukraine and central Asia,
is expected to increase the demand for infrastructure development to
underpin the private sector. The bank will also extend its nuclear safety
programme.

FT  20 APR 94 / Options for UN in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Schematically, the options fall into the following broad categories,
starting with the most belligerent and reading across to the softest:
OPTION 1: 'Take on the Serbs' by escalating air strikes and putting in more
UN ground troops, with a clear mandate to change the balance of forces on
the ground in the Bosnian government's favour, and so oblige the Serbs to
accept a more equitable territorial and constitutional settlement.
Objections: This would involve a huge increase in expenditure and acceptance
of heavy casualties. It would almost certainly provoke fresh waves of Serb
atrocities against Moslem civilians, and might encourage Moslems or Croats
to commit atrocities against Serb civilians in areas they would recapture.
It would be hard to get UN blessing for such a course because Russia would
veto it. Its effectiveness would be hard to predict. Recent experience has
shown that air strikes can be difficult to carry out in foggy, mountainous
terrain and virtually impossible in built-up areas. Serb anti-aircraft fire
is also much more effective than the west thought. Troops from the leading
western countries would be subjected to continuous provocations, aimed at
forcing them to leave or goading them into confrontation.
The number of ground troops needed would be enormous: 7,000 battle-hardened
Moslem soldiers were unable to defend Gorazde, and one UN estimate suggests
that 34,000 troops would be needed to defend the safe areas alone.
OPTION 2: Withdraw all UN personnel, military and humanitarian, from the
ground in order to have a free hand to carry out strikes.
Objections: This would also alienate Russia, with uncertain military
results. The withdrawal could lead to a humanitarian disaster, and
communities that depend on UN convoys might obstruct with- drawal by making
dramatic protests. This would not look good on television.
Even worse, the Serbs would guess the purpose of withdrawal accurately
enough, and take their own steps to prevent it, escalating their tactic of
keeping UN personnel hostage.
OPTION 3: Disengage completely from the ground and the air, and 'let them
fight it out'. The arms embargo against the Bosnian government would be
lifted (which could also be a feature of options 1 and 2).
Objections: Without Nato air cover the Bosnian government would be hard
pressed to hold its ground against the Serbs, who would launch an all-out
offensive to take advantage of the period before significant new weapons
could arrive and be deployed. The credibility of Nato and the EU as
guardians of regional stability would be reduced even further by their open
abdication. Renewed fighting might well break out in Croatia and/or Kosovo
and Macedonia, with all the risks of a wider Balkan war.
OPTION 4: Play down military options and renew efforts to secure a
diplomatic settlement, using offers of reconstruction aid for Bosnia, and
gradual lifting of sanctions on Serbia to coax the parties along.
Objections: This is essentially the strategy pursued by the EU so far (while
the US has suggested linking the easing of sanctions to Serb behaviour in
Croatia and possibly Kosovo). If continued now, it will at best consolidate
recent Serb gains and reward the Serbs' bad faith. The Bosnian government
will be very reluctant to resume negotiations on this basis. Its army has
made substantial gains in central Bosnia in recent weeks, and the Moslems
may now feel they have more to gain from military options than from
diplomacy under the guidance of an uncertain west. Also, western acceptance
of the latest Serb conquests would encourage other regional bullies to think
that aggression and bad faith will go unpunished.
It could be very difficult to reimpose sanctions in the event of Serb
backsliding.
OPTION 5: Lift sanctions unconditionally, as suggested by Russia, in the
hope that this will make the Serbs feel more conciliatory and encourage them
to behave better.
Objection: This would enrage the Bosnian Moslems, other Moslem countries,
and western public opinion. It would certainly be vetoed by the US. The
Serbs' behaviour in Gorazde would argue against any proposal that expects
them to show good faith or moderation.

FT  20 APR 94 / Gonzalez fends off calls to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, yesterday fended off calls
from the opposition to resign over the alleged financial misconduct of
senior officials and promised a crackdown on corruption.
Facing frequent barracking in one of the toughest parliamentary debates of
his 11 years in office, Mr Gonzalez sought to regain control over a
turbulent political climate.
He recognised that recent allegations of illicit enrichment by Mr Mariano
Rubio, former governor of the Bank of Spain, and Mr Luis Roldan ex-director
of the paramilitary Civil Guard, had caused 'public revulsion.'
He also accepted that he was 'directly concerned' by the Rubio case since he
had proposed Mr Rubio for the job and defended him when the first
allegations about his financial affairs emerged two years ago.
Opening a two-day state-of-the-nation debate he said the government planned
to set up a special prosecutor's office to deal with corruption, tighten the
country's penal code, increase penalties, strengthen the powers of the
Accounts Tribunal and set up a team to defend the interests of the treasury
against fraud.
He said it was 'imperative to confront these problems and restore society's
confidence'. The parliament is expected today to approve the setting up of a
special committee to investigate the case of the former governor, who on
Monday faced questioning from prosecutors over reports that he channelled
investment gains into a secret account.
Mr Jose Maria Aznar, leader of the Popular party, the main conservative
opposition, called on Mr Gonzalez to resign and nominate a successor. But he
said it would be against the country's interests to dissolve parliament and
hold fresh elections. Spain's last general election, which produced a
minority Socialist government, took place last June.
Mr Gonzalez listened solemnly as Mr Aznar accused him of 'permissiveness' on
corruption and attacked his government's record on unemployment. 'Things
have gone too far,' Mr Aznar said.
Rejecting the resignation demand, Mr Gonzalez said he intended to continue
to the end of the four-year electoral mandate. Mr Aznar's call was echoed by
Mr Julio Anguita, leader of the Communist United Left party, the
third-largest party in parliament. However, Mr Gonzalez was expected to
retain the support of Catalan nationalists, on whom the Socialists rely for
a parliamentary majority.
Earlier Mr Gonzalez told MPs the worst of Spain's economic crisis was over
and strongly defended the government's controversial new labour legislation
aimed at easing hiring and firing laws.
Worries about political instability have rocked Spanish stock markets over
the past two days. Stocks in Madrid yesterday hit their lowest levels this
year but later recovered, with the general index closing 2.8 points up at
313.6.

FT  20 APR 94 / New offensive reported in north of republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
With the Bosnian Serb army poised to partition Gorazde, the Moslem enclave
in southeastern Bosnia, media reports in Serbia have begun to warn of a new
offensive to the north.
Both the Moslems and Croats, on one side, and the Serbs, on the other, have
high stakes in the strategic Posavina, the Sava river valley, spanning
northern Bosnia.
Belgrade radio yesterday repeated a claim that a 'Moslem offensive was under
way on all fronts' in Bosnia. It accused the Bosnian government of aiming to
wrest land from Serb forces in northern Bosnia, where Serb forces have
carved out a corridor linking Belgrade to Serb-held territory in Bosnia and
Croatia.
Vecernje Novosti, Serbia's most popular newspaper, warned of 'hellish
battles' in a 10-day Moslem offensive at Brcko, towards the eastern end of
the corridor. It also described 'constant infantry attacks' in the region.
The reports could not be confirmed. In the past, Serb offensives have been
preceded by charges of Moslem attacks.
Independent analysts in Belgrade believe the Bosnian army, if backed by the
Croats, could benefit by attacking Serb positions round Brcko. It is at
Brcko where the Serb army is at its most vulnerable. Its land corridor is
only about 10km at its widest and could be severed by a Croat and Moslem
offensive from the north and south.
However while Mr Gojko Susak, Croatia's defence minister, remains in office,
the Moslem-led Bosnian government is unlikely to take seriously Croatia's
commitment to respect Bosnia's borders and will shrink from launching an
offensive with them against the Serbs. Mr Susak was behind Croatia's drive
to divide Bosnia-Hercegovina with Serbia.
Reports of Moslem offensives could herald the next episode in the Serb quest
to carve out their own state in the ruins of Bosnia.

FT  20 APR 94 / Kidder fake profits scheme spanned three-year period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The phantom trading scheme at Kidder Peabody which led the US investment
bank to report false profits of Dollars 350m (Pounds 236m) had escaped the
attention of the bank and its auditors since as far back as 1991.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman of General Electric, Kidder's parent, said in an
interview yesterday, that the phantom profits created by the scheme
stretched back for some time. 'We would estimate that approximately Dollars
150m of this occurred last year,' he said.
Mr Michael Carpenter, Kidder's chairman, said that the bank had yet to
determine exactly when all the false profits had been reported, but said
that 'it's spread between three years'. Amounts before 1993 had not been
large, he added.
The false profits, which Kidder has blamed on its head government bond
trader, Mr Joseph Jett, emerged only at the end of last week, after an
escalation in the phantom trades prompted a closer examination. Mr Carpenter
put the total number of fake trades entered by Mr Jett at 'tens of
thousands', with a notional value 'in the billions of dollars'.
Mr Jett joined the bank in 1991 and rapidly rose to become the head of its
government bond trading desk. The profits he reported from trading brought
him a bonus of Dollars 9m last year, although not all was paid in cash.
Mr Welch said: 'Kidder requires a portion to be put away in an equity
account to be paid from future earnings. So some of that is retained in the
firm'.
Mr Welch said Kidder's problems pointed to a failure by it and other Wall
Street firms to give sufficient power to the people responsible for
controlling traders.
He also said the problem had not prompted him to reconsider whether or not
to sell the investment bank. Commenting on what he called the 'star' culture
on Wall Street and the high bonuses typical in the industry, Mr Welch said:
'My concern is whether or not that money turns out to give a prestige and
power and influence to people that's inordinate.' He added: 'The imbalances
in the system are such that a strong successful personality may have more
influence than they should. This is not the first instance that it ever
happened on Wall Street.'
Kidder would continue to pay bonuses in line with those paid by other
houses, Mr Welch said.
He added that a review, now under way, was likely to lead to more power for
managers involved in internal control, and he questioned whether enough
attention was paid to these people at present. 'Do we listen with a careful
ear . . . to everything they say, or are they brushed aside?' he asked.
Mr Welch denied the problems at Kidder would prompt GE to attempt to dispose
of the firm, as it had tried to do two years ago when discussing a sale to
financial services group Primerica.

FT  20 APR 94 / Pressure mounts on Major for cabinet shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major is being pressed by close colleagues to respond to the
government's expected heavy defeat in the European elections with the most
radical cabinet shake-up of his premiership.
Senior Conservatives believe that a reshuffle which could see the departure
of up to five cabinet and many more junior ministers might also mark the
return of at least one of the political heavyweights of the 1980s.
Lord Walker and Lord Howe, two of the longest serving ministers in Lady
Thatcher's cabinets, are being canvassed as potential candidates for the
party chairmanship and the leadership of the House of Lords.
Senior party officials have also floated the idea that the employment
department and the cabinet post of employment secretary could be scrapped to
make room in cabinet for Sir Norman Fowler's replacement as party chairman.
Sir Norman intends to stand down in July.
Whitehall officials last night strongly rejected the idea, but the party
insiders said the department's responsibilities could be split between trade
and industry, education and social security.
No firm decisions have been taken about the timing of the reshuffle beyond a
decision by Mr Major to reject the idea of announcing the changes before the
June 9 European elections.
Some insiders believe it should follow within days of the poll. Others are
arguing it should be delayed until July to avoid charges that Mr Major had
been 'panicked' into hasty changes.
But the intensity of informal discussions in 10 Downing Street points to a
more radical shake-up than hitherto anticipated. There are plans also to
strengthen the prime minister's team of personal political advisers. Aides
want Mr Major to replace Mr Graham Bright, his parliamentary private
secretary, with a much more powerful political figure.
Mr Major is being warned the reshuffle will be crucial to maintaining his
authority during the expected onslaught on his leadership after the June
poll. Friends of Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke have been joined
recently by supporters of Mr Michael Portillo in informal assessments of
their chances in any leadership contest.
Four middle-ranking ministers have emerged at the top of Mr Major's list for
the cabinet: Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, Mr
Jonathan Aitken, defence minister, Mr Brian Mawhinney, the health minister,
and Mr David Davis, public services minister.
With a clear-out of many middle and junior-ranking ministers, that would
allow Mr Major to make promotions from the restless Tory backbenches.
Likely high-level casualties are Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary; Mr
John MacGregor, transport secretary; and Mr John Patten, education
secretary. Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords, has indicated he might decide
to stand down while Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, is also seen as
vulnerable.

FT  20 APR 94 / Last-minute deal brings Inkatha into S Africa poll:
Buthelezi abandons original demands in dramatic retreat
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's three main political leaders yesterday charted a course for
peace when they reached a last-minute deal to allow the mainly Zulu Inkatha
Freedom party to participate in all-race elections, now less than a week
away.
In a dramatic retreat, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader,
abandoned demands for important changes to the South African constitution
and a postponement of the April 26-28 election. He stunned a Pretoria press
conference when he said Inkatha would participate in national and regional
elections, and signed an agreement which satisfied almost none of his
original demands.
Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader, who met Chief
Buthelezi and President FW de Klerk for eleventh-hour talks yesterday,
hailed the deal as 'a leap forward for peace, reconciliation,
nation-building and (an) inclusive election process'.
The dramatic improvement in South Africa's political fortunes delighted the
local markets. Pessimism of recent days gave way to relief, and the news
boosted the Johannesburg Stock Exchange index by 2.2 per cent.
The financial rand, the country's investment currency, rallied by 8 per cent
against the dollar.
The deal was welcomed by political figures abroad. US president Bill Clinton
called it 'one more act of collective statesmanship that bodes well for the
prospect of free and fair elections . . . and for the success of the future
government of national unity'.
Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Commonwealth secretary-general, praised the three
leaders for 'looking beyond narrow partisan interests'.
Even before the official announcement, Inkatha election posters were going
on display in Natal, suggesting that its efficient party machine will launch
a formidable campaign in the six days before voting.
In Ulundi, the capital of the KwaZulu 'homeland' which Chief Buthelezi
heads, there was jubilation among members of the local legislative assembly.
Thousands of Inkatha supporters are expected to take part in a rally today
at Ulundi, marking the start of the party's campaign.
Chief Buthelezi said he had decided to compromise on his demands 'to avoid a
great deal more (of the) bloodshed and carnage which we have been witness to
in recent months', although he cautioned against expectations of an
immediate cessation of the hostilities which have left more than 500 people
dead in the past six weeks.
'There's no way that in the next seven days violence is going to vanish. We
are not so naive to think that,' he said, as fierce gun battles continued in
townships near Johannesburg between his supporters and Mr Mandela's.
All three leaders applauded the role of Prof Washington Okumu, a Kenyan
mediator, in negotiating the deal, which will entrench the position of Zulu
King Goodwill Zwelithini in the country's constitution.
It also provides for international mediation of other constitutional
disputes - notably the question of devolution of power from central to
provincial governments - only after the elections.

Turmoil in international financial markets in February and March all but

Dollars 346m in the first quarter of 1993. However, it said Dollars 177m,

FT  20 APR 94 / Clinton backs wider Nato powers: Moscow calls for
international summit to solve crisis in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton backed a major extension of Nato air power last night
as part of a package of military and diplomatic initiatives aimed at forcing
the Bosnian Serbs back into talks.
A senior White House official, who said the plan would be discussed with
Nato allies, said the president was in favour of a proposal from Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, to expand the threat of Nato air
strikes to help protect civilians in all six UN-declared 'safe areas' in
Bosnia - including the eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde which is on the
point of falling to Serb forces.
The UN mandate is currently restricted to calling for close air support to
protect UN peacekeepers on the ground.
The US initiative emerged after the second of two meetings on Bosnia which
Mr Clinton held with foreign policy advisers. Earlier Ms Dee Dee Myers, his
press secretary, said he believed a negotiated settlement was 'the only way
to end the cycle of violence'.
Mr Clinton said that a proposal from Russia's President Boris Yeltsin for an
urgent summit between Russia, the US and the European Union to solve the
worsening situation in Bosnia 'deserves serious consideration'.
Mr Yeltsin has previously suggested a summit but, coming amid growing calls
for action, the intervention marks a sharp reversal in Russia's previous
sympathetic treatment of the Bosnian Serbs. He urged them to stop their
attack on Gorazde, while Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, warned
Serb forces not to 'test the patience of the world community'.
Last night Bosnian Serbs signed an agreement with the UN to cease fire
immediately around Gorazde and allow deployment of UN peacekeepers. Their
forces had continued to fire on Gorazde yesterday and, as a measure of their
disdain for threats, they also raided a UN encampment near Sarajevo and took
possession of 18 anti-aircraft guns handed to the UN six weeks ago.
UN officials said later that the Serbs had begun to return the weapons.
Also, eight UN military observers, out of more than 50 detained by the Serbs
last week, were freed from house arrest.
In London, Mr John Major said that Britain's objectives in Bosnia had not
changed. He told the Commons this did not alter the 'fact that we wish to
secure a complete ceasefire' but said it was important to be sure there was
general will to provide resources 'before we make any blanket assurances'.

<TEXT>
Russia's president Boris Yeltsin last night called for an urgent summit
between Russia, the US and the European Union to solve the worsening crisis
in Bosnia.
Marking a sharp reversal in Russia's previous sympathetic treatment of the
Bosnian Serbs, Mr Yeltsin urged them to stop their attack on the Moslem
enclave of Gorazde, while Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, warned
the Serb forces not to 'test the patience of the world community'.
Mr Yeltsin has previously suggested a summit, but this proposal comes amid
growing international calls for action, and was welcomed by President Bill
Clinton, who was meeting with his senior military and foreign policy
advisers to review the military and diplomatic options over Bosnia.
Although US officials were conceding that little could now be done to
prevent the fall of the eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde to surrounding
Serb forces, the broader use of Nato air power to protect other Bosnian
'safe havens' was understood to be high on the list. It was also urged by Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general.
Serb forces nevertheless continued to fire on Gorazde and, in an ominous
measure of their new-found disdain for threats from both west and east,
raided a UN encampment near Sarajevo and took off with 18 anti-aircraft
guns. The weapons were handed to the UN six weeks ago after the Serbs had
been forced to ease their siege of the Bosnian capital.
About 150 Serbs were involved. 'They were simply overrun,' said a spokesman
for the UN forces in Bosnia. 'If they had fired, it would have been a
massacre.'
Mr Clinton was said to be determined to pursue diplomatic courses. Ms Dee
Dee Myers, his press secretary, said yesterday the president believed that a
negotiated settlement was 'the only way to end the cycle of violence'.
Officials at Nato headquarters in Brussels were being equally circumspect
despite an appeal from Mr Boutros Ghali for authority to call air strikes to
protect civilians in all six Moslem 'safe areas' in Bosnia.
That would significantly extend the UN mandate for military action, Nato
officials said. The mandate is currently restricted to calling for close air
support to protect UN peacekeepers on the ground.

<TEXT>
A plan backed by Rewe, one of Germany's largest food retailers, to open
discount stores in the south-east of England has proved more expensive than
anticipated.
Rewe has a 29 per cent stake in Budgens, the small UK retailing chain which
yesterday said the conversion of nine of its stores to Rewe's Penny Market
format had exceeded costings.
Shares in the UK group fell by 5p to 29p after it warned trading profits
from the 89 stores operating the traditional format were likely to be 15 per
cent lower than the previous year.
However, Mr Christian Williams, executive director of Budgens, said the
group was sticking by its plans to open 40 discount food stores in the
south-east over two years.
Budgens said it had originally estimated the nine stores could be converted
for about Pounds 600,000 (Dollars 876,000.)

FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Accountants sued for L1,000bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Montedison, the Italian industrial company, is claiming damages of more than
L1,000bn (Dollars 611m) from Price Waterhouse Italy, part of the
international accountancy group, alleging 'serious negligence'.
Sources at Montedison, which is the principal subsidiary of the Ferruzzi
Finanziaria holding company, confirmed yesterday that a writ had been served
on Price Waterhouse Italy.
Montedison's new management alleges that the company breached international
auditing and accounting standards between 1983 and 1992, when it was
Montedison's auditor.
The first hearing in the case should take place in Milan on May 24.
Price Waterhouse Italy said yesterday it would 'vigorously defend itself'
against the writ.
In a statement, the company said Montedison's claim was 'based on the
mistaken assumption that it is the auditors, not the previous management (of
Montedison), who were responsible for the deliberate and systematic fraud
now known to have been conducted at the highest levels of management'.
The writ had been expected since November last year, when shareholders in
Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) voted to proceed with legal action against
Price Waterhouse Italy.
However, the scale of the Montedison claim was not known until yesterday's
leaks from the Milan court.
Nor was it known that the writ would relate to the period before 1987, when
Montedison was taken over by the Ferruzzi commodities group, then headed by
Mr Raul Gardini, who committed suicide last year.
Price Waterhouse Italy has already lodged counter-claims in the Milan court,
alleging that the former directors of Montedison are 'liable . . . for
deliberate fraudulent conduct intended to frustrate normal auditing
procedures' and claiming compensation for the damage to its reputation.
In August last year, Consob, the Milan-based companies and stock market
watchdog, refused to renew the firm's authorisation to audit Ferfin's books.
Part of the Montedison claim relates to the long-running 'Enimont affair',
relating to claims that bribes were paid to senior Italian politicians to
smooth the way for the abortive 1989 - 90 merger between the chemicals
interests of Eni, the state oil concern, and assets of Montedison.

FT  19 APR 94 / Swiss drugs groups feel price squeeze: Ciba and Sandoz
forecast profits growth despite 3% fall in pharmaceuticals sales
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BASLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ciba and Sandoz, two of the three big Basle-based pharmaceutical and
chemical groups, provided new evidence yesterday of the squeeze on drugs
prices in industrialised countries. Both groups said pharmaceuticals sales
fell 3 per cent in the first quarter: Ciba's to SFr1.4bn and Sandoz's to
SFr1.8bn.
Roche, the other big Basle group, has shown a greater immunity to drug price
cuts by reporting last week a 10 per cent rise in first quarter
pharmaceuticals sales to SFr2.09bn.
Mr Marc Moret, Sandoz chairman, devoted his statement in the group's 1993
annual report, published yesterday, to the drugs price issue. He argued that
many drugs played an important role in cutting healthcare costs and
denounced moves by governments to cut prices. 'The pharmaceutical industry
is fighting disease, not exploiting it.'
In spite of the squeeze, Sandoz and Ciba both forecast further profits
growth this year. 'I would be surprised if we were not able, as in the past
three years, to raise our profits steadily,' Mr Moret said. Another Sandoz
director emphasised that double-digit profit increases had been achieved in
each of the past three years. Sandoz also forecast a 5 to 8 per cent rise in
overall sales this year after last year's 5 per cent advance to SFr15.1bn.
Ciba expected an increase in operating profit this year.
Both groups said their weak overall sales performance in the first quarter
was due partly to the strength of the Swiss franc. In the quarter Sandoz's
overall sales rose 1 per cent to SFr4.27bn while those of Ciba fell 2 per
cent to SFr5.58bn.
Ciba's self-medication, diagnostics and Ciba Vision divisions showed modest
growth while sales in Sandoz's nutrition sector, led by Ovaltine and
Isostar, jumped 25 per cent to SFr558m.
Ciba's industrial chemicals sales fell 3 per cent to SFr2.1bn. The group
said demand remained weak, except in the US, but an upturn in orders from
the UK, France, Spain and Italy had become apparent.
Sales in Sandoz's chemical and environment businesses, which include
agricultural chemicals, rose 1 per cent to SFr1.4bn.
Last month Sandoz reported consolidated net income up 14 per cent in 1993 to
SFr1.7bn, while at Ciba post-tax profits rose 11.2 per cent to SFr1.78bn.
Roche publishes its 1993 results today.

FT  19 APR 94 / Merrill Lynch avoids trading slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The upheaval in financial markets in recent weeks failed to dent the trading
profits of US financial institutions Merrill Lynch and Chase Manhattan.
Other US banks, though, have already reported sharp falls in trading income
in the period, mainly because of tumbling prices in the emerging securities
markets.
Merrill Lynch maintained its trading income at Dollars 667m in the first
three months of the year, a similar level to the fourth quarter of 1994,
though down 12 per cent from the record Dollars 761m reported in the first
three months of 1993.
Mr Joseph Willett, chief financial officer, said the result reflected the
fact that Merrill relied on orders from customers for much of its trading
income and hedged most of its positions.
The firm also benefited from its broad range of trading activities, with
higher profits in some areas offsetting declines in others.
Merrill suffered a 'modest loss' during the quarter in trading emerging
market debt, he said.
Chase Manhattan sold off much of its holdings of emerging market debt early
in the year, avoiding the worst of the blood bath in these markets after the
Federal Reserve started to raise interest rates on February 4.
Yesterday, the bank reported trading income of Dollars 179m, in line with
the Dollars 175m of a year before.
Mr Michel Kruse, chief financial officer, said losses made on trading such
debt since the middle of February had been more than offset by profits made
in disposing of positions before this.
'It was a very tricky environment, particularly in the second half of the
quarter,' he added.
Last week, First Chicago said it lost Dollars 54m on emerging market
securities in the first quarter, leading it to report an overall trading
loss of Dollars 25m in the period.
JP Morgan, thought to be the biggest trader of emerging market debt,
reported trading revenues of Dollars 356m, down from Dollars 469m a year
before. In the previous quarter, emerging market debt trading had boosted
its revenues to Dollars 606m.
Mr Willett added that hedges used by Merrill to reduce the risk from its
trading positions had held up relatively well during the period.
However, widening yield spreads on corporate, emerging market and non-dollar
debt instruments meant that 'hedges will not be perfect'.

FT  19 APR 94 / World Trade News: German anger over Indian child labour -
The protest over use of young people in the tea industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany has expressed strong reservation about the use of child labour in
Indian tea plantations.
The warning follows Germany's recent threat to discontinue the import of tea
grown in the hills of Darjeeling unless the level of chemical residues,
particularly pesticides, is brought down.
The German Tea Council (GTC) has told the Indian Tea Board (ITB) that some
powerful social organisations in Germany have started a campaign against the
Indian tea industry for using child labour.
Tea producers fear that child labour will become a highly emotive issue in
the whole of Europe, and that the German campaign may spread to other
European countries.
They are aware that many developed countries will not buy woollen carpets
from India unless it is guaranteed that children have not woven them.
However, they say child labour constitutes only a small percentage of the
tea labour force.
Earlier, the International Labour Organisation drew the attention of the
Indian authorities to child labour in plantation industries. To take the
wind out of the sails of the social organisations campaigning against Indian
tea, producers will give assurances that in future they will not employ
anyone under 16.
In the past, 'local socio-economic conditions, including the high level of
general unemployment' had forced many tea companies to employ children, most
of whom had now reached the age of 16, industry officials said.
In the meantime, ITB has kept GTC informed about its initiative to bring
down the level of chemical residues in Darjeeling tea. According to ITB, the
residues in brewed Darjeeling tea are much less than in black tea.
Darjeeling planters use more pesticides than other Indian tea-growing areas
because the area is more vulnerable to pest attack.
Industry officials say the effective implementation of the spraying
schedule, recommended by tea research organisations, will reduce chemical
residues in Darjeeling tea.

FT  19 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Budgens upset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRIS PRICE, CHRISTINE BUCKLEY and STEVE THOMPSON.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A profits warning from Budgens, the discount food retailer, was the signal
for a retreat among other smaller operators. Budgens said that trading
profits were likely to come in at around 15 per cent lower than last year,
blaming the tough trading climate. The group also said that its new trading
format being undertaken with Rewe, the German discount group which owns 29.4
per cent of Budgens, had incurred additional costs. Budgen shares slid 5 to
29p. Kwik Save retreated 15 to 568p, William Low 7 to 138p and Shoprite 9 to
192p.
Pharmaceuticals stocks suffered continued selling with Glaxo worst hit in
the suffering sector as traders picked up on a story in a US newspaper.
The newspaper reported that the family of a woman who died after taking the
company's anti-migraine drug was to sue Glaxo. A Glaxo spokesman confirmed
that legal action was being taken but added: 'Sumatriptan has been subject
to rigorous screening throughout its development and is now licensed in 67
markets worldwide and has been taken by over one million patients.' The
shares fell 17 to 558p with 6.3m traded.
Elsewhere, Wellcome fell 10 to 528p in spite of a report that the companies
AIDS treatment would remain the cornerstone of combination therapies.
SmithKline Beecham slipped 5 to 359p in the 'A's.
A two-way pull in Associated British Foods saw the shares shade 2 down to
596p. The shares came under pressure early on following weekend press
speculation that the sale of the Bakers Oven business could make as little
as Pounds 9m, rather than the Pounds 30m pencilled in by some analysts.
However, more positive talk later in the session revived rumours that AB
Foods was interested in buying some of the food businesses of Allied Lyons.
Last week, Dalgety was said to have been telling analysts of its interest
during a company visit. Dalgety shares were steady at 458p. Allied slipped 3
to 581p.
Royal Bank of Scotland was the only leading bank to escape the Wall
Street-led decline in the market, with Credit Lyonnais Laing said to have
been behind some strong support for the Scottish bank. RBOS shares settled 6
higher at 404p after turnover of 3.9m shares.
Caradon, the building materials company, jumped to 380p early in the
session, on buying stimulated by a Kleinwort Benson buy recommendation
before slipping back to close a net 7 higher at 372p.
Oil shares, which have been driven sharply higher in recent sessions by a
strong oil price and a firm Wall Street, turned easier yesterday as US
investors took fright at the prospect higher domestic interest rates. And
there was talk that some broking houses had adopted a much more cautious
view of the oil stocks after their recent big gains.
The majors bore the brunt of some hefty selling, which mostly emanated from
New York, with BP settling 4 easier at 386p and Shell 3 down at 725p.
Clyde Petroleum, marginally higher at 36p, confirmed market suspicions that
US fund management group Fidelity was the recent big seller of a three and a
half per cent stake in the group.
Dealers became increasingly bullish about the market debut of Ashanti
Goldfields this afternoon and the probable impact the flotation will have on
Lonrho, the UK conglomerate which will retain a 43 per cent stake in
Ashanti.
Talk late yesterday suggested that Ashanti shares will commence trading
around Dollars 20 a share. Lonrho closed 4 1/2 higher at 154p after turnover
of 8.7m.
A recommendation from Hoare Govett helped Wakebourne, the computer support
company, jump 3/4 to 3 1/2 p.

FT  19 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Eastern Elec. firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRIS PRICE, CHRISTINE BUCKLEY and STEVE THOMPSON.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastern Electricity was one of only a handful of FT-SE 100 constituents to
make any substantial progress yesterday, the shares advancing strongly to
close 8 1/2 higher at 656p following turnover of 4.7m.
The rise came as the company paid a big premium to complete its share
buy-back programme. Yesterday Eastern bought 4.1m shares at 675p a share .
Eastern received shareholder approval to embark on a share buyback programme
involving 13.5m shares last August. Yesterday's deal produced an average
buyback price of 553p a share for the whole re-purchase programme.
Other regional electricity stocks made good progress at the outset of
trading, helped by ongoing speculation that the whole of the electricity
distribution and generation sectors may benefit from increasing speculation
of potential stake-building and merger activity which could take place
before the Government's golden shares in the companies disappear in March
1995.
Also helping to drive the sector was a story that the National Grid, owned
by the 12 'recs' was being prepared for a public flotation next year.

FT  19 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Storehouse hit by sellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRIS PRICE, CHRISTINE BUCKLEY and STEVE THOMPSON.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High street retailer Storehouse was hit by the departure of another senior
executive, which prompted a sharp fall in the shares and a change in stance
from a number of brokers. Analysts said the resignation of the Mothercare
division chief executive was a particular blow, given the impressive
performance by Ms Ann Iverson in improving the baby and children clothes
business, which is seen as one of the group's key growth areas over the next
few years.
One stores analyst said: 'Any senior resignation like this is bound to make
people jumpy, but with Storehouse it seems to be becoming a habit.' The
group has had four finance directors since 1989 and three chief executives
since 1988. The shares retreated 11 to 218p with turnover a hefty 9.2m.
Among those shifting stance on Storehouse was Hoare Govett which went from
'undervalued' to 'hold', recommending investors turn their attention instead
to Sears. Coincidentally, Sears, together with Next, were being mooted as
potential bidders for Laura Ashley, the fashion retailer which last week
lost its chief executive. Analysts said that such a move would cost in the
region of Pounds 285m and had the drawback of inheriting Laura Ashley's
troubled US business. The takeover talk kept the shares of all three groups
steady, with Laura Ashley slipping a half-penny to 79p, Next improving a
penny to 238 1/2 p and Sears remaining at 126 1/2 p.

FT  19 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Gains reversed following Federal
Reserve move - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery of confidence in the London stock market, extended in early
trading yesterday, was abruptly challenged when the British government bond
market collapsed after the US Federal Reserve moved to tighten interest
rates by a quarter of a point. Equities reversed their initial gains to
close with a fall of 30.1 on the FT-SE 100 Index, which moved through a 53
point range during the session.
There was no great rush to sell equities, although stock index futures
suffered heavily, with the June contract on the Footsie Index wiped off the
screens at one time, while the September contract quotation became a 'fast
market' - in which market makers are not obliged to deal at quoted prices.
Once the shock was over, equity strategists expressed surprise at the
market's violent reaction to a move by the Federal Reserve which has been
widely predicted; many US strategists have warned that Federal Funds rate
was likely to be raised before the next meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee.
The FT-SE Index closed virtually at the day's low, its 30.1 point fall
taking it to 3,138.2, with the important support level of 3,150 brushed
aside. London's dismay deepened as Wall Street opened lower before rallying
to show a 27 point loss in London trading hours; New York bonds and equities
resumed their downturn after the UK market closed.
The setback in UK stocks was all the more disturbing for traders because, in
the early past of the session, the market had shown significant confidence
in prospects for a base rate cut in the very near future. A trading
programme worth nearly Pounds 60m was identified at mid-morning.
This was largely based on Friday's disclosure that domestic inflation has
remained low, but was buttressed by further economic data published
yesterday.
The latest survey of opinion in the distributive industry from the
Confederation of British Industries indicated that retail sales had slowed
last month. Official statistics showed that UK producer prices had risen by
only 0.1 per cent in March, below expectations.
Both reports raised hopes in the market that base rates might be cut quickly
in order to foster economic recovery. Market analysts believe that the
decision to cut rates could come this week, if the March retail sales
statistics, due on Thursday, show further weakness.
These views took the Footsie ahead by 23 points in early deals, although
this gain was soon clipped back when bond markets across Europe began to
soften as the US dollar eased. But London was still some 10 points up when
news of the Federal Reserve move flashed across the trading screens in
London.
In spite of the day's setback, analysts were hopeful that the UK market
could remain firm - but only if global bond markets can hold safely
establish themselves at new levels. Rumours of renewed heavy losses among
bond traders circulated yesterday.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell 10.6 to 3,814. Seaq volume increased sharply as
futures markets plunged, sparking off heavy arbitraging between stock index
contracts and the underlying stocks. But non Footsie stocks made up around
63 per cent of the day's total of 683.5m shares. On Friday, 698.8m shares
were traded, worth Pounds 1.32bn in retail business.

FT  19 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arbitrageurs enjoyed huge scope for manoeuvre yesterday in equity
derivatives with the June FT-SE 100 contract flinging itself from strength
to frailty, Christine Buckley writes.
The contract began confidently as markets focused on hopes for a UK interest
rate cut but was pushed into a tail spin by the US Fed's hike in interest
rates which came just over an hour before trading on Liffe closed.
Relatively low volume pumped up volatility with sellers swinging the market
more than they would have done in a more liquid state. At one stage, quotes
on the contract were moving so rapidly a fast market was declared - meaning
that trading can continue but that quoted prices are not firm. In such rare
periods the exchange does not operate its usual responsibility via the
clearing house.
The contract moved through nearly 60 points after climbing to an intraday
high of 3,191 early in the session to languishing around the 3,132 mark just
before close and at a discount to the cash market of several points. It
edged up to 3,138 at the official close with a little over 12,000 contracts
traded.
Hanson dominated the stock options with James Capel behind the 8,118 lots
traded. The broker bought 4,000 May puts and sold November 260 puts to roll
over its position.

FT  19 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow in steep decline as Fed
tightens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks followed the bond market in steep decline yesterday after the
announcement of a further tightening of monetary policy, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 41.05 lower at 3,620.42, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 3.72 at 442.46. Declining
issues overwhelmed advances, 1,642 to 626 in brisk trading.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite dropped 4.29 to 434.00,
and the Nasdaq composite 7.52 to 720.45.
The market was jolted into life by the 10am announcement by the Federal
Reserve that it would 'increase slightly' pressure on the banking system's
reserve positions.
The action is expected to result in a small boost in the overnight
inter-bank lending rate, the third increase since the Fed warned of a shift
to more 'neutral' credit conditions in early February. As in the past, the
move triggered a sharp response in the US Treasury market, where the
benchmark 30-year government bond led the yield curve in hasty retreat.
Blue chips immediately plunged 45 points on the news, with other market
indices showing similar levels of decline. But as bonds began to firm near
midday, share prices reversed course and began to recover some lost ground.
In the afternoon, share price slipped again. Cyclical stocks, which shot up
in the weeks before the Fed's initial policy move, continued to suffer the
most. Alcoa gave back Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 66 3/8 , General Motors lost
Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 56 7/8 and Allied Signal dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 34 1/2 .
General Electric was marked down Dollars 2 to Dollars 94 3/4 . The company
announced at the weekend a Dollars 350m charge against first-quarter
earnings after uncovering a fraudulent trad ing scheme at its Kidder Peabody
brokerage subsidiary.
Digital Equipment, down Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 21 1/8 , continued to feel
the impact of its disappointing first-quarter performance. It near the top
of the NYSE's most active list after Smith Barney Shearson downgraded the
stock.
Canada
Toronto prices tumbled in moderate trading, led by a steep drop in gold
stocks. The TSE 300 index plunged 71.89 points, or 1.70 per cent, to
4,168.06.
Declines led advances 572 to 211, the volume of 55.11m shares was below
Friday's 64.09m, and trading value was CDollars 601.0m compared with
CDollars 674.2m.
All 14 stock groups fell, with golds posting the biggest loss of 4.62 per
cent on index. Mexico
Equities closed sharply weaker as prices trailed Wall Street. The key IPC
index lost 61.02 points, or 2.78 per cent, to 2,137.62.
The market was also hit by fears of an increase in domestic interest rates
at the weekly auction.
On Wall Street Telmex ADRs ended down Dollars 2 at Dollars 55, the lowest
level this year. In the local market Telmex A shares retreated 4.33 per cent
and the L series dropped 4.13 per cent.

FT  19 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei 225 builds on
gains in a strong Pacific Basin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Active buying of large capital stocks by foreign investors yesterday
outweighed small lot selling by domestic institutions and companies, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index rose 112.73 to 20,277.36 after a low of 20,222.44 and a
high of 20,494.60. It rose in the morning on index linked buying by
arbitrageurs and purchases by foreign investors, but afternoon profit-taking
eroded some of the gains.
Traders said that investors were turning their attention away from the
political situation, as it seemed likely that Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign
minister, would be named prime minister,
Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said that the Nikkei would move between
20,000 and 21,000. Although the downside was limited, he said, due to buying
by foreign and some domestic institutional investors, companies facing a
high yen would continue to sell into strength.
Volume was 388m shares against 423m. The Topix index of all first section
stocks rose 8.12 to 1,643.24 and the Nikkei 300 gained 1.48 to 300.91.
Advances led declines by 626 to 374 with 174 unchanged and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.12 to 1,344.17.
Large capital steels were traded actively. Kawasaki Steel, the most active
issue of the day, rose Y10 to Y385 and Nippon Steel gained Y10 to Y360.
Shipbuilders were also higher, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries up Y11 to
Y691.
In spite of the rise in the yen against the dollar, blue chip
high-technology stocks were also bought, with Hitachi up Y8 to Y986 and
Toshiba gaining Y10 to Y790.
Construction stocks and nonlife insurance companies, regarded as laggards,
attracted foreign buyers. Obayashi added Y15 to Y697, Kumagai Gumi Y10 to
Y499 and Mitsui Marine and Fire Y18 to Y859.
Oil stocks, firm previously on hopes of a rise in demand due to an economic
rebound, retreated. Teikoku Oil declined Y19 to Y730 and Showa Shell Sekiyu
by Y20 to Y1,410.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 124.76 to 22,599.96 in volume of 24.5m
shares. The index rose for the fourth consecutive day on small lot buying.
Roundup
The region's markets saw some big gains continuing, although turnover was
generally moderate.
BANGKOK continued its strong advance adding a further 2.4 per cent as
foreign investors returned to the market. The SET index added 30.17 to
1,312.33 as turnover rose to Bt9.3bn from Friday's Bt6.3bn.
SINGAPORE gained more than 1 per cent in low volume on interest in blue chip
stocks. The Straits Times Industrial index gained 26.89 to 2,239.07 with
198m shares traded. Fraser &amp; Neave up 70 cents to SDollars 18.80 and Keppel,
up 40 cents to SDollars 10.80 accounted for most of the day's volume.
MANILA saw its fourth successive rise following PLDT's Dollars 3 gain in New
York on Friday.
The composite index added 49.59 to 2,819.01.
PLDT advanced nearly 3 per cent to 1,790 pesos.
Turnover fell to 966.5m pesos from Friday's 1.14bn pesos.
HONG KONG was active in HSBC following newspaper articles over the weekend
alleging that the treasury division of its UK subsidiary, Midland Bank, had
lost substantial amounts of money in the bond markets this year. Midland has
denied the claims.
The Hang Seng index eased 29.22 to 9,506.84, but off the day's low of
9,415.53. Turnover shrank to HKDollars 2.65bn from Friday's HKDollars
3.55bn.
HSBC lost HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 90.50, and in London trading fell 1.8
per cent.
TAIWAN was helped higher by financial stocks which pushed the weighted index
up 104.32 or 1.9 per cent to 5,690.13. Turnover was TDollars 51.1bn against
Saturday's TDollars 56.8bn.
The major banks, which went ex-rights on Saturday, ended moderately higher:
Chang Hwa rose TDollars 4 to TDollars 151, and First Commercial and Hua Nan
both rose TDollars 3 to TDollars 162 and TDollars 168 respectively.
KUALA LUMPUR rose in light trading on expectations of an early general
election. The composite index climbed 16.60 or 1.6 per cent to 1,050.26.
SEOUL failed to maintain early strength on profit taking after four days of
gains and the composite stock index shed 1.61 to 892.15. Volume was a thin
25.3m shares.
AUSTRALIA was driven higher by a futures-driven rally and the All Ordinaries
index added 15.3 to 2,095.9, but off a session high of 2,103.6. Turnover was
modest at ADollars 317m. BOMBAY fell back with many investors awaiting
today's results from Reliance Industries, the country's biggest private
company. Analysts expected it to show a 55 per cent rise in net profit.
The BSE index lost 34.26 to 3,860.92.
CHINA opened the week slowly following a rally of nearly 5 per cent during
the previous two sessions. The Standard Chartered Shanghai B index rose 0.29
to 53.37, while the Shenzhen B index added 0.21 to 65.06.

FT  19 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Tokyo funds give boost to region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asian markets, largely neglected after the surge to their January peaks,
returned to focus last week with sharp rises recorded in Kuala Lumpur and
Singapore.
The advance resulted from renewed demand from Japanese funds for some of the
regional markets. Tokyo, itself, displayed some nerves at the start of last
week following the resignation of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa as prime minister,
although the outward looking strategy adopted by investors had more to do
with the launch of fresh investment initiatives at the start of a new
financial year.
Tokyo has risen by almost 20 per cent this year while other regional
markets, which have begun to look attractive once again, have fallen by
around the same amount.
Malaysia was the week's biggest winner although the advance did not quite
make up for declines seen in the previous four weeks. It is also still 21
per cent short of its high for the year seen on January 4.
In its weekly review, Foreign &amp; Colonial notes that Kuala Lumpur moved up
strongly at the beginning of the week as a result of increased foreign
participation. F &amp; C adds that Japanese investment in Malaysia slumped by 73
per cent over the last three years, although Tokyo remains the market's
biggest investor, with part of the reason for the decline being the shift of
funds towards China and Indochina.
Singapore, which registered an 18 per cent decline from its peak early in
January to its low point on April, 4 was also the beneficiary early last
week of renewed Japanese interest and some program buying by US investors.
Malaysian shares traded over the counter in Singapore also surged amid
rumours of the possibility of a Malaysian general election being called in
June.
In Europe, Italy registered the week's sharpest advance as post election
euphoria continued. A surge of demand by individual domestic investors
swamped the market's Telematic electronic system on Tuesday, bringing a halt
to the day's trading.
After hurried consultations by the Consob bourse authorities, huge volumes
of business were transacted during the week's remaining sessions, with
turnover surging to a record L2,206bn on Thursday.

FT  19 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Fed blunts enthusiasm in
Frankfurt and Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Early in the day, Frankfurt and Paris were climbing on the rise of the
cyclicals, and interest rate hopes respectively.
However, their enthusiasm weakened after the US Federal Reserve indicated
another rise in short term interest rates, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT was having a good day before the Fed interfered. The Dax index
rose 28.36 to 2,228.78 with cyclicals driving the market higher in spite of
a mixed performance in banks. It peaked at 2,234.20 in the post bourse
before the US rate increase brought it back to end the afternoon at an
Ibis-indicated 2,218.37.
This compared with an all-time Dax high of 2,284.18 last year. Mr Edgar
Benischeck, head of trading at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, noted that the
climb in cyclicals - carmakers, chemicals, engineering and steels - had
brought the broad market even closer to its highs.
Turnover had risen from DM10.5bn to DM11.9bn. The FAZ index, up 9.74 at
846.88 by midsession, was just 8.79 short of the life high it touched
earlier this year: 'We only needed one more friendly day,' said Mr
Benischeck, ruefully.
As it was, interest-rate sensitive and volatile stocks were marked down in
the afternoon: Deutsche Bank lost DM4 from a close of DM778.50, already down
DM1 on a day still overshadowed by the Jurgen Schneider affair and
Volkswagen ended at DM538 after DM545 in the afternoon and a session rise of
DM20 to DM539.50.
With Daimler, the general problem was compounded by an S &amp; P debt rating
downgrade which left the shares at DM879, up just DM4.50, after a high of
DM895.
PARIS moved sharply from a high of 2,188 during early trading as hopes
remained that the Bank of France might cut domestic rates following the
Bundesbank easing last week.
The market was dragged down the Fed's interest rate signal, hitting a
session low of 2,155.58 before reaching positive territory again just prior
to the close. The CAC-40 index finally closed 0.47 ahead at 2,160.60.
James Capel, in contrast to some other brokers, issued an overweight
recommendation on France, arguing that investors will move from the interest
rate story to focus on corporate earnings growth: 'While we consider that
cash calls will continue to weigh on the market over the next quarter, and
in the short-term, potentially push it lower than current levels, we expect
the outlook on the earnings front to continue improving,' it said.
Given that many French companies are already well on the way to completing
their restructuring programmes, the broker added, there are good
expectations for growth this year. 'Already in the first quarter there has
been a marked slowdown in the underperformance of France relative to Europe,
an indication perhaps that investor sentiment is already turning'.
AMSTERDAM fell back sharply following the news from the US. The AEX index,
which had earlier seen a session high of 428.43, finished the day off 3.69
at 421.43.
The financial sector took the brunt of the losses, with ING shedding Fl 3.00
to Fl 81.50 and ABN-Amro losing Fl 2.00 to FL 63.60.
However, there were some positive moves during the session, with Nedlloyd,
in particular finding favour ahead of 1993 results expected on Thursday. The
shipping group's shares rose Fl 1.30 to Fl 76.20, making a rise on the week
of 5.25 per cent. Analysts are forecasting that the group will show a return
to profit, and expect earnings growth over the next few years.
MADRID needed no transatlantic encouragement to subside on the day. The
general index dropped 8.06, or 2.5 per cent to 310.80, but Mr Stephen Hughes
at Kleinwort Benson discounted any Fed effect, saying that the market was
quite depressed enough by domestic concerns.
The scandal surrounding the financial dealings of Mr Mariano Rubio, former
governor of the Bank of Spain, meant that the Spanish prime minister, Mr
Felipe Gonzalez, can be expected to face trenchant criticism today when he
delivers his annual State of the Nation speech in parliament. Mr Gonzalez
has denied he has any intentions of ending his 11-year stint in power.
MILAN stumbled 2.3 per cent lower on profit-taking after the 15.4 per cent
advance which followed the general election three weeks ago. The Comit index
fell 18.72 to 781.60.
Turnover dipped after the records set last week as domestic funds, awaiting
lower prices, held back from trading.
Industrials, which have powered the market higher, were among the hardest
hit. Pirelli fell L131 or 4.2 per cent to L2,956, Montedison lost L60 or 4
per cent to L1,447 and Fiat was L233 or 3.6 per cent lower at L6,336.
The same pattern was seen among the telecommunications stocks. Sip fell L110
or 2.2 per cent to L4,851 and Stet L234 or 3.8 per cent to L5,852.
ZURICH was closed but the SMI index fell 3.8 to 2,869.1, reflecting trading
in Basle and Geneva. Sandoz registered fell SFr5 to SFr3,870 and Ciba lost
SFr11 to SFr933 in response to first quarter sales figures announced earlier
in the day.
HELSINKI was lower in response to higher bond yields and weighed down, in
addition, by the number of new issues announced recently. The Hex index fell
18.0 to 1,817.4.

FT  19 APR 94 / Markets Report: Fed raises rates again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar finished higher on foreign exchanges yesterday after the US
Federal Reserve surprised markets with a further tightening of monetary
policy, writes Philip Gawith.
The extent of the move was not announced, but is assumed to involve the
federal funds rate rising by 25 basis points to 3.75 per cent, the third
such increase since early February when the Fed started tightening credit
policy.
The Fed's announcement came against the background of very quiet trading as
markets struggled to find direction. The dollar rose on the news by more
than a pfennig to a high of DM1.7220, but closed lower in London at
DM1.7202.
Elsewhere, markets in Europe were focusing on the outlook for the weekly
German repo auction today to see by how far interest rates fall after last
week's cut in official rates.
The Fed caught the market off-balance with most observers expecting the next
policy move to come after the May 17 meeting of the policy-making Federal
Open Market Committee (FOMC). The Fed last tightened on March 22.
Analysts said the change confirms that the Fed is acting pre-emptively to
combat the risk of future inflation. The consumer price index rose by only
2.5 per cent in the year to March.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said the timing
confirmed, as did the March tightening, that the Fed was 'not reacting to
any particular figures.' Industrial production and capacity utilisation
figures released last week showed no urgent need for tighter credit.
The IBJ analyst said the Fed was in a process of normalising interest rates,
'moving them to a level that is more appropriate for this advanced stage in
the economic cycle.' He believes the Fed tightening has 'a lot further to
go', with nominal short-term rates rising to 6-6.5 per cent from 3 3/4 per
cent now. 'We have only just started this process of normalisation,' says Mr
Hannah.
Mr Gerry Holtham, chief international economist at Lehman Brothers, said the
market was anticipating short-term rates over 5 per cent by the end of the
year. This level was 'in the market' and hence the dollar was unlikely to
rise on Fed moves unless they were so large, or early, as to 'push up year
end expectations.'
Yesterday the futures market was discounting year-end rates of about 5.8 per
cent. Mr Michael Burke, economist at Citibank, said this was 'more than a
little aggressive' about what the Fed was likely to do. He predicts a
cautious approach.
But with the market anticipating US rates rising above German rates in the
third quarter, Mr Burke added: 'There must be a big suspicion that we're
close to the top end of the dollar's range.'
The results of today's weekly repo auction in Germany will be keenly watched
for any indication that the pace of US tightening is slowing the rate at
which German rates fall. Yesterday Mr Edgar Meistner, a Bundesbank board
member, said in a speech that German rates would continue to fall.
The slow pace of Bundesbank easing has been cited by some observers as a
reason for dollar weakness. Indeed, Lehman's Mr Holtham argues that the fate
of the dollar lies more in the hands of the Bundesbank than the Fed.
Market forecasts range between a 3 basis point and a 15 basis point fall in
the repo rate, from 5.7 per cent. Call money rates eased to 5.50/5.60 per
cent from 5.55/5.65 per cent on Friday. Traders predicted that with ample
liquidity in the system, banks might be prepared to risk lowering their
bids.
In the futures market, the June euromark contract closed unchanged at 94.66
and the December contract was unchanged at 94.99.
The D-Mark had a mixed day in Europe. It was marginally stronger against the
French franc, at FFr3.422 from FFr3.421. It was weaker against the Italian
lira, which closed at L954.5 from L956. The Italian currency was bolstered
by weekend political developments which favour the formation of a new
government.
Sterling finished half a pfennig up against the D-Mark, closing at DM2.5288
from DM2.5233. The UK currency was helped by the stronger dollar. It closed
slightly down against the US currency at Dollars 1.4701 from Dollars 1.4735.
Sentiment about a rate cut - buoyed by good inflation data on Friday -
soured after the Fed tightening. The June sterling future contract closed at
94.71, down from 94.73 on Friday and off a high for the day of 94.78.
IBJ's Mr Hannah said the US move complicated UK monetary policy. With the US
having lifted rates, despite 'excellent' inflation figures, it was clear
that Friday's good retail inflation figure in the UK was 'by no means a
sufficient condition for cutting rates in the UK'.
Mr Holtham said fears about the political consequences of having to raise
interest rates might dampen any government enthusiasm for an early easing of
policy. In the money markets the Bank of England provided Pounds 971m of
assistance after forecasting a Pounds 950m shortage.

FT  19 APR 94 / Survey of Estonia (16): Grim legacy has surprise benefits -
Soviet planners' efforts to exploit shale have boosted energy supplies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a snowy winter day, the neat wooden houses of Kivioli village seem
picturesque - until you sniff the acrid air and remember the ecological
horror visited on the once fertile lowlands of north-eastern Estonia.
By the laws of market economics and in the light of environmental common
sense, the layer of shale which underlies the entire region should have been
left where modern man found it - a few metres below the ground. The
commercial and human cost of extracting the black, stony mess created by
algae 450m years ago is surely far greater than the value of the oil,
bitumen and other chemicals which the shale contains.
But Soviet planners did not see things that way, and their determination to
extract, process and exploit almost anything at almost any price has had a
happy side-effect.
Where most of the former Soviet republics depend on Russia for their energy,
and are therefore acutely vulnerable to political and economic pressure from
Moscow, Estonia can satisfy all its electricity needs - and 65 per cent of
its total energy requirements - from domestic sources. At Kivioli and two
other quarries, plus six deeper mines, 14m tonnes of shale is extracted a
year.
'If we were starting from scratch, nobody would mine shale on this scale.
But since we have inherited the machinery and plant, it makes sense to
continue,' says Mr Leonid Talko, director of the open-cast works at Kivioli.
His excavators have already covered an area of 6 kms by 2 kms, and mining is
expected to continue for another 15 years; Estonia's entire shale reserves
could last for another century.
The sharp-smelling air is caused not by the mining itself so much as the
coking plant next door. In addition to extracting oil, it produces bitumen,
formalins, and a host of industrial chemicals as well as turning out - in a
unique use of shale - consumer products such as shampoo and detergents.
While the mountains of stone thrown up by mining can be reforested with
success, the tips of waste left by coking are disastrous. Their deadly
cocktail of phenols and benzofurans will, if left untreated, seep steadily
into Estonia's ground water.
With oil accounting for about 20 per cent of the shale by volume, that means
that Mr Talko is being paid a meagre Dollars 20 per tonne of petroleum
equivalent. Electricity is sold to the consumer at less than 2 US cents per
kilowatt-hour.
If the necessary grid were constructed, Estonia could make a handsome profit
by exporting power to Sweden and Finland. In Soviet times, the republic was
at one point sending 60 per cent of its electricity output to Russia and
Latvia; now recession in those countries has reduced that business to a
fraction.
Estonia's energy planners aim to take maximum advantage of the republic's
self-sufficiency in power while minimising dependence on Russia in liquid
fuels and gas.
In January, Estonian companies which buy fuel oil from Russia reported that
they were finding it harder and harder to get supplies; and the national
power utility, Eesti Energia, acknowledged that only 30 per cent of its
tanks were full.
To balance the effects of this, the authorities are battling to reverse the
profligate energy consumption habits of the Soviet period - when gas
entering Estonia was not even metered and homes and factories were poorly
insulated.
The cost to consumers of imported gas and fuel oil has been raised sharply,
while the use of peat and wood-burning plants for urban heating systems has
been encouraged.
At Kivioli, Mr Talko - a Ukrainian with a brisk, competent manner - is the
first to acknowledge that proper husbandry of Estonia's energy resources
will not be accomplished overnight. He points with a shudder to the flimsy
window frames of his office, a poor defence against the icy winds outside,
and asks: 'How is anyone supposed to heat a room like this?'
