FT  12 APR 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts surprisingly strong ahead of
economic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government bond market vied with its Italian counterpart for the best
performance of the day yesterday. Analysts said they were surprised by the
gilt market's strength, given this week's heavy timetable of economic data
in the US and the UK.
UK trade figures for January are expected on Thursday and the more important
UK retail price index on Friday.
After February's disappointing numbers, the market will be looking for a
rise of 0.4 percentage points on the month in the underlying annual rate
(excluding mortgage interest payments) to 2.6 per cent.
The headline annual rate is expected to be unchanged from February at 2.4
per cent.
The market widely expects the Bank of England to make an auction
announcement on Friday. Some analysts said they expected the Bank to re-open
outstanding gilt issues with maturities of between 2006 and 2010.
On Liffe, the June contract on the long gilt future stood 1 7/32 points
higher in the late afternoon at 108 3/8 in moderate volume.
Italian bonds started the week in an optimistic mood, despite Sunday's
reiteration by Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader of the Northern League, that the
party would only help form a new Italian government if its federal,
free-market and anti-fascist values were respected.
Mr Troy Bowler, international strategist at PaineWebber, said favourable
coverage of Mr Bossi's comments in the Italian press helped to push bonds
and the lira higher. He noted that the yield on 10-year Italian government
bonds was now only 11 basis points higher than the yield on 10-year Spanish
government bonds. This was the closest that Italian bond yields had come to
Spain's since last October and compared with a yield differential of 100
basis points in early March.
Mr Jeff Brooks, fixed-income analyst at Merrill Lynch in London, said he
expected investors to switch into Spain because the Italian market had got
too far ahead of itself. 'There is no allowance in the Italian market for a
political collapse,' said Mr Brooks.
The June contract on the 10-year Italian government bond future on Liffe
rose 1.21 points in the late afternoon to 114.75.
Spanish government bonds finished higher in line with other European
markets. Dealers are looking to this week's consumer price index for March,
due on Thursday, for confirmation that Spanish inflation is heading
downwards. The market expects a rise of 0.3 per cent to give a yearly rate
of 4.95 per cent. The 10-year notional Spanish government bond future rose
0.54 points to 100.40.
German bunds held on to their early gains amid hopes that the Bundesbank
would cut the emergency Lombard funding rate at its council meeting on
Thursday. Dealers said that failing a Lombard rate cut, the market would
need confirmation from the Bundesbank that it would continue its recent
policy of slowly easing unofficial rates through the repo system. The bund
future on Liffe stood 0.54 points higher at 97.48 in late trading.
After weakening in early trading, US Treasury prices firmed at the long end
of the maturity range after another fall in commodity prices.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was up  1/4 at 88 1/32 ,
yielding 7.230 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged
at 99 15/32 , to yield 5.395 per cent.
After posting early declines in overseas markets, bonds opened weaker in New
York. Traders said the morning losses were a hangover from last Friday's
late sell-off. Later in the day, the long end recovered, aided by a sharp
decline in gold and other metal prices.
Apart from the rally, the market was quiet, with few willing to trade before
this week's economic data, starting with today's release of the March
producer prices index.
Analysts have forecast an increase of 0.1 per cent or 0.2 per cent in the
PPI, and a similar increase in the consumer prices index, which is due
tomorrow, as are the latest monthly retail sales data.

FT  12 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: BZ group launches covered
option fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group has launched a SFr1bn blue chip share
investment fund, whose strategy will be to reduce volatility by continually
writing covered call options on the component shares.
The fund, called Stillhalter Vision, was formed last week by BZ and a few of
its large clients, who contributed some of their shares to it. (Stillhalter
is a German term for covered options used in Swiss financial markets.)
In anticipation of a SFr1bn capital increase by way of a public issue of
Stillhalter bearer shares next week, BZ placed 1.1m call warrants on the
bearers on Friday at SFr15. In initial trading yesterday, they rose to SFr23
on the Basle stock exchange.
Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, a director of the fund, said the idea was to appeal to
investors who wanted a higher return than available on bonds but who were
uncomfortable with the volatility of even blue chip equities.
By continually writing call options, the fund would limit the gains and
cushion the losses on its holdings.
The directors said they hoped the fund would appeal to both small and large
investors seeking the advantages of option writing combined with the
liquidity of a quoted share. Initially, the fund will only hold Swiss blue
chip shares.
As in the cases of the three existing Vision funds, the founding shareholder
group, led by BZ, would maintain majority control of Stillhalter through
holdings of registered shares with five times the voting power of the bearer
shares.
BZ Trust, manager of the Vision funds, has accepted the same aggressive
commission structure for Stillhalter as for BK Vision, Pharma Vision and Gas
Vision, even though the growth potential for the new fund would seem more
modest.
Under this structure, no commission is payable in a quarter unless the
fund's net asset value has risen by more than an annualised 6 per cent.
Thereafter, commission rates rise rapidly.

FT  12 APR 94 / International Bonds: Ecu traders clear the decks for the
EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The friendly tone in Europe's government bond markets lifted sentiment in
the Eurobond market, but issuance remained thin as market participants
stayed cautious ahead of this week's release of inflation data in the US and
the UK, as well as Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank's central bank
council.
In the Ecu sector, players were clearing the decks for a bond issue by the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, expected by some as early
as today. The EBRD yesterday awarded the mandate for the issue to Banque
Paribas and Goldman Sachs International.
According to the lead managers, the timing and terms of the issue are still
uncertain and depend on market conditions. Syndicate sources expect a five
to seven-year global bond of Ecu500m to Ecu1bn. The Kingdom of Spain and the
Council of Europe are also said to be planning Ecu issues.
Most dealers expect Ecu supply to meet healthy investor demand. 'An enormous
amount of Ecu bonds mature this year and the money has to be reinvested,'
said one syndicate official. Moreover, rather than pinpointing any single
bond market, many investors are currently seeking broad exposure to European
bonds via the Ecu market, he said.
The sterling sector gave a warm welcome to Pounds 150m of four-year
floating-rate notes from Woolwich Building Society via lead manager Samuel
Montagu. The notes, which pay a coupon of three-month Libor plus 10 basis
points, yielded 16 basis points over Libor at the 99.79 fixed re-offer
price.
Meanwhile, several borrowers took advantage of continued investor demand for
lira paper and good swap opportunities to issue lira bonds, continuing a
recent trend.
L-Bank Finance and Sudwest LB Capital Markets both increased outstanding
10-year deals by L100m while Swedish Export Credit launched a L150m 9 1/8
per cent 10-year bond, callable after three years. All three deals ended the
day well inside fees.
Although some traders warned that the lira sector may start to get
congested, others expect steady investor demand to continue, boosted by
hopes of further declines in interest rates and a strengthening currency.

FT  12 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Canadian debt reviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moody's Investors Service, the international credit rating agency, has put
its triple-A rating for Canadian foreign currency debt on review for
possible downgrade.
Approximately Dollars 8.5bn of debt is affected, including bonds issued by
the Canadian government, the Export Development Corporation and the Federal
Business Development Bank.
While the agency acknowledged a moderate upturn in the Canadian economy and
said it expected a slight improvement in the current account deficit in
1994, it said the public sector debt question was complicated by the fact
that foreigners have been buying an ever-larger portion of Canadian public
sector debt.
'The rising concern about the level of public sector finance within Canada
appears to pose a risk that, during a period of stress, holders of Canadian
dollar-denominated debt might turn those assets into foreign currency
assets.'
Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the Canadian government's foreign debt from
triple-A to double-A-plus in October 1992.

FT  12 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Third mortgage backed deal by
Barclays Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank has launched a Pounds 281.8m issue of mortgage-backed
securities, arranged by BZW. This is the third securitisation completed by
Barclays, which was the first major UK bank to securitise its mortgages in
1989.
Securitisation allows institutions to remove mortgages from their balance
sheets and repackage them as bonds.
The issue is backed by 7,400 mortgages selected from Barclays Direct
Mortgage Service, the bank's third-party introduced mortgage business. The
offering consists of Pounds 270m of senior notes with an average life of 3
1/2 years, which will yield  1/4 point above the London interbank offered
rate (Libor), and Pounds 11.8m of junior notes.
'Securitisation aids balance sheet and portfolio management,' said Mr
Patrick Perry, Barclays' group treasurer.

FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Ferfin rights issue could give
banks 69% stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Creditor banks of Italy's troubled industrial group, Ferruzzi Finanziaria
(Ferfin), could control 68.9 per cent of the food-to-chemicals company if
they fully take up a complex L1,339bn (Dollars 825m) rights issue announced
yesterday, Reuter reports from Rome.
Ferfin said the stake could end up being owned by the approximately 50 banks
that make up the consortium guaranteeing the complex four-tranche issue. At
present, the banks own some 48.7 per cent of Ferfin.
Serafino Ferruzzi, the family holding company that sits above Ferfin and
once controlled what was Italy's second-largest private business, will see
its stake fall to 12.0 per cent from 19.8 per cent. It has waived its rights
to the new shares.
The capital increase, approved by shareholders last November, involves four
separate operations calling for the issue of a total of 580m shares at
prices ranging from L1,000 to L4,000.
Proceeds will be used to cut Ferfin debts by L706.2bn and those of its
Gruppo Alca (Trading) unit by L633bn.
The first tranche involves the issue of 353m shares on a 10-for-21 basis, at
a price of L2,000. Banks can subscribe for shares up to a limit of 55 per
cent of their exposure. The remaining 45 per cent will be restructured.
Ferruzzi will also offer some 59.62m shares priced at L5,000 on a 10-for-83
basis before December 1998; some 79.56m shares priced at L2,000 each on a
10-for-21 basis in an operation to raise L159.1bn; and 87.87m shares at
L2,000 generating L175.8bn.

Motorola, the US electronics and semiconductor group, yesterday reported a
surge in first quarter net income to Dollars 298m from Dollars 204m, as
sales in the period rose from Dollars 3.63bn to Dollars 4.69bn.
The pace of growth in net income represented a slowdown from last year's
profit increase of more than 100 per cent, and disappointed analysts.
Motorola shares, which had earlier closed Dollars 1 1/8 up at Dollars 107,
plunged to Dollars 99 1/4 in after-hours trading.
The company said its net margin on sales was 6.4 per cent in this year's
first quarter compared with 5.6 per cent in the same period last time.
In the general systems sector, it said orders rose 62 per cent in the first
quarter. Among semiconductor products, orders increased in all markets, led
by the Americas and Japan.
Orders were strongest for communications devices, Mos digital-analog,
advanced micro-controllers, fast static and dynamic Rams, and Risc
microprocessors.
Sales in the automotive, energy and controls group rose 58 per cent, while
orders rose by 60 per cent.
But sales in the information systems group fell by 7 per cent, and orders in
the sector by 11 per cent.
Earnings per share rose from 72 cents to Dollars 1.03.
Motorola said that a 2-for-1 stock split would take place on April 18.

Optus
</HEADLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nine Network, the Australian television network controlled by Mr Kerry
Packer, has agreed to buy a 15 per cent stake in Optus Communications for
ADollars 318m (USDollars 224m), agencies report from Sydney.
Optus, which is establishing Australia's second telecommunications carrier
and also operates communications satellites, is to issue 265m new shares to
Nine Network, which will fund the investment through bank financing.
Current shareholders in Optus are BellSouth, of the US, and Cable &amp;
Wireless, of the UK, each of which own 24.5 per cent. The balance is owned
by Australian companies Mayne Nickless, Australian Mutual Provident Society,
National Mutual Life Association of Australasia, and AIDC.
The investment by Nine Network increases the Australian shareholding in
Optus to more than 58 per cent from 51 per cent. The current shareholders
will dilute proportionately their interests to accommodate Nine Network.
The Optus group will be restructured by August so that all shareholders have
direct equity in Optus Communications. Currently, some have indirect stakes
through a separate entity, Optus Pty.
'The restructure of the Optus group will facilitate a listing of Optus
Communications on the Australian Stock Exchange in due course,' said a
statement from Optus and Nine Network.
The TV network has entered a strategic alliance with the telecommunications
company under which Nine Network will support and participate in the
development of multimedia operations at Optus. Nine Network has agreed to
maintain its shareholding for at least five years and to limit its holding
in Optus to a maximum 20 per cent for this period.
Optus, formed in January 1992 as a competitor to Telecom Australia when
telecommunications were partly deregulated, has spent ADollars 1.2bn
building a telecoms network. It plans to spend another ADollars 5bn over the
next four years.
Analysts say Optus has 20 per cent of Australia's mobile telephone market
and 18 per cent of its overseas traffic but only 7 per cent of domestic
long-distance calls, or 13 per cent of the combined ADollars 4.5bn a year
market. Telecom retains the local call monopoly.

FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: James Hardie to float off HarTec
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
James Hardie Industries, the Australian building supplies group, has
continued to sell non-core businesses, with plans to float its electronic
components subsidiary, HarTec, writes Bruce Jacques.
Hardie announced yesterday it would offer 29.1m shares at ADollars 1 each in
the company, with the issue fully underwritten. With payment of
inter-company loans before the float, Hardie will net ADollars 34.1m from
the transaction.
Hardie's managing director, Dr Keith Barton, said the sale was part of the
company's strategy of concentrating on core businesses.
About 35 per cent of HarTec's shares will be set aside for Hardie
shareholders.

Suzuki Motor, the Japanese minicar maker, said it wrote off Y8.54bn (Dollars
81.2m) of bad debt from its exposure to its troubled Spanish unit, Santana
Motor, in the year to March 31 1994, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Santana is
owned 83.7 per cent by Suzuki.
Santana stopped output two months ago when its labour union went on strike
in protest against management restructuring plans which involved reducing
the workforce of 1,400 by 60 per cent.
Suzuki said the company was standing by its November forecast of parent
current profit of Y18bn in 1993-94, down from Y20.48bn in the previous year.

Alcoa slips

<TEXT>
Directors of Alcoa of Australia, the integrated aluminium producer, have
warned that any recovery will be constrained following a 5.6 per cent fall
in net profit in the March quarter to ADollars 76.3m (USDollars 53.7m) from
ADollars 80.9m a year ago. Revenues were 1 per cent higher at ADollars
509.8m, against ADollars 504.7.
Directors said the result reflected lower prices for all products, partially
offset by increased sales volumes of alumina, lower unit production and
lower taxes.
'First-quarter results should not be taken as indicative of results for the
remainder of 1994,' they said.
'Conditions in the industry remain difficult, and although a number of
producers have communicated they will cut back metal production, inventories
remain high and will constrain recovery in the industry.'
Tax provision was down to ADollars 440.2m from ADollars 55.2m in the period,
while depreciation took ADollars 36.4m, against ADollars 36.7m. Interest
expense was down to ADollars 4.8m from ADollars 7.1m.

FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Soaring Peregrine seeks central
role in Asian bond market - Merchant bank is the envy of Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the brash and aggressive merchant banking style of the 1980s survives
anywhere, then it is in Hong Kong. And one bank which represents the style
best is Peregrine Investments, the brokerage Hong Kong's financial community
envies and likes to hate.
Since 1988, when it was just an idea in the minds of its two founders,
Peregrine has become one of the colony's leading merchant banks. Not content
with Hong Kong, it sees itself as a regional merchant bank and is opening
offices as far afield as India.
Yesterday, it reported a 27 per cent increase in net income to HKDollars
855.5m (USDollars 110.8m) from HKDollars 676.5m. Turnover, bloated by the
introduction of London-based debt securities trading, almost trebled to
HKDollars 11.4bn from HKDollars 4.3bn. A final dividend of 35 cents a share
was declared which, with 25 cents paid at the interim stage, makes 60 cents
for the year - up 14 per cent.
Peregrine is an uncommonly successful marriage of the English and the
Chinese. Mr Philip Tose, formerly chief executive of Citicorp Scrimgeour
Vickers and the son of a Vickers' partner, is chairman. Mr Francis Leung, a
corporate finance expert from Mr Tose's days at Citicorp, is the company's
managing director.
While merchant banks and brokers such as Barings and Jardine Fleming, two
long-established British houses, represent an establishment that is rapidly
passing, Peregrine is part of the establishment in waiting. Its name is
always associated with what the colony's leading 'red chips', such as Citic
Pacific, do, as it is with the big local Chinese companies such as Mr Li
Ka-Shing's Cheung Kong or Mr Gordon Wu's Hopewell.
Last year Peregrine was the lead broker in nearly HKDollars 25.5bn of new
issues, rights issues and placements in Asia. It acted as financial adviser
to another clutch of deals worth more than HKDollars 26bn in the region. The
company took the lead for companies in South Korea, India and the
Philippines, but the vast majority of deals were done in Hong Kong, where it
dominates the market.
In 1993, Peregrine was responsible for more than 60 per cent of the new
listings (by value) on the Hong Kong stock exchange; it accounted for about
one third of all rights issues and a quarter of placements, again by value.
The fees are good. The company made USDollars 10m from the flotation of Mr
Wu's Consolidated Electric Power Asia last autumn.
Says Mr Tose: 'We think the ability to commit to deals quickly is very
important . . . we have no intention of giving up our market share without a
fight.' Yesterday he forecast that the company's capital base would grow
from its present USDollars 500m of net assets to USDollars 2bn in four
years. That would make Peregrine a 'serious player' on a global scale.
Mr Leung says the idea of a merchant bank like Peregrine began germinating
in both executives' minds during 1988. Citicorp was retreating from equity
markets in the wake of the October 1987 stock market crash and Mr Leung
thought it was only a matter of time before the bank decided to retrench in
Hong Kong.
'I thought about what I did for clients - doing deals, raising money and
investing it,' he said. 'I thought I could do the same for myself. What I
had in mind was a corporate finance boutique with a small number of clients
to help make deals. Philip wanted to set up a brokerage and said 'why not
put them together?'.'
Peregrine was born in the autumn of 1988 when Mr Leung severed his ties with
Citicorp; by the end of the year Mr Tose had finished with Citicorp as well.
Among the company's initial 18 backers were Mr Li Ka-shing, Mr Wu, and Citic
Pacific - today three of Peregrine's most important clients.
Initially Mr Tose and Mr Leung wanted to raise between HKDollars 100m and
HKDollars 150m in capital, but HKDollars 300m was eventually raised. 'KS Li
said we should raise more money,' recalls Mr Leung. 'He said with more
capital at least we could live off the interest.'
Through a series of transactions - the first of which entailed investing
HKDollars 300m in 34.5 per cent of Kwong Sang Hong, a cosmetics and property
company which Mr Li used to control - Peregrine became listed on the stock
exchange.
Mr Tose and Mr Leung exercise their control over the company through
Peregrine International, a privately held investment company, which owns 20
per cent of Peregrine's issued capital and in which they have nearly a 30
per cent interest. Mr George Soros, the US financier, recently took a near 5
per cent stake in this private company. With the raising of USDollars 200m
late last year it has recently been reactivated to engage in long-term
China-related investment.
The public company has also taken advantage of historically low US interest
rates and raised USDollars 200m in long-term debt. This will be used partly
to expand in Asia and to get Peregrine into Hong Kong's emerging debt market
as a trader and originator of deals. It recently hired a fixed income team
from Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong.
Mr Leung said getting into fixed income trading served two purposes.
Peregrine was positioning itself for the day when it could participate in
the bond markets of Asia, especially China. It will also help smooth the
company's earnings profile, as profits from stock market and corporate
finance are quite volatile.
Where Peregrine causes some eyebrows to be raised, even in Hong Kong, is its
practice of taking equity in companies it brings to market. But Mr Leung
denies there is a conflict of interest.
'We use our corporate finance network and expertise to spot investment
opportunities,' he says. 'Corporate finance is separate from stock broking.
We invest in most when they are unlisted; the management of the exit is
handled by the trading department and corporate finance does not know about
it.'

FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Talks on NZ meat processing
plants fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand's two most modern meat processing plants - which lie idle
following the collapse of the Fortex group - are to be offered for sale on
the international market. This follows the breakdown of negotiations with a
group of New Zealand businessmen who wanted to lease the plants.
Earlier, the Fortex receiver, Mr Alan Isaac, had unsuccessful talks with
other New Zealand meat processing companies over leasing the plants. These
failed when he refused to give these companies options to buy.
The failure to lease the plants is a further blow to New Zealand's most
important industry, which has an annual turnover of NZDollars 3.3bn (Dollars
1.89bn). Fortex had been considered a world leader in efficient meat
processing, and was the pioneer in 24-hour slaughtering.
Fortex, which was credited with leading reform of New Zealand's meat
processing industry, was well advanced with plans to open a plant in Wales
as a step to introduce its technology to UK slaughtering. It also had
extensive marketing operations in the UK, continental Europe, North America
and Asia.
Mr Isaac was appointed receiver last month after the surprise announcement
that the company expected to lose NZDollars 45m in the six months to
February 28 because of intense competition in the industry.

FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Union Carbide, 3M implant deal
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union Carbide and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing have decided to
contribute towards the proposed Dollars 4bn global settlement of breast
implant litigation agreed by other US companies in March.
The settlement between makers of silicone implants and plaintiffs claiming
illnesses resulting from implant leaks should provide funds to settle
litigation worldwide over the next 30 years. It also provides a partial
ceiling on individual companies' liabilities.
The main corporate participants in the settlement, which is still subject to
fairness hearings and legal challenges, are Dow Corning (a joint venture
between Dow Chemical and Corning), Bristol-Myers Squibb and Baxter
International.
Union Carbide, the chemicals group, did not manufacture the implants but it
supplied generic bulk silicone materials to the implant industry. It said
its contribution to the settlement would be Dollars 138m over the next few
years.
The company said it had previously taken pre-tax charges totalling Dollars
35m for litigation, and the settlement would not require any charges in its
first or second quarters. After probable insurance recoveries, the effect on
future earnings should be negligible, it said.
3M, the diversified maker of medical products and adhesives, did make the
implants but had previously held out against joining the industry-wide
settlement. Subject to its directors' approval, it has now agreed to join
with a contribution of Dollars 325m.
The company said that, after this and other charges relating to breast
implant litigation and after probable insurance recoveries, it expected to
report a pre-tax charge of Dollars 35m in the first quarter, or Dollars 22m
after tax. In last year's first quarter, it made net profits of Dollars
330m.

Digital Equipment will today launch an aggressive bid to take the lead in
the fast growing market for computer network 'servers,' computers that boost
the performance of networks linking desktop computers.
Digital said that its new 2100 servers, based on its Alpha Reduced
Instruction Set Computing (Risc) microprocessors, would offer higher
performance at half the price of equivalent products from Sun Microsystems
and International Business Machines and one-third the price of
Hewlett-Packard's comparable server product.
'Digital is breaking several performance and cost barriers,' said Mr William
Strecker, vice-president of engineering. 'We are bridging the worlds of
large system features and small-system advantages to put the power to manage
complex tasks within the reach of enterprise departments and small
companies.'
The Digital 2100 server is the first in a family of Alpha Risc-based
departmental servers, the company said. Prices start at Dollars 18,900 for a
single processor unit, up to Dollars 36,900 for a four processor unit.
The new servers make use of low cost personal computer technology combined
with high performance Risc microprocessors, Digital said.
The company will target commercial customers as well as those using
technical applications.

profits increase to R441m

Gold Fields of South Africa yesterday reported an increase in after-tax
profit to R441.1m (Dollars 89.1m) in the third quarter to March, on the back
of a higher gold price received, well up on the same quarter last year when
profits were R267.4m.
The figure compares with the R387.7m recorded in the December quarter.
Pre-tax figures were even stronger at R626.4m, compared with R530.2m in the
previous quarter, reflecting a solid operating performance from the four
mining companies.
The quantity of gold produced was almost unchanged at 30,982kg, against
30,713kg the previous quarter, but sales revenue advanced to R1.31bn from
R1.22bn, boosted by an increase in the average gold price to R42,156 per kg,
up from R39,758, on continued weakening of the rand.
Mr Alan Munro, executive director, pronounced the results 'a fine
achievement in a difficult quarter,' noting that the overwhelming bulk of
this tax was on the group's star performer, Driefontein.
The mine, the country's most profitable, had another exceptionally strong
quarter with its east division increasing an already high yield to 11.6
grammes a tonne.
Pre-tax profits rose to R405.8m from R329.7m the previous quarter. However
Mr Munro warned that such an exceptionally high grade could not be expected
to continue for much longer.
Kloof, the other large producer in the group, lifted after-tax profit to
R192.3m from R174.1m.
This improvement came despite the continued loss of production after an
accident in one of its shafts and a disappointing quarter from its Libanon
division, which posted a loss of R1.1m after last quarter's R3.7m profit.
Troubled Doornfontein maintained after-tax profit at R4.27m compared with
R4.33m, but the figures did not include a R6m award for unfair dismissals
which will be paid in the current quarter.
The group's other producer, Deelkraal, also improved to R15.7m from R14.9m.

FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Bear Stearns suffers in
unpredictable markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bear Stearns, the Wall Street securities house, yesterday revealed that it
has incurred trading losses in recent weeks because of extreme volatility in
financial markets.
The announcement of the losses, which were described as 'moderate,' did not
surprise industry analysts. Heavy declines in bond prices over the past few
weeks were expected to have had a negative impact on the earnings of Wall
Street firms such as Bear Stearns, which own and trade large portfolios of
government securities.
Mr James Cayne, Bear Stearns' chief executive, said: 'This is not the first
time we have suffered losses, and it will not be the last.' Big trading
houses are always vulnerable to losses if securities prices change rapidly,
but those losses can just as quickly be recouped if market conditions turn
back in their favour.
The recent unpredictability of global financial markets, however, coupled
with the rise in US interest rates and declines in domestic stock and bond
prices since February, should mark a turning point in Wall Street's earnings
cycle. After three years of steadily escalating profitability, income growth
is expected to slow in 1994.
Bear Stearns' third quarter earnings, which were released yesterday,
indicated that the peak in the securities industry's cycle has probably
passed. The firm reported third-quarter profits of Dollars 115.5m, slightly
higher than a year earlier but well down from the previous quarter, when
profits reached a record Dollars 134.8m.
Separately, Bear Stearns announced that Mr Wayne Angell, who recently
stepped down after eight years as a member of the Federal Reserve Board,
will be joining the firm as chief economist and senior managing director.
The hiring of Mr Angell is a coup for Bear Stearns. His experience and
knowledge of the Fed will prove beneficial to Bear Stearns, which is one of
the most active traders in the US market for fixed-income securities.
During his high-profile tenure at the Fed, Mr Angell developed a reputation
as an inflation 'hawk', who believed the central bank's overriding priority
as the guardians of US monetary policy was to defeat inflation.

FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: BR Distribuidora float pays off
 -Brazil's petrol distributor is proving itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When investors snapped up shares in BR Distribuidora last December they were
buying into Brazil's largest petrol distributor and a company widely
regarded as the best-run subsidiary of Petrobras, the state-controlled oil
company.
Since the offer, which saw 26 per cent of the company sold in non-voting
shares mainly to institutions, BR has announced net profits up 50 per cent
for last year. It is now considering an issue of American depositary
receipts this year.
Investors were attracted because BR is considered to be a well managed,
profitable company with no bank debt. This is possibly because petrol
distribution has long been open to private competition. While Petrobras'
exploration and refining are a government monopoly, BR has had to prove
itself in a highly competitive sector against some of the world's largest
oil companies.
Despite this threat, BR has maintained a market share of 36-37 per cent,
compared with 22 per cent for its nearest rival, Shell Brasil.
Shortly after the share offer, which raised Dollars 250m for Petrobras' own
projects, BR announced net profits of Dollars 110m for the year to the end
of December 1993, up from Dollars 73m in 1992.
Financial director Mr Reynaldo Aloy said the increase was due to higher
profit margins following a partial liberalisation of prices in the oil
derivatives sector and an increase in gross sales of 8.7 per cent to Dollars
6.73bn.
Although the BR sale was oversubscribed, its share price significantly
underperformed the Sao Paulo stock exchange, rising in dollar terms only
about 12 per cent to early-March from launch, compared with about 40 per
cent for the market as a whole.
Brokers attribute the underperformance to the comparatively high initial
price asked for BR shares. These were sold at about a 50 per cent premium to
the company's per share book value.
Mr Ronaldo Guimaraes, technical manager at brokerage house Banco do Brasil
DTVM, which helped manage the initial public offering, says the sale is a
first, small step towards the full privatisation of BR.
Other analysts, however, believe Petrobras is using BR to improve its own
cash flow and may raise money again by selling more non-voting shares, for
example in the mooted ADR issue.
Ironically, the flotation of the company may make it harder to privatise.
'Experience has shown that government controlled companies with outside
shareholders are harder to sell off,' says a Petrobras source.
Mr Aloy says the sale is not related to privatisation: 'We wanted to open up
new lines of capital in the financial markets and to show that we are a
strong, solid, profitable company.'
Apart from Shell, BR's main competitor is the local Ipiranga group, which
last year bought Atlantic Richfield Company's petrol station chain in
Brazil, and has a market share of about 18 per cent. Esso has 13 per cent
and Texaco less than 10 per cent of the market.
Competitors agree that BR is strong and well-managed. However, they
attribute part of its success to traditional 'captive' government customers,
such as the armed forces. This market has been reduced recently with the
privatisation of the steel industry.
Mr Aloy says government customers, accounting for 25 per cent of sales, buy
from the company because it offers competitive service and has the biggest
distribution network.
According to Mr Henrique Neves, a vice-president of Shell Brasil, the
opening up of BR and Ipiranga's purchase of Atlantic means even fiercer
competition in the sector. Competition will also heat up if remaining
controls on pump prices are removed, as the industry expects.

FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: New HK fund for investment in
China launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A fund investing in smaller companies listed in Hong Kong with interests in
China has been launched for European investors.
South Ocean Management, a Hong-Kong based company which has Dollars 28.7m of
US private investors' funds under management in Hong Kong, is launching
Cathay Value Fund, as yet of undetermined size, for investors outside the
US.
Allen &amp; Company, a New York investment bank, is acquiring 50 per cent of
South Ocean, which was founded in 1992 and is headed by Mr Richard
McConnell.
Mr McConnell said he was investing in 43 smaller Hong Kong companies with
substantial interests in China's southern province of Guangdong, high growth
rates and low price earnings ratios.
He believes the small companies he selects will outstrip larger companies in
the Hang Seng index.
However, the US investors' accounts managed by South Ocean grew by 62 per
cent in 1993, compared with the 115 per cent rise of the Hang Seng.
Cathay Value Fund is the latest in a torrent of China-related funds launched
over the past three years. Mr McConnell, a fund manager from New York, told
a group of potential investors that 'Hong Kong looks like the Nasdaq (the US
over-the counter share market) in 1951'.

<TEXT>
Hugo Boss, the biggest German menswear designer, yesterday unveiled record
profits, up 73 per cent to DM76.5m (Dollars 44.7m) for 1993.
Worldwide sales, though, were 7.8 per cent lower.
Mr Peter Littmann, chief executive, said the company would take advantage of
a tax break and good liquidity to pay a one-off dividend of DM117.50 per
share.
He added that a 'difficult environment' meant sales this year were likely to
match levels achieved last year.
Disregarding the extraordinary items, profits would have been DM48.6m, up 10
per cent.
'The 1993 profits are not repeatable,' Mr Littmann said. 'Not now or in the
next 10 years.'
On top of the extraordinary dividend, ordinary shares will receive a DM23
dividend, up from DM21, while holders of preferential stock will receive
DM24.50, also up DM2.
Mr Littmann blamed the drop in sales on weak markets in Europe and the
restructuring of the US division.
However, Boss labels were a huge success in new Asian markets, where
turnover in some cases doubled.
The company is 50.4 per cent owned by the Italian Marzotto group while the
Holy brothers, grandsons of the founder, still hold a 7 per cent stake.
Turnover was down 10 per cent on the year before but Mr Littmann said that
would not influence year-end results.

FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Seagram expands in Australian
wine deals

<TEXT>
Seagram, one of the world's top four drinks groups, is expanding its wine
interests in Australia.
As a first step, Seagram has sold its Saltram Wine Estates, a wine producer
and distributor based in Barossa Valley, South Australia, to Rothbury Wines.
Then Seagram bought treasury shares of Rothbury to hold a 20 per cent
interest and become the largest single stockholder in Rothbury Group. It
will have one representative on the Rothbury board.
Seagram would not reveal prices or other financial details. The two
Australian companies in effect will be merged operationally and expanded.
Seagram has distributed its wine and spirits products in Australian since
1954. It bought Saltram in 1978.
'There are strong synergies between Rothbury and Saltram and joining forces
will create a strong dynamic business,' Seagram said. 'The combined company
will offer a broad Australian wine portfolio as well as other Seagram
wines.'
Analysts said the deal sets Seagram's Asian and global business strategy.
SHL Systemhouse, a fast expanding computer service group, lifted
second-quarter net profit to CDollars 5.4m (USDollars 3.9m) or 10 cents a
share, from CDollars 1.3m, or 3 cents, a year earlier. Revenues gained 22
per cent to CDollars 292m.
First-half revenues rose 27 per cent to CDollars 559m and net profit was
CDollars 10.1m, or 19 cents, against CDollars 1.6m, or 4 cents.

FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Jefferson Smurfit in Dollars 2bn
move to cut debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jefferson Smurfit, one of the US's biggest recycled newsprint and packaging
producers, plans an ambitious Dollars 2bn recapitalisation, including a
public equity offering and refinancing a substantial portion of its debt.
According to a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
in Washington, the restructuring is designed to improve the St Louis,
Missouri-based company's operating and financial flexibility by reducing the
level and the cost of borrowings, extending debt maturities and
strengthening its equity base.
Smurfit, 50 per cent owned by Jefferson Smurfit Group of Ireland and 40 per
cent by two equity funds run by Morgan Stanley, has struggled under a heavy
weight of junk bond-financed debt, exacerbated by weak paper and packaging
markets.
Long-term debt stood at Dollars 2.6bn at the end of last year, and there was
a shareholders' deficit of almost Dollars 1bn. The company, with 1993 sales
of Dollars 2.9bn, has suffered losses totalling almost Dollars 400m over the
past three years.
The restructuring includes a Dollars 300m global public equity offering and
new credit facilities totalling Dollars 1.65bn, making the financing one of
the largest for a non-investment grade company in recent years.
The Irish parent has agreed to inject Dollars 100m of new equity. In
addition, Container Corporation of America, a Smurfit subsidiary, will issue
Dollars 400m of senior notes.
The bulk of the funds will be used to repay bank facilities and to redeem
Dollars 844m of junk bonds.
When the proposals are implemented, the Irish parent's stake will drop to
about 44 per cent, while the Morgan Stanley funds will hold a 31 per cent
interest. The remaining 25 per cent will be held by outside investors,
including the public.
Under the plan, long-term debt will be only modestly reduced to Dollars
2.4bn, and the company will continue to have a large debt-servicing burden
over the next five years. The prospectus warns 'there can be no assurance
that the company will generate sufficient cash flow to meet its
obligations'.
Smurfit carries a single-B non-investment grade (or junk) bond rating,
although bankers hope an improvement in its financial condition will allow
it to reach a double-B rating before long. The strengthening US economy has
led to a marked improvement in paper prices over the past six months.
Besides the financial restructuring, Smurfit last year began an internal
shake-up aimed at reducing costs. The programme, expected to last two to
three years, resulted in a Dollars 96m pre-tax charge last September
reflecting, among other things, a consolidation of manufacturing facilities.

income gain

<TEXT>
Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber, the US tyre manufacturer that has staged a strong
recovery over the past three years, yesterday said it expected to report an
increase in first-quarter net income of between 30 per cent and 35 per cent
above the previous year's figure.
It also announced it was seeking to enter the Chinese market by setting up a
joint venture with a company manufacturing and selling tyres in China.
Mr Stanley Gault, chairman and chief executive, told shareholders at the
annual meeting in Akron, Ohio, that net profits should be in the Dollars
113m to Dollars 118m range, compared with Dollars 87.1m before accounting
changes last time.
Preliminary estimates suggested first-quarter sales would be 2 per cent
ahead of last year's Dollars 2.81bn, Mr Gault said.
Earnings per share should be in the 75 to 78 cents range, compared with 60
cents last time.
The Goodyear board also announced it had declared a 33 per cent increase in
the dividend to 20 cents from 15 cents a share for the first quarter. The
company's stock rose by Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 42 1/8 .
Mr Gault attributed the strong first-quarter results to a combination of new
products, cost reductions and efficiency improvements.
The same factors have underscored the sharp recovery in the company's
financial performance since Mr Gault took over as chairman and chief
executive in 1991.
The sales increase was more modest than the profit improvement because it
included a higher proportion of tyres for new cars, which sold at lower
prices than replacement tyres.
Concerning the group's plan to enter China, Mr Gault said Goodyear would
prefer a joint venture. But he added the company had also been approached by
Chinese provinces seeking to interest it in a greenfield venture - an option
Goodyear would consider if no suitable partner could be found.

<TEXT>
Talks yesterday in Prague between Mr Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman,
and Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech minister for trade and industry, failed to
resolve differences between the two sides over the long-term future of Skoda
Automobilova, in which the German car maker has a 31 per cent stake.
The two partners - the Czech state still owns almost 70 per cent of Skoda -
have been at odds ever since VW, which was due to invest DM7.1bn over 10
years, said last autumn that it was sharply reducing investments to DM3.7bn
(Dollars 2.2bn) as part of its cost-saving drive.
Plans for a new engine plant at the Mlada Boleslav site were also ditched.
This angered the Czech government, which argued that as the main
shareholder, it should have been consulted about the changes.
In December, both sides agreed to differ, and Mr Piech promised to keep
Prague better informed.
A new protocol covering future investments by VW will be presented at a
shareholders' meeting on Friday.

<TEXT>
CPC International, the US food company whose brands include Hellmann's
mayonnaise, Knorr soups and Mazola corn oil, yesterday reported a 9 per cent
increase in net income to Dollars 98.1m for the first quarter, helped by
volume gains and lower financing costs.
World-wide volumes rose by 9 per cent, about a third of which came from
acquisitions - among them the Pfanni potato products business in Germany.
Unfavourable exchange rates affected the value of sales in dollar terms, but
the combination of volume gains and higher prices produced an overall
increase of 6 per cent in turnover to Dollars 1.74bn.
Best Foods, CPC's North American food business, saw sales growth of 9 per
cent on increased volumes of Hellmann's mayonnaise, Mazola oil, Skippy
peanut butter, Karo syrups and Knorr products.
However, specialty baking and Mueller's pasta were down, and higher
commodity prices combined with increased spending on marketing and product
development left North American operating income flat.
Growth in overall operating income came from CPC's international operations
 -particularly in Latin America, where consumer foods recorded a 25 per cent
increase.
But Mr C. R. Shoemate, CPC's chairman and chief executive, warned that the
Latin American business would be significantly affected by the difficult
business environment in Brazil in the second quarter.
Finance costs fell to Dollars 20.2m from Dollars 22.8m, leaving pre-tax
profits up 9 per cent at Dollars 172.5m.
Earnings per share rose to 63 cents from 58 cents and the dividend is 34
cents a share, up from 32 cents.

<TEXT>
Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the French construction, utilities and
communications group, raised net profits by just over 10 per cent last year
to FFr3.2bn (Dollars 545m), according to estimates announced by the company
yesterday.
The increase was achieved in spite of difficult conditions in the
construction and water services markets, and is higher than forecasts made
by the group at the end of last year when it launched a rights issue for
more than FFr3bn.
The company said it would propose a dividend of FFr44 per share, against
FFr43 in 1992, and it is planning to split its shares into four to improve
liquidity.
Final results are expected at the end of the month, although the company has
already announced that sales grew by just under 3 per cent last year to
FFr147bn. About FFr39bn of the total was generated outside France.
The group said there was a negative impact on profits from its property and
cable television activities. It is aiming to expand its activities in the
media sector. In February it took joint control of Canal Plus, the pay-TV
network, with Havas, the media company, and Societe Generale, the banking
group.
In a statement issued yesterday, Mr Guy Dejouany, chairman, said cashflow
during the year had risen slightly to FFr11bn.
Investments in 1993 amounted to FFr7.8bn as the company sought to expand its
presence outside France.
The strategy of reinforcing its international position has been continued
this year.
Last month, Generale des Eaux announced that it was raising its stake in Air
&amp; Water of the US, from 23 per cent to 40 per cent.

Leaders of the Euro Disney loan syndicates yesterday met the company's
Japanese creditors in Paris in a bid to persuade them to agree to plans for
the troubled leisure group's FFr13bn (Dollars 2.22bn) rescue package.
Most of the 63 international banks in the Euro Disney syndicates are
understood to have agreed in principle to the rescue. Banque Nationale de
Paris (BNP) and Banque Indosuez, joint leaders of the banks' steering
committee, hope by Friday to have finalised the agreement.
But the banks have yet to agree terms for underwriting of the rights issue.
Japanese creditors - including LTCB of Japan, Mitsubishi Trust, Sumitomo,
Bank of Tokyo and Industrial Bank of Japan - are reluctant to be involved
with the underwriting.
The Japanese banks yesterday pressed BNP and Indosuez for exemption from the
underwriting. They also urged that the Caisse des Depots et Consignations,
which is Euro Disney's biggest lender, should play a larger part in the
restructuring.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Roche, the world's most highly valued pharmaceutical group, said
consolidated sales rose 6 per cent in the first quarter to SFr3.7bn (Dollars
2.6bn).
The relatively low overall increase was due mainly to the rise of the Swiss
franc in recent months against most currencies, especially the US dollar.
Expressed in local currencies, the sales rise was 12 per cent, Roche said.
The group's smaller divisions performed significantly worse than the
dominant pharma division, where sales rose 10 per cent in Swiss franc terms
to SFr2.09bn, or 16 per cent in local currencies.
Roche said its top selling drugs - Rocephin, an anti-infection treatment,
Dormicum, a mild anaesthetic, Roaccutane for treating acne - all showed
sales volume rises.
Roche will publish its profit figures for 1993 next Tuesday.
Sulzer Technology, the Swiss engineering group, has reported an 11 per cent
rise in 1993 net income to SFr186m on a 2 per cent fall in sales to
SFr6.66bn. Operating income was up 7.2 per cent to SFr268m.
The directors are recommending a rise in dividends from SFr16 to SFr18 per
share or participation certificate.

FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Finland steps up privatisation
pace - Sell-off programme enters new phase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finland's privatisation programme has entered a new phase with the
announcement that two big industrial groups, Rautaruukki and Valmet, intend
to launch large share offerings to international investors in the next few
weeks. A sell-off programme characterised by caution and hesitancy is
expected to gain momentum, as other state-owned groups follow their lead.
'The pace of privatisation this year will be faster than it has been,'
asserts Mr Matti Vuoria, secretary general at the Finnish ministry of trade
and industry.
Rautaruukki, Scandinavia's second largest steel producer, is aiming to raise
FM800m (Dollars 145m) and reduce state ownership to 70 per cent from 81 per
cent through an offer of 16m new shares.
Valmet, one of the world's three biggest producers of paper machinery, hopes
to raise more than FM500m by offering between 5m and 7m shares.
But these are only two of the 11 names on the government's privatisation
list, companies which together account for 20 per cent of Finnish exports
and 15 per cent of the industrial labour force.
Other candidates include Neste, the oil and petrochemicals group; Kemira,
the chemicals group; Outokumpu, the mining company; and Enso-Gutzeit, the
pulp and paper group.
In all 11 companies, the government has parliamentary authorisation to
reduce current state ownership levels sharply.
Privatisation has come to the fore partly because of the general European
trend. But the process also recognises that the state cannot afford to
finance its siblings, who instead will be encouraged to tap the capital
markets for their needs.
Finnish privatisation has significant differences to sell-off programmes in
other European countries.
First, the process is more a widening of ownership than full-scale
privatisation, as the state currently intends to keep more than 50 per cent
of the shares in all but three of the companies on its list.
Second, the state is not garnering the proceeds, but instead allowing the
companies to bolster balance sheets weakened by recession and heavy
investment. It is a process of gradual dilution, with companies typically
targeting share issues at domestic and international institutions to broaden
their ownership base. To date, the retail element has been very small.
It is also a very cautious programme: no timetable has been specified, let
alone a revenues target. Kemira, which first asked to be privatised 10 years
ago, is still 100 per cent state-owned.
One obvious reason for the slow progress is the three long recession years
between 1991 and 1993, which dragged many companies into the red and sent
share values plunging.
Another is the small size of the domestic market. 'I don't think we can
afford any failures, taking into account the size of the Finnish stock
exchange,' says Mr Vuoria.
There are still painful memories of one such failure: a Valmet issue in the
late 1980s when the shares crashed to FM20 from an issue price of FM120. The
limited size of the domestic market explains why international investors
will play a crucial role in the success of the privatisation process.
Finally, there has undoubtedly been a certain political hesitancy,
particularly on the part of the opposition Social Democrats. Certain
elements within the Centre Party, which dominates the centre-right coalition
government, have also shown limited enthusiasm for the process. Both parties
worry about the implications for regional policy and jobs if companies slip
out of state control.
This does not mean that there are significant ideological barriers to
privatisation. Finns stress that their state-owned companies were never
nationalised; instead their roots originate in the post-war period when
Finland had to create industrial capacity to pay war reparations to the
Soviet Union. In the meantime, they have had considerable freedom to operate
like private companies.
For many companies, the main worry is timing. Having improved their results
strongly last year, and after heavy internal restructuring, they fear that
market conditions may move against them.
Helsinki was western Europe's top performing bourse last year, rising 91 per
cent, but this year conditions have been more unsettled amid the turbulence
which has swept international bond and equity markets.
However, most analysts do not believe that the recent price correction will
unsettle the privatisation programme. 'I am very positive about prospects,'
says Mr Esa Cleve, director of Prospectus, an investment banking group.
He believes that foreigners will continue to be attracted to the Finnish
market due to the improving domestic economy and the much stronger financial
performance of the country's big exporters. Mr Cleve also notes that
domestic interest in equities is high with interest rates at their lowest
levels for decades.
Even if privatisation does move faster this year, the programme is unlikely
to be concluded before the end of the decade. At the end of the process, the
state says it will only retain a direct holding in companies on grounds of
specific national interest.
The government has already indicated that it will start selling stakes in
companies itself - but not before it is satisfied that companies' balance
sheets are generally much stronger than they are today.

UAP shares

The French government will today start the next phase of its privatisation
programme by beginning the pre-placement, or marketing, of shares in Union
des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the insurance group.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, yesterday said that the price of
the issue would be announced within the next few weeks, with the timing of
the share sale being determined by market conditions.
The issue involves the sale of the state's 50 per cent holding in UAP, which
is valued at more than FFr25bn (Dollars 4bn), and a capital increase for the
company.
However, institutional investors can from today place uncommitted orders for
shares in UAP, France's biggest insurer. The group's employees will also be
allowed to reserve shares.
The economy ministry has already announced that it plans to allocate more
than 11 per cent of the shares to noyaux durs, or 'hard core' shareholders.

FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Alcatel, Pirelli in Stet sale
talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecommunications, energy and transport
company, is planning to join with Pirelli, the Italian tyres and cables
manufacturer, to participate in the privatisation of Stet, Italy's
state-owned telecoms group.
Alcatel said yesterday that it had 'responded favourably' to a proposition
by Pirelli that they should co-operate in the privatisation, but said no
formal alliance had yet been set up. Pirelli declined to comment.
The privatisation of Stet, 52 per cent of which belongs to IRI, the Italian
state holding company, is expected before the end of the year.
A spokesman for the French group said Alcatel was keen to expand in Italy,
where it is already the second largest supplier of telecommunications
equipment, in spite of current problems in the market.
However, it will be up to Italy's new government to finalise terms for the
privatisation, likely to be one of the biggest and most controversial in the
current series of sales.
In August, five of Italy's state-controlled telecoms operators will be
merged into a single company, Telecom Italia, which will be Stet's principal
asset. But the more sensitive question of the conditions for the sale of
IRI's stake has not yet been settled.
Mr Pierre Suard, Alcatel's chairman, has cited difficult conditions in Italy
and a fall in sales there as one of the reasons for an expected decline in
net profits this year. But a spokesman said that the downturn was largely
the result of economic conditions and that the market retained a strong
potential for growth.
An alliance with Pirelli would extend Alcatel's existing ties with Italian
industry.

FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Commerzbank operating profits up
25% to record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's Commerzbank yesterday announced an increase of 'around a quarter'
in 1993 operating profits, and unveiled plans for a DM400m (Dollars 233m)
capital increase as well as the issue of up to DM2bn-worth of convertible
bonds and profit-sharing certificates.
The bank, the last of the big three to report, also confirmed a
previously-promised DM2 a share dividend increase to DM12. The higher payout
signalled the bank's confidence for the current financial year, it said in a
statement, adding that only half the increase was attributable to a
reduction in corporate taxation rates.
No figures were given for operating profits after provisions for bad risks.
A 'sizeable amount' of operating income was used to bolster risk provisions,
which are not liable for tax, against domestic loans, the statement added.
Group net earnings were down sharply at DM586.4m compared with DM837.8m. A
spokesman said 1992 earnings at this level had been inflated by the
extraordinary gains from the consolidation of the group's Berlin business,
following the ending of the concessionary tax regime for businesses in the
city.
Statutory requirements meant all the Berliner Commerzbank's reserves had
been counted as profit.
The capital-raising moves, which were foreshadowed last year, followed a
DM500m equity rights issue and a DM800m issue of profit-sharing certificates
last year. Both measures would be valid until April 30 1999, the bank said
yesterday.
Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chairman, said last November that the money was
necessary to raise core capital, the basis for future lending growth, to 5
per cent of total assets from 4.6 per cent.
Full details of 1993's record results and the bank's performance so far in
the current year are due at a press conference on Friday.
As in the case of Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, which have already
reported operating profits up 16 per cent and 24 per cent respectively,
Commerzbank's own-account trading is expected to have returned markedly
improved earnings. After 10 months, profits from securities trading had more
than trebled.

FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Sabena swings BFr4.5bn into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sabena, the Belgian airline, yesterday became the latest European state
carrier to swing into the red when it announced a BFr4.5bn (Dollars 127m)
loss for 1993.
The loss at Sabena, which is 37.5 per cent owned by Air France, followed a
BFr6m profit the previous year.
The airline said about BFr1bn of the deficit was due to one-off
restructuring charges and staff redundancies which had been carried out the
previous year.
It insisted that the results were 'in line with the the objectives of the
plan developed in 1993'.
The other components of the loss, the company added, had been:
a BFr1.5bn reduction in turnover due to a fall in the number of flights to
Africa, one of Sabena's main destinations, as a result of political turmoil;
a BFr1bn loss due to the devaluation of eight European currencies during the
monetary turmoil last year;
a BFr1bn drop in revenue due to price wars between European, US and Asian
airlines.
Although it admitted that 1994 would be a difficult year, the company
insisted that it remained optimistic about the future. The restructuring
plan had already begun to take effect in the second half of 1993. Prices had
been stabilising and passenger numbers rising, resulting in a record number
of passengers carried last year, it said.
The loss had been widely expected, with industry observers in Brussels
predicting a loss of between BFr4.4bn and BFr4.7bn.
However, analysts warned that the result was likely to raise questions about
Sabena's longer term future. The Belgian government has pursued a fairly
generous policy towards its state carrier, but attempts to provide fresh
state aid are likely to be opposed by the European Commission, they pointed
out.

FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Flextech's new Dollars 30m fund for
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flextech, the former oil services company which turned itself into a media
group, is getting together with Hit Entertainment, the specialist programme
distributor, to create a Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.5m) fund to invest in
animated programmes.
The aim is to create a range of new animated titles - among the most
international of all programme genres - in the UK, continental Europe and
the US.
Discussions are already taking place with a number of banks.
And it is believed the fund could be in place within a matter of months.
The consortium that will run the operation is likely to be expanded to
include HTV, the ITV company for Wales and the West and an international
video distributor.
Flextech, the majority shareholder of which is TCI of Denver, the largest
cable operator in the US, recently bought a 20 per cent stake in HTV.
Hit, which specialises in the distribution of children's and wildlife
programmes, is already responsible for the distribution of HTV's nature
programme arm, Partridge Films.
In turn, Flextech has a 24 per cent stake in Hit - a company founded by Mr
Peter Orton, a former executive with Henson Associates, producer of The
Muppet Show.
Hit was also involved in raising pre-production finance for series such as
Shakespeare: the Animated Tales and The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends.
The aim is to use the fund to get new animated series off the ground backed
up by selling the rights in advance to a number of leading broadcasters
throughout the world.
The consortium will retain the right to sell the programmes in other parts
of the world.

FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: GWR to buy Mid Anglia for Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GWR, the expanding commercial radio group, has agreed terms for the
acquisition of Mid Anglia Radio.
Mid Anglia is an operator of four radio licences in Cambridgeshire and
Norfolk.
The offer, 0.53257 new GWR shares for every Mid Anglia share, values the
latter at 466p per share and the whole company at about Pounds 3.5m.
There is a cash alternative of 450p per share.
Irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer have been received in respect
of 378,456 shares, or 50.46 per cent of the equity.
Earlier this year, Bristol-based GWR paid Pounds 15m in cash and shares for
four radio companies in the Midlands.
The USM-traded group also owns a 17 per cent interest in Classic FM and a 48
per cent stake in Bulgaria's first independent radio station.
In the year to end-September 1993, GWR returned pre-tax profits of Pounds
913,000.
Turnover was Pounds 9.8m.
Earlier this month directors said revenues for the first half of the current
year were ahead strongly across the group.
They added that prospects for the remainder of the year 'remained positive'.
For the 12 months to September 30 1993, Mid Anglia incurred a deficit of
Pounds 12,186 before exceptional items on turnover of Pounds 2.14m.
Trading in the current year, however, had been 'more encouraging'.

FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Rentokil chief's Pounds 2.8m option profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive of Rentokil, the environmental and
property services group, made Pounds 2.83m on the exercise of options over
1.65m shares last April, according to the company's report and accounts.
The exercise lifted Mr Thompson's holding in Rentokil to 2.8m shares, which
was worth Pounds 6.5m at yesterday's close of 231p.
The chief executive has options over a further 2.1m shares at an average
exercise price of 86.47p. This entitlement has an intrinsic value of Pounds
1.82m.
The accounts showed that his remuneration last year fell from Pounds 707,000
to Pounds 658,000. Some 37.9 per cent of his package is accounted for by
incentive payments. Mr Thompson is also on the boards of Wellcome, Caradon,
Farepak, Royal Dutch Shell and Boots.

FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: AH Ball warns of impending loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AH Ball, the civil engineer, warned that trading in the year to end-March
1994 would result in a loss, and that it was doubtful it would pay a final
dividend.
The company said it had been adversely affected by losses incurred on two
period schedule and one specific contract.
The directors said that although they were confident that trading in the
group would recover satisfactorily in the current year, they felt it would
benefit from becoming part of a larger organisation.

FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Plotting a recovery course - Aer
Lingus's transatlantic strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aer Lingus is banking on a new fleet of European Airbus A330 twin-engine
widebody airliners to help return its lossmaking transatlantic routes to
profit this year.
Mr Bernie Cahill, the Irish national carrier's chairman, also said the group
would be back in the black in its financial year to April 1995, after
reporting a loss of about IPounds 55m (Pounds 53m) in the year just ended.
The airline's decision to lease three A330s this year to replace older
Boeing 747s is the latest element in its restructuring and recovery
strategy, which has involved the shedding of about 1,000 jobs in the airline
and associated companies during the past six months.
The airline's transatlantic services to New York and Boston have lost some
IPounds 30m during the past three years.
However, the new aircraft, the recent removal of the obligation for Aer
Lingus's transatlantic services from Dublin to stop at Shannon, and new
connections from UK regional airports to link up with the airline's new
non-stop services to the US, are all expected to help return the
transatlantic operation to profit.
Together with the Dublin to London shuttle services, the transatlantic
operations are an important revenue earner for Aer Lingus.
They accounted for about IPounds 120m of the airline's IPounds 500m revenues
for the year just ended, according to Mr Bob Challens, the commercial
director.
Mr Challens also said the airline would use its new Airbus fleet to develop
a fresh corporate image for the carrier, with plans later this year to
introduce a new livery for Aer Lingus.
The A330s will also give Aer Lingus greater operating flexibility and
efficiency than the older Boeing, he added.
Mr Cahill said his airline had been able to negotiate attractive lease terms
for its new A330 fleet from ILFC, the California-based aircraft leasing
group.
'It's a perfect time to do a deal, with low interest rates and a lot of
aircraft available in the market,' he added.
Aer Lingus is also continuing to explore a commercial alliance with Delta
Air Lines to strengthen the reach of its transatlantic services into the
domestic US market.
However, Mr Challens said he did not expect any agreement soon with Delta,
and that the Irish carrier's priority was to make its current operations
profitable.
'Our ultimate target is to have a healthy balance sheet in two years' time.
I think we will achieve this, and we are already ahead of our targets,' Mr
Cahill said.
As a sign of the im-proved confidence in the airline's financial fortunes,
Mr Cahill said two Irish banks - the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks
 -had restored the credit facilities they had withdrawn at the height of the
airline's financial crisis.
'Our strategy now is to turn our existing operations into a profitable base,
and then we will feel out the next step. We see any future expansion in
co-operation with other carriers,' Mr Cahill added.
Aer Lingus recently secured a IPounds 175m support package from the Irish
government, its shareholder, to back its financial recovery strategy
involving an immediate IPounds 75m injection and two subsequent injections
of IPounds 50m over the next two years.
Although this aid package was cleared by the European Commission, Aer Lingus
has since been attacked by Ryanair, its smaller Irish competitor, for
uncompetitive behaviour.
The Commission is now investigating a complaint by Ryanair against the
national carrier, which claims there are no grounds for the complaint.

purchase

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A significant European acquisition is looming at Fyffes, the fresh fruit and
vegetable distributor, which will provide a strong boost to its banana sales
in the continental market.
Speaking after the company's annual meeting in Dublin yesterday, Mr Carl
McCann, finance director, said that a due diligence process was under way
with a European fruit distribution company, and that several other
medium-sized acquisition opportunities were being considered.
He expected 'as much as half' of the group's IPounds 92m (Pounds 89m) cash
hoard would be spent on acquisitions by the end of the year.
The group is aiming to sell 27m boxes of bananas this year, up from 18m in
1993, with 7m of the increase targeted for Europe. If the acquisitions were
to fall through, however, the company might face difficulties reaching the
target.
Interest income is projected to fall to IPounds 6m this year, from IPounds
9.6m which contributed 30 per cent of 1993 pre-tax profits.
Two acquisitions last year in Spain and Denmark cost IPounds 12m. They will
increase turnover by IPounds 150m in a full year.

FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Leisure behind Gowrings' gain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gowrings, the motor trading and leisure company, reported a turnround from
losses of Pounds 82,000 to profits of Pounds 251,000 pre-tax in the 1993
year.
The result was achieved on higher turnover of Pounds 54.5m (Pounds 52.2m)
and helped by a lower interest charge of Pounds 489,000 (Pounds 718,000) and
higher exceptional credits of Pounds 157,000 (Pounds 42,000).
There was continued sustained growth in the leisure division, particularly
food services. However, the motor side saw severe pressure on margins
resulting in lower profits.
Earnings per share were 2.29p (losses 1.4p) and an unchanged final dividend
of 1p is proposed for a maintained total of 2p.
The company is selling a mobile home park near Oxford for Pounds 825,100,
against a book value of Pounds 1.01m. It was originally acquired for Pounds
383,000 and in 1993 generated net profits of Pounds 6,000.

FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Greenacre's rise to Pounds 1.7m helped by
purchases
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In a year in which its operations 'grew significantly' Greenacre, the
USM-traded nursing home operator, reported profits up by a quarter and
announced a 20 per cent increase in its annual dividend.
On turnover up from Pounds 4.82m to Pounds 7.44m, pre-tax profits for the
year to end-January grew by Pounds 342,500 to Pounds 1.7m. The proposed
final dividend of 0.18p raises the total to 0.33p (0.28p) - covered more
than twice by earnings of 0.72p (0.57p).
The advance was boosted by acquisitions, which added Pounds 1.04m to
turnover and Pounds 369,958 to operating profit.
Almost 170 beds were added during the period - the company now operates 12
homes with a total of 578 beds.
During the year further mortgage borrowings were contracted to finance
development and acquisitions and net borrowings at the year-end were Pounds
4.24m, giving gearing of 31 per cent.

FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Trafalgar House sells Dukes Hotel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House has sold the smallest of its three London hotels, the
64-room Dukes Hotel in St James Park. The price was not disclosed, but it is
understood to be at a small premium to the property's book value of some
Pounds 10m.
Dukes has been sold to Franklin Hotels, which already owns the Egerton House
and Franklin Hotel in Knightsbridge. The hotel had been up for sale for some
time.
It is understood that initial discussions have also taken place for the sale
of Trafalgar's Stafford Hotel, but its flagship property, the Ritz, was
taken off the market last year, as offers did not come close to 'acceptable'
levels.
Franklin's acquisition has been accompanied by a financial restructuring
undertaken with Hambro European Ventures.
As a result, Hambro will emerge with a 75 per cent stake in the enlarged
hotel company. Mr Jeremy Hand, of Hambro, said the enlarged Franklin group
would have Pounds 24m in debt and equity financing (the founders retain 25
per cent).

FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: London and Manchester sharply ahead to
Pounds 33.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London and Manchester, the life assurance and financial services group,
announced pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 23.4m to Pounds 33.4m over the
1993 year, helped by a sharp turnaround in non-core activities.
These non-insurance businesses - covering areas such as consumer finance,
mort-gage lending and a property agency - contributed Pounds 2.5m, against
losses of Pounds 6.5m last time.
The greatest change was in the mortgage business, which achieved trading
profits of Pounds 846,000 (losses of Pounds 3.7m), despite a Pounds 300,000
increase to Pounds 9.7m in provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
Profits from insurance activities, including a transfer of Pounds 20.6m from
the life revenue account, came to Pounds 32m: comparable figures last time
were Pounds 19.3m and Pounds 30.7m. Within this area, however, there was a
fall of 25 per cent in new industrial branch business, where premiums are
collected weekly from customers' homes.
While there was a 40 per cent rise in new regular premium business won by
the direct sales force, which operates from the 37-branch network
established in 1992, there was a drop of almost one third in regular premium
new business through firms acting as appointed representatives.
Mr Tom Pyne, chief executive, said the reduction was largely because ties
had been broken with a number of companies, either because the amount of
business generated was not worth the investment by the group, or because the
group was not satisfied with the standards of selling. Appointed
representatives now number about 200 - against a maximum of 600 - though the
group intended to rebuild the total.
A final dividend of 10.56p is recommended, taking the total to 15.68p
(14.25p). Earnings per share rose to 20.49p (14.3p).

FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Exports prompt leap at Dinkie Heel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Dinkie Heel, the footwear component manufacturer, more
than trebled from Pounds 201,000 to Pounds 649,000 for the 1993 year.
Turnover from continuing operations expanded 11 per cent to Pounds 7.4m
(Pounds 6.67m) while exports continued to rise with a 38 per cent gain.
Directors pointed out that exports accounted for 30 per cent of total
turnover. Sales to the Americas virtually doubled in 1993 and at Pounds
739,000, 'this now represents the company's largest export market'.
Earnings per share were 3.84p, compared with 1.31p, and the dividend is
lifted to 1.4p (0.95p) with a final of 0.9p.
Sales in the UK benefited from increased sales of toe caps and of 'the more
robust styles of rubber sole units which have been very fashionable',
directors said.
Trading results for the 1994 first quarter were encouraging, they added.

FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Reconstruction boosts Orb
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial reconstruction at Orb Estates helped the property company,
formerly known as Ossory Estates, report pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.23m for
the six months to end-December, against losses of Pounds 19.8m.
The result was helped by an exceptional credit of Pounds 10.3m, being the
elimination of subsidiaries in receivership, settlement with trade creditors
and the write-back of liabilities to banks.
There were also lower amounts written off properties and investments of
Pounds 897,000 (Pounds 8.74m) and interest charges of Pounds 2.5m (Pounds
9.94m).
Turnover was Pounds 4.04m, against Pounds 8.89m, which included Pounds 1.5m
from discontinued activities. Operating profits on continuing activities
were Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 1.77m).
The company said full benefits of the reconstruction were still to take
effect. Court permission for the reduction of the deficit on the profit and
loss account by Pounds 48m to Pounds 25m was received on February 18. A
revaluation of the assets will take place at the June 30 year end.
Earnings per share were 9.12p (losses 21.82p). Adjusting for the effect of
the reconstruction and taking into account the share issue, losses per share
were 0.16p.

FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Alpha Airports meets target - Current
trading up to expectations and joint venture formed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alpha Airports Group, the airline catering company floated by Forte in
February, matched its prospectus forecast with a 19 per cent increase in
operating profits to Pounds 20.6m.
Pre-tax profits, struck on pro forma turnover ahead 5 per cent to Pounds
423.3m, rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 19.2m.
Mr Richard Gold, finance director, said Alpha was optimistic about the
current year in light of an expected 4 to 5 per cent increase in the number
of airline passengers in the UK. 'We have got a strong UK market this year,'
he said. 'There has been quite an increase, particularly in the charter
market.' Current trading was 'well up to expectations'.
The group also announced the first of two joint ventures promised at the
time of flotation. It is joining forces with British West Indian Airways at
Trinidad's Piarco airport, paying Pounds 700,000 cash for a 40 per cent
stake in Airline Caterers, Piarco's sole caterer, which last year generated
sales of Pounds 3m.
Mr Gold said Alpha hoped to announce a second joint venture within the next
three months.
The company also opened two new kitchens, in the US and Manchester. Capital
expenditure during the year came to about Pounds 12m.
Net debt rose from Pounds 9.6m to Pounds 28.8m, representing 82 per cent of
shareholders' funds. Mr Gold said gearing should be reduced to between 50
and 60 per cent by the end of this year.
The strongest performance came from the airport retailing business, which
increased operating profits by 40 per cent to Pounds 5.9m; sales were 3 per
cent higher at Pounds 213.5m.
Mr Gold said this division would benefit from the expansion plans of airport
operators. 'We will see quite an abnormal increase over the next few years
in the UK marketplace,' he said.
The airline catering division increased operating profits by 12 per cent to
Pounds 14.7m on sales ahead 6 per cent to Pounds 209.8m.
Notional earnings per share were up 32 per cent on a pro forma basis at
8.89p. The company warned that the earnings figure related to Alpha as part
of Forte and might not reflect the level generated as an independent
company.
The first dividend will be paid at the interim stage. Forte received Pounds
33.5m in dividends last year.

FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Weisfelds give Brown Jackson cash injection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The millionaire couple who created What Everyone Wants, the discounting
chain now owned by WEW Group, have come to the rescue of rival Brown &amp;
Jackson, which has been in talks with bankers and potential investors for
the last three weeks.
Mr Gerald and Mrs Vera Weisfeld, and a charitable trust which they founded,
are injecting Pounds 6m to meet immediate working capital needs in return
for a 19 per cent stake and two seats on the board.
They will have options on a further 298.8m shares at 7 1/2 p, which with the
3m shares they already own would bring their holding to 41.46 per cent for a
total investment of about Pounds 28m. Brown's shares closed yesterday 1 1/2
p higher at 4 1/2 p.
The investment is the Weisfelds' first business venture since they
unexpectedly left Amber Day, as WEW was known then, just eight months after
selling WEW to the quoted company for Pounds 47m in 1990. Since then, the
Weisfelds, who sold their 15 per cent stake in Amber Day for Pounds 11m,
have devoted most of their time to charity work.
Mr Weisfeld said he was confident he and his wife could add value to the
Poundstretcher business of Brown &amp; Jackson. 'This is where our
entrepreneurial flair lies,' he said. The couple built their Scottish-based
discount fashion retailer into a Pounds 75m business over 20 years.
The Weisfelds will be appointed non-executive directors on a salary of
Pounds 15,000. They will also act as consultants to Brown &amp; Jackson for a
daily rate of Pounds 500, or a maximum of Pounds 25,000. No other changes to
the board are expected in the immediate future.
The proposals are subject to the Takeover Panel waiving the requirement for
the Weisfelds to make a general offer to shareholders once their stake
breaches 29.9 per cent.
Brown &amp; Jackson has been struggling to recover since the Pounds 16m rescue
rights issue which brought in new management in 1992. However, poorer than
expected trading at Christmas led to a profits warning in January. Last
month the group announced losses of Pounds 12.7m for 1993, against
expectations before the warning of a Pounds 4m deficit.
In light of the losses, banks refused to agree working capital facilities of
Pounds 14m to fund peak demands in September.
Brown &amp; Jackson said in its statement yesterday that trading had improved
with like-for-like sales in the 13 weeks to April 2 about 1 per cent ahead.
The company now hopes to complete the sale and leaseback of a group of
properties and asset disposals which will raise Pounds 9.3m. These
transactions were delayed by the difficulties with the banks.
Mr Ian Gray, chief executive, said Brown &amp; Jackson had been negotiating with
several possible investors, including Pepcor, the South African retailer.
However, pressure from trade creditors meant a deal had to be concluded
quickly.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As forecast, Wakebourne, the computer support concern, suffered pre-tax
losses for 1993 of Pounds 18.6m, largely reflecting the write-off in the
Lantek Electronics investment.
The outcome was from turnover of Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 24.2m), including
discontinued activities of Pounds 958,000 (Pounds 18.2m), and compared with
profits of Pounds 453,000 for 1992. Losses per share were 3.6p, against 0.1p
earnings.
Directors said that, in contrast, the UK computer support side, which makes
up the principal trading activity, recorded operating profits during 1993 of
Pounds 2.6m excluding discontinued activities.

FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Bilton shares fall 39p on downward property
valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Bilton, the property and construction company, yesterday fell 39p
to 590p after the company announced an 11 per cent drop in the value of its
property investment portfolio.
The downward valuation came in spite of the fact that companies have been
reporting a sharp improvement in the UK property investment market.
The announcement accompanied Bilton's results for 1993, with the company
reporting pre-tax profits of Pounds 17.4m, up from Pounds 17.1m in 1992.
The mark-down of Bilton's property values was the result of its first
external valuation since 1989. Bilton had announced consistent increases
from internal valuations in the previous three years, despite an
unequivocally falling market. King Sturge, the chartered surveyors, valued
Bilton's 7m sq ft portfolio at Pounds 312.2m, compared with a valuation of
Pounds 352m in December 1992. There have been no material changes in the
portfolio.
Net asset value per share amounted to 643p (739p).
Group turnover from trading activities fell from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds
9.1m, reflecting competitive market conditions.
Profit on ordinary activities at the trading level fell to Pounds 20m
(Pounds 20.5m), but net interest payable was reduced to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds
3.42m). The company did not release its balance sheet yes-terday, but
gearing is expected to have increased marginally from the 13 per cent
recorded in 1992.
Earnings per share emerged at 27.3p (26.8p) and the directors proposed a
final dividend of 13.61p, making 19.28p (18.9p) for the year.

FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: A primary target for the 1990s - The
growing number of companies focusing on Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There may be an element of companies offering a relative bright spot amid
the Occidental economic gloom, but one of the most notable themes of the
recent UK reporting season has been the focus on investment and trade in
Asia.
Hanson is to set up in Hong Kong, Virgin Megastores will appear in Hong Kong
and China, and a host of UK companies have identified the fastest growing
economic zones of the 1980s as their primary target for the 1990s.
British exports to Asia (excluding the Middle East and Australasia) rose 29
per cent to Pounds 12.8bn last year, while the book value of direct
investment increased by 30 per cent to Pounds 11.5bn in 1992 - the latest
figures available.
Some British companies have long histories in Asia, but as Mr Peter Godwin,
chairman of the Asia Pacific Advisory group, says, this has tended to focus
on the old colonies of India, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong. These four
markets accounted for 44 per cent of exports to Asia last year.
There are many more which have not been struck by the Asia Syndrome, of
multiplying sales by this untapped half of the world's population.
Mr Charles MacKay, chief executive of Inchcape, a company with centuries of
experience in Asia, said: 'The big companies have been in Asia for some
time, but many of the small and medium-sized British companies have
concentrated on Europe. Now, with the fall-back in Europe, they are saying
that they must do something to develop Asian markets.'
On his visit to Japan and Malaysia last September, Mr John Major, the prime
minister, outlined the government's determination 'to give Asia a new place
in our priorities'. Corporate Britain is responding.
Mr John Fletcher, chairman of Trafalgar House Corporate Development, said:
'It is disappointing that there isn't more British involvement in Asia. In
some major markets, like Taiwan, you don't see any other major British
engineering or construction companies.'
Trafalgar House has completed the twin 190m high towers that will support
Hong Kong's Tsing Ma suspension bridge. It will be the second longest in the
world and a monument to British engineering skill - but Trafalgar admits
that it remains a relatively isolated example.
Trafalgar's involvement in Asia began in 1983, when it bought 50 per cent of
Jardine Matheson's construction arm, Gammon Construction. By September 1993,
Trafalgar had Pounds 605m of contracts in hand in the Asia Pacific, or 54
per cent of its total. Mr Fletcher said: 'We need to be in areas where there
are big populations and expanding economies. I would like Asia to account
for one third of turnover from construction and engineering (its two core
businesses) within the next few years.'
Tarmac opened an office in Hong Kong last year and other construction
companies are following, but Mr Fletcher said competition was predominantly
with Japanese, German and local companies, not the British.
Mr Clive Weedon, research director at regional brokers Asia Equity, argues:
'British companies are coming a little late. They also don't seem to be
coming with the same level of commitment as the US companies, and they can't
build up the same relationships as other Asian companies.'
In many cases, however, the timing is excusable. Given the distances
involved, companies could be forgiven for avoiding a complex and fragmented
marketplace, until it has built up critical mass in terms of spending power.
According to Mr John Robinson, chief executive at Smith and Nephew, the
healthcare company, the time has now come. 'In the healthcare sector, we
require markets with a certain level of GNP. Most of these south-east Asian
economies are only just getting there,' he said.
In 1993, Smith and Nephew's sales to east Asia, including Japan, grew by 30
per cent to Pounds 50m, representing 5 per cent of its Pounds 949m turnover.
Mr Robinson anticipates that it will hit 30 per cent of the total within the
next decade.
'The Chinese healthcare market is already the fifth largest in the world,
and we don't think it is developed. I would have thought it will be worth
between Pounds 35m and Pounds 50m to us by the end of the decade and it will
take off thereafter. At the moment we are selling virtually nothing there.'
Smith and Nephew plans to expand by setting up a network of wholly owned
sales and marketing offices, rather than taking on joint venture partners.
It will also manufacture some basic products. This was its strategy for
continental Europe in the 1980s and that market now accounts for 20 per cent
of sales.
Other companies have opted to team up with distribution companies.
Inchcape - which derives around half its operating profits from Asia - has
franchises to manufacture and sell an enormous variety of western brand name
products. Mr MacKay said there had been a marked increase in British
companies wanting to sell into Asia.
'British companies have become a lot more competitive in recent years. Four
or five years ago, we were selling a handful of Rovers in Hong Kong. Today,
it has become a very successful franchise,' he said.
He argued that the Asian economies would achieve average annual growth of
about 6 per cent over the next six years, and some, like China, would be
much greater. Even in a strong upswing, the western economies were unlikely
to achieve half that.
This has been a big motivation. British Petroleum is a substantial investor
in oil exploration in Vietnam, Imperial Chemical Industries has opened
chemical plants in Japan and China, and GEC, through its joint venture with
Alsthom, has become a force in power and engineering throughout the region.
Recent threats of discrimination against UK companies by the governments of
Malaysia and China have raised some concern over the downside of investment
in Asia. Thus far the only casualties are likely to be high profile
engineering projects, not British brand name product sales.
Trafalgar is set to lose contracts under tender in Malaysia, but existing
contracts should stretch on for another four to five years. Mr Fletcher said
its John Brown subsidiary is working on a Pounds 1.5bn contract to build a
petrochemicals complex for Petronas, the state oil company.
In China, Trafalgar's 25 per cent ownership by Hong Kong Land - a member of
arguably China's least favourite group of companies, Jardine Matheson -
might be expected to hamper business. However, it has just picked up another
Dollars 50m (Pounds 34m) contract for the steel industry.
Mr Godwin claims there is no evidence of British companies facing
discrimination in China and political stances appear to be softening.
Analysts said that British companies with a technological edge or strong
brand names can generally eke out higher profit margins than in the UK,
despite the logistical costs of dealing with a distant continent. This
should compensate for short-term problems.
As one Hong Kong businessman said: 'In Asia, one doesn't tend to have
enemies for too long, and one has to take a long-term view of the markets.'

FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: QS optimistic despite reduction to Pounds
5.25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QS Holdings, the discount retailer which saw its shares plunge by more than
20 per cent following a profits warning last July, was optimistic yesterday
in spite of a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 8.47m to Pounds
5.25m. The shares closed 7p lower at 228p.
Mr Marc Walters, chairman, said there had been a strong improvement in
second half sales, which was expected to continue into this year.
The first six months had been particularly difficult, with customers both
cautious and extremely value conscious. Margins had declined as a result.
Sales rose 14 per cent to Pounds 58.1m for the year to January 28. Some 14
new stores were opened, making a total of 99 including the two launched
since the year end. Mr Walters said this had been funded from cash
resources, which stood at a net Pounds 5.7m at the year-end.
'We will continue to pursue our plan for controlled expansion,' Mr Walters
said, 'aiming for further growth in retail sales.'
The final dividend is 3.63p for a maintained total of 5.19p. Earnings fell
from 14.22p to 8.49p.

FT  12 APR 94 / Burmah gains from scrip payout policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Burmah Castrol rose 11p to to 826p after the UK lubricants,
chemicals and fuel group announced its second successive enhanced scrip
dividend.
The group also said it would be interested in using the foreign income
dividend (FID) scheme introduced in last year's budgets.
Burmah's 1993 pre-tax profits increased 18 per cent to Pounds 193.8m, while
profit after tax and minorities rose 39 per cent to Pounds 102.7m. The group
said the results were pleasing given the difficult trading conditions in
Europe and Japan.
Mr Jonathan Fry, chief executive, said volumes and market shares improved in
most businesses. 'We significantly increased our spend on marketing and
technology, particularly in Castrol, while focusing on reducing
manufacturing and administrative overheads in chemicals.'
Burmah is recommending a final dividend of 11p, giving a total cash dividend
of 27.5p (25.25p). The board intends to offer a second enhanced share
alternative, again at a 50 per cent premium, in order to alleviate further
the company's advance corporation tax (ACT) problem. Companies which earn
most of their profits overseas suffer when their corporation tax liability
is insufficient to offset their ACT liability on dividends.
Assuming an uptake for the second ehanced scrip scheme similar to the 92 per
cent achieved for the interim dividend, Burmah said its ACT payable this
year would be reduced by about Pounds 4.5m and earnings per share improved
by some 2p.
The FID scheme was introduced to help companies with an ACT problem. It
allows them to pay a dividend out of foreign income, which they must remit
to the UK, and in effect avoid paying ACT on the dividend. BAT Industries,
the UK tobacco and insurance group, has already opted to use the scheme.
Burmah's lubricants business increased operating profits by 22 per cent to
Pounds 155.4m, helped by a favourable exchange rate and record marketing
expenditure, as well as a strong performance in North America and newly
deregulated India.
Chemicals increased operating profits by 8 per cent to Pounds 36.7m, but the
metallurgical businesses acquired with Foseco in 1990 continued to suffer
from depressed foundry markets. Burmah has closed nine former Foseco plants
and shed nearly 400 jobs. It expected this rationalisation to benefit
profits from now on.
Mr Fry said that before Burmah looked to make any further chemicals
acquisitions, it would want to ensure that all doubts about the Foseco
purchase were laid to rest.
Mr Lawrence Urquhart, chairman, said: 'So far this year, trading has been
encouraging, but it would be rash at this juncture to count on a swift
economic recovery in Europe and Japan.'
Earnings per share rose 35 per cent to 53.9p (33.9p).

FT  12 APR 94 / Bankers propose guidelines on derivatives: International
task force tackles issue of disclosing credit risk in complex markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of leading bankers will shortly produce a new framework for the
disclosure to regulators of credit risk in the derivatives markets.
The framework, which should be finalised within two months, will require
banks and securities houses to break down their exposure in the derivatives
markets by counterparty and by type of instrument.
The growth of derivatives products, such as futures and options, has caused
concern that banks may not be fully aware of the risks involved in dealing
in these complex markets. The Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) losses incurred last
year by the German oils and metals company Metallgesellschaft in oil
derivatives heightened fears that such losses might cause a breakdown in the
market.
Last year, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, then general manager of the Bank for
International Settlements, called for the drawing up of international
standards on risk disclosure for banks dealing in derivatives. Mr Lamfalussy
said that derivatives had reduced the transparency of bank balance sheets
and an International Monetary Fund study said derivatives had 'made it
extremely difficult' for regulators to assess the risk of default in the
system.
The new proposals have been drawn up by 15 of the world's largest players in
the derivatives market. They are members of a task force set up by the
Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based research and lobbying
group financed by 170-plus member banks from more than 40 countries.
The task force, formed last autumn, has already discussed its work
informally with regulators. Mr Charles Dallara, managing director of the
institute, said regulators had given 'an informal welcome to our efforts and
think we are headed in the right direction'.
Under the proposed framework, regulators will receive quarterly reports from
banks and securities houses. It is hoped the system will allow them to spot
when banking groups have become over-exposed to one particular counterparty.
Once the details of the new framework have been agreed by task force
members, Mr Dallara will talk to regulators about putting the proposals into
practice. While banks will not have a legal requirement to use the new
framework to report their credit risk, it is hoped that, if the leading
players use the system, other market participants will fall into line.
The task force's proposals deal only with credit risk, the danger that a
counterparty will fail to meet its debts. The topic of market risk - the
danger that sharp price moves may undermine the financial position of a
market participant - was not examined. However, Mr Dallara said the
institute hoped the task force would move on to deal with that question as
well.

FT  12 APR 94 / Forte and Accor fight for Meridien
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Forte, the UK hotels group, and Accor, the French travel group, are vying
for control of the Meridien Hotels chain, owned by Air France, the
loss-making state-owned airline.
Kempinksi, the German group, has also expressed interest in acquiring the
luxury hotels business.
The offer period for bids for the French hotel group closed last night and a
decision is expected to be announced following an Air France board meeting
on April 28. Air France, which holds a 57 per cent stake in the luxury
Meridien chain, is seeking to sell all or part of its holding in the hotel
operation as part of a restructuring package. The airline, which lost an
estimated FFr7.5bn (Pounds 870m) last year, has debts of about FFr38bn.
Officials at Air France and the prospective purchasers declined to comment
on the terms of their offers. But Forte is thought to have made the highest
bid with an offer that values Meridien at about FFr1.8bn. As it is not yet
clear what percentage of Meridien will be sold, the eventual cost of a
successful Forte bid could be considerably less.
Forte earlier this year failed in its attempt to gain control of Ciga, the
Italian luxury hotel group. ITT Sheraton, of the US, topped Forte's Pounds
270m bid for Ciga with an offer of L900bn (Pounds 376m).
Accor, which is seeking to merge its luxury Sofitel chain with Meridien's 58
hotels, is thought to have made a cash offer for 40 per cent of the group,
which values the whole of Meridien at about FFr1.4bn. Industry analysts in
Paris said that Accor may have to raise new capital to finance such a deal.
Accor's proposal is also thought to emphasise the benefits to Air France
that could flow from wider ticket distribution through its travel agency
chain, and from the combination of Accor's business travel activities with
those of Carlson, of the US.
Kempinksi, the third possible bidder, has been linked with Meridien before.
In 1992, Lufthansa, the German airline, which then held a 42.6 per cent
stake in Kempinksi, called off plans to merge the chain with Meridien.
Lufthansa subsequently sold part of its stake in Kempinksi to Advanta
management, a German investment group.

FT  12 APR 94 / Ice packs form a useful buffer: The oil majors' Russian
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The need to operate in extreme temperatures in some of the most desolate and
isolated areas of the world is an occupational hazard of the international
oil industry. Sometimes, however, such isolation has its advantages.
Yesterday three US oil majors, Texaco, Exxon and Amoco, along with Norsk
Hydro of Norway, announced a joint venture to assess and develop the oil
reserves of the vast Timan Pechora basin within European Russia's Arctic
Circle. Tens of billions of dollars will eventually be needed to develop the
reserves, which the companies conservatively put at 2bn barrels and which
Russian experts believe exceed 5bn barrels.
Texaco, which began studying the region in 1990, acknowledged that the
project posed an 'enormous logistical challenge' in an area that Mr Peter
Bijur, senior vice-president, described as 'desolate, cold tundra'.
The proposed sea terminal - the first in arctic Russia - will have to
withstand extensive ice packs. The special shuttle tankers that the partners
envisage using to get the oil to a warmer trans-shipment point will have to
be strong enough to break their way through the ice.
But the very isolation and hostile environment of Timan Pechora may mean
that the consortium will be able to avoid many of the political problems
which have dogged so many western oil projects in Russia.
The absence of a well developed oil infrastructure, such as the one in
Siberia, means there is no 'single, strong local oil company' of the type
which has hindered some other western projects, according to Mr Thane
Gustafson, a Washington-based analyst with Cambridge Energy Research
Associates.
The consortium will have a service contract with Arkhangelskgeologica, a
local company which has drilled 130 wells in the area, but there will be no
direct Russian equity participation.
Mr Gustafson also points out that the consortium intends to build a
dedicated export terminal on the Pechora Sea, thus eliminating dependence on
the often clogged Russian oil transportation system or the need to arrange
swaps through Transneft, the Russian monopoly oil transporter.
The political sensitivity of a foreign consortium having full control of
such a large export project is lessened by the fact that the Russian
industry lacks the financial and technological ability to tackle the scheme,
which is likely to be in production for up to 50 years.
The consortium has not been entirely free from the political uncertainty
which surrounds foreign involvement in Russia's oil industry. 'It has been a
tortured route' to secure the necessary approvals for the project, according
to Mr Bijur. Expert committees have spent three years reviewing the project,
and negotiations are still going on with the Ministry of Fuel and Energy
over the details of a production sharing contract.
The partners are also seeking approval from the Russian parliament.
Meanwhile, assessment work will continue.

FT  12 APR 94 / Property yields fall back below gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp recovery in the commercial property investment market over recent
months has pushed property yields below gilt yields for the first time since
1992.
Property yields, the ratio of income to capital value, have fallen at the
fastest pace on record since institutions returned to the property market in
force last summer. Since the market's turning point last June, property
values have risen by about 25 per cent, according to Hillier Parker,
chartered surveyors.
The Hillier Parker figures show that property yields fell from 9.2 per cent
in May 1993 to 7.3 per cent at the start of this month, when long-dated gilt
yields stood at about 8 per cent.
The cross-over of bond and property yields marks a new phase in the recovery
of the property market. Until recently, investors principally bought
property for the strength of its existing income, rather than for its
potential rental growth. The property market was largely driven by movements
in the bond markets, rather than the strength of tenants' demand for
buildings.
The re-emergence of a reverse yield gap between property and gilts suggests
that investors are sufficiently optimistic about the prospects for rental
growth to compensate for the extra costs and risks involved in owning
property, compared with gilts.
Average rents appear to have stabilised, after falling nearly 5 per cent in
the year to February, according to Hillier Parker. Most agents expect rental
growth to begin towards the end of the year.
Mr Russell Schiller, head of research at Hillier Parker, believed the
decline in property yields had diluted the argument for buying property. He
expected the market to plateau, as more property owners tried to sell and
investors' enthusiasm for buying property cooled.
In particular, investors are showing less interest in properties which have
poor prospects for rental growth because existing leases require tenants to
pay above-market rents. Hillier Parker expected the value of properties of
this type, particularly poorly located City office blocks, to fall by 10-15
per cent.
However, the large sums of money earmarked for property by institutions and
property companies is likely to continue to drive up the value of good
quality property, say many agents. The institutions, which spent more than
Pounds 1bn on commercial property in the last quarter of last year, are
still bidding up prices for properties which have good prospects of rental
growth.
The cross-over of gilt and property yields marks the end of the first period
since the 1960s when investors demanded higher yields from property than
from gilts. This reflected the property surplus following the surge in
construction at the end of the 1980s, weak demand from new occupiers and the
high risk of tenant default.

FT  12 APR 94 / Looming tax rises fail to dim signs of recovery: Consumer
loans up - Building outlook good
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rise in consumer borrowing and an optimistic forecast for the construction
industry indicated yesterday that the pace of UK economic recovery is being
maintained.
Net lending to consumers rose to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 277m in
February - compared with the Pounds 250m predicted by economists - from
Pounds 235m in January, the Central Statistical Office said.
It had been feared that lending, which had fallen in January from December's
high levels, would continue to decline as the April deadline for the tax
rises approached. The February increase was due mainly to a rise in net
lending by finance houses, largely responsible for hire-purchase agreements,
which rose to Pounds 283m from Pounds 255m in January.
Further good news for the economy came from the National Council of Building
Material Producers, which published the most optimistic forecast for
construction output since 1989.
The council, representing companies with a combined annual turnover of more
than Pounds 30bn, predicted that output, measured in constant 1990 prices,
would rise by 2 per cent this year, and by 2.5 per cent in each of 1995 and
1996.
The growth was forecast to be led by private-sector house building and a
better performance than expected from commercial construction.
The Treasury welcomed the credit figures. Officials said consumer borrowing
was still high and remained consistent with a continuing upward trend of
spending by consumers.
Two other reports published yesterday showed borrowing by consumers holding
up well. Both the Finance and Leasing Association, whose figures are taken
from a wider base than those provided by the CSO, and Infolink, a credit
information organisation, reported a strong increase in borrowing in
February compared with the year before.
However, the CSO's figures showed that in the three months to February, net
lending to consumers fell to Pounds 937m from Pounds 1.077bn in the previous
three months, suggesting that the underlying trend was now downwards, in
spite of February's rise.
This more pessimistic assessment of the health of the British consumer is
supported by the fall in retail sales growth to 2.5 per cent in February,
the slowest year-on-year rate since May 1993, and by a Gallup poll
suggesting that consumer confidence dropped to a four-year low in March.
The CSO said new credit advanced to consumers - leaving debt repayment out
of account - rose to a new monthly record of Pounds 5.01bn in February from
Pounds 4.74bn in January. The rise in new credit advanced was due to an
increase in the use of Visa and Mastercard credit cards and to increased new
lending by finance houses.
Repayment of building society loans fell to Pounds 6m from Pounds 14m in
January. The amount of credit outstanding on bank credit cards was unchanged
after a small repayment in January.

FT  12 APR 94 / Portugal moves to boost role of small investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal announced measures to promote 'popular capitalism' and draw small
investors into the country's privatisation programme yesterday.
Mr Eduardo Catroga, finance minister, said the government planned to sell
shares in state-owned companies to small savers more cheaply than to
companies or institutional investors. The move is aimed at bringing greater
liquidity to the Portuguese bourse.
In a related move, designed to enhance the competitiveness of its banking
system, Portugal is to cut compulsory cash reserves for commercial banks
from 17 per cent to below 3 per cent of selected liabilities.
The move, announced by the central bank, applies to reserves levied on the
banks' total deposits and treasury bills, excluding their offshore deposits,
and is likely to take effect before the end of this month.
The estimated Es2,000bn (Pounds 7.8bn) of banking liquidity that will be
released will be absorbed by an issue of special central bank bonds, in the
hope of preventing a sharp fall in short-term interest rates.
A Lisbon banker said: 'The central bank is being careful to ensure that
there will be little impact either on liquidity or interest rates, otherwise
the changes would blow the whole interest rate system out of the water.'
Mr Catroga said that in privatising companies considered strategic to the
economy, the state would maintain a majority of the capital or a 'golden
share', giving it veto rights over company decisions.
Leading privatisations planned for 1994 and 1995 include the sale of
minority stakes in Cimpor, a cement producer, Electricidade de Portugal, a
power producer and distributor, and Portugal Telecom, a telecommunications
operator to be formed from the merger of three existing companies.
'In the case of Cimpor, telecommunications and EDP, it is out of the
question the state could lose control', Mr Catroga said.
Portugal's centre-right government has said it plans to sell up to 30 per
cent of BFE, the trade bank, but hinted for the first time at the sale of
minority stakes in two other financial sector companies, BNU and Fidelidade.
'The state must still retain a strong position in the financial system, but
this does not mean that we cannot disperse the capital of one or two
companies such as Banco de Fomento, BNU or Fidelidade', Mr Catroga said.
Private Portuguese investors were not big enough to buy majority stakes, he
said.

FT  12 APR 94 / Air France wins workers' support for rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Air France workers voted overwhelmingly yesterday in favour of a rescue
package, securing an important victory for Mr Christian Blanc, the chairman,
in his attempt to restructure the state-owned carrier.
Air France said a ballot of the company's 40,000 staff had shown that 81 per
cent of those who voted were in favour of the package. More than 80 per cent
of employees voted.
Acceptance of the plan will clear the way for an injection of FFr20bn
(Pounds 2.34bn) of state capital over the next three years. The capital
increase is necessary to reduce debts of about FFr38bn at the airline and to
curb losses estimated at FFr7.5bn last year. But the plan requires approval
from the European Commission and is likely to face resistance from Air
France's competitors, including British Airways.
Mr Blanc, who took over as chairman last October, had threatened to resign
if he did not receive a 'clear and massive' vote in favour of his plan to
cut 5,000 jobs, freeze wages and increase productivity by 30 per cent. He
appealed directly to staff following the refusal of eight of the airline's
14 unions to sign his recovery plan, although the six that signed
represented just over half the workforce. Mr Blanc's success was attributed
to a strong communications effort which has involved more than 2,000
meetings with staff and union representatives. It also reflected the
severity of the company's problems.
The vote in favour of the restructuring plan will come as a relief to the
French government, which was forced into a humiliating climbdown last
October when it withdrew a previous plan. The scrapping of the plan, in the
face of a wave of strikes, forced the resignation of Mr Bernard Attali, the
previous chairman, and set a precedent for government concessions to
opponents of reform.
Mr Bernard Bosson, the transport minister, said the plan was an endorsement
of the government's consultations. He saw no reason why Brussels should
oppose the plan, adding that the proposed state aid represented only half
the company's debts.
The result represents a blow to the eight unions at the airline which had
rejected Mr Blanc's proposals. However, an official at the communist
Confederation Generale du Travail, the second largest union at Air France,
said: 'We continue to oppose the plan'. He said the union did not rule out
industrial action in protest at the plans to cut jobs and freeze wages.

FT  12 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 15 per cent fall in the water sector this year owes more to rising bond
yields than to increasing regulatory risks. The yield gap between
index-linked gilts and water shares has remained remarkably constant since
the turn of the year at around 1.6 percentage points. The risk premium for
holding water shares is thus unchanged.
True, this aggregate performance hides a narrowing of odds ahead of this
summer's review of price limits by Ofwat, the industry regulator. Laggards
such as Yorkshire have tended to perform better than traditional favourites
such as Severn Trent. If trading volumes remain thin there could be some
uncomfortably sharp corrections. Last week's 5 per cent fall in the sector,
despite relative calm elsewhere in the equity market and in index-linked
gilts, is a case in point.
With few announcements likely in the run up to the review, though, the
sector will probably continue to track bond yields. Whether water shares
decouple from bonds thereafter depends on the outlook for dividend growth
once the new price limits are known. Until then a prospective yield
approaching 6 per cent, based on estimates of dividend growth this year, is
a tempting carrot. That should limit the downside, even if index-linked gilt
yields rise from here. The worry is that Ofwat has yet to wield its stick.

FT  12 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Construction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest forecast from UK building material producers is notably more
upbeat than previously. But given the rise in building material and
construction shares over the past year, it would have been alarming to
contemplate anything else. Housebuilding appears to be ticking over nicely
while there is a lot more optimism about industrial and commercial
construction spending. The repair and maintenance numbers look weak but the
suspicion must be that official numbers are distorted by the blossoming
black economy. Companies exposed to that sector, such as plasterboard
manufacturers, are certainly reporting good volume and price gains.
Despite the benign outlook, contractors remain a grumpy bunch. Industry
leaders are advancing the novel proposition that the generosity of bankers
is to blame for keeping weak competitors afloat. Aggressive tendering is
therefore still whittling away margins while some big projects fade away.
The Channel tunnel is almost complete, the grocery chains are scaling back
their ambitions to carpet the country with concrete, and the cut in the road
building programme will begin to hurt next year.
The logical answer would be for the construction sector to rationalise
capacity through mergers. There remains a place for both specialist or
regional contractors and diversified international groups. But medium-sized
contractors may find it increasingly hard to justify an independent
existence.

FT  12 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Small companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the minnows of the market had the best of last year's bull run in
equities, they are also showing some useful defensive qualities. Even after
two months in decline, the FT-SE SmallCap index has risen by 4 per cent this
year. If hedge funds and other big international investors were responsible
for the turmoil in the upper echelons of the market, the lower reaches might
have been expected to escape the worst. Still, the recent wave of flotations
and rights issues - more than Pounds 1.5bn was raised by smaller companies
in the first quarter - has been absorbed surprisingly well.
Increased weighting towards small companies by investment institutions, and
a steady flow of funds into small company unit trusts, have helped. But the
best of the institutional re-weighting has probably now been seen. After its
recent outperformance the SmallCap is hardly cheap relative to the rest of
market. A multiple of around 17 times this year's forecast earnings - a 20
per cent premium to the FT-SE 100 index - is not exceptional for this stage
in the economic cycle. Neither does it leave much room for disappointment.
The comfort is that smaller companies' results have been, in aggregate, well
up with expectations. Dividend growth has bounced back after three years of
shrinking payouts. There is also a chance that analysts' forecasts
underestimate the extent of operational gearing likely to be experienced by
industrial companies as the economy improves. With so many manufacturers and
engineering companies clustered at the bottom end of the stock market, the
SmallCap could yet justify investors' faith.

FT  12 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Burmah's pace quickens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a certain amount of lubrication in Burmah Castrol's annual figures.
Without currency movements and disposals last year's Pounds 231m operating
profit would have shown only a small gain. Without the enhanced scrip
dividend at the interim stage the tax rate would have been 4 percentage
points higher. That benefit will fall this year and Burmah will no longer be
releasing Pounds 7m in provisions on its liquid natural gas transportation
business. In earnings terms it will have to run hard to stand still,
especially given the dilutive effect of two enhanced scrip dividends in a
row. Yet the unexciting outlook for stated earnings masks an improving
underlying position.
Burmah's automotive lubricant business has proved resilient in the recession
and Syntec, its high margin synthetic oil, will move into profit this year.
More important, the chemical businesses should soon start to recover with
the cycle. Earnings should be growing strongly by 1995, which makes a
historic price-earnings ratio of 15 undemanding.
Yet Burmah still has to decide how to use the benefits. The operational
gearing inherent in its chemicals business means it could start to generate
more cash than it is traditionally used to. If it manages to sell peripheral
businesses as well, Burmah could be enjoying a surplus of cash. Although
gearing is nearly 60 per cent, there is no pressing reason to pay down debt
when interest cover is over six times. One possibility might be another
large acquisition, though Foseco has not yet proved a convincing
diversification. It might make more sense to return money to shareholders,
especially if the new foreign income dividends reduce the tax problems in
doing so.

Lauda Air, the Austrian airline founded by former motor racing world
champion Nikki Lauda, is having a busy month, opening up new Vienna-based
European regional network services to Barcelona, Madrid, Brussels, Geneva
and Munich. Yesterday was Manchester's turn.
However, Lauda himself couldn't be there - it was his turn to fly Lauda's
Madrid route. Instead, he will land in Manchester today. But Lauda fans will
have to be quick - he takes off on the return Vienna journey at 9am, only 45
minutes after landing. He may be on the ground a bit longer, though, by
virtue of landing earlier. 'They always seem to go faster when he's at the

What is it with headhunting all of a sudden? First the TV series, now a
novel, oozing with sex and corruption, entitled The Headhunter, by Juliette
Mead, an ex-headhunter.
But it is not just the media that are beguiled by this peculiar line of
work. Anne Ferguson, an ICI veteran of more than 20 years' standing - who
ran ICI's World Class campaign and masterminded the search for Zeneca's
marvellously obscure name - has just answered the call to join Spencer
Stuart, one of the big international search companies.
So how does a high-profile career in marketing prepare you for being a
headhunter? 'Both are about helping find solutions,' says Ferguson glibly.
Except in the minds of those who think the latter species create the
problems.

Meanwhile, relations have not exactly been wonderful between Abu Dhabi -
majority owner of the corrupt Bank of Credit and Commerce International -
and Touche Ross, the bank's liquidator, though outright war has so far been
avoided. Touche has sued BCCI's former auditor, Price Waterhouse - and even
the Bank of England - but has deployed a softly-softly approach with the
emirate.
Being nice doesn't necessarily pay off. At the end of March, Abu Dhabi
shipped to Touche's London office 70 tonnes of BCCI documents, all its head
office files, airlifted to Abu Dhabi in 1990. Creditors should not
over-excite themselves; despite being carefully sorted in the UAE, the index
has mysteriously disappeared in transit.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Who would be a bank supervisor? Success is untrumpeted and the best
reputations usually end up tarnished. Yet Rosalind Gilmore, 57, chairman of
the Building Societies Commission, is in danger of leaving her job smelling
of roses.
She intends to retire at the end of this year, having steered the building
society movement safely through its worst upheaval in living memory.
Financial deregulation, a consequent hair-raising increase in the level of
mortgage debt, the first collapse in nominal house prices since the second
world war, unprecedented arrears and repossessions - all came at a time when
the building societies' capital base was uncomfortably slender.
The worst she can be accused of is nannying her charges. A robust approach
to supervision was anyway part of the key to Gilmore's success. Serious
nannying was required to ensure that troubled societies were taken over by
larger and sounder institutions before cross-infection caused further
turmoil in the sector. The successful absorption of Town &amp; Country by the
Woolwich Building Society in November 1991 marked the high tide - in the
public eye, at least - of Gilmore's regulatory activism.
True, her success owed something to the charity of others, notably the
insurance companies that chose to underwrite a growing share of the risk in
mortgage lending at the most inauspicious moment.
Taxpayers and legislators have also done their bit, since income support for
distressed borrowers is now paid direct to mortgage lenders. And Gilmore
didn't have to cope with a US-style deposit insurance scheme which gave
managers of troubled savings and loans carte blanche to run amok.
Yet the record speaks for itself: depositors have emerged with their savings
intact. If only she had been in charge of regulating the life assurance and
pensions industry. Were it not for her age, she would have made a natural
replacement for the Bank of England's Brian Quinn when he gives up
regulating.

FT  12 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Gradualism has proved ineffective in
Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor ANDERS ASLUND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Remarkable things are happening in the Russian economy. Monthly
inflation has fallen from 22 per cent in January to 9 per cent in March,
while industrial production fell by 24 per cent in the first quarter of 1994
in comparison with the first quarter of 1993. This is a severe stabilisation
shock.
It is caused by policies introduced by Boris Fyodorov, the former finance
minister, last October after the dissolution of the Russian parliament. He
abolished subsidised credits and raised the refinance rate to 17.5 per cent
a month, that is 592 per cent a year, though it is wrongly cited by the
Russian authorities as 210 per cent a year. He kept the budget deficit at 9
per cent of gross domestic product.
A little noticed fact is that Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister,
contrary to his public statements, has maintained Fyodorov's policy. Last
month, Russia had a positive real interest rate of 9 per cent a month, or
180 per cent a year, by far the highest in the world. Therefore inflation
falls so sharply.
However, a macroeconomic stabilisation driven only by monetary policy, with
a relatively weak budgetary policy, is both socially costly and difficult to
sustain. Tax revenues are collapsing because of the tough monetary policy.
Therefore, Professor Jeffrey Sachs (Personal view, March 31) is right in
arguing for a more balanced, effective and humane stabilisation programme
with substantial and timely Western support.
Professor Padma Desai (Letters, April 6) does not understand that the prime
minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, is delivering an extraordinary shock after
too much unintended gradualism. Unlike Desai, he has learnt that gradualism
has proved ineffective.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BARRY LEATHWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'The last board' (April 8), suggests a substitute
mechanism for the Agricultural Wages Board which could be enforced by
ejection from the National Farmers Union. The NFU has enough trouble keeping
its own membership and certainly would be in no position to discipline those
who do not toe the line.
You also suggest it would be unfair for the workers to feel the pain of
deregulation before the farmers have to take the medicine and, in doing so,
assume there is equity between them.
Thousands of workers and their families live on the margins of poverty, many
in tied cottages in isolated areas, while their employers receive subsidies
from the public purse greater than the total wage bill. Where is the equity
here?
More than 99.7 per cent of those consulted by the government, including
employers, called for the retention of the boards. Surely it makes more
sense to retain a system which, though not perfect, is supported by both
sides of industry.

FT  12 APR 94 / Adapt, rejig and survive: There are ways for machine tool
companies to prosper in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As UK machine tool manufacturers meet this week at the Metcut '94 exhibition
in Birmingham - a show intended to prove that, after two decade of decline
and three years of recession, the industry is still alive - there will be a
noticeable absentee.
Missing will be FMT, the machine tool company based in Brighton, Sussex,
which since the 1950s has absorbed companies that once employed thousands of
people. In February it called in the receivers. Last month US competitor,
Giddings &amp; Lewis, bought most of FMT's spares and service business, brand
names and intellectual rights - and took on just 30 of FMT's employees.
G&amp;L has yet to decide whether to continue making FMT machines. If, as is
widely expected, it does not, the deal would mark the end of production of
large machining centres - big, multi-function machines which drill and cut
metal components - by UK-owned companies.
Whatever happens, the collapse of FMT seems to make a mockery of the 'show
of strength' slogan chosen by the Machine Tool Technologies Association for
this week's event. 'It's a disaster - who's left at the high-tech end of the
industry?' asks one observer.
FMT's demise looks like another example of a UK machine tool company on the
wane, joining names such as Alfred Herbert, the Coventry-based company,
which was once Europe's largest producer but which collapsed in 1983.
Since the 1970s, UK machine tool production has slumped, falling in value
from Pounds 1.4bn in 1970 to Pounds 456m in 1992, in constant 1985 prices.
The collapse has been due partly to the decline of UK manufacturing. But it
also reflects the success of overseas machine tool companies, particularly
from Germany and Japan: imports have risen to more than 50 per cent of UK
machine tool consumption, and the market is fiercely competitive.
Typically, British machine tool companies have contracted severely - or are
subsidiaries of foreign companies, such as Bridgeport and Cincinnati
Milacron of the US, and Yamazaki of Japan. The industry is scattered around
120 manufacturing sites in the UK.
To survive, many smaller machine tool manufacturers have avoided mass
markets dominated by Japanese producers and exploited niches: in
sophisticated technology such as laser-cutting; or in under-exploited
markets such as manual, non-computerised machines; or in accessories.
One of the best examples of the niche approach is Ren-ishaw of
Gloucestershire, which last month reported half-year pre-tax profits of
Pounds 2.81m on sales of Pounds 23.3m. It has become a world leader in tiny
measurement probes, which are attached to machine tools to check they are
cutting components correctly.
Larger companies can still compete with foreign competition. For instance,
600 Group this week launches its new CNC (computer numerical control) lathe,
aimed at small engineering companies. However, it has gone through a painful
restructuring of its lathe manufacturing operation, including the closure in
1992 of its Colchester plant which employed 280 people.
But FMT was different. Though small, it tried to stay in the mainstream,
with products competing directly with the large machining centres built by
Japanese, continental European and US companies.
FMT's slide into receivership dates from 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait and
the UK Department of Trade and Industry refused to renew export licences to
Iraq, costing the company Pounds 1m in lost orders. Then came the UK
recession, which further weakened its order book.
In response to these pressures, FMT drew up a two-pronged business strategy:
moving from Brighton to a smaller site and forging joint ventures to exploit
growth opportunities in China and India. To succeed financially, the
proposals depended on securing planning permission to sell the Brighton site
for use by retailers.
But when in February it became clear that there would be delays before that
permission was granted, FMT's bank, the Midland, cut the company's borrowing
limit.
The lesson for the industry is that it is hard for small British-owned
machine tool builders to survive in the mainstream market - and it is even
more difficult without the financial backing of larger, international
groups. FMT had annual sales of just Pounds 7m when it called in the
receivers. Financing was crucial, because of the long lead-times - as much
as 18 months - involved in making large, sophisticated machining centres.
Whatever the competitive weaknesses of FMT, however, managers of machine
tool companies - as well as of banks - would be wrong to be too gloomy about
the prospects for companies that have adapted to a harsh trading
environment.
According to American Machinist magazine, the UK remains the world's
eighth-biggest machine tool producer. There are still a 'good number of
innovative, reasonably healthy companies around to maintain our market
position', says Mr Simon Brown, director general of the Machine Tool
Technologies Association.
Though many machine tool manufacturers have cut output, there are signs that
investment in product development has been spared. For instance, Jones &amp;
Shipman, the Leicester-based grinding machine producer, has subcontracted
out almost all of the components of its tools, allowing it to concentrate on
designing, assembling and marketing.
At the same time, the UK's relatively low inflation and interest rates,
along with relatively low manufacturing costs, have enhanced the industry's
competitiveness in overseas markets.
Activity in the world machine tool market has also picked up. 'We are
experiencing greater demand from markets in the UK, the US and the Far East.
People are investing in new machines again,' says Mr Mike Colvin, export
sales and marketing manager at Cincinnati Milacron UK.
Too late, unfortunately, for FMT. It seems condemned to become another name
on a long list of machine tool companies that did not realise soon enough
that, in a competitive industry, strategies for survival have to be designed
with as much precision and thought as machine tools themselves.

FT  12 APR 94 / The prisoner's dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best that can be expected from South Africa this year is the emergence
of a government strong enough to restore order and wise enough to lay the
foundations of a liberal economy. The worst is chaos, civil war, a botched
social revolution, the end of any chance that sub-Saharan Africa's
rehabilitation might be led from its southern tip.
The first of this pair of anticipations is philosophically improper. It says
nothing of democracy, or human rights, or cutting a deal with Inkatha. It
implies the emergence of an over-mighty government such as that of Malaysia
or Singapore. It suggests autocracy; a controlled, censored, or obedient
media; an absence of those civic freedoms in which the north Atlantic
countries luxuriate; an ominous willingness to deploy the security forces
wherever necessary.
Is that really the best that years of struggle against apartheid is destined
to achieve? Probably. This foreboding is expressed without relish. Nobody,
least of all those of us privileged to enjoy something better, should wish
such a fate on post-apartheid South Africa. The world's hope for the
republic, the goal to which its friends should assist it to strive, must be
that a peaceful, open, democratic polity emerges as the 'new South Africa'.
Many intelligent, decent South Africans clearly harbour such a vision. Pray
that they are right. It is, however impossible to maintain the fiction that
such a fairy-tale ending is imminent.
For a start, the received wisdom among those close to the affairs of the
republic has been that the appalling bloodshed, the killings of supporters
of one party by another, can only be stopped by a 'crackdown'. This
proposition has been argued with increasing confidence over the past year.
The mailed fist will be visible before the government due to be elected at
the end of this month has tidied up the crumbs left behind after the
celebration banquets. There will be no doubt about what to do. South Africa
has had years of practice at 'crackdowns', in which states of emergency are
declared, 'troublemakers' are arrested and detained, and the press is
censored. The first step, the declaration of an emergency, has already been
taken in kwaZulu.
A long-unanswered question has been whether the white-led security forces
would take orders from a black-led administration. The signs are mixed, but
encouraging for those who believe in civilian control of armed forces. It is
not clear that the white-officered South African police (the rank and file
is mostly black) are reconciled to the change of government. They do,
however, know where their pay comes from. Most of them are expected to obey
their new political masters. The SA Defence Force has shown that it will
take orders from the mouth of Mr FW de Klerk, even when the president of the
African National Congress, Mr Nelson Mandela, is visibly pulling the
strings. Thus were lesser tribal homelands such as Bophutatswana and Ciskei
brought into line. So, if need be, will kwaZulu be tackled.
This time the order will be given by Mr Mandela, as the new president. When
I was growing up in Johannesburg the ANC was the embodiment of non-racial,
liberal, democratic virtue. The South African Communist party, its close
ally, was the only white-led political organisation that could be wholly
relied upon to support black aspirations. Others in the 'congress movement'
represented Indians and mixed-race 'coloureds'. Liberation from apartheid
was the goal that united all such groupings. If you be-lieved that that was
an overriding necessity, your support for them was un-wavering.
It is different today. I share the global admiration for Mr Mandela. The
Nobel prize for peace sits comfortably upon his distinguished shoulders. It
does, however, look as if he may be destined to crown his lifetime's
achievement, the overthrow of apartheid, by slamming political opponents
into the very jails from which he and other ANC leaders were so recently
released. Since politics and murder are intertwined in parts of South
Africa, he may be said to have little option. That does not detract from the
bitter irony of what fate appears to have in store for him.
South Africa cannot afford a provincial war, as in Katanga, Biafra or
Angola. The ANC might try harder for a political settlement with Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, chief minister of kwaZulu, but it may be that the
trick is not possible. Mediation will only succeed if both sides are ready
to agree. But Chief Buthelezi, the darling of the dewy-eyed anti-communist
right, is not a man anyone can easily do business with. The ANC clearly
seeks centralised power over all the territory of the republic. The ANC
assumption must be that the army, the most powerful in Africa, could quell a
rebellion on its home ground. The elephant, as Mr Mandela has taken to
calling his party, is in rampant mood.
It would be comforting to stand aside from these hard realities and cry out
for justice. The truth is that no clear road to a just settlement exists.
South Africa will fail absolutely if there is no economic growth. The
economy cannot prosper if there is chaos. The imposition of order by the ANC
is thus likely to be a painful prerequisite for a resumption of inward
investment, and a resurgence of the economy. Even that would not suffice.
Only the free market, the proven stimulator of capitalist energy, can ensure
that growth is sufficiently rapid to enable the ANC to keep its election
promises.
Outsiders can read recent ANC statements to mean that South Africa's new
masters have begun to understand this. Mr de Klerk's National party formerly
prospered by creating state-financed jobs for Afrikaners. Now it appears to
have become a late convert to the merits of private finance. The National
party may win as much as a fifth of the vote, perhaps even a quarter. That
is not enough to temper the demands of the ANC. It might be sufficient to be
useful if Mr Mandela perceives the value of familiar faces in important
economic posts. A post-election alliance with Mr de Klerk could produce two
Nobel peace prize winners' signatures at the foot of orders to the security
forces to 'pacify' troublespots. Together the old jailer and his old
prisoner might avert the disintegration of their country. They might also
reassure potential investors, if Africa's luck turns.

FT  12 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Dominant force in the bond markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Plender ('Lull before the battle resumes', April 9/10) argues
that, if the dollar remains weak, European bond markets will be able to
decouple from the US Treasury market. This view is based on the proposition
that a weak dollar reflects outflows of long-term capital from the US into
European markets.
This may be the case, but the valuation effects of changes in the value of
the dollar works the other way and, at the present time, would seem to be
the more dominant force. When the price of dollar assets falls, everything
else equal, the price of non-dollar assets will be forced to fall in line to
maintain their relative attractiveness. A rise in the dollar, however, makes
dollar assets look more expensive to non-dollar investors. Hence, if the
dollar rises while the local price of dollar assets falls, the foreign
currency price of dollar assets remains the same and there is no need for
the price of non-dollar assets to change.
In practice, a rising dollar is another way of saying that some decoupling
of US and European markets is warranted by economic fundamentals, say
because of changing interest rate differentials. Since the first rise in US
interest rates in early February, European markets have suffered from the
fall-out in the US because the dollar did not rise as was generally
expected. In the last couple of weeks, however, the dollar has started to
strengthen and some decoupling has taken place.

FT  12 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Conflicting interests if BAe articles
are changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NOEL FALCONER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I rejoice at the first flight of the British Eurofighter.
I wonder if it will be produced - and worry for British Aerospace if it
isn't. For there is no fall-back, because of its cost, which is appalling,
notwithstanding the Eurofighter's undoubted excellence.
The project cost is admitted as Pounds 33bn, of which Pounds 11bn is R&amp;D.
That leaves Pounds 22bn to build 453 fighters - Pounds 50m each, for
production only, more if the UK has to go it alone, more yet if the RAF cuts
its order for 250, worth Pounds 12.5bn, a quarter of the public sector
borrowing requirement deficit.
Neither the UK nor Germany, Italy, or Spain is committed to its
construction, so securing national and international agreement for it must
involve a struggle.
Consequently, at this of all junctures, BAe needs the most influential
leadership possible. A non-executive American chairman, hired for whatever
tiny part of Bob Bauman's year Pounds 50,000 buys, is the opposite of what
is essential. Why, in any event, is John Cahill being ousted when, less than
halfway through his term and with his task incomplete, he has lifted the
shares fourfold?
The company's articles require that the BAe chairman be British, for the
sound reason that the head of the prime armourer of our nation is privy to
our deepest secrets. Yes, America long stood with us against the Russian
hegemony; but the Soviet Union has fragmented and, according to Pitt the
Younger, 'nations have no friends, only interests'. Interests that are
diverging.
Requirements conflict: most obviously, America wants to sell its aeroplanes
in preference to BAe's, and vice versa. Mr Bauman would have to be disloyal
either to his country or to the organisation he has been invited to lead.
I beg shareholders concerned for the security of the nation, and for the
future of their company, to oppose the enabling amendment of its Articles.

Sir, Your obituary of Kurt Cobain (Arts, April 11) was offensively

FT  12 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Where Israel is important to UK's
export efforts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms HELEN DAVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peter Norman's excellent article on the progress of the Israeli economy
('Knocked about but unbowed,' April 5) failed to mention one important
dimension: the remarkable growth of Britain's trade relations with this
market.
Last year, Britain's visible exports exceeded Pounds 850m, an unprecedented
50 per cent increase over the previous year, making Israel Britain's
24th-largest export market. So far this year, growth in exports has
increased by a further 40 per cent and now averages Pounds 90m a month.
This growth has occurred almost exclusively in capital equipment and
manufactured goods, areas where Britain must focus its attention in order to
consolidate economic recovery. Israel's sales to Britain are also growing
and Britain is currently its second-largest customer after the US. This
year, bilateral trade could exceed Pounds 2bn.
Israel will import Dollars 20bn worth of goods this year and export Dollars
15bn, and Britain's share is a healthy 9.5 per cent of this market.
The effects of the Arab trade boycott continue to be felt in spite of the
peace process, yet it seems that British exporters are increasingly taking
advantage of this vital and innovative market.

FT  12 APR 94 / Arts: Close up on Tintoretto - William Packer visits the
Accademia and the Guggenheim in Venice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No one is ever short of things to see in Venice, but then why not pile
Pelion on Ossa, given the chance? Certainly the current programme of special
exhibitions is as strong as ever, quite apart from the remarkable exhibition
of architecture at Fiat's Palazzo Grassi, The Renaissance: from Brunelleschi
to Michelangelo (to be reviewed later).
This, in Venice, is the year of Tintoretto, the 400th anniversary of his
death at the age of 76. The Commune di Venezia is marking the moment with
wide publicity of itself as the City of Tintoretto, drawing attention to the
many works hung in its churches and ancient institutions and, until May 1,
showing a group of the religious paintings in the Church of San Bartolomeo,
near the Rialto. The principle celebration, however, is of Tintoretto the
portrait painter, now on show at the Accademia.
Tintoretto, with Titian, his master, and the somewhat younger Veronese,
completes the commanding trio of great artists that forms and dominates our
view of Venetian painting through the greater part of the 16th century.
Which was the greatest? Titian, who, some would say, in his great old age,
was the first modern painter; Veronese, the virtuoso, pittore sovrano di
Venezia, as the plaque on his house near San Samuele would have it; or
Tintoretto himself, with his driving expressive energy and emotional force?
Who would say?
All three of them were portrait painters on the side - and in the middle as
well, for with the model used even for the idealised figures of any
devotional composition, the donors - sponsors as we would say - required
their own personal, if peripheral commemoration. The family kneeling at the
sacred throne, one head turned perhaps to look us directly in the eye, is
ever poignant and humane.
But the smaller single and private portrait will always bring us closer to
the artist himself in his practical working of the image, just as it allows
us closer to the surface of the canvas. Here is the artist alone and
himself. And what we find here in Tintoretto is a certain crudity and
awkwardness, almost a naivety in the immediate drawing and handling that
never leaves him. The odd thing is that we find these qualities being not so
much overcome as turned to advantage.
Sophistication and an easier naturalism come with experience, but always
there will be the commitment and attack, that saving determination to get
the mark and thus the image down, to make it real and to make it work. It is
moving and inspiring to follow an artist as he moves towards true greatness
by sheer force of character. What a pity it is that the two self-portraits,
in youth and old age, are not hung side by side. The boy is father to the
man.
The short walk beyond San Vio takes us to the late Peggy Guggenheim's
Palazzo Venier and into another world and another age. Her collection of
modern international art, prime Ernst, Miro, Picasso, Giacometti and the
rest, remains the draw it always was, but changes are afoot. It is not that
the emphasis is to shift away from the collection as such, with its strong
personal flavour; nor should it, ever. But with pressure from visitors
continuing to grow, the need for more space, if only to maintain the
peculiar character of the place, is undeniable.
The opportunity has been taken to acquire much of the property behind the
Guggenheim, over the garden wall. The central portion was taken over some
time ago and has already been converted into a shop and temporary gallery,
with a cafe to open this summer. The intention is thus to concentrate
offices and services, with the old Palazzo returned as much as possible to
its old self.
Along with this comes the opportunity to make rather more of temporary
exhibitions. Two such are now on show. Italian Artists' Books in the 20th
Century, already shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, is a rich
documentary display that makes the useful point that artists everywhere, and
not just in Italy, continue to be intrigued by the relation of image to
text, and the creative collaboration between artist and writer. Artists
represented range from de Chirico to Clemente.
Josef Albers: glass, colour and light is a small but substantial
retrospective study. Drawn principally from the holdings of the Josef Albers
Foundation in Connecticut, it lays a fresh and proper emphasis on Albers'
early development in his years at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and '30s, first
at Weimar and then at Dessau. Albers died in 1976 at the age of 88. He moved
to America in 1933, where he spent the rest of his life, engaged after 1950
in endless colour variations upon his 'Homage to the Square', three simple
squares inset in a uniform format. With his post-war reputation resting on
this American minimalism, it is useful to be reminded of the European
constructivist tradition from which he came, with Klee, Schwitters and
Mondrian the most obvious and notable influences.
Jacopo Tintoretto: Portraits; Gallerie dell'Accademia until July 10, then on
to Vienna. Sponsors: Hyundai Automobili Italia and Ramazzotti. Josef Albers:
Glass, Colour &amp; Light; Peggy Guggenheim Collection, until July 10. Italian
Artists' Books in the 20th Century; Peggy Guggenheim Collection, until May
22.

FT  12 APR 94 / Arts: Why Janacek is out of fashion at home - Czech opera
houses are opting for Verdi and the quick buck nowadays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is Monday night in the Moravian city of Brno, where the composer Leos
Janacek lived, worked and died. The municipal theatre which bears his name
is presenting a new production of Katya Kabanova but the auditorium is
half-empty. The theatre manager says Czech audiences are not interested in
Janacek - 'they want Verdi, they want spectacle, they want entertainment'.
In Prague earlier this season, a new production of The Makropoulos Case was
taken off the National Theatre's programme after a handful of performances,
the last of which attracted just 27 paying customers. At the State Opera,
the title role in Jenufa is sung not by a Czech soprano but a Romanian.
Neither company has plans for a new Janacek production in the foreseeable
future.
While packed houses in London, Paris and New York applaud international
casts performing Janacek in a language few understand, the tradition in his
own country is dying away. Young Czech conductors and singers are focusing
on popular repertoire which will bring them foreign engagements and easy
money. Second-rate artists from the West and the former Soviet empire fill
the gaps, accelerating the break with the native tradition.
For much of the postwar era, Czech audiences were exposed to Janacek through
cheap tickets and factory outings. Now they spend their free time watching
television or nurturing private businesses. 'We know in advance that Janacek
will be empty and Verdi will be full,' observes Tibor Varga, Brno's opera
director. 'We want to perform Janacek but if we carried on playing to empty
houses, the city would cut our subsidy. Under Communism, the people had no
ideas, no problems. The unions bought the tickets and we had busloads from
everywhere. It didn't matter what we played, it was an outing for them. The
public is different now. They don't see art as a spiritual outlet, they no
longer get free tickets. They want a show.'
Janacek scholars from around the world still flock to Brno to study the
collection of original manuscripts at the Moravian Museum. This is where
Charles Mackerras discovered the orchestral interludes for Katya and the
original score of Jenufa, which had been ignored by Czech conductors; where
British Janacek expert John Tyrrell selected texts for his
recently-published translations of the composer's correspondence with Kamila
Stosslova the woman who inspired his Indian summer of creativity.
But few people make the journey to Brno in the hope of hearing a
well-preserved performing tradition. The new shoe-string production of Katya
offers one classic piece of casting - the veteran bass Richard Novak as
Dikoy - as well as some of the clipped Moravian song-speech which informed
Janacek's compositional style. But there is little indication that Brno was
once a beacon of Janacek interpretation, long before his music became
familiar in the West.
When Janacek died in 1928, he left a group of interpreters with an
instinctive understanding of his work - men like Bretislav Bakala, Vaclav
Talich, Zdenek Chalabala and Jaroslav Vogel. They in turn spawned a postwar
generation of interpreters.
In Brno, Frantisek Jilek forged new ground with a cycle of Janacek operas in
1958, repeated in 1978 - after which, in the words of Brno musicologist
Alena Nemcova 'things began to slide. Conductors today are no longer willing
to devote the time to it, to work with singers on it. No-one is being
encouraged to carry forward the tradition.'
Of the postwar generation of Janacek specialists, only Bohumil Gregor is
still alive and active. Like several of his contemporaries, he was steeped
in Janacek by the time he reached Prague, because he had served a long
apprenticeship in the provinces. He bemoans the fact that this kind of
lengthy preparation is no longer possible, that Czech theatres have given
themselves over to fail-safe repertoire like Aida, Madama Butterfly and The
Bartered Bride.
'They live from day to day,' comments Gregor, whose Janacek performances
during the National Theatre's visit to the 1964 Edinburgh Festival won him
an international reputation. 'They want to do it the quick way, the cheap
way - art as a commercial commodity, managements following rather than
leading. Instead of building for the future, they're destroying the link
with the past.'

FT  12 APR 94 / Arts: Fall River Legend - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The story of Lizzie Borden ('Eighty-one things a bright girl can do with an
axe') has all the ingredients for tremendous theatre. Wicked step-mother;
potential loss of money - Lizzie thought that her father would disinherit
her; sexual tension; a final explosion of violence on a stifling day in a
repressive community. The mystery of who killed Lizzie's father and
step-mother - for Lizzie was acquitted - is no mystery at all, and Agnes de
Mille's famous old barn-stormer, Fall River Legend rightly presents Lizzie
as homicidal. It has now entered the Birmingham Royal Ballet's repertory - I
saw it as the BRB Covent Garden season ended on Thursday - and the company
serves it up hot and strong.
It is dubious choreographic stuff, but its fustian is astutely judged.
Motivation trails its coat throughout; characterisations are blatant, and
the dance rarely makes any sense of them. But the story is crackingly good,
and the sight of a ballerina clutching an axe can still give a frisson of
horror. The reason for this BRB staging is what Fall River's purpose
originally was: to provide a stunning role for a dramatic ballerina. The
ballet was made in 1948 for Nora Kaye, a consummate dance actress with
American Ballet Theatre. I saw and was bowled over by her then - as also by
Alicia Alonso, who actually gave the first performance - and I think BRB's
Marion Tait, the justification for this staging, no less good.
Tait is a dance actress of rare finesse. She has the right 'look' - the
searching gaze; that sense of a troubled spirit in quest of release  - for
Lizzie. As with so many of her finest readings - notably in the MacMillan
repertory - we are as much moved by the absolute precision of Tait's playing
as by her expressive power. She has never given a predictable or mechanical
performance: everything is felt, understood, and the dance has been no less
honest and subtle. As Lizzie, she takes the stage like a diva - the part
demands it; Tait can supply it - but she gives purpose to every scene, and
makes us forget much of the surrounding choreographic chit-chat. Lizzie's
anguish, her sense of being victimised, her tremulous eagerness for love and
her sudden malicious caprices, are shown with a sharp, nervously precise
outline that speaks exactly of the girl's spiritual life.
BRB's artists - Desmond Kelly as the father; Samira Saidi as the mother;
Karen Waldie as the step-mother; Sandra Madgwick as the child Lizzie, and,
especially, Joseph Cipolla as the local priest - give a welcome depth to
paste-board characters. Oliver Smith's original design is still splendid;
the Morton Gould score a vexation to musical sensibilities. The piece is a
vehicle for Tait: she drives it to glory - as did Nora Kaye. No higher
praise is possible.
This triple bill also included the company's honourable account of
Balanchine's Serenade and MacMillan's Elite Syncopations - where style could
have been more elegantly sparky, but I greatly admired Miyako Yoshida and
Joseph Cipolla.

FT  12 APR 94 / Arts: My Night with Reg - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The title of Kevin Elyot's new play at the Royal Court's Theatre Upstairs is
a barbed joke, for as it turns out almost everybody here has had a night
with Reg (and enjoyed it thoroughly). Reg has been putting himself about
more than his globe-hopping art-dealer lover Daniel ever twigged. But we
never meet him: he misses Guy's re-decoration party in scene 1, and by scene
2 he is dead (Aids, of course). Guy's gaggle of gay friends gather there
again for Reg's wake, some with related worries in their minds.
Two years on, the third and last scene is sadder still; but Elyot's dialogue
never goes flabby, always keeps its cool focus and sympathetic wit. This
dark comedy is humane, skilfully economical. Except for young Eric from
Lancashire, barman at the local gay pub, Elyot's characters are all some way
into middle age, unharried and quite well settled, if variably
well-preserved.
As gay plays go, that makes My Night with Reg seem uncommonly fresh. I
strove dutifully to apply the standard test: if all the relationships were
heterosexual instead, would it deliver anything like the same frissons? The
test was useless, because Elyot's people are too thoroughly rooted in their
sexual milieu to be transposable. These are sensible, independent grown-ups
with real-life jobs. They don't go in for luvvie-talk, bitchery or campery;
they inhabit no pretend 'special' world that would set them apart.
That is what provides the frisson. Only their effusive hugs and kisses when
saying hello or goodbye, and their avid gossip about each other's love
lives, stretch the norms of ordinary male conviviality. Even nice,
houseproud, frustrated Guy, who is something in advertising, counts as a
camp 'stereotype' - exquisitely self-deprecating as rendered by David Bamber
 -merely in the sense that there really are a lot of Guys about.
As promiscuous old chums who dazzled him at university, John Sessions plays
a flamboyant Daniel and Anthony Calf a plausible public-school hero. Not
only does he wield a terrific golden-boy smile, but he sustains it through
the entire first scene with superhuman stamina.
They both come into their own near the end, with an intimate grief which
they prefer not to admit sharing.
For cross-class contrast, we have the odd couple of Bernie (Roger Frost) -
prissy, unattractive and deeply boring - and his grizzled partner Bennie
(Kenneth Macdonald), a randy bus-driver. The maturing of young Eric (Joe
Duttine) scene by scene, from hired handyman to welcome guest to ambitious
gay publican, makes a bright thread, not least because all these new friends
strike him as irretrievably old. About such discomfiting facts of life
Elyot's play is unblinkingly fair and very funny.

<TEXT>
In Omnibus the BBC pays tribute to Sir John Gielgud who will be 90 on
Thursday. Having been acclaimed for his Shakespearian roles in the 1920s and
30s he was ridiculed in the late 50s, after the advent of kitchen sink
drama, for the deliberate beauty of his delivery. But Gielgud has lived long
enough to see off his detractors (10.00 BBC1).
Unhappily Benny Hill died before his own renaissance, but it will come of
course. His traditional comedy will outlast the feminists in charge of
television, mostly men, whose slavish devotion to 'kissing the arse of the
zeitgeist' (thank you Barbara Amiel) led to such shameful abandonment of
Hill in the 1980s. Today ITV screens a half-hour programme, recorded on both
sides of the Atlantic, completed just before his death in 1992, and not

FT  12 APR 94 / Business and the Law: Dan Air sale evades merger rule's
scope - European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of First Instance has rejected Air France's appeal
against the European Commission's finding that British Airways' acquisition
of Dan Air was outside the scope of the European Merger Regulation.
The CFI said a public announcement by the Commission that an unnotified
merger did not satisfy the turnover thresholds of the merger regulation was
a decision reviewable by the Court. But it approved the Commission's
calculation of the turnover of Dan Air for the purposes of deciding whether
the merger had a Community dimension.
On October 23 1992, BA and Davis and Newman, owners of Dan Air, agreed BA
would purchase Dan Air's scheduled services. Davis and Newman agreed to sell
or discontinue Dan Air's charter business as a condition of the deal. Before
completion on November 8, the charter service was discontinued.
On October 30 1992, the European competition commissioner's press spokesman
made a public announcement, reported by Agence Europe, that the merger was
not of Community dimension as one of the quantitative thresholds fixed by
the merger regulation was not reached.
In calculating turnover, the Commission had used only the turnover in the
last available accounts relating to the scheduled services business bought
by BA, excluding the turnover of the charter business.
On November 2, the UK's trade and industry secretary decided not to refer
the deal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Air France wrote to the European Commission disputing the turnover
calculation and the conclusion that the merger regulation did not apply. The
competition commissioner confirmed the Commission's position.
Shortly afterwards, Belgium asked the Commission to investigate the impact
of the merger on the Belgian market in accordance with merger regulation
rules permiting a member country to make such a request when a merger does
not have a Community dimension. On February 17 last year the Commission
ruled the merger did not create or reinforce a dominant position in Belgium.
Air France challenged the Commission's announcement that the merger did not
have a Community dimension before the CFI.
The Commission asked the court to dismiss the appeal as inadmissible on four
grounds: the announcement was not a decision because it had no legal
effects; its form was inconsistent with its being a binding decision; there
were other more appropriate proceedings available to Air France at EC and
national level; and, even if the announcement was a decision, it was not of
direct or individual concern to Air France.
The CFI ruled the appeal admissible, rejecting all the Commission's
arguments. Two aspects of the Court's decision are particularly significant.
First, it said it did not matter that the merger had not been notified, nor
that the announcement was not a formal decision taken under the regulation.
Second, the court found the decision was of direct and individual concern to
Air France because it was a competitor in the relevant market.
The CFI found against Air France on the issues of substance, however. The
underlying question was whether the Commission had correctly interpreted the
turnover calculation rules. Air France said it should have included the
charter business turnover. But the CFI said the Commission had correctly
interpreted the rules.
The general rule on turnover calculation required the Commission to take
into account the turnover of the undertakings concerned by the merger as
reported in the most recent published accounts. However, an exception
existed where only part of a business was being sold. In those circumstances
the Commission may only take into account the turnover of that part of the
business actually sold. It did not matter that the exception did not
expressly refer to the cessation of part of a business prior to merger as in
the BA-Dan Air case.

FT  12 APR 94 / Business and the Law: Too shallow a pool - City solicitors
find it hard to qualify as judges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business has become accustomed to the expense of commercial litigation in
the English High Court. Now a survey of City lawyers, in Legal Business
magazine, suggests the overall standard of High Court judges is so poor that
businesses are no longer getting value for their money.
This is not only of concern to leading City law firms and their clients  -
it also threatens to damage London's reputation as a centre for
international litigation. The Commercial Court, which deals with
international trading and commercial disputes, contributes hundreds of
millions of pounds each year to UK invisible earnings.
The current system of drawing High Court judges from the ranks of leading
QCs is held to blame. There are not enough senior barristers of the right
quality prepared to serve on the bench. Many are unwilling to give up
lucrative careers at the commercial Bar for a High Court judge's salary of
Pounds 95,051 a year and the promise of a pension. According to the survey,
eight of the 35 QCs offered High Court judgeships last year said no.
The solution advocated by many lawyers is to widen the pool from which High
Court judges are chosen to include solicitors, and in particular to make use
of the specialist knowledge and expertise of City solicitors in handling
complex commercial litigation.
A report by the City of London Solicitors' Company, the City lawyers'
representative body, published this week endorses that view. It calls for
fundamental changes to the present judicial appointments system to make it
easier for City solicitors to be appointed High Court judges.
What do City solicitors have to offer? Approximately 5,000 practise in the
City - the home of the 11 largest law firms in the UK, which are instructed
by the biggest companies in the country.
The report says the City has a pool of talent with specialised knowledge of
company and commercial law, banking, commercial property and commercial
litigation. City solicitors also have more commercial awareness, thanks to
their contact with business clients, and greater experience in the
management of litigation.
Specialised courts, such as the Commercial Court and the Official Referee's
court, have already cut delays and improved efficiency by adopting a
specialist emphasis, says the report. The speed of resolving a dispute is
quicker with a judge on the bench who is a specialist in the issues being
litigated.
As yet, however, there are no City solicitors sitting as High Court judges.
At the moment, the route for any solicitor to the High Court bench is long
and arduous.
The only realistic path begins with appointment as an assistant recorder for
at least three years. This is a part-time position: assistant recorders sit
for between 20 and 50 days a year. To qualify for appointment, applicants
must have had advocacy rights in the Crown or county courts for at least 10
years. The application process is lengthy and can take three years.
Solicitors then have to sit as recorders for not less than two years, and
probably at least three. This is also a part-time appointment, requiring
them to sit for between 20 and 50 days a year.
After a minimum of two years, they become eligible for the Circuit Bench.
After two years as a Circuit Judge (or 10 years' High Court advocacy rights)
they become eligible for the High Court bench.
Even the fastest moving candidates are unlikely to reach the High Court
bench in less than eight or nine years from application. Solicitors aiming
for the High Court therefore need to apply in their early 40s if they are to
achieve a full-time judicial appointment by the age of 50, and qualify for a
full pension under the new pension arrangements for the judiciary.
The report by the City of London Solicitors' Company says it is hard for any
solicitor to meet the requirements of this system, but it is almost
impossible for City solicitors. Most successful City solicitors expect to
become full partners between 34 and 38. Their early 40s, therefore, are the
time when their careers and their earning potential are likely to be at
their peak.
Most of them have other commitments in the running of their firms at that
stage. Many find it hard enough to squeeze in a holiday, without committing
between 20 and 50 days a year to sitting as an assistant recorder or
recorder.
The current system also ignores partnership pressures. However relaxed a
partnership may be, the cost to any firm of one partner embarking on the
path to full-time judicial appointment in the early 40s is likely to be
prohibitive.
The Solicitors' Company believes several changes are needed:
The system needs to be more flexible, so that solicitors in their early 50s
who are winding down their City practices can offer some of their experience
to the bench at the point in their careers when they are best able to do so.
To achieve this, the system has to allow City solicitors to be appointed
directly to full-time judicial posts. In theory, the report says, there is
no reason why suitably qualified solicitors should not be appointed directly
to the High Court. There is a need for more specialised courts. At present,
judges are not assigned to the courts to which they are best suited, and
cases are not allocated to the judges best suited to hear them. City
solicitors with specialist knowledge should be allocated to courts that deal
with disputes in areas in which they have expertise.
The present system for vetting candidates for the High Court bench, which
places undue reliance on the views of the serving judiciary and senior
members of the Bar, should be abolished and replaced with a Judicial
Appointments Commission, made up of lawyers and lay people.
Although the Law Society has agreed to help the Lord Chancellor's Department
in assessing solicitor candidates for judicial office, the report says it
knows far too little about individual solicitors and their practices for its
opinion to be of much value. An independent vetting procedure is therefore
needed.
The solicitors' company wants judges to be able to return to private
practice after serving on the bench. Abandoning practice has become a
condition of appointment to the bench for no apparent good reason, it says.
Both sides of the profession could benefit if judges returned to practice or
took up academic positions or posts in commerce and industry. This happens
in other common law jurisdictions, such as Canada and Scotland, and could
encourage those reluctant to give up lucrative practices to offer their
services, albeit for a limited time.
The report concludes that, if the Lord Chancellor's Department agrees that
City solicitors have a potentially valuable role to play in the judiciary,
it should make the appropriate changes to the system. It cannot continue to
expect City solicitors to fit in with a system designed primarily to
accommodate members of the Bar.

FT  12 APR 94 / Business and the Law: Backing for new insolvency procedure -
Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Law Society has endorsed the introduction into English insolvency law of
a 'corporate voluntary arrangement' procedure, under which there would be a
moratorium on creditors' rights prior to a creditors' meeting to consider
the CVA proposals.
The small number of administrations and CVAs since the 1986 Insolvency Act
came into force is seen as evidence of the absence of a company rescue
culture in the UK. However, the Law Society's company and commercial law
committee warns that the number of successful rescues as a consequence of
CVAs is likely to be small.
Many companies became victims of the recent UK recession because of changes
in fundamental economic factors, for which existing rescue procedures
provide no relief, the committee says.
It suggests, therefore, a limit on the extent to which CVAs should take
precedence over existing insolvency procedures. The rights of
floating-charge holders, for instance, should not be altered radically
unless it is clear that any changes will not diminish companies' ability to
raise finance. The committee also wants checks imposed on directors during
the moratorium to prevent them from using the CVA to retain control of their
company for longer than is appropriate.

analysts covering global telecommunications.
SBC lacks expertise in this area and has apparently been on the look-out for
a suitable candidate for a while. Ryder, 46, will be head of global
telecommunications research, working with a handful of analysts - still to
be appointed. The bank sees 'telecommunications and media as one of the
sectors which will have a great future'.
Ryder had a high profile at Salomon Brothers, his home for the last seven
years, where he was global co-ordinator of telecommunications research. He
points out that with some Dollars 40bn worth of telecoms issuance expected
in Europe as a result of privatisations over the next three years, the area
is 'a big apple to take a bite out of'.

it was in a troubled period - by Rodney Galpin, its former chairman.
Nicolle, 59, is retiring from Standard Chartered. Wilson has had a long
career with the bank, joining in 1961 and serving in India, Singapore, the
US, South Korea and Malaysia before becoming chief executive Hong Kong in
1991.
Since September 1992 he has been general manager for the Middle East and

FT  12 APR 94 / People: Koerfer to chair Sutherland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sutherland &amp; Partners, the small Edinburgh stockbroking house which says it
is the only institutional broker headquartered in Scotland, has appointed a
Swiss as its chairman. He is Patrick Koerfer, a London-based director of the
Swiss fund manager Global Asset Management.
'We could have done what other companies here do and appoint a Scottish
dignitary,' says Ken Brown, the managing director, 'but we felt that with
our international orientation Patrick Koerfer would be more valuable to us.'
Sutherland was founded in late 1989 to provide international soft commission
services to UK clients and independent research to international clients.
That formula was only partially successful and in 1991 Roderick Sutherland,
the founder, resigned as ceo. He ceased to be non-executive chairman last
February, since when there has been no chairman.
Since 1992 Sutherland &amp; Partners, which employs 25 people, has concentrated
on execution-only dealing, traditional advisory stockbroking and
research-based broking in the whisky, retail and pharmaceutical sectors. Its
institutional clients are in continental Europe and the US as well as the
UK.
Brown says the company is based in Scotland 'because that is where we all
want to live'. The fact that Edinburgh is not a major stockbroking centre
offers complete discretion compared with London, he says. 'There is none of
the tittle-tattle you get in London. You can do a deal here without people
getting wind of it.'
Koerfer, who is in his 50s, will bring to the company his ability to
introduce Sutherland to European clients and will accompany Sutherland
executives on forays on the continent.

FT  12 APR 94 / People: Barry moves up at Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK pharmaceuticals company Wellcome is merging the management of its entire
research, development and medical (RD&amp;M) operations into one unit under
David Barry.
He takes over from Trevor Jones, formerly head of RD&amp;M outside the US.
Jones, 51, moves to Wellcome's corporate headquarters to work with chairman
John Robb on what the company calls 'strategic projects' from May 1.
Wellcome says the changes bring the company into line with the rest of the
industry where one head of R&amp;D is the norm.
Barry, 50, most recently held the post of vice president of RD&amp;M at
Wellcome's US operation Burroughs Wellcome. He has been a main board
director since 1989, having joined Burroughs Wellcome in 1977. Previously he
was a surgeon who worked for the US Food and Drug Administration.

Elliott Bernerd, the 48-year-old property developer, has recruited Sir Alan
Hardcastle, 60, a former head of the government's accountancy service, as a
non-executive director of his latest quoted property venture - Chelsfield.
Sir Alan, who stepped down from the Treasury last September, is a former
senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick. He is currently chairman of the
regulatory board of Lloyd's of London and is a member of the Bank of
England's board of banking supervision.
Sir Alan, who held the title of chief accountancy adviser at the Treasury,
will be chairman of Chelsfield's audit committee. The committee, made up
solely of Chelsfield's non-executive directors, will receive and review
reports from the management and the auditors relating to the accounts and
the group's internal control systems.
Bernerd, who owns 30 per cent of Chelsfield which he brought to the stock
market at the end of last year, says that since several of Chelsfield's
non-executive directors are based overseas, he had been keen to recruit
someone based in the United Kingdom.

FT  12 APR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Seeking credibility for
quality standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the process of certifying companies with the UK's BS5750 quality
assurance standard and its international equivalent, ISO9000, losing its
credibility?
The European Commission is concerned that too many companies see
certification as an end in itself rather than a step towards improving
quality and is seeking support for the idea that improving competitiveness,
not awarding certificates, is what matters. Brussels' interest will be
welcomed by many smaller companies.
In little over a decade, BS5750 has been adopted by more than 28,000
companies. Over 30 bodies are now qualified to issue certificates, including
the British Standards Institution which drew up the standard. Countless
consultants help companies to prepare and maintain their certification. Yet
despite being designed to improve British industrial competitiveness, the
standard has become a nightmare for many small and medium-sized enterprises.
Critics say it is expensive, bureaucratic, and difficult to set up and
maintain. Some complain that while it was designed for manufacturers, the
standard lacks relevance for many smaller companies which are providers of
services.
This said, there are many companies that have adopted the standards and
successfully used the certification structure as part of a quality
improvement programme. For them certification is a step towards Total
Quality Management, the approach that focuses all an organisation's efforts
on what the customer wants.
But the critics say there are many other companies which have been peddled
an inappropriate standard by self-interested consultants and certification
bodies. Others, they say, have bought into certification solely to avoid
being dropped from a supplier's preferred list or so they can claim to be
'quality' companies for marketing purposes.
Jacques McMillan, head of the Commission unit in Directorate-General 111 in
charge of quality policy and certification, says: 'There are many
enterprises going bust where the last flag as they go under is their
certificate. I am trying to put it back in perspective so those companies
that actually need it should go for it and those that don't shouldn't. It
should not be thrust down the throats of small and medium-sized companies.'
These forthright views appear to have been sanitised in the paper called
Elements of Community Quality Policy, now circulating member states. But
McMillan hopes ministers late this year will look at the issue again in the
context of examining ways to increase Europe's competitiveness.
The Commission's move has received a guarded welcome from the Brussels-based
European Foundation for Quality Management, set up six years ago by 14
captains of European industry, including Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of BT.
'I welcome the Commission coming out with the beginnings of a quality
strategy for Europe,' said John King, EFQM director-general.
'But the major challenge is getting the message to the senior management of
European businesses that they have to be committed to quality policies and
not simply satisfied with product certification as represented by BS5750 and
ISO9000,' he said.
Critics say that quality assurance standards often do little more than
document existing procedures against which the company is subsequently
checked. A uniformity of process is achieved, but one that might be leading
to uniformly poor quality products. Only if management decides to focus on
quality issues is there any chance they will improve.
Certification has been abused - or mistrusted - by some larger companies as
well. McMillan says there are cases where large manufacturers are demanding
certification from suppliers but continue to insist on doing their own
quality audits, too.
Some companies use certification as an arbitrary way of cutting down their
supplier lists. This also undermines the value of the certificates awarded
to companies that are genuinely seeking to improve their competitiveness
through better quality.
Some US companies that have reluctantly adopted the ISO9000 standard have
done so because they feel that without certification they will be barred
entry to European Union markets.
Faced with uncertainty about who should seek certification, some companies
may have fallen prey to certification salesmen. 'They (companies) are not
being helped by the certification environment,' says McMillan.
'It is a lucrative environment for consultants and certifiers. If there is
no coherent policy it is difficult for some to know what to do because they
are hearing so many different voices.'
In the UK there is some hope of a helping hand through the maze. The BSI
will this week unveil a scheme it says will make BS5750 registration simpler
and cheaper.

FT  12 APR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Bring on the clones - How
franchising can help companies grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next weekend thousands of potential businessmen and women will flock to the
Spring National Franchise Exhibition at London's Olympia. For many the
exhibition may be the first step towards running their own business, be it a
fast food franchise, a printing company or a pawnbroker.
But it is also a first step for some of the companies selling franchises.
Nearly 50 years after franchising started in the US, there are signs that
large and small companies alike recognise its potential for accelerating
growth.
The success of chains like McDonald's, Burger King and Holiday Inn is plain
to see. Holiday Inn has grown from nowhere to more than 1,500 hotels in 20
years, a growth rate that would have been impossible if all the hotels had
been financed by the group.
In the UK franchising has had a slower start. But moves by Securicor Pony
Express, the same-day parcel delivery service, Yule Catto, the chemicals
company, and a host of smaller companies, demonstrate how franchising is
catching on.
Securicor Pony Express leads the same-day market through the 35 branches
which it owns; it is also about to sell a similar number of franchises. Tony
Mundella, national franchising manager, says Securicor was impressed by the
way franchising worked for other parcel delivery groups like Business Post,
Amtrak and Interlink Express.
Like many companies attracted to franchising, Securicor wants to involve
people who would be more highly motivated than employed managers. An equally
powerful motive is the realisation that customers need and demand constantly
improving levels of service. 'The general feeling is that the well-run
franchise will deliver higher degrees of service than an operator-owned
outlet,' says Sinclair Beecham, managing director of Pret a Manger, the
London sandwich chain that has just begun selling franchises.
Yule Catto became a franchisor for a similar reason. Three years ago its
Neilsen car care line was becoming a tired brand. Sales were stagnating,
despite extra marketing effort, and the customers were demanding more of a
just-in-time service - smaller quantities delivered more frequently.
Yule Catto decided it was too expensive to meet this customer demand with
its managed sales force and started converting to a franchised sales team.
Each franchisee will buy stock from Yule Catto and sell from seven-tonne
trucks, or mobile showrooms, in 75 territories around the UK.
Chris Gater, franchising manager, says Yule Catto had to have deep pockets
because converting to franchising is a long-term investment. In the
transition, profits have been hit by the continuing overhead of the old
sales team, a fall in the value of sales (to give franchisees their margin)
and the cost of setting up the franchise infrastructure.
But despite the distractions Neilsen has responded with a 20 per cent
increase in sales volume. 'It is not easy and it is expensive,' he says.
'But it will work.'
Converting part of the company to franchising is not a decision to be taken
lightly. 'Franchising is not the easiest way of running a business,' says
Brian Smart, director of the British Franchising Association.
For one reason, franchising can create a culture clash. Holland &amp; Barrett,
the health food chain, took the franchising route in the 1980s but abruptly
stopped in 1987. The group is widely seen to have had trouble handling
independent franchisees within a culture established to manage
corporately-owned shops.
Tie Rack, which has had a mixed franchising record, had similar problems.
'When it works it works very well because you have a highly motivated
group,' says Nigel McGinley, chief executive. But the group could not always
control its franchisees and now prefers to open new stores in the UK under
its own management.
Such well-documented cases explain why many new franchisors are making only
cautious forays into franchising. Pret a Manger, which owns 17 sandwich
shops in London, has decided to roll out its brand across the country, but
is testing the formula initially in only four franchises.
'We are holding at that level till we understand the difference between a
business managing its own shops and one managing a franchisee,' says
Beecham, who opened the first shop with chairman Julian Metcalfe in 1986.
Some companies that set out with the intention of building a franchising
network from scratch make an equally cautious start. Prontaprint, which
started 20 years ago and has 260 high street copier shops, took three years
establishing its system and reputation before selling franchises.
Signs Express, a Norwich-based sign maker, followed a similar route. David
Corbett, managing director, says the company slugged it out for three years
from one shop against 59 local competitors before selling the first
franchise last year. He sold 11 franchises by the end of the second year,
wants 40 at the end of this year and plans on 70 by the end of the fourth
year.
Marks and Spencer, which has 74 franchises overseas, uses the system as a
way of testing new markets. But for smaller companies, the main reason for
becoming a franchisor is to finance a faster rate of growth.
As such the growing company does not have to buy or lease new outlets or
finance inventory. It also gains from bulk buying of products, services and
advertising, and has lower head office overheads; it needs no distribution
system and has no sales force to manage.
Martin Mendelsohn, partner at solicitors Jaques &amp; Lewis, believes many more
companies could consider franchising. 'As a rule of thumb any business that
has the potential of being run under management has the potential of being
run as a franchise,' he says.
The reason more do not follow this route is a lack of understanding of how
to set up a franchise infrastructure, Mendelsohn suggests. 'You are asking
the franchisee to set up a business as an independent business but you are
asking them to run it within a controlled environment. It is a conflict
situation.' Visitors to Olympia would do well to remember that message.

FT  12 APR 94 / Technology: Mainframe reborn - IBM is jumping on the
client/server bandwagon by adapting its existing technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the corporate computing world, the mainframe computer is the symbol of a
bygone era; a legacy of the days when the data processing department
strictly controlled access to computers housed in a big air-conditioned
glass room.
Networks of low-cost personal computers brought democracy to information
processing in the 1980s, putting computers at the command of individuals.
Yet, as many companies are finding out, managing that democracy is more
complicated and expensive than they expected.
Open 'client/server' computing has not achieved the nirvana of lower costs
and greater efficiencies that the computer industry promised. Instead,
companies face continuing problems with incompatibility between computers,
difficulty keeping track of corporate data and rising costs for training and
systems management.
Fully 80 per cent of total client/server computer costs occur after the
initial purchases of hardware and software, according to US-based Gartner
Group, a computer industry market research company. A single Dollars 3,000
(Pounds 2,054) personal computer linked to a client/server network costs
about Dollars 40,000 over its five-year life cycle when the costs of
training, administration, maintenance and other factors are tallied, the
researchers estimate.
Even die-hard networking advocates such as Sun Microsystems, the workstation
market leader, now recognise the need for some measure of centralised
control over distributed computing systems. 'You have to manage the network
like a mainframe,' says Curt Wozniak, Sun's marketing vice-president. He
encourages customers to 'pull data back into controlled areas'.
Stepping into this milieu with a new-found determination to establish itself
as a leader in the client/server market, International Business Machines has
seen opportunities to bring its mainframe-world expertise to bear on the
complex problems of enterprise-wide, client/server computing.
'Implementing client/server (computing) in a real live customer environment
has turned out to be rife with problems. And those problems open a very wide
door of opportunity for IBM,' says Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman and chief
executive.
Gerstner's remarks signal a significant change of heart at IBM, the
mainframe computer market leader. Rather than minimising the significance of
client/server computing, as it has in the past, IBM is finally jumping on
the bandwagon.
A critical element of IBM's strategy is to create links between the old
world of mainframes and the new world of client/server computing. Last week
it introduced a new generation of 'large-scale computers' (no longer called
mainframes) specifically designed to work as 'servers' on networks.
In a radical departure from traditional mainframe designs, the new IBM
systems are built on microprocessor chips manufactured using the same
semiconductor technology as those found in personal computers. These
powerful chips are linked to work in parallel on a computing task, like a
fleet of tugs pulling an ocean liner.
The advantages of parallel processing are twofold. Customers can increase
the power of a parallel processing system in small increments by adding a
few processors, rather than having to purchase expensive mainframe upgrades.
Also, because the new IBM parallel systems are based on microprocessor
chips, they can be expected to follow similar price decline and performance
improvement trends to those seen in the personal computer and workstation
segments of the market.
The most important new offerings from IBM are two parallel computing servers
built around chips that emulate the brains of the company's traditional
mainframe products. The S/390 parallel transaction server and the S/390
parallel query server can run the same software as IBM's traditional
mainframe computers, hiding the complexities of parallel processing from
users and software developers.
The transaction server is designed for applications such as credit card
processing, ticketing and banking. The query server elicits new information
from existing data. A company might, for example, mine its customer database
for clues to the potential of a product.
The new servers can be coupled to existing IBM mainframe computers so that
the new and old machines work together like a single computer, automatically
balancing the workload and sharing data.
This facility, which IBM calls the parallel sysplex, is 'as significant as
any technology we have announced since the introduction of the 360 (the
first IBM mainframe 30 years ago', says Ned Donofrio, IBM vice-president and
general manager of the large-scale computing division.
The parallel servers give the mainframe a new lease of life, he explains.
With the introduction of a new 10-processor mainframe last week, IBM's line
of conventional mainframes may have reached its peak. 'We are not sure if we
can go to 12 or 14, but we are sure that the way we are scaling (the
parallel systems) will enable us to move to almost limitless numbers of
microprocessors while preserving all of the programming, all of the skill
and the infrastructure that our mainframe customers have built,' says
Donofrio.
'These systems deliver what customers tell me they want: lower cost, more
power and protection of their existing Dollars 1 trillion investment in
software,' he adds.
Indeed, the high prices of mainframe hardware and software, along with the
need to link different types of computers in a seamless network, have
created a strong impetus behind the shift to client/server computing. By
reducing mainframe hardware and software prices IBM might aim to slow the
trend away from mainframe computers.
Yet IBM is no longer counting on client/server computing being a temporary
fad. Instead, it has designed its new parallel processors to link to
networks. The company last week announced a new version of its mainframe
computer operating system, MVS, with 'open' features that will enable
mainframes to run the Unix applications favoured in client/server systems.
IBM also introduced a Unix-based 'Powerparallel' system, based on the same
microprocessor technology that it uses in its latest workstations. The SP2
is an outgrowth of IBM's massively parallel supercomputer, introduced a year
ago. The new computer will run 'nearly all' of the 10,000 applications
programs available for AIX, IBM's version of Unix.
By applying the latest semiconductor and software technologies to
large-scale computers, IBM has created a new perspective on the benefits of
client/server computing. Rather than killing off mainframe computers,
client/server networks may increasingly incorporate mainframe-like features
and some mainframe computers.

FT  12 APR 94 / Technology: Costly resistance to telecommuting - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advances in technology make it easier for many companies to convert some of
their office staff into telecommuters. They thereby gain a competitive
advantage through lower operating costs and more productive staff.
But while technology such as compact desktop computers, E-mail and fax
machines makes fitting telecommuters into the office network relatively easy
 -and cheap video conferencing systems are just around the corner -
management attitudes are still stuck in the past.
Jack Nilles, president of California-based management consultants Jalla
International and the person who coined the term telecommuter more than 20
years ago, says many managers do not know how to supervise staff unless they
can see them.
In telecommuting (or teleworking) employees come into the office one or two
days a week and spend the rest of their time working from home. For
companies, there are clear advantages. Supervision of staff is reduced and
savings can be made on overheads such as office space and parking space.
Happier staff means lower turnover and thus savings from reduced recruitment
and training costs. And teleworkers tend to work harder and longer hours
when at home. For staff working mainly from home, the benefits are obvious:
more productive time with less commuting; lower travelling costs; and
control over their own working time.
Companies that can learn to manage teleworkers are thus likely to achieve
greater flexibility in their operations. But teleworking should not be seen
as simply a more progressive way of working. Moving workers into the home
also means transferring the responsibilities of maintaining an office space
and certain management functions to the teleworker. Once teleworkers are
established, they are just one step nearer the status of independent
contractors.
By employing such contractors, companies transfer even more responsibilities
to the teleworker - tax payments and, more importantly in the US, individual
responsibility for health benefits, a major business cost. Companies also
gain greater flexibility in hiring and firing as many teleworking contracts
are limited to single projects. Already in the US, temporary workers and
independent contractors are the fastest-growing sector of the labour market.
While this growth is mostly in the blue-collar sector, telecommuting
technologies are now helping to turn many white-collar and professional
workers into independent contractors. Book publishers are an example of this
trend. Many now contract out most of their requirements such as editing,
book layout and design to a host of independent contractors.
As the US and Europe lay the foundations for electronic information
superhighways, many other companies in different sectors will be able to
convert staff roles into independent contractors. Initially, such
contractors will be able to earn higher incomes than their office-bound
colleagues tied to one employer. But the technology enabling them to work
from idyllic countryside locations will result in competition among
contractors - and from locations around the world.
In the US, there are several incentives for companies to increase their
teleworkers. The recent earthquake in southern California and the damage to
its motorways has led to a rise in teleworking in an area that already had a
high proportion to begin with.
The US Clean Air Act specifies that companies with more than 100 staff in 11
US states with high air pollution must seek ways of reducing employee car
use or face stiff fines. Many companies complain about the increased burden
of complying with such regulations. But those that view this as an
opportunity to employ more telecommuters will learn valuable lessons on how
to manage a mixed workforce. Rival European companies should keep a close
eye on what this does to US productivity.

FT  12 APR 94 / Technology: Speedy business tool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Multimedia has been hyped mostly as a provider of news and entertainment
rather than a help for business.
But some companies have turned to this combination of voice, pictures and
text - using computers, telephones and video - to speed up operations and
save costs. Frost &amp; Sullivan, the US market researcher, forecasts a
multimedia market in Europe of Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds 2.5bn) by 1996, with
the fastest growth in desktop systems.
One of the first UK companies to use multimedia as a business tool is
Colorgraphic, which produces direct marketing and sales promotion leaflets.
It turned to this technology to improve communications with agents and
customers in continental Europe, especially in Germany and the Netherlands,
and so lift exports.
Colorgraphic is the first European user of the Visit (visually interactive
technology) system from Canada's Northern Telecom. The UK company's products
are all of different designs. Agreeing these with clients can take time,
especially if changes are needed. Now, by communicating visually and
verbally through Visit and putting designs on screen, the process from
design to printing agreement can be completed in hours rather than days.
'Everything we do starts as a reel of white paper but ends as an intricate
finished product,' says Michael Hunter, chief executive. Colorgraphic wants
more foreign customers. 'Often, we or they had to hop on a plane. Courier
costs were Pounds 25,000 a year - air fares cost the same and hotel bills
were high. This was about Pounds 100,000 and we will save a lot of that.'
Colorgraphic, whose main competitors are in Germany, spent Pounds 250,000 on
Visit and communications technology. 'It's much easier to make something
clear,' says Armin Kleiss, production manager at ECM, its Dutch agent. 'We
can show what a product is like while we talk about it.'

FT  12 APR 94 / Construction forecast best since 1989
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most optimistic forecast for construction output for five years was
published yesterday by the National Council of Building Material Producers.
It follows a string of industry and government statistics pointing to a
marked improvement in construction orders since last autumn, particularly
for housebuilding.
The council, which represents companies with a combined annual turnover of
more than Pounds 30bn, expects the value of UK construction output, measured
in constant 1990 prices, to rise by 2 per cent this year and by a further
2.5 per cent in 1995.
That is a great improvement on the council's previous forecast, published in
December, when it expected output to rise by 0.5 per cent this year and 2
per cent in 1995.
It expects output to rise by a further 2.5 per cent in 1996 as the recovery
in housebuilding spreads to other sectors of the industry. It says repair
and maintenance work will lead the way in the private sector.
Public-spending reductions previously announced by government will reduce
investment in infrastructure and public-sector housing. Total output in 1996
would be 6 per cent lower than at the peak in 1990, says the council.
There is concern that tax increases and government spending cuts may yet
slow the pace of recovery.
Mr Peter Roberts, chairman of the forecasting panel and a director of IMI
metals group, said: 'The impact that higher taxes will have on confidence
remains unclear and government must be ready to meet any substantial
hesitation in consumer expenditure growth with further reductions in
interest rates.'
The increased optimism was due to the recovery in housebuilding and a higher
than expected rise in private commercial construction orders for offices,
shops, leisure and sports facilities.
That was helped by an increase in demand for City of London office space
after last April's IRA bomb blast. Retail construction also increased in
spite of a decline in orders for out-of-town developments.
Commercial construction was expected to rise by 2 per cent this year, by 5
per cent in 1995 and by 7 per cent in 1996. The council had forecast a
further 5 per cent fall in commercial activity this year and only a 4 per
cent rise in 1995.
The forecast for starts made by builders on private-sector homes has been
increased from 150,000 to 160,000 this year and from 160,000 to 175,000 in
1995. Public-sector housing output, however, is expected to fall by 9 per
cent in 1995 and 1.5 per cent in 1996.

FT  12 APR 94 / More NHS trusts 'fail to meet cash targets'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many hospital and community trusts are failing to meet government financial
targets, and 'significantly more' failed in 1992-93 than in the previous
year, a report said yesterday.
Analysis of the early years of National Health Service trust development
found that 47 per cent of first-wave trusts failed to meet the government's
target of earning a real return on capital of at least 6 per cent. This
compared with 17 per cent failing to meet the target the previous year.
The number of trusts that failed to break even or operate within borrowing
limits had also increased, The Fourth Newchurch Guide to NHS Trusts said. It
also found that systems for monitoring and measuring performance of trusts
had failed to keep pace with their rapid growth.
There are about 400 trusts with incomes ranging from Pounds 15m to Pounds
230m. From this month NHS trusts are responsible for delivering Pounds 17bn
of healthcare - equivalent to 7 per cent of total government spending.
However, the report noted that the direction and pace of change of the NHS
reforms had taken both policy makers and managers by surprise. It said
fundamental changes would not go smoothly unless they were made to work for
the benefit of patients.
For trusts to succeed, managers would have to:
Make information about their activities more available. Have guidelines on
mergers of trusts which set out the benefits to patients.
Have a tighter financial-reporting regime.
Have clear ideas on how to merge different kinds of trusts.

FT  12 APR 94 / One in 20 homes reported empty
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One in 20 of all homes is empty - the highest number for a decade - says a
report by the Empty Homes Agency, published yesterday.
During the same period the number of households accepted as homeless doubled
to 142,000.
While local councils have filled more of their empty homes, the number of
empty private-sector homes has risen steadily, according to the study. It
says millions of pounds is spent each year on the maintenance, insurance and
security of empty homes, in spite of acute demand for affordable rented
accommodation.
Mr Bob Lawrence of the Empty Homes Agency said: 'These unused assets are
worth over Pounds 25bn. Bringing just 10 per cent of the 864,000 empty homes
back into use would have a very significant impact on the problems of
homelessness.'
The figures show that 764,000 private-sector homes are empty compared with
541,000 in 1983.
Councils are the least wasteful landlords, with only 1.9 per cent of their
housing stock empty, followed by housing associations with 2.4 per cent of
properties not lived in.
In contrast, 15 per cent of homes owned or supervised by government
departments are not being used. But the total standing empty - 15,800 - has
been reduced.
Worries about regaining possession, a reluctance to rent and a lack of
awareness of grants to tackle repairs have contributed to the situation.
The report calls for more publicity to be given to the benefits of assured
shorthold tenancies, and a simplification of the range of grants available.
It also says councils should develop strategies to deal with empty
properties.

FT  12 APR 94 / Store groups defy slow death: Sears' Pounds 50m plan to
revamp Selfridges in Oxford Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail analysts have long predicted the slow death of the department store,
killed off by the new generation of superstores and cut-price warehouses.
But the news that Sears is to spend Pounds 50m revamping its Selfridges
store in London's Oxford Street suggests they may be premature.
The evidence does not end there. Both the Allders and House of Fraser store
groups have enjoyed highly successful flotations. House of Fraser is
spending Pounds 50m on refurbishing its chain - including the flagship
Dickins &amp; Jones on Regent Street - and its former owners, the Fayeds,
recently completed a five-year, Pounds 100m refurbishment of Harrods.
At Selfridges, work is already progressing on creating a new escalator well
at the store's west end, sweeping up from the basement to the top floor.
The escalators are so big they will have to be lowered into place through
the roof. Last year Pounds 12.6m was spent on similar escalators at the
store's eastern end.
In total Sears, which acquired Selfridges in 1965, will have spent more than
Pounds 60m on it in four years.
Mr Liam Strong, Sears chief executive, admits that this is a large sum for
one store, but he is confident of earning a return.
He says: 'Selfridges makes a better return on capital than other parts of
the business. And we see this as investment in the Selfridges brand. If we
can make Selfridges a pre-eminent store, we can exploit the brand in other
ways.'
The 450,000 sq ft store remains a tourist attraction. But sales densities
lag behind those of other Oxford Street stores.
One problem is the irregularly shaped building, with a mass of columns which
obscure eyelines. A system of infra-red sensors called Shoppertrak, which
monitors customer movements, found shoppers did not circulate easily.
Mr Tim Daniels, Selfridges managing director, says fewer than 5 per cent of
shoppers ever visit the top floor. Hence half the investment will be spent
on structural changes.
As well as the east and west escalators, new ones will be built at the rear
of the store and the central escalators will be rebuilt. Columns will be
ripped out to create a 12-foot wide gangway running the length of each floor
from east to west escalators.
The haphazard lay-out, with related products often scattered around six
floors, will be reorganised.
The first floor will be devoted to menswear, sporting goods, and a
children's department. The second and third floors will be devoted to
women's wear, and the fourth to furniture.
Further investment will go into new fittings.
Selfridges expects a substantial increase in sales. Last year's new
escalators alone brought an increase of 15 per cent more than the store-wide
average in departments near the escalators.
'This is the age of the department store,' insists Mr Daniels.
'People come to us because of our range and quality, and because we are a
very timeefficient way of shopping.'

FT  12 APR 94 / Tighter video hire conditions planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Children will be required to produce evidence of age before hiring
particular videos, under a government plan expected to be announced today.
The idea, proposed by the British Board of Film Classification, is put
forward as Mr David Alton, the Liberal Democrat MP, tries to change the law
to ban home videos that are inappropriate for children or that may harm them
psychologically.
Critics of the Alton amendment, including Mr James Ferman, director of the
BBFC, believe it is too widely drawn to be workable.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is expected instead to tighten the
conditions under which young children might gain access to videos aimed at
those aged over 15 or 18.
Conditions for video rental would resemble those for buying fireworks or
alcohol, where evidence of age can be sought. At the moment the issue of age
tends to be left to the judgment of video shop staff.
Mr Ferman also said yesterday that the BBFC planned to extend its film
classification for 12-year-olds to video for the first time.
The BBFC director was talking as the board launched the first study into the
viewing habits for young offenders for more than 20 years.
The study, carried out by the Policy Studies Institute, found little
difference in the viewing habits of a group of 78 young offenders aged from
12 to 18 and a representative sample of more than 500 schoolchildren of a
similar age. Soap operas and similar dramas dominated the viewing of both
groups, although the young offenders showed a marked preference for The
Bill, the ITV police series. The favourite film among both the male
offenders and the schoolboys was Terminator 2: Judgement Day.
The study also found that the offenders had less access to television, video
and other equipment than other children, probably because they came from
poor and disrupted families.
The report, by Ms Ann Hagell and Mr Tim Newburn, suggested that, in both
groups, those aged under 18 had access to films classified for those aged
over 18.

FT  12 APR 94 / Schools quango draws criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Both rightwing and leftwing critics attacked the launch yesterday of the
Funding Agency for Schools, the quango which will distribute funds to
grant-maintained schools.
It will have full or shared responsibility for secondary school provision in
44 local authorities in England, and powers over planning and closures, as
well as financial monitoring for schools which have opted out of local
authority control. So far, 829 of 24,503 schools in England and Wales have
done so.
The rightwing Centre for Policy Studies attacked the government's policy,
claiming that schools were not allowed to develop their own character once
they had opted out. It said all schools should be made grant-maintained.
Mr Brian Sherratt, head of Great Barr grant-maintained school in Birmingham,
said the new funding agency could worsen bureaucratic constraints and
're-create the kind of bureaucracy from which grant-maintained schools opted
out'. He attacked as 'counter-productive' education department regulations
forbidding new schools in areas where there are surplus school places.
Labour described the new quango as 'the last desperate attempt to prop up a
failing policy'. It claimed only 187 schools had held ballots on
grant-maintained status in the last two terms, compared with 444 in the same
two terms of the academic year 1992-93.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, said the agency would allow schools to
'plan confidently on the basis of a long and secure future'.

FT  12 APR 94 / Tecs get ready to grapple with wider picture: The question
of who looks after local schemes of regeneration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the next few weeks South and East Cheshire Training and Enterprise
Council will take the unusual step of enrolling its 16 directors - most of
them senior business executives - in an intensive two-day course on economic
development.
This year the government intends the 82 Tecs, which deliver state-funded
training in England and Wales, to focus more clearly on their role in
fostering enterprise and economic development.
It is a complex task, not least because of the need for employer-led Tecs to
work in effective partnerships with the other agencies involved, including
local authorities.
Mr Richard Guy, chief executive of South and East Cheshire Tec, said:
'Economic development is a specialist skill. It is difficult for our
non-executive Tec directors, even though they have developed a broad
strategy for business growth and wealth creation in our area, to focus on
this bigger picture without going through a training process.'
The Tecs' progress towards fulfilling their economic-development role in the
three years since they were set up has been difficult to monitor.
For one thing, it has been hard to agree measures. Many bodies other than
Tecs are involved in promoting business growth.
Some Tecs have been active, while others have made slow progress, preferring
to concentrate on training where there are strict contractual arrangements
with the government.
This year for the first time the government will ask Tecs to draw up
detailed three-year corporate plans, involving details of partnerships they
are forging, as a prelude to detailed negotiations with the government over
priorities.
Some of the funds Tecs have been given in the past for business support have
been absorbed into the Single Regeneration Budget, which this year will have
Pounds 100m to dispense.
The SRB draws together enterprise and regeneration programmes from four
government departments. Tecs, local authorities and other bodies such as
chambers of commerce have been told their bids will be viewed more
favourably if they have formed partnerships, with agreed local priorities.
It is a high-risk period for Tecs, which already have faced tough
'territorial' wars in the areas in which they have tried to form
partnerships. Tecs and local authorities do not necessarily have the same
priorities. Tecs see their role as promoting business growth and improving
skills while local authorities are more likely to be involved in
regeneration - promoting infrastructure and tackling social disadvantage.
Tecs fear that local authorities will swallow up the small amount of funds
available for regeneration, while local authorities fear that Tecs will be
the agents of government in stripping away even more of their powers.
Trust between Tecs and local authorities has not been promoted by the fact
that government guidelines for bidding for the SRB has left fluid who should
be the lead partner - partly because the government wants maximum
flexibility, but also because government departments do not agree over the
Tecs' role in relationship to bids for the SRB.
The Department of Trade and Industry wants Tecs to be a key player, whereas
the Department of Employment believes they should be the main bodies
involved in pulling together bids.
Mr Guy says Tecs' roles will vary. In some areas, particularly inner cities,
local authorities and development agencies could have a strong handle on
regeneration as well as promoting inward investment. A Tec's role would be
to improve skills and providing business support activities. In others the
Tec might play a more active part in bringing partners together.

FT  12 APR 94 / Water suppliers 'will issue bonds'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Water companies are expected to raise several billion pounds from the bond
markets to finance their capital spending, a leading environmental
investment house has said.
Mr David Owen, analyst at Ecofin, said that the tighter the price controls
imposed by Ofwat, the water regulator, the greater the amount companies
would seek to raise from the bond markets.
Next month Ofwat will tell the water companies in England and Wales the rate
at which they will be allowed to raise prices between 1995 and 2005.
Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, has been concerned that the cost of
complying with new environmental regulations means that water bills will
continue to rise much faster than inflation.
According to industry estimates, capital spending could amount to Pounds
40bn this decade. The companies have indicated to Ofwat that they want
annual price increases of 6 per cent a year on average to pay for these
improvements.
Mr Owen is preparing a report on the treatment of sewage sludge, one of the
most expensive parts of this programme. He said: 'The likelihood of lots of
rights issues (to pay for this spending) is low.'
Companies could be deterred from issuing shares to raise cash because
'institutions have been putting immense pressure on them to keep up dividend
growth', he said. But he still expected companies to issue shares for
acquisitions.
According to Ecofin's calculations, the outflow of cash from the 10 large
water and sewerage companies has been between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 1.5bn a
year since the year ending March 1992.
In the year ending March 1995 Mr Owen expects the cash outflow to be Pounds
956m.

<TEXT>
London is likely to pose Mr John Major's greatest local government electoral
test next month. The national media's traditional interest in the capital
will influence this, but there are also sound political reasons why London
should hog headlines.
Councillors facing re-election this year were elected in 1990, when the poll
tax, or community charge, was introduced. That helped condemn the
Conservatives to appalling results everywhere in England, apart from London.
There the 'flagship' rightwing boroughs of Wandsworth and Westminster, which
set the two lowest poll tax figures in England, saw strong swings towards
the Conservatives, while the party also took control of less publicised
boroughs, including Ealing and Brent. The poll tax, plus the alleged 'London
effect' which held that Londoners were uniquely annoyed by the antics of
'loony left' Labour councils, were held to blame.
The Conservatives must defend a sizeable presence in London, having taken 13
of the 32 boroughs at the last election.
Labour has regained Hillingdon in west London through by-elections, while
Brent and Ealing, along with Enfield, would all be vulnerable to a Labour
recovery.
Harrow (where the Liberal Democrats are the main rivals), Croydon (where the
Conservatives have 41 to Labour's 29) and Redbridge could all see the Tories
lose control if the night goes badly for them, while double-figure swings
would wrest control of Barnet, Bexley, and Bromley.
London also presents challenges for the Liberal Democrats, who hope to gain
the one seat they need for overall control of Kingston. They also have hopes
in several traditional Labour boroughs, including Waltham Forest in east
London, and two inner-London Labour strongholds - Lambeth and Southwark.
Tower Hamlets, where the ruling Liberal Democrats have been accused of
racism, is another test of strength.
Outside London the opposition parties are busy playing down expectations, as
their strong 1990 performance limits chances of further gains.
While all London councillors face re-election, only a third of metropolitan
council seats are up for election, along with a third of seats on 114
district councils in England and Wales and the Scottish regions. About
two-thirds of district councils in the shires are not going to the polls
this year.
Calculating potential winners and losers where only a third of seats are
contested is complicated.
Even in the south-west, where the Liberal Democrats made strong advances in
last year's county council elections, the Lib Dems speak only of 'cautious
optimism'. Unless they capitalise on Tory turmoil, they may be disappointed.
The Conservatives privately accept that their best hope is to hold seats
rather than gain them. With the elections turning into a vote of confidence,
or lack of it, in the government and Mr John Major's leadership, one Tory
official ruefully described the introduction this month of higher taxes as
'interesting timing'. The party's campaigners fear that even if disaffected
supporters do not vote against them, they may abstain.
Of the largest cities, the Conservatives no longer control any council with
the exception of Derby, where they have a casting vote, while Trafford, in
Greater Manchester, is the only Conservative-controlled metropolitan
district.
Their hopes of regaining Birmingham, lost in 1984 to Labour which now has a
seven-seat majority, subsided on March 24 when Labour won a by-election in a
ward which once had a Tory majority of more than 1,000 and had never had a
Labour councillor.
Focusing on Birmingham may have been at the expense of neighbouring Dudley,
where Labour has control by virtue of a by-election win. The Conservatives
also seem exposed in Walsall and Wolverhampton, which they run without
overall control.
Liverpool is an unusual contest. The controlling Labour group is fighting on
two fronts - against the Liberal Democrats and 'Liverpool Labour
councillors', a 17-strong, leftwing faction expelled from the party in 1990.
Liberal Democrats believe Labour is on the defensive, having imposed a 20
per cent rise in council tax this year to make the city's rate the highest
in England. The Liberal Democrats have 39 seats compared with the 49 held by
Labour.
Another council where special factors come into play is South Tyneside. Few
councils in Britain could be more rock-solidly Labour. The party has 55
councillors, the Liberal Democrats four and the Progressives - a local brand
of independent - one. Yet Labour is divided into two factions, known as the
A Team and the B Team.
Labour's national executive has conducted an inquiry and the result is
expected soon. The Liberal Democrats, for the first time contesting all 20
seats up for election, will highlight the battle within the Labour camp and
could make one or two gains.
Labour hopes, however, to wrest Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria from the
Conservatives' tenuous hold, which is secured at present only by the
allegiance of two independents.
In the south-west, Labour's best bet is Gloucester, where it is the largest
party on the hung city council and only needs two seats for outright
control. Exeter is another city where Labour is the largest party, although
the Conservatives have only two fewer seats and have not given up hope of
making gains in spite of their difficulties.
But Labour is not without problems of its own. In Bristol, which Labour
holds with a majority of 12, a party formed by disgruntled Bristol Rovers
football supporters, upset at the city's failure to find the club a stadium,
has gained broader backing. The so-called Bristol Party seeks to mount a
challenge in at least 10 Labour-held wards. Labour describes it as 'one of
those irritants'.
Bath, where the Conservatives are the largest party, is a target for the
Liberal Democrats, who in the general election defeated local Tory MP Mr
Chris Patten, now governor of Hong Kong. The Conservatives have 24 seats,
the Liberal Democrats 17, and Labour seven. The Liberal Democrats are also
confident of winning Weymouth and Portland in Dorset, and Colchester in
Essex.
In Wales, only four out of 37 district councils are holding elections, all
in the south: Newport, Swansea, Port Talbot and Rhondda. Labour is firmly in
the saddle, although in Swansea its overall majority is down to eight with
the Conservatives in second place, and the Liberal Democrats hope to gain
some ground from the Tories. But the Welsh elections are being held in the
knowledge that the councils are about to be reorganised, with elections to
unitary authorities in 1996.
In Scotland as well, the May elections are overshadowed by local government
reorganisation. The elections in the nine regions and three island councils
will be Scotland's last regional elections before the regions are abolished
in 1996.
In spite of the reduced significance of this year's poll, the elections are
likely to be an opportunity for Scottish voters to display their discontent
with the Tory party. After months of somnolence, Scottish politics has come
to life with a recent opinion poll showing support for the Tories at 13 per
cent.
Labour holds five regions, Strathclyde being the largest, with no party in
overall control in the others and independents dominating Borders, Dumfries
&amp; Galloway and the islands. Since the Tories hold no councils and have no
expectations of doing so, there is not much further they can fall.

FT  12 APR 94 / UK Elections - Major's Campaign: Registration deadline nears
for Euro elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time is running out for about 400,000 non-British citizens of the European
Union living in the UK to register to vote in the European parliament
elections, Kevin Brown writes.
The initial round of registrations with local government returning officers
closed on March 29, but the Home Office says applications will be considered
up to April 22.
There are fears that many potential voters may not be aware that the
Maastricht treaty on European Union extended the right to vote to EU
citizens living outside their home country.
The Home Office took no steps to publicise voting rights until February 28,
when it issued a press notice to newspapers. The notice was followed in
early March by a further press release and an article for regional
newspapers written by Mr Peter Lloyd, the Home Office minister of state.
The Home Office says these were 'appropriate steps' to publicise the new
franchise, which was finally agreed by the Council of Ministers in December
last year.
'This left us only a very short time to bring forward legislation to give
effect here to the new voting rights. Nevertheless we were able to make new
regulations with a minimum of delay,' the department said.
The extension of the franchise was intended to increase the importance of
the European parliament by giving voting rights to about 5m EU citizens
living outside their country of citizenship, including 400,000 Britons.

They will mark the end of the government's ordeal by ballot box. And they
will probably have the greatest bearing on whether the prime minister keeps
his job. More than next month's local elections and the smattering of coming
by-elections, it is the European elections on June 9 that are making Mr John
Major and the Conservative party apprehensive.
If the results are bad enough - and some are predicting substantial Liberal
Democrat and Labour inroads into the Tories' remaining 32 seats of the 87 -
the pressure on Mr Major to go by the autumn, if not sooner, could be
irresistible.
Some observers put the prime minister's survival threshold as high as 20
seats. Most believe he would be hard-pressed to stay if the tally fell below
15 - only a third of the total won by the party in 1984.
With turnout traditionally low, much will depend on the leading parties'
ability to coax their supporters into the polling booths.
Such are the government's current difficulties that the opposition parties
will almost certainly try to cast the election as a national referendum on
its overall performance.
It is equally likely that the Conservatives will respond by encouraging
voters to focus on genuinely Europe-related issues.
The trouble with this strategy is that it could provoke another damaging
outbreak of the internecine warfare over Europe that has plagued the party
under Mr Major's premiership and which flared up again in response to the
recent row over European Union voting rights.
An insight into how campaign managers will attempt to apply a veneer of
unity came at the end of last month in a letter to Conservative MPs and MEPs
from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary.
This spoke of a campaign stressing both the importance of the European
parliament and the party's commitment to national sovereignty within a
decentralised, free-trading Europe.
It will be a delicate balance to strike - especially if the share of the
vote which the party achieves in the local elections augurs badly for its
European election performance and dents morale.
In 1989 the party secured 34.7 per cent of the vote - far above recent
opinion-poll ratings - compared with 40 per cent for Labour which won 45
seats. The combined share of the Liberal Democrats and the SDP was less than
7 per cent. The Greens, enjoying their brief spell in the electoral
limelight, polled 15 per cent of the vote.
Opinion poll evidence suggests the Liberal Democrats may emerge as the
biggest victors, winning anything up to a dozen seats in a swathe of England
running from Cornwall to Hampshire - site of the Eastleigh by-election. That
would be a devastating blow to Conservative morale in the south.
Tory strategists will be noting nervously that the Greens took as much as a
quarter of the vote last time in Sussex West, and 23 per cent in the
Cotswolds, Hereford &amp; Worcester and Somerset. Precious little of that
surprisingly heavy environmental protest vote is likely to come the
Conservatives' way four years later. The Lib Dems may also pick up a seat in
Scotland.
Labour could make about six gains, although the target seats are more
difficult to identify because of the effect of boundary changes. The party
has high hopes of picking up seats in north-west England and possibly the
east Midlands. The battle in London and the south-east will also be of
crucial importance.
In Northern Ireland - the only part of the UK where first-past-the-post does
not apply - the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist
party, has already served notice of his intention to turn the poll into a
referendum on the Downing Street declaration.
Most interest will focus on what difference this makes to his share of the
vote, which reached 34 per cent in 1989, versus 22 per cent for both the
mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party and the Ulster Unionists,
13 per cent for Sinn Fein and 5 per cent for the non-sectarian Alliance
party.

The two main opposition parties are fighting the parliamentary by-election
in Eastleigh as if the date had already been fixed. Judging by the leaflets
distributed by Liberal Democrats and Labour, which attack each other with a
ferocity usually reserved for the government, the electors could be forgiven
for thinking it was a straight fight between them.
In reality, the Conservative candidate, Mr Stephen Reid, leader of
Basingstoke council, is defending a 17,702 majority. The by-election was
caused by the death of Mr Stephen Milligan, the Conservative MP, in
February.
It is one of five by-elections due soon. Three others are in east London
constituencies and one in Rotherham. These are regarded as safe Labour
seats.
Given the Liberal Democrats' recent success in beating the Tories in the
apparent strongholds of Newbury and Christchurch - when they overturned
majorities of more than 12,000 and 23,000 respectively - the opposition
parties have all but discounted the Tories' chances of holding Eastleigh.
There is ample evidence to suggest they may be right, with many Conservative
voters incredulous at the qualified majority voting dispute in Europe and
angry about the increase in taxation.
That may explain why the government has yet to announce a date for the
by-election.
It was assumed that it would be called on May 5, the date of the local
government elections. But Mr Gerald Malone, Conservative deputy chairman,
yesterday indicated that it may be delayed until June.
The past record of by-elections suggests the party which is placed second
will be the main beneficiary if the Conservative vote collapses.
In Eastleigh, the Liberal Democrats came second in the 1992 general election
with 21,296 votes. They need a swing of 11.5 per cent to seize the
constituency. In Christchurch the swing against the Conservatives was more
than three times that.
But Labour came a strong third with 15,768 votes in Eastleigh, and cannot
afford to leave the field open to the Liberal Democrats as it did in Newbury
and Christchurch.
Eight members of the shadow cabinet, including Mr John Smith, labour leader,
Mr Tony Blair, and Mr Gordon Brown, regarded as the party's stars, have
campaigned in Eastleigh.
Labour's strategy is high risk as anything but a win may be seen as a
setback to its presentation of itself as the main alternative to the
government in the south.
The Liberal Democrats, wary of starting as front runners, have warned
supporters not to be complacent.
Labour is expected to call Rotherham, caused by the death of Mr James Boyce,
on May 5, and the three other by-elections on June 9, the date of the
European elections.
The three east London constituencies are Newham North East and Barking,
which were held by the late Mr Ron Leighton and Ms Jo Richardson, and
Dagenham, where Mr Bryan Gould has announced his intention to resign.
All four are traditional Labour strongholds. Labour hopes the race issue
does not affect its vote in the three east London contests.

For Mr John Major it may well be political life or death. The next eight
weeks, starting with council elections on May 5 and culminating in the
European elections on June 9, will provide the most comprehensive test of
the national mood since his 1992 general election victory. Five
parliamentary by-elections - the most important in Conservative-held
Eastleigh - will complete the picture.
There is little doubt that the Conservatives will do badly. The voters have
not forgiven Mr Major for the recession that he had promised would end the
day after he returned to Downing Street in April 1992.
The electorate has watched the Conservative party tear itself apart over
Europe and has looked on despairingly as a lacklustre administration has
failed each time it has tried to establish for itself a sense of strategic
direction.
So the issue is not whether the prime minister will emerge the loser from
the local, European and by-elections. His future will depend on whether the
results are merely tolerably bad or fatally catastrophic.
There are important tests also for Mr John Smith's Labour party and for Mr
Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats.
Mr Smith has profited greatly from the Tory disarray. But there are many,
even in his own party, who have yet to be convinced that he has crafted a
credible programme for an alternative government.
The voters who now profess support for Labour show little real enthusiasm
for the party's agenda. For many, a protest vote against the Conservatives
this summer will not stop them returning to the Tory fold at the next
general election.
For his part Mr Ashdown cannot claim that the rise in support for the
Liberal Democrats since 1992 represents much more than the traditional
mid-term influx of disaffected Tories.
The Liberal Democrats remain a local (and in some areas a regional) rather
than a national party. They will do well in the forthcoming elections but
rebuilding the belief that British politics has room for a powerful third
force will require much more than simply good results.
In the short term the opposition parties' tactics are straightforward: to
maximise mid-term discontent with higher taxes, rising crime, poor public
services and irresolute leadership.
The opinion polls are on their side. Labour is 20 to 25 points ahead. Mr
Major's personal standing is lower than that of any modern political leader.
On nearly every issue - from the economy to law and order, health and
education - his government is judged incompetent.
In short, Mr Major's position is worse than the one in which Baroness
Thatcher found herself during the months before her demise in November 1990.
About 90 Tory backbenchers would lose their seats at a general election if
there were a modest 5 per cent swing against the Conservatives. At last
autumn's Christchurch by-election there was a swing of 35 per cent. It
should be no surprise, then, that Conservative MPs are promoting Mr Michael
Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke as alternative leadership candidates.
Nor, after his decision to play a high-profile personal role in both the
local and European campaigns, can the prime minister credibly deflect
opposition attempts to frame the elections as a referendum on his
leadership.
But one of the few things on Mr Major's side are expectations. With most
Tory MPs at Westminster discounting abysmal results, an outcome that was
merely bad might yet be projected as a relative triumph.
The local elections were last fought in 1990, at the height of the poll tax
revolt. The Conservatives were trounced. So it is perfectly possible that
the losses this time will be relatively small.
Labour has still to prove that it has shaken off its 'loony left' reputation
sufficiently to regain the confidence of voters in the south-east and win
pivotal councils in the London suburbs. The Liberal Democrats could well
dent support for Labour in the north.
The Eastleigh by-election and the European elections will provide much the
tougher test for Mr Major. Tory strategists believe Eastleigh is all but
lost to the Liberal Democrats.
The European elections evoke the nightmare of renewed infighting between
those who cling to the Conservatives' public commitment to a positive role
in the European Union and those who want the party to retreat to a
nationalist redoubt.
Nor is there any comfort for Mr Major in the likelihood that the June 9 poll
outcome will be decided on national issues rather than on European ones.
Elections to the European Parliament provide the ideal vehicle for
disgruntled Conservatives to register a mid-term protest. Few voters care
who represents them in Strasbourg. On current projections anything between
10 and 20 of the Tories' 32 seats in the Assembly are vulnerable - mainly to
the Liberal Democrats.
If the actual losses are at the more optimistic end of that spectrum Mr
Major's battered premiership may survive the shock waves. But a result at
the pessimistic end of the scale could well see an irresistible challenge to
his leadership.

FT  12 APR 94 / Private investor watchdog suffers further setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect private
investors, suffered a fresh blow yesterday when it emerged that Mr Peter
Taylor, its deputy chairman, is to stand down because of a change in his
role at Sun Alliance.
The timing of the news is unfortunate for the PIA, although it is not as
serious a setback for the regulator as the resignation from its board of Mr
Jim Stretton, deputy managing director of Standard Life. He left in January,
arguing that the authority's plans did not amount to genuine
self-regulation.
While the government remains firmly committed to the PIA, the new regulator
has not yet put beyond doubt its ability to attract enough support from
across the financial services sector to achieve credibility.
News of Mr Taylor's impending departure will add to the suggestion of
uncertainty about the PIA which has undermined the authority's momentum.
The PIA's strength has been diminished by the failure of some larger
potential members to apply so far - although many are said to be planning to
sign up.
The regulator is still waiting to see if there will be applications from
some leading life offices and some other significant financial institutions,
such as the Halifax building society.
The Prudential, the UK life insurer, is the only organisation so far to
announce its outright rejection of the PIA and its intention to exercise its
right to be regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board, the
City's chief watchdog.
Mr Taylor became Sun Alliance group marketing director with international
responsibilities at the beginning of this month. He had previously been head
of the Sun Alliance UK life company. He became deputy chairman of the PIA in
1992.
Sun Alliance said that Mr Taylor's decision was entirely a result of his new
duties. The company has already applied for membership of the PIA and
underlined yesterday that it still saw it as the logical progression from
the existing regulatory arrangements.
Mr Taylor will leave the PIA board later in the year, at a date to be
agreed. It is not clear whether this would be before the authority is due to
become operational in July.
Ms Colette Bowe, PIA chief executive, said there was no suggestion that Mr
Taylor was leaving because he was unhappy with the regulatory arrangements.
She said his decision was entirely to do with the other claims on his time
resulting from his new responsibilities at Sun Alliance.

A public inquiry into plans for the Birmingham northern relief road, which
would be the first privately-financed toll motorway, was announced

The government will face opposition from environmental groups when the
inquiry opens in Walsall on June 21. More than 7,000 people and
organisations have objected to the 27-mile route which is designed to
relieve pressure on the M6.
The inquiry, to be held before independent inspector Sir John Fitzpatrick,
could take up to nine months.
The proposed road would be built and operated by Midland Expressway, a
company that has been formed by Trafalgar House, the shipping and hotels
group, and Grouppo IRI of Italy. It would provide a link around the
north-east side of the west Midlands conurbation from the M6, north of
junction 11, to the M6 east of junction 4.

FT  12 APR 94 / Scots oppose six-group merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland yesterday came out
strongly against proposals for a merger of the UK's six professional bodies,
Andrew Jack writes.
In a letter sent to its members recently and made public yesterday, Mr Nigel
Macdonald, the outgoing president, said he rejected recommendations unveiled
last month to rationalise the profession. He said proposals for change would
be more costly than the existing structure, and called instead for more
modest 'harmonisation' and closer co-operation between the bodies.
The comments follow opposition already voiced to a merger by the Chartered
Association of Certified Accountants last month.
The statement came after more than a year's work on rationalisation by a
sub-committee of the six professional organisations which comprise the
Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies. The sub-committee recommended
a shift from six bodies to three geographical chartered institutes with a
series of specialist sub-groups in each.

FT  12 APR 94 / More TV channels planned for Astra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SES, the Luxembourg company that owns the Astra television satellite system,
said yesterday in London that it planned to have 14 more television channels
on air by the end of this year.
The new channels will become available if the launch of the fourth Astra
satellite - scheduled for September or October this year - is successful.
This will bring the number of satellite channels available all over Europe
on the system to 64. Old receiving equipment is not, however, compatible and
will either need a new LNB (the horn part of the satellite dish) costing
about Pounds 40 plus fitting or a converter box which will cost about Pounds
30.
The main purpose of the fourth Astra satellite is to back up the first three
in case of malfunction but it also has spare channels.
The decision to go for 14 conventional satellite channels and only one or
two experimental digital channels reflects the high demand for conventional
channels and the fact that digital receiving equipment for consumers is not
yet on the market.
Two further Astra satellites, due for launch in 1995 and 1996, will be given
over mainly to digital rather than existing analogue television channels.
Television channels converted into digital form can be compressed allowing
up to 10 channels to be squeezed into the capacity previously needed for
one.
There is a trade-off between the number of channels and picture quality, but
by next year the first 150-channel systems could, in theory, be available
over Europe.
Eutelsat, Astra's main satellite television rival, will this week carry out
Europe's first demonstration of simultaneous high-performance analogue and
digital broadcasts from a single satellite transponder.
Until now each channel has needed a dedicated transponder.

<TEXT>
A receiver to Lancer Boss is flying to Germany to meet the lawyer appointed
to take control of the subsidiary Steinbock Boss to clarify the insolvency
procedures.
In the UK, the receivers are preparing a detailed analysis of the company
and will then report back to creditors.
Although the subsidiary is only part of the group and is wholly owned by it,
German law will apply in a clash with English insolvency procedures.
This will prove particularly difficult in any attempt to sell the entire
group as a single entity, given conflicting interests of accountants,
lawyers and creditors.
The German procedure will make full control of the company from the UK
impossible.
Mr Tony Houghton, an insolvency partner with accountants Touche Ross, said
yesterday: 'Each jurisdiction looks after its own. Any assets in Germany
will be subject to local law. In our experience the German courts are very
suspicious of any sort of interference.'

FT  12 APR 94 / Reform of milk market faces fresh uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dairy sector in England and Wales was plunged into fresh uncertainty
yesterday when the Dairy Trade Federation announced that it had fundamental
objections to the Milk Marketing Board's revised plans for opening the
Pounds 3.3bn milk market to competition.
The federation, which represents dairy processing com-panies, said the
amended proposals were 'unacceptable' and would not create a free market.
Its main objection is to the board's proposed auction system for selling
milk. It said that the system, by which Milk Marque would determine prices
and selling rules, would not provide enough information to buyers.
It proposed instead the creation of a 'milk forum' representing Milk Marque
and prospective buyers under an independent chairmanship.
That forum would set prices, as well as determining how bids would be scaled
back if supply did not match demand.
It would report to the Office of Fair Trading every six months on the
working of the new arrangements if Milk Marque secures 40 per cent or more
of total milk output.
Mr Andrew Dare, the board's chief executive, rejected the proposal and said
it was unlikely to meet EU competition laws or to be accepted by the
government.
'It doesn't open the market up, it's not necessary and it's just an excuse
for buyers to be able to continue buying as a cartel,' he said.
The board has already agreed to an independent arbitrator to ensure that
Milk Marque applies its selling rules fairly.
However, Mr Jim McMichael-Phillips, president of the federation, rejected
that provision as insufficient.
He called for an arbitrator to adjudicate on any disputes in the first two
years of the new market.

FT  12 APR 94 / Group's state indicated by 1992 accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lancer Boss Group is already more than two months late in filing its 1993
accounts, according to documents filed with Companies House.
The latest financial information available with the government's corporate
information agency dates from the year-end to March 31 1992.
The 1992 accounts highlight some of the difficulties facing the company and
the challenges that will be faced by its receivers. They show the group made
losses of Pounds 3.1m, against pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.4m in the
previous year. Operating profits declined from Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 2.1m in
the same period.
Total borrowings at the balance sheet date in 1992 were Pounds 32m. The
proportionately high interest costs of Pounds 5.9m suggest borrowings may
have been considerably higher earlier in the year. The company is relatively
stretched in servicing its borrowings. Net cash flow from operating
activities was only Pounds 6.4m, barely covering the Pounds 5.9m in interest
costs.
The chairman's statement says 'a large part' of the company's investments
are in D-Marks, while Germany also accounts for a large share of its
operations. However, it refuses to comply with the accounting standard
requiring a geographical breakdown of profits and assets, so all that is
available is turnover of Pounds 86m from a total for the group of Pounds
192m.
The German subsidiary's pension fund was only 89 per cent funded during the
year, suggesting that the current estimated costs of pensions cannot be
covered.
The accounting policies on leasing are confused, while the note on turnover
policy is unusual and may allow for considerable flexibility. Turnover is
recognised when 'final arrangements have been made for shipments.'
Sir Neville Bowman Shaw, the chairman, was paid Pounds 455,000 and one other
director more than Pounds 305,000. All the shares are held by Sir Neville,
other members of his family and trustees on their behalf.
The accounts received an unqualified opinion by KPMG Peat Marwick, which
charged an audit fee of Pounds 362,000. The company donated Pounds 13,000 to
the Conservative party and Pounds 12,500 to charities in 1992.

FT  12 APR 94 / Bogus accountants feel profession's wrath
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A surprising number of non-accountants are passing themselves off as members
of the profession, a report showed yesterday.
The latest annual report of the ethics committee covering the UK's three
chartered accountancy bodies says it has 130 cases on file of individuals
calling themselves 'chartered accountants' when they have no right to do so.
The largest group is former accountants who have let their membership lapse,
followed by individuals without qualifications fraudulently misrepresenting
themselves as accountants to gain business, and those from other
professional bodies, especially from outside the UK.
There is no criminal sanction available to the professional bodies to deal
with these 'misdescribers', but officials have obtained 37 formal
undertakings and started 23 court cases to restrain their activities last
year.
The details come at a time when the accountancy profession is facing more
public scrutiny than ever and faces growing criticism of its ethical
conduct.
The report - due to be discussed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales Council tomorrow - shows the number of inquiries to its
ethics services almost doubled in the last four years.
Oral inquiries to the Chartered Accountants Advisory Service on Ethics -
primarily from members in public practice - rose from 4,923 in 1990 to 8,871
in 1993, while written inquiries increased from 984 to 1,506 in the same
period. The trends have stabilised in the last year.
There were also 64 'substantive' cases and 118 less significant inquiries
last year to the industrial members' advisory committee on ethics, which
handles concerns raised by accountants working in business.
Mr Julian Osborne, committee secretary of the chartered accountants joint
ethics committee, said yesterday the increase reflected growing questions by
accountants on regulation matters, as well as the publicity given to the
advisory services.
He said many of the inquiries from accountants in business related to
pressure on finance directors from other board members to massage the
figures in their companies.
The report also reveals that the profession is launching an investigation
into how far accountancy firms develop 'sound ethical attitudes' among their
students and younger staff.
It has hired a graduate for an 18-week pilot study of the procedures in more
than 40 firms, which is likely to lead to a more detailed project later this
year.
'Ethics only recently became part of the professional examination syllabus
and is not a separate paper yet,' Mr Osborne said. 'Some firms were not
familiar with our bye-laws and it made us wonder what they were doing to
keep up to scratch.'

FT  12 APR 94 / De-regulation body 'needs powers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The committee of MPs which will oversee the parliamentary implementation of
the government's de-regulation initiative should have tough new powers, an
influential Commons committee has recommended.
The government has accepted that a watchdog Commons committee be set up to
ensure parliamentary procedure to accelerate the scrapping of burdensome
regulations is not abused.
The Commons procedure committee recommended last night that the committee be
given new powers which could impede some of the more controversial aspects
of the government's de-regulation programme. It proposes that a new select
committee of 16 MPs - five more than the select committees which examine the
operations of government departments - should be able to take decisions
affecting the parliamentary timetable.
If the proposals are approved by the Commons, the committee could recommend
outright rejection of a de-regulation order, or approval subject to
amendments.
When the government disagreed with amendments suggested by the committee, it
would be required to stage a three-hour debate on the issue in the Commons.
Parliamentary orders are normally debated for one and a half hours and
cannot be amended by MPs. Where a de-regulation order gained the unanimous
approval of the committee, the government would be able to secure its
passage through the Commons without debate.
Another recommendation, which may not appeal to the government's business
managers, is that MPs should have 60 days to consider controversial
de-regulation orders instead of the 40 proposed by ministers.
The primary role of the new committee will be to ensure that health and
safety and other concerns are not adversely affected through regulations
being abolished without the checks and balances provided by all the stages
of primary legislation.
The new committee will be able to take evidence from ministers and civil
servants, appoint special advisers and, when appropriate, work in
co-operation with a similar scrutiny committee appointed by the House of
Lords. The scope of the new powers available to ministers under the
de-regulation bill now before parliament extends to 29 general headings, and
an initial programme envisages the repeal of 55 regulations.
The new committee will probably first consider draft orders so that
amendments acceptable to the government can be made before the final version
is submitted for the approval of the Commons and the Lords.

FT  12 APR 94 / Receiver trapped in legal maze: Lancer Boss's future has
been complicated by two conflicting sets of insolvency laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Receivers love to be in control. But Mr Allan Griffiths and Mr Scott Barnes
have yet to gain full control of Lancer Boss, the UK lift-truck company for
which they were named administrative receivers on Friday.
A few hours before the partners at Grant Thornton were named receivers for
the Bedfordshire-based group and certain UK subsidiaries, a German lawyer
was appointed administrator to Steinbock Boss, the German subsidiary.
'It's an extremely unusual situation,' Mr Griffiths said yesterday.
As more details emerged of the circumstances behind the Lancer Boss
receivership, an extraordinary tale unfolded of conflicting insolvency laws
between UK and Germany, and of two separate banking groups with very
different priorities.
Two groups of banks - one in the UK and one in Germany - were funding the UK
and German parts of Lancer Boss, which each had borrowings of 'tens of
millions of pounds', Mr Griffiths said. To add to the confusion, the UK
banking group includes not only National Westminster and Standard Chartered
but also Dresdner Bank, which is based in Germany.
At a press conference in Tring, Hertfordshire, yesterday, Mr Griffiths
revealed little of Lancer Boss's financial position, but some of the puzzles
behind the receivership of one of the UK's largest private manufacturing
groups are becoming clearer.
Jungheinrich, the large German lift-truck producer, revealed yesterday that
it had been holding negotiations with Lancer Boss on the future of
Steinbock, Lancer Boss's German unit, which has been badly hit by the
recession.
It is believed that, originally, negotiations were based on a full-scale
link-up between Jungheinrich and Lancer Boss. But the receivers believe that
it emerged recently that Jungheinrich wanted only to buy Steinbock. The
German banks were keen to pursue a domestic solution for Steinbock's
troubles, and strongly backed the deal.
But Steinbock's directors and Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, Lancer Boss's
chairman, rejected the deal because it would have involved the break-up of
the group. In response the German banking group withdrew its support from
Steinbock, which had been trading within its banking limits, and the
administrator was called in.
This left directors of Lancer Boss in a difficult position, because of what
Mr Griffiths called the 'interconnectedness' of the UK and German
operations. Large sums of money were flowing between Germany and the UK, he
said, and there was considerable interchange of products and reciprocal
supplies of components.
For that reason, he said, Sir Neville and directors of Lancer Boss decided
to ask banks to appoint administrative receivers for the UK operations - to
maintain stability while the German administration was sorted out.
Mr Griffiths is keen to maintain the links between the UK and German
operations because he believes the group would be worth more if both parts
were sold in one piece.
He has already had two approaches from potential purchasers in the UK. 'To a
purchaser, the attraction is to buy both the UK and German operations. In
isolation, they are not worth so much.'
The problem for Mr Griffiths is that he does not have control of the German
operation, and is urgently trying to establish what powers the German
administrator has to sell Steinbock. 'I am concerned that we will not get
control of the German company,' he said. 'If I do, I could sell the group in
a short period of time.' He hopes that Grant Thornton can persuade its
German counterpart to co-operate.
Mr Griffiths said a variety of companies would be interested in buying
Lancer Boss as a group. A 'structured financial deal' backed by engineering
interests was possible, or the business could appeal to big UK industrial
companies. No inquiries have yet been received from foreign companies, but
they are expected.
Meanwhile, Mr Griffiths and his team have moved quickly to secure the
support of the 770 workers in the UK businesses. Flanked by union
representatives at yesterday's press conference, he revealed that he had
already announced 19 redundancies and could not give any guarantees to the
remainder. But he stressed that his first concern was to sell Lancer Boss as
a going concern with as many jobs preserved as possible. Only if that fails
would he consider 'stage 2' - selling the product range without the
manufacturing operations in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire.

FT  12 APR 94 / London and Dublin will resume talks on Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish governments will this week signal their determination
to press on with the Northern Ireland peace process following the failure of
last week's IRA ceasefire to achieve a political breakthrough.
Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister responsible for conducting
talks with the province's main parties, is to resume immediately the series
of bilateral discussions aimed at seeking agreement on the shape of a
political settlement in the province.
In Dublin Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, is expected to
announce today the opening of formal talks with Irish opposition leaders on
the setting up of the proposed Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, first
mentioned in the Downing Street declaration as a way of promoting
cross-border relationships.
The message from both governments will be that Sinn Fein, the political wing
of the IRA, will be able to participate in both exercises only when the
republican movement decides on a permanent cessation of violence. Since the
end of the IRA ceasefire on Friday, the province has again been hit by
terrorist attacks from the IRA as well as from loyalist groups.
In spite of Ulster politicians' intense public criticism of the so-called
three-stranded talks process and the prospect of slow progress at least
until after the European elections in June, the Northern Ireland Office
intends to press on with the internal dialogue and with efforts to agree
with Dublin a more detailed framework for political progress.
Until now Mr Reynolds has resisted opposition calls to establish the forum,
preferring to wait for a response from Sinn Fein to the Downing Street
declaration.
In December Mr Reynolds said the purpose of the forum would be to bring Sinn
Fein into an initial negotiating process with nationalist parties following
a permanent cessation of IRA violence. Dublin's thinking now is to leave an
empty seat for Sinn Fein pending an end to IRA violence.
Mr John Bruton, the leader of Ireland's opposition Fine Gael party, said
yesterday that the peace process now required 'more practical and more
immediate' measures including talks between Northern Ireland's political
parties on a Bill of Rights for the province.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday started a
week-long visit to the US to explain the government's policy on Ulster.

FT  12 APR 94 / Parties clash on Eastleigh by-election date
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats and the government were yesterday heading for a
confrontation over the timing of the Eastleigh by-election in Hampshire amid
indications that the Conservatives would like to delay it until June.
Mr John Major will meet senior cabinet colleagues today to discuss a date
for the poll, which was caused by the death of Mr Stephen Milligan, the
sitting MP, in February.
But there was speculation at Westminster that the poll - originally expected
on May 5, the day of the local elections - might be postponed until June 9,
the date of the European elections, as part of an informal understanding
between Tory and Labour party managers.
In return for tacit Labour support in delaying the poll, the Conservatives
are understood to have agreed that Labour could defer the by-election due in
Barking until the same date. Labour could then hold the three by-elections
due in east London simultaneously, concentrating their campaign effort.
Liberal Democrat leaders warned they would bring a motion before the Commons
'moving the writ' for the Eastleigh by-election, if ministers did not
announce a date by tomorrow night. A writ is traditionally moved by the
party defending the seat. It is rare for another party to move it.
The Liberal Democrats are favoured to take Eastleigh, which Mr Milligan held
for the Conservatives with a majority of 17,702 at the last election.
Conservatives are worried that the Liberal Democrats' rating tends to climb
after by-election victories and fear that this may enhance their performance
in the European poll if the Eastleigh by-election were held before it.
The Liberal Democrats have warned the government that the Conservative party
would be breaking the conventional time limit within which by-elections are
held if it tried to combine the by-election with the European election. They
are considering moving a writ in the Commons on Thursday that would mean the
poll would be held on May 5, the date of the local elections.
The Liberal Democrats said convention dictated that the writ for a
by-election be moved within three months of the death of a sitting member.
Even if the government moves the writ at the last possible date, May 7, the
returning officer in Eastleigh would technically be obliged to hold the
election on May 26 or June 2. Liberal Democrats suspect that if the
government does not move the writ tomorrow it will try to 'stretch the
rules' so that the by-election is held on June 9.
Mr Gerald Malone, Tory deputy chairman, indicated that Eastleigh would not
suffer if the by-election was held in June as all the parties' policies
would be 'exposed to further scrutiny'.

The Conservative and Labour parties were yesterday locked in bitter
recriminations over the conduct of local government as the campaigning for
next month's council elections hit a new level of intensity.
Tory party managers issued a sharp denunciation of Mr John Smith, the Labour
leader, arguing that he had ignored a string of 'appalling activities'
carried out by elected Labour officials in his Monklands constituency in
Strathclyde.
Mr Gerald Malone, Tory party deputy chairman, accused the council of
nepotism in its recruitment policies, bias in its allocation of capital
spending, and incurring huge losses in companies established to run its
services.
Mr Malone said: 'If Labour say nothing and do nothing, either in terms of
national politics or local government . . . then they will be condemned for
their record.'
The Conservatives came under attack as Labour unveiled another method of
examining the latest round of council tax levied by local authorities.
In recent weeks the Tory and Labour parties have looked for more and more
ingenious ways to show that they levy lower levels of council tax than their
rivals.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, yesterday issued figures
claiming that, on average, Labour-controlled local authorities had increased
council tax by much smaller amounts than either the Conservatives or the
Liberal Democrats between 1993-94 and 1994-95.
He claimed that Labour councils had increased the Band D schedule of council
tax by an average of 1.2 per cent between those years. By contrast, the
Conservatives and Liberal Democrats had levied increases of 2.1 per cent and
5.7 per cent respectively.
The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, concentrated their fire on the prime
minister, presenting evidence that large sections of the Tory party no
longer had any confidence in Mr John Major's leadership abilities.
They presented a dossier of about 60 quotes from leading Conservative
figures which they said derided the prime minister and showed that the
Conservatives were 'divided and leaderless'.
Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat campaign co-ordinator, said he would
focus on 'more positive' issues later in the local election campaign.

FT  12 APR 94 / Shadow chancellor proposes review of NI system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday proposed a revamp of the
National Insurance system to finance lifetime educational assistance and
'personal development plans' for individuals, Kevin Brown writes.
In a Fabian Society pamphlet Mr Brown says there is a strong case for
revamping employment benefits 'for the new world of permanent lifelong and
recurrent' education and training.
He adds: 'National Insurance benefits need not just be benefits against
periods of unemployment but also offer help for training and retraining and
for the provision of personal development plans, with people offered the
best careers advice, not just on leaving school, but throughout their
working lives.'
Mr Brown gave no details of how the revamped National Insurance scheme would
work, partly because the issue is being discussed by Labour's policy
commissions. However, the pamphlet suggests that Labour is looking
increasingly seriously at the idea of earmarking tax revenues for specific
purposes as a means of rebuilding trust in the taxation system.
Mr Brown reaffirms Labour's commitment to a minimum wage and calls for a
'skills revolution'. 'Investment by the community as a whole in the
potential of people - in their employment opportunities and their education
and skills - is the major determinant of both economic growth and the relief
of poverty.'

FT  12 APR 94 / Minister delays art export licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Iain Sproat, national heritage minister, yesterday deferred the granting
of export licences on four works of art, giving art galleries and museums
time to raise the money needed to keep them in the UK.
Three of the works have had their export licences delayed until the end of
next month. They are: The Miraculous Translation of the Holy House of
Loreto, an oil sketch by Tiepolo, for which Pounds 3.2m must be raised to
keep it in the UK; St Sebastian Succoured by Two Angels, by the 17th century
Italian artist Guercino (Pounds 400,000); and a pastel portrait of the 4th
Duchess of Marlborough, by Gainsborough (Pounds 236,919).
A marble bust of Lady Harriet Pellew by Bertel Thorwaldsen, with a price tag
of Pounds 170,404, has had an export licence delayed until the end of June.
The Hoxne Hoard, the Roman treasure found in Suffolk in 1992 and one of the
finest in the UK, has been deposited in the British Museum. The National
Heritage Fund and the National Art Collections Fund contributed to the
Pounds 1.75m needed to meet the treasure trove reward.

FT  12 APR 94 / Early move promised on coal sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will invite 'expressions of interest' in the sale of British
Coal in the very near future, Lord Strathclyde, trade and industry minister,
told the Lords yesterday.
Peers gave a second reading to the coal industry bill, the privatisation
measure already approved by the Commons.
Lord Strathclyde said that private-sector management would provide fresh
ideas and there would be opportunities for British Coal employees to make
proposals for taking over the running of the industry.
Lord Morris of Castle Morris, from the Labour front bench, was joined by
other opposition peers in advocating an expanded role for the proposed Coal
Authority. They suggested it should have wider responsibilities for dealing
with subsidence as well as for licensing coal mining operations and granting
interests in coal.
Lord Ezra, the Liberal Democrat peer and a former chairman of the National
Coal Board, said there must be some doubt over the effect of the
fragmentation of the industry under privatisation.
Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, yesterday ruled out government help
for Tower colliery, British Coal's last deep mine in south Wales. He made
clear he had no plans to intervene to save the mine, which is due to shut at
the end of the week with the loss of nearly 300 jobs.

FT  12 APR 94 / Shipyard challenge to curbs on work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The company which bought Sunderland's last shipyard is challenging the
government's insistence that no shipbuilding, conversion or repair work can
resume there before January 1999.
Pallion Engineering, the UK-Greek company which took over the Pallion yard
in 1991, is taking legal advice on the terms of the deal under which it
acquired the site following the closure in the late 1980s of Wearside's last
shipyards.
Mr Alan Dickinson, chairman, yesterday said the Greek shipowners that are
Pallion Engineering's main stakeholders wanted to have their vessels
repaired there, creating several hundred jobs.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, has told Mr Bill Etherington, MP for
Sunderland North, that the terms of Pallion's lease preclude resumption of
shipbuilding and related activities until 1999.
Mr Dickinson said Pallion had understood that the European Commission's
10-year ban on shipbuilding, imposed as a condition of sanctioning a Pounds
45m 'rescue package' for Sunderland, could be reviewed after five years.
CMN, the French company negotiating to buy Swan Hunter, the Tyneside
shipbuilder in receivership, expects it will take at least a fortnight to
complete the technical and legal matters needed before it can enter into a
contractual agreement with receivers Price Waterhouse.

FT  12 APR 94 / Inquiry announced into toll motorway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A public inquiry into plans for the Birmingham northern relief road, which
would be the first privately financed toll motorway, was announced
yesterday.
The government will face stiff opposition from environmental groups when the
inquiry opens in Walsall on June 21. There have been objections from more
than 7,000 people and organisations against the 27-mile route which is
designed to relieve pressure on the M6.
The inquiry, to be held before independent inspector Sir John Fitzpatrick,
could take up to nine months.
The proposed road would be built and operated by Midland Expressway, a
company that has been formed by Trafalgar House, the shipping and hotels
group, and Grouppo IRI of Italy.
It would provide a link around the north-east side of the west Midlands
conurbation from the M6, north of junction 11, to the M6 east of junction 4.
Mr Roger Higman, transport campaigner of the environmental group Friends of
the Earth, said: 'We will be opposing this scheme very, very strongly at the
inquiry.' The road would not solve M6 traffic problems, he added.
Friends of the Earth say the road would lead to further development on
green-belt land and would pass through two sites of special scientific
interest, the River Blythe and Chasewater Heath.

<TEXT>
Algeria's president, Mr Liamine Zeroual, yesterday replaced his prime
minister after less than eight months in a surprise move which came as the
government took measures to put the economy back on course.
The resignation of Mr Redha Malek and his cabinet in favour of a team to be
led by Mr Mokdad Sifi, transport minister, came shortly after Algeria's
army-backed rulers undertook a steep devaluation of the dinar as part of an
agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
At the weekend the government sent a letter of intent to the IMF which will
pave the way for a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 678m) standby credit and economic
reforms. These are aimed at liberalising the economy which is increasingly
crippled by a debt-service ratio of over 100 per cent and a confrontation
between the army and supporters of radical Islam. Since Mr Malek took office
last August, Moslem fundamentalists have stepped up their violent campaign
with random attacks on foreigners.
Mr Sifi, aged 53, has served in high-ranking posts in the ministries of
commerce, public works and finance.
France yesterday pledged its support for Algeria's new economic measures,
while awaiting announcement of the composition of the new government.
'France has always said it is ready to play its part in helping the Algerian
people and we will continue in this direction,' Mr Richard Duque, the
foreign ministry spokesman, said yesterday.
In practical terms, this means France is holding open a largely unused
FFr6.3bn (Pounds 732m) credit line granted to Algeria last year. Some FFr5bn
of this is export-credit tied to the purchase of French goods, and should
help maintain Algeria's imports from France which would otherwise be
severely hit by the 40 per cent devaluation.

Belgian paratroopers were yesterday beginning a high-risk operation to
rescue the remaining foreign nationals scattered across the Rwandan capital,
Kigali, the scene of bloody inter-tribal massacres.
But with the Rwandan rebels reported to be marching on the capital,
prompting fears of further clashes, the Belgian defence ministry said of
foreigners trapped in outlying areas: 'We do not envisage for the moment
pushing our action further than Kigali - it is not possible given the
difficulties we are experiencing in Kigali itself.'
The first group of Belgians to leave Rwanda yesterday were returned to
Brussels, with several hundred more expected to be evacuated from the centre
of Kigali later today. Several hundred French and US nationals also left
Rwanda yesterday.
There are currently 400 Belgian paratroopers in Kigali.

FT  12 APR 94 / Japanese factions target LDP: Coalition parties are wooing
the opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's political upheavals over the past few days have seen the emergence
of two broad groups, on the right and left wings of the seven-party ruling
coalition.
Both sides are wooing potential defectors from the opposition Liberal
Democratic party, in an attempt to create the core of a future coalition
government.
If they succeed in dislodging one or two LDP factions, this will be another,
possibly terminal blow, to the LDP's chance of returning to power after
being ousted last summer for the first time in 38 years.
The lower house has 511 seats, so any new alliance will need to muster 256
for a clear majority. The main players have lined up roughly as follows
(with the number of party seats in the lower house in brackets).
On the right is the Ozawa-Hosokawa group.
The Japan Renewal party, (52 seats), is led by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign
minister and a reluctant front-runner for the prime ministership, plus Mr
Ichiro Ozawa, who dominated policy in the coalition government.
The JRP is close to the Buddhist backed Komeito (60) or clean government
party, and to the Japan New party (40), led by Mr Hosokawa. The JNP, most of
whose members of parliament are first timers, has invited Komeito and the
JRP to join a new group, called Reform.
The JRP can also count on the support of five former LDP members, led by Mr
Mutsuki Kato, who left the party last year.
On the left is the Murayama-Takemura group:
The Social Democratic party (74) is the biggest coalition member, but
weakened by a split between 20 far-left members and 54 moderates loyal to Mr
Tomiichi Murayama, the party leader. The SDP has found a close ally over the
past few days in Mr Masayoshi Takemura's New Harbinger party (15).
The NHP was planning to merge with Mr Hosokawa's JNP, but Mr Takemura fell
out with Mr Hosokawa, once a close friend, over the prime minister's growing
closeness with Mr Ozawa.
Mr Takemura and Mr Ozawa have deep personal and policy differences. Also in
this camp is the Democratic Socialist party (19), a group of
conservative-minded former SDP members, which now also includes four members
of the former United Social Democratic party.
The above line-up could change, depending on possible defections from the
LDP (219), still the largest party in the lower house, which has so far
refrained from putting forward a rival prime ministerial candidate.
One main potential defector is the Watanabe faction (45), led by Mr Michio
Watanabe, a former foreign minister who has said he might join the
Ozawa-Hosokawa group if a 'comfortable' number of supporters follow.
He would also be in the running for the post of prime minister.
Also in the market for a partner is Mr Toshiki Kaifu, a reform-minded former
prime minister.
He has no formal faction, but has around 50 LDP supporters, and is being
wooed by Mr Murayama of the SDP.
The Miyazawa faction (54), led by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, a reform-minded former
prime minister, is also said to be working loose.
Mr Miyazawa is unlikely to work with Mr Hata and Mr Ozawa, who between them
destroyed his government last year by staging a rebellion, so could be a
candidate for the Socialist-led group.
Finally, there is the isolated Japan Communist party (15), which is not in
the coalition.
However, it could be joined by the 20 SDP hardliners, if they leave in
protest at an SDP alliance with a former LDP faction.
Independents and vacant seats (17) are excluded.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of Japan's divided seven-party coalition plan to meet today in
another attempt to resolve the deadlock over a successor to Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa as prime minister.
The outlook for an accord is poor - the three right-wing parties, grouped
around Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's backroom strategist, refused to
attend a summit yesterday, proposed by the Social Democratic party, leader
of the coalition's left wing.
The continued stalemate increases the likelihood of an early general
election, under the existing multi-seat constituency system which has been
blamed for engendering corruption, and deepens the rivalry between the
coalition's left and right wings.
But the outcome is unclear. Some SDP members of parliament favour an
election on the grounds that the party might recover some seats lost in last
summer's poll, so improving its clout in negotiating the new electoral
boundaries required under the recently agreed electoral reform laws.
Mr Ozawa's supporters gave procedural reasons for not attending yesterday's
summit. Political observers believe the coalition's right wing wants more
time to woo potential defectors from the opposition Liberal Democratic
party.
Instead, officials from the seven parties staged just a 40-minute exchange
yesterday, in which they agreed to keep talking in an attempt to choose a
new leader by the mid-week deadline they set themselves on Saturday. Leaders
of the left- and right-wing groups held their own separate planning
sessions.
At least one coalition member, the New Harbinger party, appeared to be
positioning itself for an election, by issuing a manifesto. The NHP called
for continued economic reform and said Japan should not try to become a
leading political or military power. This contradicts the policy of Mr
Ozawa's Japan Renewal party, of seeking a more internationally active Japan.
Separately, an independent panel began work yesterday on redrawing Japan's
electoral map, due for completion in six months.
This is the first stage in the transition from Japan's multi-seat
constituency system for electing the lower house of parliament - said to be
a factor in fostering money politics - to a mix of single seats and
proportional representation.

FT  12 APR 94 / Rand hit by poll uncertainty: Failure of Natal peace talks
sends currency to record low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South African rand plunged yesterday after the failure of last Friday's
peace summit between the government, the African National Congress and Zulu
leaders over the strife in Natal province which threatens to disrupt the
country's first all-race elections, a fortnight away.
The volatile financial rand, a currency used in non-resident investment or
disinvestment and designed to protect the country's foreign reserves,
crashed to a record low of R5.6435 to the dollar in London, down 61.85 cents
on the day. Dealers reported heavy selling all day from both Europe and
America. 'It was one-way traffic,' said Mr Willie Potgieter, assistant
general manager for foreign exchange at Standard Bank in Johannesburg. 'Once
the fall started, panic selling set in.'
Because the financial rand is thinly traded, relatively small movements can
cause large swings in its value. It is regarded as the best barometer of
international business sentiment. Given the political climate, most analysts
believe that the currency will remain highly volatile until after the
election. 'I can't see the situation stabilising for a while,' said Mr Ray
Davies, director of Smith New Court Securities.
The commercial rand, the country's trading currency, also hit a new low,
closing 3.6 cents down at R3.5925 to the dollar after falling for most of
last week. Figures released over the weekend by the South African Reserve
Bank show that this has been caused in part by heavy capital flight from the
country, which resumed in March after having slowed significantly over the
first two months of the year. According to the bank, the country's foreign
reserves declined by R867m to R7.9bn.
Mr Nick Barnard, economist at stockbroker Ed Hern Rudolph, said there was no
sign that the reserve bank was intervening in the markets to protect the
rand. 'There is unlikely to be significant reserve bank involvement until
after the election, when the political situation becomes clearer,' he noted.
Although share prices on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange were stronger
yesterday, the currency's collapse followed a bearish trend in international
investor sentiment in South African bond and equity markets.

FT  12 APR 94 / Israel to delay military pull-out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Israel said yesterday it would not be able to meet tomorrow's deadline for
completion of its military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and West Bank town
of Jericho, and blamed the Palestine Liberation Organisation for delaying
the peace process and the implementation of Palestinian self-rule.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, said the PLO was responsible for the delay
because it had broken off peace talks in the wake of the February 25 Hebron
mosque massacre of 29 Palestinians by a fanatical Jewish settler.
Mr Rabin said Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, 'suspended the negotiations
after the massacre in Hebron and therefore the responsibility is not on us'.
Israel undertook the bulk of its military withdrawal last week and senior
officers said they could complete the operation within 12 to 18 hours.
However, Mr Rabin has insisted on an agreement including all aspects of
Palestinian self-rule before giving the army final orders to leave.
On a visit to Ankara Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said the new
target date for signing would be the end of April.
At the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in Cairo, the PLO appeared to resign
itself to the delay. Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said: 'If Mr
Peres says he is willing to respect the new target date, the date at the end
of the month, fine with us.'
Mr Shaath also said that despite the PLO disappointment about the
postponement, progress had been made in the past 48 hours of talks and if
progress continued the two sides might be able to make an announcement on
what they have agreed so far.
For the past two weeks the negotiations have been bogged down in wrangling
over the numbers and powers of a Palestinian police force, the timetable for
the release by Israel of up to 8,500 Palestinian prisoners and the zoning
arrangements for the Gaza Strip, which will leave some areas exclusively
under Israeli control to protect 4,500 Jewish settlers.
Mr Haim Ramon, a popular former cabinet minister touted as a successor to Mr
Rabin, said he would stand on his own list for elections to lead the
Histadrut, Israel's biggest trade union feder-ation.
Labour leaders said Mr Ramon's declaration of political independence could
split the party and weaken it at a critical time as it pursues peace with
the PLO.

FT  12 APR 94 / South African Elections: 'Comrade Joe' is no Stalin -
Michael Holman on campaign trail with S African communist Slovo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Black South Africans literally sing his praises. Many of their white
compatriots would like to kill him. In Cape Town's Guguletu black township
he is a hero.
Former guerrilla chief, avowed communist and, according to opinion polls,
the second most popular man in South Africa, Mr Joe Slovo is on the campaign
trail in the country's first all-race election.
The reception for 'Comrade Joe' at the Guguletu rally is rapturous. The
crowd's tangible warmth takes a tired man into the crowd's embrace and
visibly revives him.
A roar of approval greets the entry of Mr Slovo, South African Communist
party chairman, into the township's dusty stadium, the last appointment on a
36-hour whistle-stop tour of Cape Town and its coloured and black suburbs.
He mounts the platform, soaking in the acclaim, clenched fist aloft.
'Amandla] (power). De Klerk must go] De Klerk must go] De Klerk must go]'.
En route to Guguletu Mr Slovo, who is on the extreme right's hit-list, is
squeezed between two security guards, a raincoat-draped rifle placed upright
between the occupants. Two-way radios crackle as the fleet of cars careen
through townships that could house hit-men, body guards sprint ahead as car
doors open, and the tension that underlies Mr Slovo's life every day is
brought home.
He gives no outward sign of strain. Tousled silver hair, face turning
slightly pink, Mr Slovo perspires under the autumn sun. He has a sharp
tongue and the debating skills of the barrister he once was.
Indeed, there is a touch of the Rumpole about him, that fictional barrister,
shrewd in court, wise in the ways of the world, and on the side of the
underdog almost since he arrived in South Africa in 1936, a 10-year-old
Yiddish-speaking Lithuanian Jew called Yossel Mashel Slovo.
But the genial, avuncular figure on the platform is also, it seems fair to
assume, ruthless if necessary. He helped form and lead Umkhonto we Sizwe
(Spear of the Nation), the ANC's armed wing, to serve a cause and a party to
which he has dedicated his life. That cause has claimed the lives of his
wife and the man whose memory he celebrated at the weekend  - his
comrade-in-arms, Mr Chris Hani.
A year ago Mr Hani, the head of Umkhonto we Sizwe and Communist party
leader, was gunned down in a quiet middle class Johannesburg suburb while
walking home with the morning newspaper.
At the open air memorial service under a blue Cape sky and overlooked by
Table Mountain, Mr Slovo salutes Mr Hani's memory, and turns the event into
a party rally.
In the life-and-death battle against apartheid, the graveyards of the 15,000
who have died of political violence since 1984 have become the platforms of
the politicians, and the obsequies and ideology intermix.
His excoriation of President F W de Klerk and Zulu leader Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi are rapturously received, but the ANC, near certain overall victor
in the poll this month, is in trouble in the western Cape.
The region is home to most of the country's 'coloured' (mixed race)
community. With the 658,000 white voters divided between Mr de Klerk's
National party and the liberal Democratic party, and the 427,000 black
voters (almost certainly an under-estimate) overwhelmingly ANC, the 1.3m
coloured electors will determine the outcome in the region.
With the coloureds disowned by the race that shared in their creation,
disenfranchised in the 1950s, and evicted in the 1960s from their historical
home known as District Six in the heart of Cape Town, Mr Nelson Mandela
might seem their natural choice.
But the ANC made a tactical error in appointing as ANC regional leader Mr
Alan Boesak. Although coloured and with a brave record of opposition to
apartheid, his troubled private life and radical reputation bother an
essentially conservative community, also fearful of ANC dominance of the new
government.
Not least of their concerns is Mr Slovo himself, sent as much to set these
fears at rest as rally the ANC vote. In private house meetings and in city
halls he canvasses support of white professionals and coloured community
leaders, helped by Mr Franklin Sonn, a respected coloured academic drafted
late into the campaign.
The night before the Guguletu rally, Mr Slovo tried to lay to rest the
communist bogy before an audience in Cape Town university's medical school
of doctors and medical workers, mostly white.
The influence of the SACP is reflected in the candidates. Of the top 200
names on the ANC list for the 400-member National Assembly, Mr Slovo is
fourth, after Mr Mandela, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC secretary general, and
Mr Thabo Mbeki, the 'shadow' foreign minister. Another 33 people on the list
are acknowledged SACP members; a further five are former members.
But, says Mr Slovo, what you see and hear is what you get: 'No hidden
agenda', he tells the audience, pointedly comparing the open stance of the
SACP to the secretive Broederbond, the elite group of Afrikaners that in its
heyday ran the National party and South Africa.
He concedes there has been a 'murky side' to the SACP past, 'locked into
horrific Stalinist distortions'.
The response, whether at the University of Cape Town, at a meeting of the
Jewish community the next day, or in the coloured homes, is difficult to
gauge - polite, but sceptical for the most part.
Guguletu is the highlight of the day: the crowd is black and ANC to the
core. But preaching to the converted in front of the television cameras may
not win floating voters.
Once a heavily fortified outpost of apartheid, in Guguletu posters urging
citizens to know their rights adorn the walls. On the dashboard of a taxi a
National party sticker, with a beaming President de Klerk, reveals the
coloured driver's preference.
Despite Mr Slovo's best efforts, he says, the National party, not the ANC,
will run the province after the election.

Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media owner, has been accused by Mr Bob Hawke,
former Australian prime minister, of not telling the truth about his claim
that the government had encouraged him to lift his stake in the Fairfax
publishing group to 35 per cent.
Mr Hawke, testifying before a Senate inquiry into foreign ownership of
Australian newspapers, said: 'The simple fact is that Conrad Black does not
tell the truth.'
The inquiry, which started in December, is investigating Mr Black's claim
that Mr Paul Keating, Mr Hawke's successor, had told him he would be allowed
to buy a 35 per cent share in Fairfax in exchange for 'balanced coverage' by
the group's publications during the election in March last year. It aims to
establish whether Mr Keating had sought to influence the decision of the
Foreign Investment Review Board.

US President Bill Clinton yesterday imposed an embargo on imports of
wildlife products from Taiwan because it had failed to stem trade in
rhinoceros and tiger parts, animals in danger of extinction, writes Nancy
Dunne in Washington.
China escaped similar sanctions after the US determined that it consolidated
and burned its stocks of rhino horn and tiger bone and enforced laws against
such trade.
The US action came under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species.

FT  12 APR 94 / World Trade News: China pact entices S Korea's big guys - An
expected surge in trade and investment by conglomerates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent visit of South Korean President Kim Young-sam to Beijing has
inaugurated a new and bigger phase of South Korean investment in China.
While small and medium-sized businesses pioneered South Korean investments
in China, the next stage will be dominated by the country's big industrial
groups, or chaebol, accompanied by their subcontractors.
The chaebol have been cautious about entering China because of market
restrictions on the sale of their products and other worries ranging from
uncertain business laws to poor infrastructure.
But the signing at the end of March of a Sino-Korean technological and
industrial pact will open up the Chinese market to such South Korean
products as cars, telecommunications equipment and electronic goods. The
conclusion of a double taxation treaty and an agreement on business
contracts will also reassure Korean investors.
The entry of the chaebol is expected to increase total cumulative South
Korean investments in China from Dollars 1bn in 1993 to Dollars 4bn by 1997,
while boosting annual direct trade from Dollars 9bn to Dollars 28bn. China
accounted for almost half of South Korean investment abroad last year, while
South Korea enjoyed a Dollars 1.1bn trade surplus with China.
Mr Todd Maurer, analyst at Dongbang Peregrine in Seoul, says China has been
'paramount to the survival of financially weaker Korean companies operating
within saturated domestic industries', such as textiles, food products and
electronic components.
These companies have been using China as a cheap manufacturing base and
re-exporting their goods, with their wholly owned factories clustered around
the rim of the Yellow Sea because of its proximity to Korea.
Although low wages appeal to the chaebol, their primary interest is in
developing markets in China in co-operation with local joint venture
partners. This reflects a shift in the chaebol's strategy toward creating
markets in the developing world, in particular in Asia, as competition
intensifies in the industrialised countries.
Moreover, the chaebol view China as a backdoor entrance to investments in
North Korea. South Korean companies may be able to avoid a ban imposed by
Seoul on their direct investments in North Korea by using Chinese joint
venture partners to establish factories there. Korean companies, such as
Samsung, are also planning to invest in Chinese-supported transport links to
the Rajin-Sonbong free trade zone in north-eastern North Korea.
The chaebol have already made initial investments in China, mainly in the
electronics sector. Samsung and Goldstar, for example, operate VCR plants in
Tianjin, a prime investment area for Korean companies.
Goldstar recently announced that it is establishing joint venture colour TV
and VCR factories in Changsha and Shanghai respectively. Meanwhile, Yukong,
Korea's biggest oil company, plans to build a Dollars 1.5bn refinery in
Shenzhen which would be the largest joint venture to date.
Samsung wants to operate plants for petrochemicals, industrial chemicals and
electronics, while participating in the construction of port facilities and
other infrastructure projects.
Daewoo plans to manufacture heavy machinery, cars and motor vehicle parts,
and electronics in China in addition to winning construction orders.
The sectors that will benefit from the new agreement include:
Motor vehicles. The deal will probably allow at least one of Korea's main
carmakers - Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo - to build a joint venture factory by
1997. Hyundai and Kia already assemble a limited number of trucks and
minibuses in China, while Hyundai and Daewoo operate a small network of
after-service outlets. Daewoo plans to establish a parts joint venture soon
in Jilin Province in the hope that it can eventually assemble cars in China.
Telecommunications: South Korea will develop a new version of its time
division exchange (TDX) system for China's telephone network. Goldstar
Telecom and Samsung Electronics are setting up joint venture manufacturing
plants for TDXs in Shandong province and want to expand into the production
of fibre optics, transmission equipment and handsets.
Aerospace: Aviation Industries of China will co-operate with Samsung
Aerospace, Daewoo Heavy Industries and Korean Air Lines in developing and
producing a medium-sized commercial airliner with 50 to 100 seats for
regional carriers in Asia. Electronics: A Korean consortium, including
Samsung and Goldstar, will provide technology for the development of
high-definition television in return for access to the Chinese market.

FT  12 APR 94 / World Trade News: Delays threaten Dollars 870m Czech oil
investment plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The future of a proposed Dollars 870m investment by a consortium of Agip,
Conoco, Shell and Total will be put at risk unless the Czech government
endorses the project at a meeting of its economic council today, sources
close to the consortium say.
A decision on the project, involving two Czech refineries and an oil
pipeline linking the Czech Republic with Germany, has been awaited for
months by consortium members, worried that nationalists in the government
who oppose foreign participation will cause further delays and render the
project unfeasible. Under the proposal the consortium would take a 49 per
cent stake in the refineries, with the government keeping 51 per cent for
the foreseeable future.
The two refineries are included in the wave of voucher privatisations now
moving into the decisive stage when voucher holders bid for shares in
specific companies. The consortium said the government must make clear its
intention to bring foreign partners into the refineries which are to be
combined within a single company as outlined in its own privatisation
programme for the oil and petrochemicals industry. Failing this, the
refineries' ownership structure will become too diversified, with competing
shareholders in the two refineries making an effective bid unworkable.
The consortium envisages investing Dollars 280m in the Chemopetrol Litvinov
refinery, in northern Bohemia near the German border, and about Dollars 240m
in the smaller Kaucuk Kralupy refinery, some 60km north of Prague.
The consortium also proposes to invest about Dollars 150m, a third of the
cost of a new oil pipeline to be built between Ingolstadt in Germany and the
two Czech refineries. A further investment of around Dollars 200m in working
capital will be needed to help start up the pipeline and other costs.
The Czech Republic imports practically all its crude oil, about 6m tonnes a
year, from Russia, making it prone to political pressures from Moscow. The
new pipeline, with an annual capacity of 10m tonnes, would 'attach' the
Czech Republic to west Europe, an analyst said. It would provide greater
security and more flexibility, by carrying different products, and could
boost Russian oil exports to Germany. It awaits approval from the Bavarian
authorities, and is expected to be completed by early 1996.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
All countries will emerge winners from the Uruguay Round trade liberalising
accords, Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, declared yesterday. Mr Sutherland said assertions that
some of the world's poorest countries would lose from the accords were based
on 'a mis-statement of the facts'. He was speaking on the eve of a four-day
meeting of ministers from more than 120 countries which will end with a
formal Uruguay Round signing on Friday.
'The least developed countries are not losers but winners,' he said. Above
all, they would gain from strong multilateral rules and disputes settlement.
For small and economically weaker countries, these rules were the only
protection from the 'law of the jungle' where 'might is right'.
Mr Sutherland said ratification of the Uruguay Round was still the subject
of debate in some countries and legislative approval by the leading trading
powers must be completed in time for the round to take effect by next
January. However, the round would not mean an end to international trade
policy disputes.
Japan is expected to call at this week's meeting for unilateral trade
weapons to be placed on the agenda of the World Trade Organisation, planned
to replace Gatt. Tokyo fears that the new international trade rules will not
curb the growing use of anti-dumping actions and US threats of unilateral
trade sanctions.
The Gatt secretariat, in an analysis published this morning, estimates that
market-opening for agricultural and industrial goods negotiated in the
Uruguay Round could add Dollars 235bn (Pounds 160.9bn) a year to world
income by 2002. This compares with estimates from the World Bank, the OECD
and others of Dollars 212bn-Dollars 274bn.
These estimates do not include expected gains from liberalisation of
services trade or the boost to business confidence and investment from
improved trade rules.
According to Gatt, industrial tariffs in developed countries will fall from
an average 6.3 per cent to 3.9 per cent. Some 43 per cent of their imports
by value will enter duty free, against 20 per cent before the round began.
Virtually all their industrial tariffs will be 'bound', giving exporters
security that they will not be raised again. Developing countries have
agreed to bind tariff lines covering 59 per cent of the value of their
imports, compared with 14 per cent before the round began.
The Gatt analysis notes that the least developed countries will receive
significantly lower tariff cuts on their exports than others - 25 per cent,
compared with 37-38 per cent.
However, if textiles and clothing, and fish and fish products, are removed
from the calculation tariff concessions to the poorest countries average 59
per cent compared with 44 per cent for industrialised nations.
In addition, abolition of quota restrictions under the Multi-Fibre
Arrangement after 10 years could in effect more than double the 22 per cent
average tariff reduction in the textiles and clothing sector, Gatt points
out.

<TEXT>
Ryanair, the Dublin-based independent airline, is to expand its budget
'no-frills' UK-Ireland services with two new UK destinations out of Dublin
from next month.
Adding Manchester and Glasgow to its destinations of Stansted, Luton,
Liverpool and Birmingham, Ryanair aims to capture market share from Aer
Lingus, the state-run airline, and Irish Sea ferry operators.
Ryanair says traffic on the Dublin-Birmingham route has grown by over 60 per
cent since it started last October, challenging the Aer Lingus monopoly on
the route. The company is confident it can achieve the same level of growth
on the Manchester and Glasgow services.
Ryanair will operate eight flights a day between Dublin and Manchester and
four between Dublin and Glasgow. Its fares will be half those currently
offered by Aer Lingus, the state-run airline, and will almost certainly
force Aer Lingus to adjust its fares on the routes.

The investigation into last month's assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo
Colosio, presidential candidate of Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary party, has received a setback after a judge freed an official
accused of helping plot the murder.
The judge on Sunday released Mr Rodolfo Rivapalacio, a PRI official who
hired the security guards accused of aiding the assassin, on the grounds of
insufficient evidence. Mr Rivapalacio had been charged with indirect
involvement in the murder.
His arrest had led to speculation that an organised faction in the PRI was
behind the murder of Mr Colosio, and his release seems to hit hopes that the
government prosecutor will discover who, if anyone, ordered the
assassination.
The judge ruled that there was sufficient evidence to bring to trial Mr
Mario Aburto, the confessed assassin, along with three security guards at
the campaign rally in Tijuana where Mr Colosio was killed - Mr Vicente
Mayoral and his son Rodolfo, and Mr Tranquilino Sanchez.
The three security guards were held on the basis of a video and photographs.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher said yesterday he would visit
Mexico next month, Reuter reports.

FT  12 APR 94 / Poll boosts Menem's ambition: Ruling party's vote share
slips as centre-left alliance sweeps capital

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's governing Peronist party won its fifth consecutive electoral
victory on Sunday, but saw its share of the vote slip from the 40 per cent
it won in 1991 and 1993 mid-term congressional elections.
The Peronists took 38 per cent of the votes in a poll to elect an assembly
that will rewrite the country's constitution.
President Carlos Menem's ambition to be re-elected to a second term in 1995
dominated the campaign. The current constitution bans presidents from
succeeding themselves and can only be amended by the specially-elected
assembly.
Former president Raul Alfonsn's Radical party was the great loser, taking
only 20 per cent of the votes in its worst result since the return of
democracy in 1983. In last year's elections it polled 30 per cent.
The great winner was the upstart Frente Grande centre-left alliance that
swept the federal district of Buenos Aires with 38 per cent of the votes,
against 25 per cent for the Peronists, by campaigning on an anti-corruption
and anti-government platform.
Mr Manuel Mora y Araujo, a leading pollster, said: 'The government did
pretty well considering it has been in power almost five years. The result
shows that economic stability is not affected. But (the government) is
showing signs of fatigue.'
Nonetheless, Mr Menem is assured of enough votes in the 305-seat assembly to
lift the re-election ban, because the Radicals pledged support for a
constitutional reform package negotiated by Mr Menem and Mr Alfonsn last
year.
Voters punished both mainstream parties, which have dominated the scene for
50 years. The Radicals lost by failing to appear as a credible opposition
force. A reputation for corruption, infighting and local political disputes
damaged the Peronists.
A record one-third of voters stayed away from the polls or spoilt their
ballots, showing only modest support for constitutional reform and Mr
Menem's re-election.

that appear to show them helping Mr Aburto gain access to Mr Colosio.
However, Mr Aburto has said he acted alone.
Mr Rivapalacio, an official in a Tijuana branch of the PRI and a former
policeman, was not implicated by the video evidence, making it hard for the
government to sustain its case against him.
The government prosecutor has not released any evidence beyond the video and
photographs. While suggestive, the photographic evidence appears to be
insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused guards.

FT  12 APR 94 / Crime laws head hectic US Congress schedule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Congress faces a hectic legislative schedule after returning to
Washington yesterday from a two-week recess, with healthcare, crime, welfare
reform and campaign finances likely to dominate debate in the coming weeks.
Crime legislation, of which one version has already passed the Senate, will
be the immediate priority, with debate scheduled in the House of
Representatives later this week.
But House leaders have not yet reached agreement on the exact contents of
their version of the bill, which will roll together measures including
proposals for mandatory life sentences for a third violent offence. Gun
control and death penalty components of the bill are likely to be
controversial.
Congressional leaders say the healthcare reform bill will be more difficult
to craft, but claim legislation can be passed by both the House and the
Senate before July, opening the way for a climactic conference between the
two chambers to reconcile their two versions, at which the real shape of the
reform will finally be determined.
Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic leader, yesterday met Senator Robert
Dole, his Republican opposite number, to try to agree on how to arrange a
busy programme for the Senate, with a possible clash looming over Mr Dole's
insistence on congressional hearings into President Bill Clinton's financial
involvement in the Whitewater affair.
Mr Dole has threatened to delay action on other legislation if he does not
get his way on Whitewater hearings, but Mr Mitchell, who had to handle
another threatened Republican filibuster yesterday over legislation to
designate 3.75m acres of Californian desert as wilderness, warned the
Republicans against such delaying tactics.
'Senator Dole is a good friend and a very smart man, but I would not want to
be him going to the American people and saying: 'We think Whitewater is more
important than passing a crime bill. We think Whitewater is more important
than passing a healthcare bill',' Mr Mitchell said in a television interview
on Sunday.
Mr Mitchell's own future could influence the Senate's work this summer. The
Democratic leader has already said he will not run for re-election in
November, but if Mr Clinton were to select him to fill the vacant seat on
the Supreme Court he might leave the leadership even sooner.
So far only Senator Thomas Daschle of South Dakota has declared himself a
candidate for the leadership, while Senator John Breaux of Louisiana, who
had been considered a leading contender, yesterday said he would not seek
the job.

FT  12 APR 94 / Canada vows to crush deficit: Finance minister flies to
London to state his case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paul Martin, Canada's finance minister, feels badly misunderstood.
In recent weeks, interest rates have soared and the Canadian dollar has been
under pressure on the foreign exchange markets. Last Friday Moody's
Investors Services announced that it might downgrade Canada's foreign
currency debt from its Aaa rating.
Yet Mr Martin, appointed finance minister in November after the Liberal
party's landslide election victory, insisted yesterday that Canada's new
government had mounted the most determined assault on the country's budget
deficit in two decades. He was in London to impress this message on
financial markets.
Mr Martin underlined that the Canadian government's policy was 'to keep its
eye on two balls - deficit reduction and job creation'. He told the
Financial Times: 'Everything should be geared to that.'
But he made clear that fiscal rectitude came first in his list of
priorities. Canada last week announced its best employment figures for two
years with a sharp fall in unemployment to 10.6 per cent in March from 11.1
per cent in February and 11.4 per cent in January. Mr Martin was in no mood
to make optimistic predictions or hail the drop in the jobless rate as a
sign that Canada's export and investment-led economic recovery was becoming
more broadly based.
'We were elected to create jobs, and we recognise that we can't create jobs
unless we mount a fundamental assault on the deficit problem,' he said.
Mr Martin stressed that the government would not retreat from the goal
enshrined in its February budget of bringing the deficit down to 3 per cent
of gross domestic product or about CDollars 25bn (Pounds 12.3bn) by 1996-97.
The budget, which envisages a reduction in the deficit to CDollars 39.7bn in
1994-95 from CDollars 45.7bn last year, 'is the most significant budget in
the last 20 years in terms of cuts'.
The financial markets had failed to recognise that it involved 'a deep
restructuring of the way government operates', including radical reductions
in unemployment insurance and defence expenditure. The markets were wrong to
fear that deficit reduction might be put off course by higher interest rates
following the rise in US rates since February.
The government had planned for the unexpected, Mr Martin said. 'We will take
whatever action is required to hit our targets.'
It was not properly understood abroad that the 3 per cent deficit to GDP
target was anchored in legislation that would be passed in this year's
budget bill and that budgets in later years would seek to cut the deficit
even more.
Meanwhile, Canada has an inflation rate that is well below the average of
the main industrial countries, productivity increases 'are going
gangbusters' and growth, at an annual rate of 3.8 per cent in the final
quarter of last year, is high by international standards and above the
government's expectations of a 3 per cent annual rise. Higher than expected
growth added further credibility to the government's budget targets, he
said.

FT  12 APR 94 / IADB capital to be boosted by two-thirds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   GUADALAJARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An agreement to expand the capital of the Inter-American Development Bank by
two-thirds was forged early yesterday by shareholder governments. The change
enlarges the stakes of Japan and Europe in the institution.
The accord will take the capital of the bank from Dollars 61bn to Dollars
101bn (Pounds 69bn), making it the largest of the regional development
banks. The stake of Japan will rise from 1.1 to 5 per cent and that of four
of the five main European shareholders will double. Germany, Spain, France
and Italy will increase their share of the bank to just under 2 per cent,
but Britain's will remain unchanged at under 1 per cent.
The agreement, which accomplishes a long-held Japanese ambition to increase
its influence in a region where it has financially supported US initiatives,
will be achieved by reducing the share held by the US, Canada and Latin
American members in the bank. The US stake drops to a fraction above 30 per
cent from 34.67 per cent, while that held by Latin American and Caribbean
countries falls to 50 per cent from 53.86 per cent. Two extra board seats
were created, for Japan and Chile, bringing the board size to 14.
The move was broadly welcomed. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, said
in Washington: 'The agreement represents tremendous progress, reflecting the
vitality of both the bank and the region.' Mr Hans-Peter Repnik, Germany's
vice-minister for economic co-operation and development, who chaired the
talks, said he was 'very satisfied by the result, particularly because it
gives the non-regional countries finally their proper role in the most
important development institution for Latin America and the Caribbean'.
The accord, which allows the bank to lend indefinitely at the current rate
of Dollars 6bn a year or somewhat more, will also set in train big changes
for the bank's operations.
In a move designed to meet concerns that newly privatised companies will be
unable to raise finance, the bank will be expected to make up to 5 per cent
of its loans to the private sector. Convention previously dictated the bank
make all its loans under government guarantee.
Loans to the private sector will be expected to encourage further lending by
private financial institutions. In no case will the bank's lending exceed
Dollars 75m or 25 per cent of a project's costs. Interest rates will be
decided on a case-by-case basis depending on the perceived risk of the
project, and could theoretically be higher or lower than the lending rate to
governments, currently 7.26 per cent.
Asked about concerns that lending without government guarantee could hurt
the bank's top credit rating, Mr Repnik said the bank's management had shown
itself capable of handling the risks. 'I don't see any particular risk, but
rather new possibilities,' he said.
The bank will also expand lending to fight poverty. Some 40 per cent of the
value of loans and 50 per cent of the number of loan operations will be
directed towards social sectors.
Some 35 per cent of total lending will be directed to the region's smaller
countries.

FT  12 APR 94 / US plays down Latin American Nafta hopes: Washington
cautious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US officials are beginning a campaign to play down Latin American countries'
expectations of quick accession to the North American Free Trade Agreement,
while trying to maintain progress towards more liberal trade in the western
hemisphere.
The officials, conscious that the summit of Latin American leaders set for
Miami in December risks raising expectations of rapid Nafta expansion, say
they are still formulating policy. But discussions at conferences in
Guadalajara around the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank
have provided some indication of the possible direction of US policy.
In the next few months, two reports by the administration will go to
Congress. The first in May will provide a general overview of countries in
Latin America and elsewhere and of how they measure up to standards seen as
vital to either Nafta association or a bilateral free trade accord with the
US, such as the extent to which the economy has been liberal-ised and opened
to free trade.
In July, the administration must notify Congress of the countries with which
it believes it will be able to enter talks. In doing so it will ask for
fast-track authority, under which Congress gives the administration a free
negotiating hand. It will not be able to do this again until July 1997.
According to US officials, the net is likely to be cast as widely as
possible, but being nominated will not imply a rapid movement toward
negotiations. With mid-term congressional elections due in November, the
administration will have other priorities for the second half of this year.
Nafta came into force between the US, Canada and Mexico at the start of the
year, and the Nafta vote in Congress in November was described by one
official as 'one of the most divisive and dramatic in recent US history'.
The administration will not be rushing to repeat the experience.
Negotiations with Chile - the one country with which President Bill Clinton
is so far committed to negotiate - appear unlikely to start in earnest
before 1995, officials confirmed.
But in the interim the administration wants to keep the process on track,
first by ensuring other trade arrangements in the hemisphere do not push
potential partners further away from Nafta, and second by encouraging other
countries to adopt measures that will bring them closer to Nafta
qualification.
Ms Carmen Suro-Bredie, assistant US trade representative responsible for the
region, said this interim strategy would seek to establish bilateral
investment treaties and more satisfactory arrangements to protect
intellectual property in the region.
She said the US would 'look at integration schemes across the border and
links between Asia and Latin America'. Latin America's evolving trade
arrangements should be transparent and should not create barriers to trade
by outside countries. This should help to ensure that new arrangements do
not impede future efforts to accede to Nafta.

FT  12 APR 94 / Rift grows over UN action: Russia insists that it should
have been consulted over air strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the heart of one of the biggest diplomatic rifts between Russia and the
west since the end of the cold war lies the question of how much power Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, has to act on his own.
Western governments insist legal and diplomatic procedures were followed to
the letter before Nato's air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs.
The decision to recommend air attacks was taken by the UN commander in
Bosnia, General Sir Michael Rose, who says he issued repeated warnings to
the Serbs before making a move. He passed on his proposal to Mr Yasushi
Akashi, the Japanese diplomat who has been given wide-ranging authority as
the secretary-general's representative in Bosnia.
Mr Akashi, after consultations with his boss in New York, then made a formal
request for support to Nato, which has been mandated by Mr Boutros Ghali to
give air support for the international peacekeeping effort in Bosnia.
President Yeltsin maintains that Russia, a permanent member of the Security
Council, ought to have been consulted.
Western governments, in justification of the air raids, have cited Security
Council Resolution 836, which allows member states or regional organisations
to protect UN forces in Yugoslavia with 'all necessary measures, including
air power'. It specifies that these protective measures must be taken 'under
the authority of the Security Council and subject to close co-ordination
with the secretary-general and Unprofor (the UN force in former
Yugoslavia)'. This wording would not suggest Mr Boutros Ghali requires any
fresh, explicit mandate to order air strikes; but Russia can still argue
that the secretary-general has a standing obligation to consult the Security
Council's permanent members.
While the bombings will strengthen anti-western feeling in the state Duma
(parliament), it was significant that the Russian Foreign Ministry focused
on the need to continue peace efforts and stop the western military being
sucked further into the conflict.
'Things went terribly wrong in Goradze,' said Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian
negotiator in Yugoslavia. 'We are very much concerned. . . that we may be on
a slippery slope in terms of international involvement in the fighting. We
will be trying to do everything we can in order to prevent situations where
such actions could even be contemplated.'
Mr Vyacheslav Nikonov, chairman of the Duma's subcommittee on international
security, appeared to echo the view of Russian foreign policy makers when he
deplored the fact that Russia had not been consulted but hoped that
relations with the west would not be damaged as a result.
'My first feeling was one of disappointment because for several weeks we had
hoped that the peace process was moving ahead and I think the strikes will
now interfere with this process,' said Mr Nikonov, whose Russian Unity and
Accord party is less nationalistic than the communists and far right who
dominate parliament. The strikes would not only produce predictable 'fury'
in the Duma but would 'also add to some tensions between Russia and the
west'.
A first test of the longer-term impact on foreign policy will be whether
Russia still signs up with Nato's partnership for peace programme later this
month as planned. Mr Nikonov said that although opposition to the programme
would only strengthen in the Duma, the way the air strikes had been carried
out, without consulting Russia, only underlined the need for closer military
co-operation.
Part of Russia's grievance lies in the fact that western governments have
two separate inputs into Bosnian policy. The US, Britain and France are
makers of UN policy as permanent members of the Security Council, and
executors of that policy as participants of Nato - which has been invited by
the secretary-general to play the role of 'regional organisation', as
referred to in Resolution 836.
For the western governments, there was was no danger of Mr Boutros Ghali
acting 'behind their backs' - because it was their firepower on which he was
relying.
In practice there is no other organisation besides Nato with the military
clout, and above all the co-ordinated structure, to police the skies of
Bosnia. But its role leaves Russia out in the cold, and acts as a red rag to
nationalist bulls.

FT  12 APR 94 / Bosnian Serbs choose the hard option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By stepping up their attacks on Gorazde in defiance of Nato air strikes, the
Bosnian Serbs have chosen a course of confrontation with the most powerful
states in the world.
Bosnian Serb forces yesterday sealed off Sarajevo from the outside world in
an effort to show that they still controlled the destiny of the Bosnian
capital.
Meanwhile, Serb leaders hailed the Nato intervention as yet another example
of western betrayal and conspiracies against the Serbs.
If he allows them to stick to this collision course, their protector,
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, is in danger of finding himself
backed into a corner. On past performance, it is in just such a situation
that he is liable to take the most unpredictable and destructive decisions.
His calculation may be based on the belief that he can back his own putative
sponsor President Boris Yeltsin of Russia into a corner, obliging him to
take Serbia's side against the western coalition, which since the end of the
cold war has dominated the UN.
In previous crises in former Yugoslavia, such calculations have proved
false, leaving Serb leaders disappointed and Mr Yeltsin a target of
vitriolic abuse from Serbian political leaders and media.
This time Mr Milosevic appears convinced that he can get Russia on his side.
In a bid to drive a wedge between Russia and the west, Serb leaders
yesterday severed all relations with the UN, naming Mr Vitaly Churkin,
Russia's special peace envoy, as the only channel of communication.
Even if his gamble fails, Mr Milosevic has the upper hand over his Bosnian
Serb proteges, in that he has no particular stake in Gorazde.
Serbs appear to believe that he has fulfilled his pledge to stop the war at
Serbia's frontiers.
At the same time, he has succeeded in carving out a Greater Serbia, in fact
if not in name, through the creation of two sister republics on Bosnian and
Croatian territory.
Whether one of these republics includes the pocket of Gorazde is of little
or no consequence to most Serbs in Serbia proper.
They are tired of sanctions, imposed because of Belgrade's role in the
violent partition of Bosnia, and indifferent to the map of the new post-war
Bosnia. Mr Milosevic knows this and he wants to push for a deal in order to
get sanctions lifted. By contrast, the self-styled 'Serb Republic' covering
some 70 per cent of Bosnian territory, has been carved out over two years of
war.
General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb commander, has repeatedly rejected any
proposal to hand back land, for which Serb fighters have fallen. The issue
for the Serbs in Goradze is obviously not whether they would be willing to
hand it back, since despite unremitting attacks, it is still under Bosnian
government control.
But its continued existence as a Moslem enclave prevents the Serbs from
consolidating their control over the whole of eastern Bosnia. Further,
Bosnian government attacks from Gorazde have disrupted communications
between Serb-held zones in the west and south, where a relatively narrow
corridor separates the enclave from Sarajevo.
Bosnian Serb leaders cannot be divided into hawks and doves. They all agree
that the war was an inevitable 'defence against the Moslem threat'. But the
air strike has given fresh impetus to those leaders who have always argued
that the UN was anti-Serb and may thus make it more difficult for Mr Radovan
Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, to compromise with western demands for
territorial concessions regardless of instructions from Mr Milosevic.
Mrs Biljan Plavsic, a Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday went so far as to
proclaim the UN as the new aggressor against the Serb people.

FT  12 APR 94 / Zhirinovsky fans the flames
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of the Russian reactions to the Nato attacks, none was more extreme, nor
more predictable, than that of the nationalist leader Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, who yesterday called on Russia to bomb Nato bases in Italy in
response to the air strikes on Gorazde.
'They bomb one town, we bomb another town,' he said, immediately ahead of a
debate on the situation in the former Yugoslavia at the 32-nation Council of
Europe, which promotes human rights and democracy.
Mr Zhirinovsky, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, said
he favoured solving the issue of Yugoslavia by peaceful means, but insisted
that Nato had initiated the aggression.
'It's against Russia, it's for more interests of Germany in the Balkans, of
Nato in the Balkans, it's against the Orthodox, against the Slav people.'
Well known for his vitriolic attacks and statements, Mr Zhirinovsky
reinforced his image as an aggressor with an outburst on a group of
protesters on his way to the meeting. Spitting and hurling stones at a group
of Jewish students protesting against anti-Semitism, Mr Zhirinovsky said he
would 'break their heads.'
The man who has threatened to bomb the Kurile Islands and dump nuclear waste
on the Baltics suggested to the protesters that he would use his 'atomic
pistol' on them.
Mr Zhirinovsky's visit, which has provoked some unease in France, was
arranged as part of a wider visit by 18 delegates from different political
groups in the Russian parliament.
The Council of Europe was yesterday at pains to point out that Mr
Zhirinovsky was not invited explicitly by them to attend the conference on
the former Yugoslavia. 'It is not for us to choose who represents Russia -
the Russians chose groups from across the political spectrum - that's
parliamentary democracy,' one official commented.
France has warned Mr Zhirinovsky he faces expulsion if he makes trouble. To
show its displeasure at his presence in the official Russian delegation,
Paris has told him he may only stay for the one week of the session and may
not leave Strasbourg.

European Commission officials are hopeful that informal discussions can
smooth over some of the disputes which have come to the fore during
negotiations on the Uruguay Round of global trade reform and EU plans to
develop European information highways. The optimism follows talks between
European and US business leaders and officials in New York last week. A
Brussels spokeswoman said the largest obstacles concerned standardisation,
intellectual property rights and data protection, where the lack of
harmonisation has led companies on both sides to complain of discrimination.
EU officials are due to hold another round of discussions with US officials
and possibly Japanese representatives again in the autumn.

The French centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur suffered a 10 per
cent decline in its popularity and support last month, according to a poll
by the Louis Harris market research consultancy. At the end of March the
government commanded the approval of just 41 per cent of the French public
against 51 per cent a month earlier, according to the poll commissioned by
Profession Politique magazine. The proportion of the electorate claiming to
be dissatisfied with the government rose by 10 points to 54 per cent over
the same period. The fall in support for Mr Balladur's policies follows his
abandonment of plans to cut the minimum wage for young workers after violent
protests from students and youths. It also reflects concern about the
continuing pressures on the French economy.

Ireland's 1994 finance bill, to be published today, includes measures to
improve the investment climate for small and medium-size businesses. It will
also provide additional attractions for the development of Dublin's offshore
financial centre and the city's derelict docklands. Mr Bertie Ahern, finance
minister, said the overall effect of the measures should have a 'broadly
neutral' effect on the government's borrowing requirement thanks to the
additional economic activity expected to be generated.
The measures include raising the thresholds for VAT registration and
increasing relief on capital gains tax, the introduction of capital
allowances for the purchase of computer software, and an easing of
restrictions on business expansion schemes. Of interest to UK mushroom
growers will be the ending of the preferential 10 per cent corporation tax

FT  12 APR 94 / US plea on German reactor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US has asked Germany to reconsider plans to build a nuclear research
reactor using bomb-grade highly enriched uranium, a step which it says would
set back 10 years of efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. The State
Department has voiced its concern to the German government about the FRM-II
neutron source reactor, to be built near Munich in Bavaria, for which
licensing hearings are expected to begin next month. The US has also warned
Germany that it will not supply HEU fuel for the reactor.
For the past 20 years the US has tried to persuade other countries to
convert their research reactors, some of which, unlike normal power
generation reactors, can only be run effectively on HEU, to switch to lower
enrichment uranium. A similar advanced neutron source reactor planned in the
US is now expected to use LEU after feasibility studies were carried out by
the US government, but German officials said LEU would add considerably to
the cost of the FRM-II plant.
Some German reactor operators have suggested Russia could be an alternative
supplier of HEU, but German officials said such a radical step was not yet
under consideration. But the willingness of European research reactors to
co-operate with US non-proliferation goals has been stretched by the US
Department of Energy's failure so far to fulfil its undertaking to take
their spent fuel for disposal. An emergency solution to the spent fuel issue
was expected to be completed by the end of March, but has been put off again
until Friday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government has delivered an economic action plan to the
International Monetary Fund in an effort to unlock a new Dollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 1.02bn) loan. A copy of the memorandum, agreed between Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin's government, the Russian central bank and IMF officials,
promises to lower inflation to 7 per cent a month by the end of this year.
The government undertakes to keep strict limits on the budget deficit, while
the central bank will keep its main discount rate at just 5 percentage
points below inter-bank interest rates.
The document reverses Mr Chernomyrdin's public declarations last winter that
he planned to fight inflation with 'non-monetary' means and exposes him to
suspicions by both conservatives and radical reformers of his true
intentions.
From this month, Moscow promises to abolish export quotas except on key
exports such as natural gas and crude oil. Having just promised to review
increases in import tariffs on food, the government says it will keep
tariffs at an average level of 15 per cent, and will produce by October 1 a
3-5 year timetable for the gradual reduction of these tariffs. General
undertakings include a promise to improve supervision of Russian commercial
banks, continuation of the privatisation drive and a new budgetary system
devolving responsibilities to Russia's regions.

FT  12 APR 94 / Tensions fired by seizure of Black Sea fleet ship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KIEV, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A 'bandit attack' on a Black Sea fleet ship has raised tensions to their
highest level yet in a two-year dispute between Ukraine and Russia over the
fleet's property and national allegiance.
At the end of last week, Russian sailors defied Ukrainian orders and left
Odessa with one of the fleet's ships, carrying Dollars 10m-worth of
radio-navigational equipment. According to a Defence Ministry official in
Kiev, they took a senior Ukrainian military officer hostage and cut tow
ropes in the middle of the night to take the ship to sea. A coastguard boat
which tried to stop them was fired on with tracer bullets and water cannon.
Russian television countered that the 'defection' of the ship, the Cheleken,
was prompted by Ukraine's failure to meet its share of the cost of the
navigational equipment.
Ukraine, however, called the ship's seizure 'an act of piracy' and condemned
the Russian officers for creating 'a precedent of a sharp escalation of
tensions which might have led to grave consequences'. The Russian commander
of the Black Sea fleet, Admiral Eduard Baltin, also condemned the action as
'an act of uncontrolled bandit formations'.
The two countries agreed after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 to
split the Ukraine-based Black Sea fleet within three years. Last September,
under pressure of massive energy debts, Ukraine then agreed to sell its half
to Russia. Later, however, the agreement, already unpopular in Kiev, fell
apart and new negotiations on dividing the ships have stalled. These more
violent confrontations over the past few days reflect the precarious nature
of the currently unresolved arrangement.
Russian fury was aroused yesterday over a Ukrainian attack on the
Russian-controlled naval base in Odessa in retaliation for the seizure of
the Cheleken. It accused Ukrainian special forces of storming the base,
wounding servicemen and their families, and of blockading a second
installation. A navy spokesman in Moscow said 120 soldiers had attacked the
base, which is a reserve yard for the fleet, on Sunday night, seizing the
shore area, armoury, communications and security sections.
Police in Ukraine confirmed that an attack had taken place, but Defence
Ministry officials denied force had been used. They said paratroopers had
entered the base to arrest three Russian officers wanted in connection with
the seizure of the Cheleken.
The commander-in-chief of the Russian navy, Admiral Felix Gromov, said the
attack was a flagrant violation of agreements on joint control of the fleet
and had created an 'explosive situation'.
The fleet has been the most acute source of tension between the two former
Soviet republics. Disputes over bases and control of ships have repeatedly
clouded relations, Ukrainian nationalists accusing Moscow of 'imperialist'
bullying.
Moscow has repeatedly complained that Kiev, beset by worse economic problems
than its northern neighbour, is failing to pay its share of the cost of the
fleet. Though the situation was calm yesterday afternoon, a senior Russian
diplomat said Kiev could expect a tough response and he hinted there could
be further cross-retaliation.

FT  12 APR 94 / Ukrainian vote brings reform no closer: Elections have
failed to resolve the crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ukrainian elections have produced a parliament torn between left-wing
pro-Russian forces, a smaller group of nationalist parties and a 'swamp' of
independent candidates - a result forecast to further delay reform of the
country's plunging economy and of its fractured politics.
Communists, socialists and their Peasant party allies seem likely to be the
strongest party bloc, last night claiming some 110 of the 337 seats where
candidates have been announced after a second round of voting. Of the
remaining seats in the 450-seat parliament, some have still to be announced
while others failed to produce the qualifying number of votes and will
require a third round of voting.
The centrist-reformist parties did very poorly, a bad sign for an economy in
which reforms have been constantly delayed by lack of agreement in
parliament. The Interregional Reform Bloc of Mr Leonid Kuchma, the former
prime minister who tried to make the case for economic transformation, has
only four seats so far.
To further deepen the crisis, voters in the Crimean peninsula - where the
dominant ethnic Russians are calling for semi-independence from Ukraine -
returned a local assembly dominated by pro-Russian and Communist deputies.
The 'Russia Bloc' took 54 of the 94 declared seats, with Communists taking
another 15, both groups advocating much closer ties with Russia.
Mr Leonid Hrach, the Crimean Communist leader, said that 'the Ukrainian
people have called for the idea of communism', adding that the solution to
Ukraine's problems was only possible by integrating its economy with other
members of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Mr Yuri Yekhanourov, the reformist-minded deputy economic minister, said
yesterday 'the new parliament will be unable to take any real decisions, and
there will also be a battle between it and the local authorities. The
results mean we will lose a further two years, and the economy will continue
its decline'.
The result, however, belied the predictions - some would say hopes - of
President Leonid Kravchuk that the turnout would generally fail to reach the
50 per cent figure required to make each deputy's election legal. The
overall average turnout was around 66 per cent, though the figure was lower
in the capital, Kiev, with a number of constituencies reporting turnout in
the 40 per cent band.
The only other bright spot was the return to parliament of several
reform-minded figures. Besides Mr Kuchma, prominent deputies in the new
parliament include Mr Victor Penzenik and Mr Volodymyr Lanovoi, both former
deputy premiers and Mr Roman Shpek, the outgoing economics minister.
At the same time, those elected to parliament cannot, under present law,
also serve in the government, reducing the field of ministerial talent in a
country where able reformers are few.
The new parliament inherits a constitutional tangle which appears certain to
set it at odds. Mr Kravchuk has said he will refuse to stand in presidential
elections scheduled for June 26 unless a law cancelling the appointment of
presidential representatives to the regions and giving full authority to the
regional authorities, is itself cancelled. At the same time, the basic
question of division of powers between the presidency and the parliament is
unclear, while a new constitution is not even in preparation.
The nationalists, whose main force remains the Rukh grouping which draws its
principal support from western Ukraine, yesterday claimed around 80 members
and supporters in the parliament, though Rukh itself had only 21 members in
the preliminary figures released by Interfax news agency last night. Mr
Vyacheslav Chornovil, Rukh's leader, said yesterday that 'economic collapse
is giving an opening to extremists'.
The numerical 'victors' were, on last night's figures, the 167 deputies who
claimed no party label - though some are close to the formal parties. The
struggle for their allegiance will dominate the politics of the new
parliament. Many are enterprise directors and officials likely to tend
towards the pro-integration Communists in the hope that closer links with
Russian and the other CIS economies boost trade and give them access to
lower-priced energy.
The extreme nationalists, who in their furthest right manifestations openly
espouse fascist and militaristic postures, gained a toehold in the new
parliament. The Ukrainian Nationalist Congress won four seats and the
UNA/UNSO bloc three. Mr Chornovil, who backs an unsteady strategy of
moderating the nationalist message of his party, dissociated himself from
them yesterday, saying they constituted one of the extremes which would
neuter the parliament.
The first test will come on Thursday, at a meeting in Moscow of the CIS
heads of state at which a new economic union will be discussed and Ukraine
will be pressed to define its hitherto ambiguous stand on closer ties.

FT  12 APR 94 / Swedes enshrine right to know in their EU deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Amid all the wrangles over voting rights, fishing rights and farm subsidies
in the European Union's enlargement negotiations last month, a declaration
by Sweden attached to its accession accord with Brussels passed almost
unnoticed.
It asserted Sweden's right to continue to exercise a deeply entrenched
policy of open government and freedom of information.
Such is the importance attached in Sweden to the principle of open
government that Stockholm felt it necessary to include the declaration in
its EU accession documents to reassure voters worried that joining the EU
might erode citizens' right of access to state-held information.
The most celebrated example is the right all Swedes have to read the
official correspondence of the prime minister - without delay.
'Actually, the way it works it is possible sometimes for a reporter to see
some non-urgent letters before the minister,' says Mr Goran Schader, a
senior official at the justice ministry.
Public officials are explicitly given the right to leak information as part
of their rights to the freedom of expression. Early this year, most of the
details of the 1994-95 budget were published in the national newspapers
several days before Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, presented them to
parliament.
The country's first freedom of the press legislation was enacted in 1766.
The current freedom of the press law which enshrines the principle of open
government was passed in 1949 and is part of the written constitution.
All ministries and local authorities are obliged to keep a register of
completed documents which citizens can freely peruse and have access to,
like a public library.
There are, however, seven areas where the state may withhold information,
ranging from state security, through currency policy and individual privacy
to the protection of animals and plants, with restrictions up to 20 years.
Swedish officials and politicians of all parties boast that the policy of
open government has ensured a virtual lack of public corruption. 'It makes
everyone aware that they are operating in the public eye,' says Mr Schader.
'It encourages efficiency and the fair treatment of every case.'
Some Swedes feel access is too open, especially information about private
individuals that can be obtained by fellow citizens. Details of individual
income taxes are publicly available, for example. There is also a campaign
to make the possession of child pornography a crime.
In case European leaders may fret that their confidential musings in EU
council meetings might suddenly pop up in publicly-available Swedish
briefing papers, Mr Schader points out that any threat of damage to foreign
relations is a case for restricting information under the secrecy law.
'We have conducted foreign relations for centuries without this being a
problem. I don't think anyone should feel that you can't tell Sweden
something for fear of it suddenly appearing on the front page of the
newspapers.'

A left-wing Greek terrorist organisation yesterday claimed it had fired a
rocket at the British aircraft carrier Ark Royal while it was docked in
Piraeus harbour for maintenance work. In a call to a radio station, the
group also claimed responsibility for attacks on Sunday night on two foreign
insurance companies in Athens. A search of the vessel revealed no evidence
to back the terrorist group's claim. However, Greek police later found two
3.5in rockets and two plastic pipes, apparently intended as launchers, in a
timber warehouse near where the ship was docked.

FT  12 APR 94 / US urges Bonn to halt reactor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US has asked Germany to reconsider plans to build a nuclear research
reactor using bomb-grade highly enriched uranium, a step which it says would
set back 10 years of efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. The State
Department has voiced its concern to the German government about the FRM-II
neutron source reactor, to be built near Munich in Bavaria, for which
licensing hearings are expected to begin next month. The US has also warned
Germany that it will not supply HEU fuel for the reactor.
For the past 20 years the US has tried to persuade other countries to
convert their research reactors, some of which, unlike normal power
generation reactors, can only be run effectively on HEU, to switch to lower
enrichment uranium. A similar advanced neutron source reactor planned in the
US is now expected to use LEU after feasibility studies were carried out by
the US government, but German officials said LEU would add considerably to
the cost of the FRM-II plant.
Some German reactor operators have suggested Russia could be an alternative
supplier of HEU, but German officials said such a radical step was not yet
under consideration. But the willingness of European research reactors to
co-operate with US non-proliferation goals has been stretched by the US
Department of Energy's failure so far to fulfil its undertaking to take
their spent fuel for disposal. An emergency solution to the spent fuel issue
was expected to be completed by the end of March, but has been put off again
until Friday.

Russia and Ukraine yesterday traded accusations over the storming of a
Russian-controlled naval base in Odessa. Moscow alleged Ukraine had used
armed force and wounded servicemen in response to Ukraine's earlier
accusations that Russia had stolen naval equipment at the weekend.
Ukrainian military authorities denied using force in the incident, which
took place on Sunday night. They said that the troops had acted to detain
three officers who had ordered Russian sailors to defy Ukrainian orders and
sail a research ship out of Odessa.
According to the Russian reports, 120 Ukrainian soldiers stormed a Russian
naval base in Odessa on Sunday night, opened fire and injured several
servicemen and their families. Reports from Moscow also said that a second
Russian-controlled base near Odessa was blockaded by 40 Ukrainian soldiers
yesterday.
Ukraine's Defence Ministry called the Russian allegations over the use of
force 'a lie' designed to provoke 'an armed conflict between Black Sea fleet
servicemen, Odessa port officials, border guards and Ukraine's navy'.
Ukraine said it had only detained Russian officers who defied Ukrainian
orders on Friday night, when the two navies narrowly avoided an armed clash
near Odessa. Ukraine also strenuously denied surrounding the second Russian
base.
The Russian government protested to Ukraine demanding the officers'
immediate release. Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin spoke to Ukraine's
President Leonid Kravchuk by telephone, but details of their discussion were
not released.
The heated confrontation was the latest and most serious in two years of
disputes when the fleet was put under Russian-Ukrainian joint command
following the break-up of the Soviet Union. The tensions have arisen over
property rights and allegiance between the Ukrainian military and the
largely Russian-controlled and financed fleet.
The conflict began on Friday night when a Russian ship, the Cheleken, loaded
Dollars 10m worth of naval navigational equipment at Odessa and sailed away
toward its headquarters in Sevastopol, Crimea, despite objections by
Ukrainian naval officials.
The Russian ship, part of the 300-vessel Black Sea fleet awkwardly shared
between Russia and Ukraine, defied Ukrainian orders to remain in the port of
Odessa. After Ukrainian border guards tried to block the ship, Russian
sailors took a senior Ukrainian military officer hostage and cut tow ropes
in the middle of the night to take to sea, a Ukrainian Defence Ministry
spokesman said.
Ukraine is calling the seizure of equipment 'an act of piracy' and is
condemning the Russian officers for creating 'a precedent of a sharp
escalation of tensions which might have led to grave consequences'. Russia
says Ukraine's failure to pay its debts for the equipment, which needed
maintenance, justified the move.
On Sunday night, Ukrainian special forces reportedly attacked an Odessa
reserve naval yard of the Black Sea fleet and took control of its armoury.
During the attack, bystanders were injured by flying glass and some Russian
soldiers may have been beaten. Tensions had eased by yesterday afternoon
although the rhetoric was stepped up.

FT  12 APR 94 / Portugal's budget deficit plans: Economic Watch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal's 1995 budget is being drawn up with a planned primary deficit of
about 5 per cent of gross domestic product, according to Mr Eduardo Catroga,
the finance minister. This would represent a fall from a planned primary
deficit of 6 per cent this year and a revised deficit of 7.1 per cent in
1992, he said. 'The fundamental guideline of the 1995 budget is a
continuation of the objective of budget consolidation,' he said. He
reiterated the centre-right government's determination to reach the budget
deficit target set in its programme of economic convergence with the
European Union.
Norway's consumer prices rose 0.5 per cent in March after a 0.4 per cent
gain in February. The annual rate was 1 per cent. Wholesale prices rose 0.2
per cent in March after an 0.4 per cent rise in February. The annual rate
was 0.7 per cent.
Russian weekly inflation rose to 2.2 per cent in the week from March 29 to
April 5 from 1.8 per cent in the previous week, the government said. In the
latest week, prices for consumer services rose 11.9 per cent while food
prices rose 1.4 per cent.

FT  12 APR 94 / German tangle may delay sale of Lancer Boss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The receiver of Lancer Boss, the last leading UK-owned producer of lift
trucks, warned yesterday that efforts to sell the group as a going concern
might be delayed if he could not get control of the company's important
German operations.
Mr Allan Griffiths, a partner in Grant Thornton, the accountants, said two
prospective UK purchasers of Lancer Boss had contacted him, but expressed
his concern that Steinbock Boss, the UK company's struggling German unit,
was in the hands of a German administrator.
Mr Griffiths and Mr Scott Barnes, his colleague, were appointed
administrative receivers for Lancer Boss Group, the UK holding company, and
certain UK subsidiaries on Friday.
Grant Thornton is now urgently seeking to establish links with the Munich
lawyer who has been named as German administrator to establish what powers
he has to sell Steinbock Boss. Mr Peter Fletcher, of Grant Thornton, was due
to fly out last night to meet the lawyer. The UK receivers are keen to
co-operate with their German counterpart because Mr Griffiths believes the
group is worth more if the UK and German operations are sold as one unit. He
is expecting inquiries from prospective foreign purchasers.
He admitted that it was an 'extremely unusual' situation for a UK receiver
not to have full control of a company.
It emerged yesterday that the German banking group had withdrawn support
from Steinbock Boss after the company's directors vetoed a deal under which
Jungheinrich, the Hamburg-based lift truck producer, would have bought the
Moosburg-based company.
It is understood that the German banks strongly backed the deal, which would
have provided a domestic solution to Steinbock Bock's troubles and created a
new force in the industry. Jungheinrich, which claims to be the world's
third-largest lift truck maker and the European leader in battery-powered
vehicles, said it had been negotiating with Lancer Boss over Steinbock for
some time.
In an usually forthright statement for a German company, it said it was
'astonished' that the British group had not responded to its proposals and
that the insolvency of Steinbock had been 'accepted'.
Jungheinrich indicated that it hoped to reach an agreement for the
acquisition of Steinbock Boss from the liquidators some time this week. That
would thwart Mr Griffiths' plan to sell the group in one piece.
The German company was also interested in an Austrian subsidiary.

FT  12 APR 94 / Nato raids strain ties with Moscow: Yeltsin bitter at
exclusion from UN policy - Clinton defends strikes against Serbs in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Relations between Russia and the west came under fresh strain yesterday
after a second Nato air strike against Serb forces bombarding the Bosnian
enclave of Gorazde.
United Nations officials said the Serb shelling continued sporadically for
about two hours after US aircraft bombed their positions for the second
successive day.
One shell fell yards from the local headquarters of the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees. The situation was reported to be calm at nightfall.
President Bill Clinton called the latest air strikes - which destroyed three
armoured personnel carriers and a truck - 'entirely appropriate'. He urged
the Serbs to resume talks and insisted that the raids had been in keeping
with Security Council decisions.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned that Nato was prepared
to attack again if shelling went on. He said the UN wanted the Serbs to pull
back to their positions of March 30 before they began their attack on
Gorazde, which is held by Bosnian Moslems.
Mr Clinton pledged to keep in touch with Russia's government, which has
complained bitterly about being excluded from UN policy in Bosnia. He said:
'They have a critical role to play if we are going to get those peace talks
going again.' President Boris Yeltsin, setting off for a visit to Spain,
told reporters he had complained to President Clinton that America had not
consulted Moscow before Sunday's attack.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said in Madrid it had been
a 'big mistake' to launch air attacks without consulting Moscow. He called
the decision a hasty one that had failed to take account of all the
consequences. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, refused to meet
Mr Charles Redman, the US negotiator, in Sarajevo and accused the UN of
siding with the Bosnian Moslems.
The Serbs blocked traffic in and out of the city and virtually broke off
relations with the UN. They said that from now on Serbs would deal with the
UN only through Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian special envoy, who travelled
to Pale, the Bosnian Serb stronghold above Sarajevo, for talks to ease the
crisis.
In yesterday's action, two US F-18s attacked Serbian T55 tanks and personnel
carriers with 20mm cannon and Mk 82 bombs after a tank had fired directly at
the town, ignoring the aircraft's warning passes and dropped flares. Three
personnel carriers were destroyed and a truck hit, said the US defence
department.
Hinting at direct Serbian intervention in the war in Bosnia, a senior
Yugoslav army officer said the 'act of aggression would lead to
unpredictable consequences' and that the army had taken steps 'for its own
defence'.
Mr Kozyrev said he had conveyed his concerns to Mr Christopher. 'I do not
want to aggravate the situation, which is bad as it is, but would like my
words to be taken very seriously,' he added.
General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, also voiced Moscow's
unhappiness in a conversation with Mr William Perry, his US counterpart.
Officials in Washington insisted the US had initiated the telephone
conversations of Mr Perry and Mr Christopher with their Russian
counterparts, and Mr Clinton's tense exchange with Mr Yeltsin on Sunday
night.
Shortly before yesterday's air raid the UN reported heavy shelling of the
centre of Gorazde. One shell injured many refugees sheltering in a school.
A UN estimate said 60 people died on Sunday night. Around 100 people had
already died in the two-week offensive.

FT  12 APR 94 / Oil groups to develop big fields in Russian Arctic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and KAREN FOSSLI

   LONDON, OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Four western companies yes-terday announced an ambitious plan to develop oil
reserves in the Russian Arctic which they 'conservatively' estimate at 2bn
barrels. They said the project, one of the largest in Russia, might last for
50 years and cost tens of billions of dollars.
Texaco, Exxon and Amoco of the US and Norway's Norsk Hydro said they planned
to assess and possibly develop as many as 11 proven oilfields in 2,847 sq
miles of the remote Timan Pechora basin, which lies within the Arctic
Circle, 1,100 miles north-east of Moscow.
Unlike many western projects in Russia and other oil regions of the former
Soviet Union, the Timan Pechora plans envisage the construction of a
dedicated export terminal. That would prevent the bottlenecks that have
beset other projects.
Texaco, which has been studying the area since 1990, said its 'conservative'
estimates put recoverable reserves in the area covered by the consortium's
contract at 2bn barrels. Russian estimates place reserves at 5bn barrels,
but much of the area remains unexplored. The top end of the range would mean
that Timan Pechara's reserves exceed the UK's proven oil reserves of 4.1bn
barrels at the end of 1992.
Mr Peter Bijur, Texaco's senior vice-president, said the project was 'one of
the most challenging and attractive hydrocarbon development prospects in the
world today.'
He would not be drawn on the eventual output of the area, but predicted that
initial output of 120,000 barrels a day could be achieved by 2000. That is
equivalent to production of the larger North Sea fields.
Some consultants believe exports from that and a Conoco project being
considered in the Timan Pechora basin could reach 400,000-600,000 b/d in the
first decade of the next century.
The Timan Pechora company, in which Texaco and Exxon each hold 30 per cent
and Amoco and Norsk Hydro 20 per cent each, will spend Dollars 100m on a
three-year assessment phase. Mr Bijur said the consortium's partners were
chosen in part because of their Arctic experience.
The consortium hopes to gain final approval of a production-sharing
agreement from the Russian government by this autumn. Mr Bijur said the
consortium was also seeking the approval of the Russian parliament because
of the political controversy over western oil deals.

FT  12 APR 94 / Row about Tory broadcast damages Major's campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major was embroiled in a damaging row over Conservative election
advertising yesterday, amid signs of continuing unease among backbench MPs
over his leadership and growing electoral nervousness among the party's high
command.
On a visit to Birmingham, the prime minister's attempt to boost the local
Conservative campaign was undermined by criticism of the aggressive tone of
a Tory broadcast attacking the city's Labour council.
In an attempt to limit the electoral damage in Birmingham - the only large
city where the Conservatives have a realistic hope of overturning Labour
control - Mr Major told local voters: 'I am not bashing Brum.'
In an interview with the Birmingham Evening Mail, Mr Major said: 'Our
political view is that (the city) is being short-changed by the
inefficiencies of the present Birmingham council.' The visit was intended to
help the local party win the seven seats needed to take control, but he did
not forecast a Conservative victory in the city.
Meanwhile, party officials were backing away from a weekend admission by Sir
Norman Fowler, party chairman, that the prime minister's future could depend
on the results of the May 5 local elections. Mr Gerry Malone, deputy
chairman, said: 'This is not a referendum on John Major in any possible
sense.'
But Tory MPs returning for the parliamentary session starting today told a
different story. 'There is a lot of unhappiness in the constituencies with
the prime minister's leadership,' a supporter of Mr Major said.
There were also indications that the government may seek to avoid holding
the by-election in the vacant Conservative-held seat of Eastleigh,
Hampshire, before the June 9 elections to the European parliament. Mr Major
and senior cabinet ministers will decide today whether to stick to plans to
hold the by-election on the same day as the local polls.
The Liberal Democrat party, expected to win the seat, said it would move the
writ for the election on Thursday if the government did not do so tomorrow -
the deadline for a May 5 poll. Both main parties fear a Liberal Democrat
victory before June 9 would give the party a strong platform for the
European vote.
A Mori poll of voting intentions in The Times today suggests that, on a
uniform national swing, Labour could win 66 of the 84 European seats in
Great Britain, the Conservatives 15, and Liberal Democrats three.
A regional breakdown suggested the Tories could fall to eight seats from 32.
The Liberal Democrats, who hold no seats, would win 10 and Labour, which
holds 45, would win 66. But Labour played down the poll, saying: 'We do not
think it is possible for us to win 66 Euro-seats.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Egyptian police believe five gunmen firing from a car and a motorcycle
assassinated the country's top anti-terrorist official as he left his home
near the Giza Pyramids, security officials said yesterday, AP reports from
Cairo.
The killing over the weekend was the most daring operation carried out in
Cairo in the two-year campaign by Moslem radicals to overthrow the secular
government and turn Egypt into an Islamic state.
It showed that, despite government claims to have curbed the extremists,
they were able to strike in the capital and kill the official assigned to
destroy them. Maj Gen Raouf Khayrat was deputy chief of state security
intelligence in charge of religious terrorist activities.
In the radicals' stronghold in southern Egypt yesterday, police said
unidentified gunmen killed a policeman in the village of al-Qusiya.
The Islamic fundamentalist extremists regularly kill police in southern
Egypt but the slaying of Gen Khayrat was the first major attack in Cairo
since a homemade bomb was thrown at a tourist bus last December, wounding
eight Austrians and as many Egyptians.
More than 350 people have been killed since the radicals started their
violent campaign in January 1992. Most have been police or radicals killed
in battles, but the extremists also have attacked officials, tourists and
members of the Coptic Christian minority. Four foreign tourists have died.

FT  11 APR 94 / Beijing to freeze vehicle ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China will freeze numbers of vehicle assembly plants until 1996 under a new
automotive policy to be announced soon, the official Business Weekly
reported at the weekend.
The policy, sketchy details of which appeared, lays down local-content rules
and sets out a blueprint for the industry's development beyond the year 2000
and appears to close the door, for now, on foreign makers that do not
already have ventures.
Foreign manufacturers assembling vehicles in China include Volkswagen of
Germany, Citroen and Peugeot of France, Chrysler of the US, and Daihatsu,
Suzuki and Fuji Heavy Industries of Japan.
Conspicuous by their absence are the larger Japanese manufacturers,
including Toyota, Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi. The Japanese were slow to
respond to opportunities in China, preferring to rely on exports.
The moratorium on new plants is aimed at allowing local industry to
consolidate after recent rapid changes, including the entry of foreign
manufacturers.
Local-content rules laid down in the policy call for 40 per cent locally
sourced parts for new ventures, rising to 60 per cent after three years,
according to Business Weekly.
China produced 234,000 cars in 1993 and plans to increase output to 350,000
this year. Imports reached 310,000 units in 1993, but that almost certainly
understates numbers of vehicles entering China by a wide margin, since
smuggling is rife.
At 1 January there were 1.2m passenger cars in China, 70 per cent of which
were imported. China reduced tariffs by 70 per cent from the beginning of
the year to 150 per cent for larger cars and 110 per cent for smaller
models.
Volkswagen is producing 100,000 sedans a year and has increased local
content to 80 per cent. The Germans have plans to introduce new models to
range more widely across the Chinese market.
China is home to about 120 vehicle manufacturers, but many are tiny, turning
out as few as 10 vehicles per week. Such enterprises are struggling to
survive in the new, more competitive era.
Restrictions on numbers of car assembly plants will not apply to components
manufacturers, which are flooding into China in search of opportunities.
Ford and General Motors are establishing components joint ventures in order
to build a platform for entry to the China market once restrictions on new
assembly plants are lifted.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (20): Funds flow into
options - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The huge investment flows into Latin American securities over the past few
years have fuelled rapid growth in the use of derivatives in the region and
beyond.
Bankers who have been involved in the development and marketing of these
structured fixed-income and equity products, mainly in the form of options
and warrants, say their main attraction is that they provide investors with
a highly-leveraged exposure to Latin America at a fraction of the cost of
buying the underlying securities. At the same time, they offer investors a
certain amount of protection against the inherent volatility in these
markets.
'If you want to delve into Latin America with limited risk then options are
the way to do it,' says Mr Louis Hanover, a specialist on emerging market
debt derivatives at Merrill Lynch in New York.
However, others have reservations about the risks associated with
derivatives on such volatile underlying securities. They point to the lack
of a recent price history to allow one to judge volatility of the underlying
security - a critical factor in its pricing. A further concern is the
relatively high chance of liquidity drying up in the event of a price
collapse or the repatriation of international funds which have been invested
in Latin America over the past few years.
Mr William F. Truscott, an equity fund manager at Boston-based fund manager
Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, says of derivatives: 'We haven't made active use
of them. You have to look at them very closely to make sure that you're not
overpaying - particularly if you're buying over-the-counter options.'
Nevertheless, the early success of the industry has drawn attention away
from the risks. Derivatives fans point to the mushrooming trading volumes in
derivatives on Latin American debt following the restructuring of Latin
American sovereign bank debt through the issuance of Brady bonds. Mr Hanover
estimates that around 200m options on notional bonds are now traded on a
daily basis.
Mr Jordi Wiegerinck, head of asset trading at the Dutch bank, ING, in Sao
Paulo, expects the trading volume in derivatives on Brazilian debt alone to
rise threefold this year to Dollars 40bn to Dollars 50bn from Dollars 18bn
last year. 'The liquid underlying market has enabled the derivatives market
to develop,' says Mr Wiegerinck.
He adds that warrants offer best possible leverage to a volatile market.
'You can buy the underlying security and get a yield of 12 to 13 per cent
but you run the risk that the country will not be solvent in two years'
time,' he says.
On the equity side, bankers say that the derivatives business has been given
a significant boost by the wave of privatisation which has swept through the
region since the late 1980s.
Mr Jeremy Campbell-Lamerton, managing director of Inverlat International,
the London-based European operation of Grupo Financiero Inverlat, Mexico's
fourth largest financial institution, says that the progress has been
substantial in three fields.
First, the options exchange in Chicago now has contracts on 10 Latin
American companies, providing international investors with exposure to
companies in Mexico, Brazil, Chile and Argentina. These include Telmex, the
Mexican telephone company; Ica, the Mexican construction company; Panamco, a
US-listed Panamanian company which has Coca-Cola interests in Mexico;
Aracruz, the Brazilian pulp and paper company; CTC, Chile's telephone
company and YPF, the Argentine oil group.
Second, most countries in Latin America now have thriving options exchanges
for local investors. Although the life of the options is short, around 28
days, trading volume in the instruments is significant, particularly in
Argentina and Mexico where the market's capitalisation is estimated at
Dollars 100m.
There have also been issues of domestic over-the-counter (OTC) warrants on
Brazilian and Mexican stocks denominated in local currencies, though
foreigners are less interested in these products, mainly due to the currency
risk.
As a result, there has been a third area of growth in Latin American
derivatives for which international investors have shown a formidable
appetite, namely the dollar-denominated OTC market in so-called 'synthetic'
warrants.
These warrants, which for the most part are exercisable into the American
Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of Latin American companies, are 'synthetic'
since they have not issued by the companies but by banks which have
identified a pool of demand from their clients. The warrants can also be
cash-settled.
Since the warrants are priced in dollars, the holder does not need to worry
about capital controls or currency risk. In addition, trading in many of the
warrants can be settled through Cedel and Euroclear, Europe's two main
clearing houses.
Mr Campbell-Lamerton says that this market has grown rapidly over the past
12 months and estimates that there are now 120 issues compared with fewer
than 10 issues one year ago. Volume is thought to be around Dollars 2bn.
Although the market is at an early stage, its future development will be
limited by the finite pool of ADRs which can be used, Mr Campbell-Lamerton
says.
The warrants are not 'covered', that is the issuing bank will not actually
own the underlying securities. However, the issuing bank will have hedged
itself by taking out a series of options so that if the warrant holders
exercise their rights, the bank can deliver the goods.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (19): Strong nerves called
for - Brady Bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors in Latin American Brady bonds will need strong nerves in the
coming months to cope with market volatility amid continued political and
economic uncertainty.
After last year's stellar performance, the region's markets have been
ravaged in the past two months by the sharp sell-off that has sent bonds
worldwide tumbling.
'Last year we saw the mother of all bull runs - followed by the mother of
all crashes,' says Mr Peter West, economic adviser at West Merchant Bank in
London. 'The sell-off wiped out a substantial proportion of the gains made
last year.'
After posting a record 43.87 per cent return in 1993, Brady bonds in the
year to March 24 fell by 14.48 per cent, Salomon Brothers' Brady Bond Index
shows. The Brady bond market comprises about Dollars 95bn of bonds converted
from loans under commercial bank restructuring agreements in the late 1980s
and early 1990s.
The markets' initial slump was triggered by the US Federal Reserve's
monetary tightening on February 4, but exacerbated by adverse regional
developments, such as the Chiapas uprising in Mexico and the collapse of
Banco Latino, Venezuela's second-largest commercial bank.
The sell-off was further fuelled by heavy selling from highly leveraged
short-term participants - including the much-maligned hedge funds - facing
margin calls after losses in other markets.
'A big part of the rally last year was due to money flows from people who
were not very acquainted with, nor very dedicated to, this market,' says Mr
Marc Wenhammer, head of fixed-income at Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets,
who hold about Dollars 400m in Latin American bonds.
A second wave of selling was prompted by the assassination on March 23 of Mr
Luis Donaldo Colosio, Mexico's leading candidate for the presidential
elections. This put another damper on the Mexican bond market and its
neighbours and seemed to weaken the prospects for the long-awaited upgrading
of Mexico's credit rating. For months, bankers have been hoping that
Mexico's foreign debt rating will be raised to investment grade, from its
present sub-investment level. An upgrade would have significantly widened
the potential investor based for Mexican bonds.
Standard &amp; Poor's recently affirmed its BB+ rating (one notch below
investment grade) and its positive rating outlook, but few expect an
upgrading this year. Moody's Investors Service rates Mexico's long-term
Eurobonds Ba2, two notches below investment grade, and its par and discount
bonds Ba3.
Faced with continued political and economic uncertainty and resulting market
volatility, investors have remained cautious. However, for now, few
observers see the threat of last year's heavy inflows being reversed this
year. 'The flows will tail off, but they will continue at lower rates,'
predicts Mr Paul Luke, senior economist at Morgan Grenfell.
Although some short-term participants and US mutual funds have pulled out,
longer-term investors, including insurance companies and pension funds, have
been reported to be testing the waters. Moreover, there is a feeling that
the next wave of buyers is not looking for a quick killing, but will need to
take a more realistic investment approach.
'The recovery will probably be more gradual, but also more stable,' says Mr
Luis Luis, chief economist for emerging markets at fund managers Scudder,
Stevens Clark in New York, who invest some Dollars 1.5bn in emerging bond
markets.
'I hope we'll get greater selectivity by more discerning investors,' says Mr
Wenhammer.
At present levels, Latin American Brady bonds look cheap. Moreover, the
ferocity of the recent sell-off has created anomalies in certain sectors
which offer 'a good buying opportunity for long-term investors', says Mr
Luis.
Take floating-rate bonds. Since their coupon is pegged to money-market
rates, floaters are usually protected from sharp jumps in long-term yields
and gain value when short-term rates rise. However, during the recent bond
market sell-off, Brady floaters fell sharply, effectively behaving like
long-dated fixed-rate bonds. With no fundamental changes to justify this
move, their slide was largely a function of supply and demand factors -
leveraged participants liquidating their positions. Thus, 'these bonds are
undervalued, and will increase in yield as rates rise', says Scudder's Mr
Luis.
Interestingly, even during the recent heavy sell-off, 'the market maintained
its ability to handle heavy flows', says Mr Joe Boyle, head of emerging
markets trading at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York. Bid-offer spreads did
not widen significantly and there was no lessening in liquidity during the
turmoil. 'This testifies to the depth of the market.'
Still, the Colosio assassination sent shock waves through the markets which
are likely to reverberate in the region for some time. 'It increases the
perception that Mexico still has a long way to go in opening its political
system and dealing with social imbalances,' says Mr West at West Merchant
Bank. 'This may make some investors look at these markets with more caution
than before.'
'Mexico has always been regarded as a benchmark for the region - all the
other markets trade off it,' says another analyst. But while she expects the
neighbouring markets to track Mexican bonds, the increase in the political
risk could cause neighbouring markets' yield spreads over Mexican bonds to
tighten. 'The fundamentals in the other countries are still what they were
before the assassination.'
With sentiment shifting from the rampant optimism of last year to
overwhelming bearishness of late, good news has tended to be ignored, says
Mr West. However, 'once things settle down, people will focus on the
positive news', he predicts. These good tidings will include progress in the
the ongoing debt restructuring by countries converting their former bank
loans into Brady or Brady-style bonds.
Brazil is set to complete its Dollars 52bn debt restructuring by April 15,
making it the last of Latin America's big four debtor countries - the others
being Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina - to complete a Brady-style debt deal.
Brazil's bank creditors recently decided to go ahead with the restructuring
even though Brazil failed to win a standby loan accord from the IMF.
Next in line is Bulgaria, which is expected to exchange its debt by June 30.
Some say the deadline may be extended due to administrative delays, but most
market observers expect the deal to be completed later this year.
Among other ongoing Brady-type negotiations, Ecuador appears to be closest
to an agreement in principle, while Panama and Peru continue talking with
their creditors.

European states, anxious to reform their overburdened state pension schemes,
would do well to take a look at Latin America.
There, governments are beginning to put in place attractive alternatives to
their creaking pay-as-you-go state pension schemes which rely on
contributions from existing workers and their employers to pay benefits to
those already retired. The reforms involve the diversion of employee
contributions to long-term individual savings accounts and away from the
state pension scheme.
In the process of this reform, Chile, the pioneer in Latin America, has
built up a domestic capital market valued at over Dollars 15bn. These
newly-created Chilean pension schemes, begun in 1981, provided 72 per cent
of all domestic investment by the end of 1991. And, unlike the recent surge
of foreign investment into Latin America, which can flow out as easily as it
flowed in, domestic pension funds provide capital which is here to stay.
'When private pension schemes first started in Chile, there really wasn't a
domestic capital market,' said Mr Tim Sharples, a director at Callund and
Co, an actuarial consulting firm specialising in Latin America.
The growth of assets under management has been so swift that Chilean
regulators have had to gradually relax the investment restrictions placed on
the private pension schemes. According to data from Chile's Superintendent
of Retirement Fund Administration Companies (AFJP), the average pension
fund's investment in equities has risen from nil in 1981 to about 10 per
cent in 1986 to roughly 40 per cent by the end of 1991.
Moreover, currency-matching requirements have been relaxed, allowing for
some investment abroad.
Chile's neighbours have watched its emerging pension fund business with
growing interest. Last May, Peru put in place its own version of Chile's
dramatic reform of its state pension system, while Argentina will launch its
pension reforms on June 1 this year. Colombia has recently passed
legislation allowing for similar reforms while Bolivia is also examining the
same structure.
Pension reform in Latin America is proving attractive especially to US-based
insurance companies and fund managers. American International Group (AIG)
has a significant presence in the pension fund management business there,
and UK-based fund management companies are anxious to export their
expertise. For instance, Mr Win Bischoff, chief executive of UK merchant
bank Schroders, recently pinpointed Argentina as a potential growth region
for the group's investment management business.
But aside from the potential that pension reform offers service providers,
Chile's shift to a funded pension system is being closely watched,
particularly by European governments anxious to do the same.
For most countries, making the shift is complicated by the fact that the
bill for those already receiving state pensions, is paid by current workers.
If the contributions of those workers were to be diverted to long-term
savings accounts, governments would have to meet the pensions bill out of
tax receipts - something most governments are unable to even contemplate.
Mr Sharples notes that Chile was to some extent bailed out by its
demographics; it has far fewer pensioners per worker than most European
states. Moreover, it guessed - correctly - that the 1980s would be a decade
of strong economic growth which would enhance its tax receipts.
To finance its existing pension obligations, Chile issued long-term bonds
and set investment rules requiring AFJPs, the managers of the funded pension
schemes, to buy them. Thus, Chile was able to recycle much of the individual
savings in a way which allowed it to meet its own pensions bill.
Moreover, it changed the way national insurance contributions were treated.
Instead of the previous system which made NI contributions a liability of
the employer, they became a liability of the employee. 'Tax avoidance
decreased because people could see a reason to declare their earnings and
make a payment,' Mr Sharples said.
Meanwhile, western governments may find other lessons to be learned from the
Latin American pensions experiment. For instance, both the Chilean and
Argentine systems are compulsory for younger workers, with older workers
having the option of either remaining in the state scheme or choosing a
private pension.
Also, both countries have chosen to cap costs. In Chile, three percentage
points of the 13 per cent of each workers' pay which goes in contributions
is set aside to cover life insurance and disability insurance premiums and
costs.
Overall, the Latin American experiment with pension reform offers a few
crucial lessons for other western governments grappling with a state
pensions bill threatening to run out of control. However, the peculiar
demographic and economic conditions at work there may make it a much more
hospitable laboratory for such experiments than other more industrialised
nations.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (18): Mood turns distinctly
sour - Eurobonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin American borrowers have seen the mood in the international bond market
turn distinctly sour in recent weeks as the combination of higher US
interest rates and a host of quite unexpected domestic factors have
unsettled investors.
Given the volatile conditions in the world bond markets, Latin American
names may well find that they have to accept less favourable borrowing terms
on their bond issues for the foreseeable future, offering investors more
generous yields to entice them back into the market.
And following the collapse of Banco Latino, Venezuela's second largest bank,
in January and the subsequent crisis in the Venezuelan financial system,
many investors would be wise to pay closer attention to the creditworthiness
of individual Latin American borrowers, especially if some of the less
familiar names make an appearance once market conditions calm down.
Latin American borrowers, sovereign and corporate alike, had a field day in
the international bond market in 1992 and 1993. While Latin American names
raised a total of Dollars 9.64bn with 112 separate issues in 1992, the
amount raised soared to Dollars 22.58bn (218 new issues) in 1993, according
to figures compiled by Euromoney.
As interest rates in the US gradually declined during the 1990s, and yields
on US Treasury bonds fell to their lowest level in nearly 20 years, US
investors searched further afield for high-yielding bonds with enhanced
returns.
A wall of money washed across the globe as investors hunted for yield and
turned to the emerging markets. Latin American Eurobonds proved attractive
investments: they are mainly denominated in US dollars and offer investors a
high yield pick-up - known as the yield spread - over US Treasury bonds,
ranging up to about 550 basis points over Treasuries for some of the poorer
credits.
Investors were keen to lock into a high yield and make capital gains as bond
markets rallied and as yield spreads over Treasuries narrowed, helped by
expectations that certain Latin American borrowers such as Mexico would see
an upwards revision in their credit rating.
Borrowers were able to raise cheaper funding abroad in the international
bond markets than back home in their own domestic financial markets. They
raised fixed rate funding in US dollars and used it partly to pay down the
more expensive domestic debt and partly to fund expansion.
Several important trends have taken place since the emergence of Brady plans
enabled the rehabilitation of Latin American borrowers in the international
capital markets. The range of borrowers has widened to include private
sector corporate names as well as sovereign borrowers and public sector
companies. A handful of Latin American borrowers - such as Cemex of Mexico
and the Republic of Argentina - have launched large global bond issues,
providing investors with more liquid paper. Borrowers have succeeded in
launching longer-dated paper, and have broadened the range of currencies in
which their bonds are denominated to appeal to a wider investor base.
'This is a relatively new market, born out of the Brady plans in 1991-92,
and it will go through various ups and downs, but it will continue to grow
and attract interest,' says Mr Jerry Brown, manager of emerging market
Eurobond trading at Salomon Brothers in New York.
This gradual evolutionary process has been disturbed by the recent severe
shake-up in the world's bond markets.
The decision by the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by a quarter
point on February 4 upset the world financial markets and left borrowers
uncertain about the direction of US interest rates. Until the markets become
more settled, it seems unlikely that borrowers of any description will hurry
to issue fixed rate bonds.
However, some Latin American names - including Pemex and Banamex - have
launched floating rate notes (FRN), hoping to take advantage of investor
uncertainty. Mr Paul Luke, Head of Emerging Markets Research at Morgan
Grenfell, warns borrowers will have to concentrate on the FRN sector in
future, and must accept higher yield spreads on their fixed rate issues.
However, countenancing higher spreads in the secondary market and on new
issues is not necessarily going to make life easier, some experts warn.
'Borrowers face a very difficult problem, because even if they want to come
at slightly higher yield spreads, lead managers (on the bond issues) will
find it difficult to place the paper (with investors),' says Mr Pepe de
Aguinaga, head of bonds at LatInvest Securities.
He warns that if borrowers are forced to borrow in their domestic markets,
they could face higher borrowing costs and this could eat into corporate
profits. Mr Luke says the main losers 'would include the Brazilian
institutions, given that real domestic interest rates are so high'.
On the domestic front, Mexico's various political problems and Venezuela's
banking scandal have probably had the most impact on bond issues with some
psychological spillover into neighbouring markets.
Mr Brown of Salomon Brothers says that since mid-January, the Mexican market
has been extremely volatile due to the peasant uprising in the southern
state of Chiapas, the kidnapping of a senior banker in March, and the
assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate of the
governing party.
'We need to see the following happen now - a new presidential candidate, a
resolution of the Chiapas situation, and a sorting out of the
democratisation process. Until this happens (Latin American) Eurobonds will
continue to be volatile,' says Mr Brown.
Even so, many Latin American experts are optimistic about the longer-term
prospects for Mexico, which is widely expected to have its credit rating
raised from sub-investment (or 'junk') to investment grade, probably by the
end of this year.
Mr Luke points out that there is a silver lining to the otherwise difficult
international background. 'Higher US rates do not matter as much as many
observers think because 60-70 per cent of Latin American debt is fixed.
Moreover, commodity prices have risen by eight times as much as nominal
rates in the last six months, so LDCs (less developed countries) face
negative real interest rates. Faster US growth is also excellent news for
the Latins' says Mr Luke.
Ms Leena El-Ali, fixed income manager at Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging
Markets, points out that 'countries like Mexico and Argentina have a good
domestic story', adding that in Mexico's case, it will benefit from factors
such as Nafta and membership of the OECD. 'At the moment, people are
concentrating on the international aspects. As this situation is resolved,
the local stories will become more important,' predicts Ms El-Ali.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (17): Investors are likely
to focus on quality - International Equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin American companies have attracted substantial sums of money from
specialist emerging market investors during the 1990s, through an assortment
of government privatisations, initial public offerings (IPOs) and secondary
share sales.
Latin American demand for money - raised through such international equity
offerings - is expected to remain strong, but market analysts point to two
likely trends this year.
For a start, international investors may find that the relatively difficult
market conditions experienced in February and March continue, calling a
temporary halt to the stream of new issues as companies await more
favourable conditions. And second, as the various Latin American markets
continue to grow and develop, investors will have to be more discerning
about the quality of companies in which they invest.
The volume of new international equity issues rose sharply last year,
jumping to a total of Dollars 6.05bn in 1993 from Dollars 3.96bn the
previous year, according to figures compiled by Euromoney.
Last year's total figures were boosted by the launch of a very large share
offering from YPF, the Argentine oil and gas company, which provided the
highlight of the Latin American calendar.
The Argentine government sold a 45 per cent stake in YPF in June 1993,
raising a total of Dollars 3bn which included an international tranche of
some Dollars 2.3bn. The deal was heavily subscribed by foreign investors and
helped to lift the total amount raised from Argentine companies via
international share offerings to Dollars 2.72 bn. Mexican companies
completed a total of 25 issues raising Dollars 2.87 bn last year.
This year has started off reasonably strongly with international equity
offerings from Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Chile raising a total of
Dollars 1.23bn. But analysts point out that market conditions have been
extremely choppy. The US Federal Reserve's decision to raise US short-term
interest rates - by 25 basis points on February 4 and by a further quarter
point on March 22 - sparked heavy selling in many of the world financial
markets and left international investors nervous about future trends in the
US, Europe and the various emerging markets.
'Markets are nervous, and the emerging markets will probably feel the global
underwriting pinch even more (than the developed markets),' says Mr Dan
Smaller, emerging market product manager at Lehman Brothers in London. He
believes that as a result, the pace of new issuance from Latin America is
likely to slow down in the near term.
Added to this, the political situation in Mexico has not helped sentiment
either: in the space of the past three months, Mexico has suffered from a
peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, the kidnapping of a
senior banker and the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential
candidate of the governing party.
International investors tended to regard Mexico as the bastion of stability
in Latin America, so these recent developments have come as a severe shock.
Yet analysts still expect to see the country credit rating lifted later this
year from sub-investment to investment grade by the key rating agencies and
are optimistic that economic growth will pick up again in the second half of
the year.
'We still think the markets are fundamentally attractive,' says Mr Richard
Lamb, director of Morgan Grenfell Asset Management which manages pension and
insurance fund money.
There are still plenty of interesting deals waiting on the sidelines for a
suitable moment. Market specialists point out that investors can expect to
see further privatisations of utilities in Argentina, Brazil, Peru and
Venezuela, which are expected to provide 'decent-sized' international
offerings. On the corporate side, there may be more IPOs and secondary
placements, although these may be somewhat smaller in size, according to
Lehman Brother's Mr Smaller.
Mrs Ondine de Villalobos, Latin American equities analyst at Paribas Capital
Markets, expects to see a lot of paper coming out of Argentina. 'By the end
of 1992 - excluding YPF - the government had more or less completed its
privatisation programme. Now, it is expected to sell its remaining minority
stakes - of around 30 per cent - in companies in the gas transportation, gas
distribution and electricity distribution sectors.'
Mexican companies are also expected to pursue more international equity
offerings, either as new companies seek listings or as existing listed
companies return to tap the market again for more money.
The other main development that market specialists expect to see is a 'focus
on quality'. There are plenty of Latin American specialists who claim that
international investors fail to apply the same discerning principles of
investment to the emerging markets that they use for other more developed
markets such as the US or UK.
The more cautious among them stick to the blue chips - such as Telmex, the
Mexican telecom company - because these stocks are very liquid. Others tend
to 'buy a particular market' without really discriminating much between the
individual companies, claims one Latin American specialist.
'This is the year of fundamental valuations and analysis, and investors will
have to be much more selective,' says Mr Smaller.
Part of the problem is the standard of information available. Some investors
complain about the quality of information they receive. Those companies
which have New York Stock Exchange listings must comply with the SEC
regulations in providing financial information. 'The only companies which
give a lot of information are those with ADRs which means that they are
required to (provide the information),' says Mrs de Villalobos.
These tend to be the big blue chips, but on the whole, 'companies need to
give out a lot more information, as this information is not readily
available in annual reports,' says one analyst.
Investors point out that there is plenty of scope for an improvement in the
independent research provided by banks and brokers.
'Banks should provide good research on the company as well as taking a
sectoral approach in Latin America and globally,' says one Latin American
specialist. 'The quality of third party research is generally pretty low,'
says Mr Lamb, but he points out that the US firms are generally taking steps
to beef up their Latin American research departments by hiring staff 'so an
improvement is under way'.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (15): Question mark over
debt remains - Does the region have a current account problem? Stephen
Fidler discusses the issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fall, when it came, was quick. The rapid plunge in the price of
sovereign debt and Brady bonds in February and March has raised questions in
the minds of some economists about the sustainability of the region's
current account deficits. Put another away, the question posed was whether
Latin America had truly escaped its debt problem.
'If the present disruption in the market results in more than a temporary
slowdown in capital flows to Latin America, concerns could re-emerge about
the sustainability of the region's current account imbalance,' said Mr Peter
West, economic adviser to the London-based West Merchant Bank last month.
Those most vulnerable to such worries would be Argentina and Mexico, given
the size of their current account deficits, he said.
The sharp drop in secondary market prices implied a sharp rise in the cost
of finance for Latin American borrowers. Although the price collapse was
less devastating in the Eurobond market where new finance is raised, that
market appeared likely to remain all but closed for some time to new Latin
borrowers.
Yet, some economists say the market uncertainty - at least until the
assassination of the Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio on
March 23 - had more to do with the heavy inventories being carried by
sovereign debt dealers ahead of the rise in US interest rates in February
than with worries about rising US interest rates.
Mr Paul Luke, research head at Morgan Grenfell's debt trading arm, said the
rise in US interest rates should not be a source of concern. Inasmuch as it
reflected the strength of the US economy, Latin America would benefit. And
if it reflected the US Federal Reserve's concern about the strength in
commodity prices - up 8 per cent since October - the region would also be a
prime beneficiary.
Moreover, much of government debt is at fixed rates, particularly in those
countries that have secured Brady restructurings. In addition, equity
inflows of portfolio and foreign direct investment have been more important
than in the 1970s and early 1980s.
Most countries also have a significant cushion in foreign exchange reserves.
'I don't think there is any particular concern about funding the current
account deficits,' said Mr Lawrence Brainard of Bankers Trust. 'Foreign
direct investment is increasing in Mexico, for example, where if anything
they have too many inflows. It's why the exchange rate is so volatile - but
reserves went past Dollars 30bn towards the end of February.'
In Argentina, too, reserves rose from Dollars 10bn at the year end to around
Dollars 13.6bn - it appears that funds have returned to the country to take
advantage of the interest rate premium of Argentine pesos over dollars.
Meanwhile, Brazil's reserves have risen to Dollars 35bn, and it should soon
be able to reduce its debt service bill through a Brady bank debt
restructuring.
Ms Marilyn Skiles, economist at JP Morgan, argued in a February research
report that other factors had significantly lessened the vulnerability of
the region to debt problems. The investor base was more diversified than in
the early 1980s and may not move in unison as banks did then.
Unlike in the earlier period, private sector entities rather than the public
sector have been the main borrowers, reflecting the improved fiscal
discipline in some countries.
However, this fiscal discipline is not universal. In Venezuela, there are
worries about the government's budget deficit - reflected in the price of
that country's Brady bonds, yielding at the time of writing more than 19 per
cent. Brazil may make significant strides with its current economic plan
towards fiscal balance - but that has not been achieved yet. Furthermore,
other public entities - such as the states in Brazil - are making demands on
the capital markets.
But the main fear is the sustainability of the current account deficits,
given there is little evidence so far that capital inflows have expanded the
export base of Latin countries. Ultimately, only through increased exports
will increased debt be serviced.
Ms Skiles pointed out that most Latin countries' capacity to pay their debts
had improved by some measures - such as the ratios of debt to GDP and
interest payments to exports. But one important measure - debt to exports -
had not improved except in Chile and to a lesser extent Mexico. 'The limited
improvements in Latin America's debt-to-export ratios are due in large part
to the relatively poor performance of exports from the region, particularly
in the past few years,' she said. 'While current account deficits are
readily financed, because of the availability of external capital, the
deterioration in their external balances suggest some Latin American
countries may find themselves unable to generate sufficient foreign exchange
earnings at some point in future.'
Mr John Clark, an economist at the New York Federal Reserve Bank, argued in
the bank's latest quarterly review that results of the Brady debt
restructurings had been impressive, largely because it established a more
stable long-run financial framework than did the previous approach.
But he also concluded that the Brady approach 'did not achieve significantly
more near-term cash flow relief for debtors than the previous approach' and
that 'debt service obligations remain heavy for the Brady countries'.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (16): Cross-border ventures
expanding - The embrace of free trade has forced the continent's companies
to think regionally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Latin America's rehabilitation in the international capital markets has been
accompanied by a growing interest in the region by companies from the
industrialised world. Faced with mature markets at home and the potential
for fast growth in the developing world, they are looking overseas.
The trend has been reflected in gradually rising flows of foreign direct
investment into the region. It has also been accompanied by a less-noticed
but growing tendency of companies from within the region to seek investments
in countries elsewhere in Latin America.
It is Latin America's embrace of free trade that has forced the continent's
companies to think regionally. A decade ago they rarely considered investing
outside their own borders. Generally less productive than their
international competitors, and with a captive and profitable market at home,
there was never any need.
Now, they have to compete against the world's most efficient producers to
survive. For many, this has meant forming joint ventures with international
rivals, or expanding into nearby regional markets by buying up competitors.
Access to cheaper financing has given regional companies the possibility of
launching bids and buying stakes that would have been impossible a few years
ago. Government regulations that prohibited inward and outward foreign
investment have been scrapped, opening new opportunities to Latin and other
foreign investors.
Companies from Mexico and Chile, the countries that began the continent's
pro-market economic reforms a decade ago, have led the way. Many Chilean
companies reckon they are too small to survive in the global market place
and have thus expanded into Peru and Argentina.
Mexican businesses have the financial muscle to grow and find new markets,
and believe that by so doing they will benefit from economies of scale.
The trend was started by Vitro, Mexico's dominant glass company. Back in
1989 it spent some Dollars 900m (including debt) on acquiring Anchor Glass,
a US rival.
The acquisition turned Vitro into one of the world's largest glass
companies, better able, in the opinion of its managers, to fend off
competitors in the domestic market.
Since then scores of other Mexican companies have followed Vitro's lead.
Synkro, a Mexican textile company, last December paid Dollars 233m for
Kayser-Roth, a US textile producer; Dina, a bus and truck assembler, earlier
this year paid in equity more than Dollars 336m for the US Motor Coach
Industries International, making it the largest bus producer in the
Americas; Mr Bernardo Dominguez, the head of DSC, a privately owned tourism
to construction outfit, paid with partners Dollars 708m for Westin hotels in
February.
Cementos Mexicanos, the cement giant, and Televisa, the media giant, have
targeted both North and Latin America as growth areas for the company. Cemex
has taken the decision as part of its strategy of becoming a global cement
company, and Televisa largely because of synergies it sees between different
Spanish-speaking markets.
In positioning itself as the Spanish language's dominant media company,
Televisa has taken significant stakes in Univision, the US Spanish-language
network, TGV, a Chilean network, Compania Peruana de Radio Difusion, a
Peruvian television network, and has a joint venture in Argentina.
Televisa reckons such stakes will enable it to make higher profits from
broadcasting its highly successful television programmes, that have long
dominated Spanish-speaking Latin America. Televisa is now expanding cable
television in the region, suggesting it has further to go.
Apart from an important acquisition in Spain, Cemex several years ago bought
cement companies in the south of the US, and recently purchased cement
companies in Jamaica and the Bahamas. It also has a joint venture with the
Cuban state producer. Last March it paid an estimated Dollars 300m for a
controlling stake in Venezuela's largest cement producer.
Cemex believes that Latin America is the natural area of expansion for the
company, given the similarities in culture and language with Mexico, and
prospects for high economic growth.
It is now being followed by Mexico's largest construction companies, Tribasa
and ICA, which believe they can bring to other Latin American countries the
skills that enabled them to build Mexico's toll roads, and other high
profile infrastructure projects.
Aeromexico, one of Mexico's two main airlines, believes, like Cemex, that in
the long run it can only survive if it expands internationally, and that the
natural competitive advantage it enjoys is in Latin America. Thus February
last year it bought with Peruvian partners a controlling stake in Aeroperu,
and is using the Peruvian carrier's routes in the continent to expand in the
region.
The growing expansion of Mexican companies is being aided by the government,
which has been pushing for free trade agreements between Mexico and other
Latin American countries, such as those signed with Chile and Costa Rica.
These agreements are expected to expand bilateral investment, and make
businessmen more aware of complementary circumstances between their markets.
Chile's most adventurous cross-border investors have so far been energy
companies. The trend began in earnest in 1992, when Chilectra, Chile's
biggest electricity distributor, paid Dollars 102m as leader of a consortium
that bought 51 per cent of formerly state-run Edesur, a Buenos Aires
electric utility.
That year saw two other energy groups lured by Argentine privatisations.
Endesa, Chile's biggest utility, spent Dollars 90m on a Buenos Aires power
generator while a rival consortium, led by electricity generator Chilgener,
paid Dollars 92m for a majority stake in Central Puerto, also in the
Argentine capital.
Last year, Chilgener was flexing its transAndean muscles again, investing
Dollars 90m in a three-way consortium that bought 59 per cent of
hydro-electric plant Piedra del Aguila in central Argentina.
Energy companies have not been alone in finding Chile's market of 13m people
too small. Santa Carolina, the supermarket group, last April took over a
Peruvian chain, while Chilean pension funds (AFPs) - including Santa Maria,
Habitat and Provida - have participated in the establishment of a Peruvian
private pension fund system to the tune of some Dollars 30m.
In 1992, Dos en Uno, the sweet maker, built a plant in Argentina for Dollars
12m and conglomerate CMPC chose the same location for its Dollars 14m nappy
factory. Lord Cochrane, Chile's biggest printer, has set up a printing press
in Buenos Aires in association with Argentina's Atlantida, and one in Brazil
with Sao Paulo publisher O'Globo.
Chile's more ambitious companies, long used to competing in the deregulated
domestic market, are proving themselves ever more willing to apply those
skills in new, potentially highly profitable, Latin American turf. Central
Bank figures for approved foreign investments - which underestimate real
outward capital flows - have leapt from only Dollars 10m in 1988 to more
than Dollars 400m last year.
Argentina, with an economy more than three times the size of Chile's, has
been by far the biggest attraction, accounting for an estimated 65-70 per
cent of investments. Peru, which has one of the most ambitious privatisation
programmes in Latin America, comes in second, with other investments in
Bolivia, Columbia, Mexico and Panama. The shoemaker Dolphin has even
invested Dollars 2.3m to begin production in Cuba.
Chilean companies have proved themselves adept at raising finance abroad for
foreign ventures. Masisa last year mustered Dollars 58m in the US by placing
American Depositary Receipts in New York. Much of that was injected into a
Dollars 100m fibre-board plant in Argentina.
Chilean pension funds, now marshalling funds of Dollars 16bn, are also about
to become more involved in Latin American businesses. Recent capital markets
reform allows them gradually to expand investments abroad to 12 per cent of
their assets.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (14): Possibly far more
talk than action - Can Latin America finance its privatised infrastructure?
Stephen Fidler discusses the problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most dramatic signs of the shift towards market-orientated
economic policies in Latin America has been privatisation programmes on an
unprecedented scale.
Yet the shifting of government assets and responsibilities to the private
sector has raised a number of important questions. One of the most pressing
is how infrastructure development can be financed. This is more than a
financial question: the debt crisis of the 1980s and the consequent
budgetary stringency resulted in a deterioration of infrastructure which in
many countries represents a real obstacle to growth.
Many of those involved in project finance believe that pure
privately-financed infrastructure projects will be few and far between. Mr
John Flora, transport specialist at the World Bank, told a Canning House
conference in London last month: 'We are not going to see many pure private
sector financings. It's going to take a partnership of government, the
private sector and third party intermediaries.'
While the governments of Latin countries have in many cases moved rapidly to
privatise assets - with the backing of the World Bank and other development
institutions - these institutions have themselves moved slowly to
accommodate the changes.
The World Bank is forbidden by its statutes from lending without government
guarantee, and until now, convention has dictated that the InterAmerican
Development Bank lends only to governments.
The World Bank has a private sector arm - the International Finance
Corporation - but it is too small to handle the demand for infrastructure
finance from the region, let alone that coming from rapidly-growing
economies in Asia.
Before he stepped down last year as head of the IFC, Sir William Ryrie,
argued in a speech in London that 'in the World Bank group, the balance
between state-funding and private-sector-supporting activities needs to be
reconsidered'. Some ideas had been put forward for a transfer of resources
from the World Bank to the IFC and these needed careful thought, he said.
The subject of providing finance for infrastructure has been preoccupying
senior bankers and finance officials, but the results of their deliberations
have not yet emerged. Export credit agencies have been talking under the
auspices of the Berne Union over how project finance can be provided, and
Britain's Export Credit Guarantees Department has issued preliminary
proposals for more flexibility.
The Institute of International Finance - the Washington-based think tank
owned by international banks - has been holding talks with the World Bank,
the IADB and the US Treasury, among others, to find ways to bring banks into
project financings.
Mr Anthony Bottrill, deputy-managing director of the Institute of
International Finance, said: 'Private borrowers are going to become
increasingly important and it's important that the multilateral development
banks adapt accordingly. What we'd like to see is each creditor and investor
group playing a role that reflects its comparative advantage.
'Private lenders should be looking at commercial risk, but they are not as
well placed to go with political risk and transfer risks. The official
lenders should use their guarantee authority to guarantee against political
risk.'
This would involve the official lenders using much more fully than in the
past guarantee powers that shareholder governments have been unwilling to
see used.
Mr Bottrill said much of what the banks are seeking are contained within the
existing Expanded Cofinancing Operations programme of the World Bank. 'The
ECO programme contains within it most of the features but it hasn't been
used actively enough.' The reason for this in part has been the reluctance
of government shareholders to push the institutions into private sector
lending, in part because of concern about the effect this would have on
their credit rating.
These worries have been reflected in discussions about increasing the
capital of the IADB. The IADB will in coming years be the only official net
provider of finance to the region as, barring a new financial crisis, Latin
American countries will be repaying the World Bank in net terms.
However, European shareholders, in particular, have been anxious to keep
down the level of funding for private sector infrastructure development.
Discussions continue but, while the bar to private sector finance will be
lifted, loans to the private sector may well be limited to 5 per cent of
overall new lending, some Dollars 400m-Dollars 500m a year. Those countries
that have privatised most will receive a disproportionate amount, but even
supposing this lending will act as a catalyst for private sector financing,
the amounts will still be small compared to infrastructure demands.
Mr Alberto Paz, chief of the InterAmerican Development Bank's transportation
and communication division, said some projects have been delayed while the
discussion continues. 'We have a lot of projects that have been delayed in
the expectation that this facility will be available.'
But slow movement by official lenders is not the only reason why, in the
words of Mr David Suratgar, deputy-chairman of Morgan Grenfell
International, 'there is possibly far more talk than action'.
Banks remain inhibited from lending for a variety of reasons. Many still
harbour memories of the 1980s debt crisis and are worried by the country
risk.
Many banks no longer have a presence in Latin America to monitor their
lending. Furthermore, said one British banker, 'project finance is very
time-consuming and a lot of banks are concentrating on the Far East - that
is where the deals get done.'
The growing importance of the securities markets and institutional investors
may to some extent offset the reticence of the banks. Last year, for
example, a group of energy companies launched a fund - along with the IFC -
aimed at investment in private power generating capacity in Latin America.
The targeted size of the Scudder Latin America Trust for Independent Power
was Dollars 500m.
Mr John Richardson, associate director at Nomura International in London,
said: 'A great deal of emphasis will be placed on securitisation as a means
of financing. Demand far exceeds the available supply and we are going to
see a wider range of instruments.'
However, banks will still have an important and unavoidable role in the
financings: 'During the construction phase of the project, you are not going
to be able to use bond finance; construction finance is the realm of banks.
But once the construction is complete and it starts generating revenues,
then securitisation comes into its own. The banks will be phased out and
their balance sheets freed again.'

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (13): Agreements may hinder
growth - A look at trade accords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those arguing that Latin America is set for substantial growth into the 21st
century often cite the rapid move of the region towards free trade in
support of their case.
There is little doubt that trade within the western hemisphere is growing
rapidly, if from a low base that has characterised the region's trade
relations in the past. The proportion of the region's exports accounted for
by other Latin American countries jumped to 16.7 per cent in 1992, up from
10.8 per cent in 1990. US exports to Latin America have doubled in seven
years, rising to more than Dollars 80bn in 1993.
Yet this growth stems largely from the unilateral reduction of trade
barriers in nearly every Latin country rather than the complicated patchwork
of trade agreements which has grown up in the region in recent years.
Furthermore, some proponents of free trade are beginning to worry that this
proliferation of agreements may hinder further trade growth and provide
obstacles to the development of a free trade zone in the whole western
hemisphere.
Far from being the building blocks of hemispheric economic integration,
sub-regional free trade agreements 'are more likely to be stumbling blocks,'
argues Mr Moises Nam, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment in
Washington and a former Venezuelan minister.
One concern is that so many of these agreements lack common external
tariffs, requiring in their place complicated agreements on rules of origin.
The aim of rules of origin is to prevent the country with the lowest tariff
acting as the conduit for all exports from outside the free trade area.
They have a potential, however, for developing into a bureaucratic nightmare
and being used as a proxy for protectionism. In this way, these agreements
could water down the benefits of generalised lower tariffs, and herald a
return to the inefficient and usually corrupt customs operations from which
the region moved in the late 1980s.
Where trade agreements do carry provisions for common external tariffs,
there have usually been difficulties. Mercosur, which brings together
Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, was forced to agree a list of
important exceptions to the common tariff. The Andean group of Venezuela,
Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru, meanwhile, has to cope with the
supposedly temporary withdrawal of Peru, lower tariffs negotiated for
Bolivia and the new Venezuelan government's suspicion of neighbouring
Colombia and its general distrust of free trade.
The Caribbean Community's attempts to lower its common external tariff have
been beset by compliance problems, while the common external tariff proposed
in 1997 for the Central American Common Market is likely to be selective.
But these are not the only concerns. A proliferation of trade accords could
marginalise some states by encouraging investment to concentrate on a few
'hub' countries and by developing trade links between the most dynamic
economies, leaving others by the wayside.
Even the prospect of free trade with the US does not necessarily offer the
benefits to Latin American economies that are commonly supposed.
A 1992 analysis by two World Bank economists, Refik Erzan and Alexander
Yeats, argued that the trade benefits for most Latin counties - apart from
Brazil and Mexico - of free trade with the US will anyway be small. This is
because most Latin American products - predominantly raw materials - enter
the US with low tariffs already.
The analysis ignored the dynamic trade effects - the possibility that an
open US market might encourage Latin economies to move 'downstream' over
time, exporting less in raw materials and more value-added products.
Neither could it examine the other benefits - the insurance effect of being
allied to the US if the trading system degenerated into blocs and the
increased investment flows that would possibly emerge from the longer-term
stability in economic policy that would be inferred.
However, free trade agreements with the US or accession to the North
American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada are unlikely
to be easy to achieve.
While US officials have privately raised the question of whether Mexico will
be willing to let other Latin countries into its exclusive Nafta club, the
US will in fact dominate decision-making.
In July, Washington will name those countries eligible to negotiate free
trade agreements with the US. The nomination does not commit the US to
negotiations and is silent on whether accession to Nafta or a bilateral
trade accord with the US is the right way forward. The list will be next
reviewed in 1997.
Trade will also be on the agenda for the Summit of the Americas meeting
planned for Miami in December, and the Clinton administration has repeatedly
indicated its willingness to talk next with Chile about free trade
agreements.
But it is far from certain that the administration, which expended much
political capital in pushing Nafta through, will want to spend more on a
relatively minor policy priority. Further, apart from Chile, it is not clear
that other countries meet the conditions the US now apparently believes
necessary to join the Nafta club - in particular labour and environmental
requirements.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (10): Rich in natural
resources - Bolivia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WINSTON MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bolivia stands at the heart of South America and is a country rich in
natural resources, yet little is known save for a mistaken image abroad that
it continues to languish amid high inflation and political problems.
Nothing could be further from the truth. Bolivia implemented a landmark
structural adjustment plan in 1985 which reduced 20,000 per cent inflation
to single figures in under a year.
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the planning minister who masterminded Bolivia's
anti-inflation programme, returned to public office last August as president
with a bold programme to capitalise six of Bolivia's leading state
enterprises. This will involve handing over the administration of the state
companies - in the areas of telecommunications, oil and gas, rail and air
transport, smelting and electricity - to foreign investors as well as the
free distribution of 50 per cent of public sector company shares among
voting age Bolivians. The government reckons the scheme will attract
USDollars 8bn in foreign investment over the next four years and result in a
7-8 per cent rate of GDP growth by 1997.
One project that has caught the eye of foreign investors is the construction
of a gas pipeline from Bolivia across the Matto Grosso to the industrial
city of Sao Paulo in Brazil. The Brazilian government's decision to end the
monopoly of Petrobras in Brazil - a condition set by the World Bank - paves
the way for the signing of this gas contract with Bolivia. The deal will
ensure Sao Paolo receives 8m cu m of Bolivian natural gas a day to power six
hydroelectric turbines which will meet 30 per cent of the city's energy
needs.
Bolivia's state oil and gas producer YPFB hopes to complete the USDollars
2bn funding for the pipeline by August, when the project will be put up for
international tender. Besides selling gas to Argentina and Brazil, Bolivia
is looking to sell 14.5m cu ft of gas a day to Paraguay for industrial and
domestic use.
Carlos Miranda, Bolivia secretary for hydrocarbons, says the value of YPFB,
which is one of the state monopolies up for capitalisation, ranges from
USDollars 1.5bn to USDollars 2bn, but this figure could rise once the
project to export gas to Brazil gets closer to coming on stream in 1997.
YPFB currently accounts for half of the Bolivian state revenues. Several
foreign companies involved in the gas industry including BHP, Tenneco,
British Gas, Enron and Total have expressed interest in the project.
Mining sector investment in 1994 will be between USDollars 40m and USDollars
50 according to Jaime Villalobos, the national secretary of mining.
Investment in the sector virtually ground to a halt until the Inti Raymi
gold mining corporation ploughed USDollars 150m into its operations in 1992.
Mining sector investments totalled USDollars 45.8m in 1993. Investor
interest declined due to depressed world market prices and a failed contract
involving FMC Lithium Division.
Mr Villalobos has now devised a medium-term plan to invest USDollars 350M in
Comibol's mines through a series of 'joint ventures'. Comibol will move out
of production to oversee the administration of joint ventures contracts.
These contracts will serve to attract investment, technology, create new
jobs, and raise tax revenues.
In a country still sensitive about privatisation, Mr Villalobos defined
'joint venture' as 'the participation of the private sector in an area of
production from which the state is pulling out'. Comibol is seeking foreign
and domestic companies to exploit rich untapped reserves at Huanuni, using
open cast mining methods.
Until these projects bear fruit, Comibol will continue to operate and
produce at its only profitable mines: Colquiri, Huanuni and Caracoles.
Mining exports have throughout Bolivian history set the pattern of the
country's external trade, first with silver, then tin and more recently with
a range of mining products. Non traditional exports appeared from nowhere in
the 1980s and their rise to the top of the list of exports will herald a new
phase in foreign trade.
Non-traditional exports totalled USDollars 270m in 1993 - but unofficial
figures say the figure could be as high as USDollars 300m. Bolivia exported
minerals worth USDollars 366m in 1993, although this figure has been revised
to around USDollars 335m by the Central Bank.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (11): 'Not yet emerging,'
is the verdict - Central America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central America has come a long way from the investors' wasteland of a few
years ago. But opportunities are thin compared to other emerging markets,
and bureaucratic obstacles can be formidable.
'Not yet emerging,' is how one financial analyst describes Guatemala the
largest economy in the region, where a guerrilla conflict persists after 33
years.
The removal of former President Mr Jorge Serrano, who failed to seize
dictatorial powers last May, has slowed privatisation plans, and the new
government has lurched from one political crisis to another.
The recent elections of two social democrats, Mr Jose Maria Figueres in
Costa Rica, and Mr Carlos Roberto Reina in Honduras, in the region's most
stable countries, suggests less future emphasis on liberalisation, and more
on social spending.
In El Salvador, Mr Armando Calderon Sol of the governing right-wing Arena
party, who will probably win a presidential run- off this month, is expected
to continue the liberalising policies of his predecessor which have awakened
investor interest.
But serious problems on implementing a United Nations-sponsored peace
agreement could threaten political stability.
Seemingly chronic instability in Nicaragua, which has not recovered from the
divisive affects of a civil war in the 1980s, has even put off Central
American investors. Last year was the first in almost a decade that the
Nicaraguan economy grew.
In Panama, which has recovered its importance as a financial centre
following the US invasion to oust general Manuel Noriega in 1989, the
favourite to win presidential elections in May is Mr Ernesto Perez
Balladares, a former finance minister, from General Noriega's party.
But most countries are undergoing World Bank structural adjustment
programmes, and have standby agreements with the International Monetary Fund
which have reduced inflation, cut tariffs, and moved towards more
market-driven economies with freer exchange rates.
Mainly repatriated private capital has flowed into the region, attracted by
high interest rates, more stable currencies, and more fluid currency
regulations, to underwrite the large trade deficit.
But the fledgling markets are dominated by government paper, and few
companies have ventured beyond issuing short-term debt. A number of
privatisations, mainly of small state companies, have taken place over the
past few years.
There is residual suspicion towards Central America whose high political
risk, with the exception of Costa Rica, has limited long-term capital
investment. But some niche opportunities providing high margins exist, says
Jeffrey Erkelens from the Grupo Antigua, an investment consultancy. 'You
can't sell Central America to large institutional pension funds, but there
are opportunities for venture capital and private equity funds.' The local
private sector is lobbying for privatisation of energy generation,
telecommunications and transport services, which would help to develop
capital markets, and provide opportunities for foreign investors.
In El Salvador, Mrs Mirna Marques de Lievano, the planning minister, says
Dollars 1bn is needed to invest in the energy sector over the next five
years. There is a perception in governments throughout the region that
foreign private capital will be needed to modernise poor infrastructure.
The Honduran government is making moves to privatise Hondutel, the state
telephone company, one of the few public utilities that makes a profit.
There are similar intentions in Nicaragua, and in El Salvador. But in
Guatemala a recent proposal for securitisation of future account receivables
of international calls, broke down through a combination of government
indecision and union pressure.
For Mr Gerardo Zepeda, a senior official at Sieca, a regional technical
organisation which promotes integration, recent advances towards free
movement of goods and capital within the region is a new incentive. 'The
market is bigger now - about 30m people with combined GDP of Dollars 35bn,'
he says.
But Mr Zepeda admits that capital intensive industry is unlikely to locate
to Central America, until infrastructure and services are improved. And in
spite of progress, for example on intellectual property rights, laws and
incentives for foreign investors are still inadequate or unclear in most
countries, he says.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (12): New incentives for
investment - Caribbean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caribbean countries are seeking new ways to attract foreign economic
support, following the unenthusiastic response to their efforts to lure
private foreign investment.
With increasing uncertainty over the future of markets for traditional
commodity exports, and growing reliance on fickle tourism, several
governments have radically reshaped their economic policies, implementing
wholesale deregulation, opening their markets, removing exchange controls
and floating their currencies.
Regional economists say that the response by foreign investors to these
steps has been disappointing, especially for the governments of the
Dominican Republic, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. Flows from
traditional sources in North America and Europe have been diverted to more
attractive places, including eastern Europe, the far East and Mexico, say
regional economists.
While the economies of some Caribbean countries recorded fair levels of
growth last year, the performance of most was disappointing. In reviewing
the performance of regional economies in 1993, the Caribbean Development
Bank said that growth of between 7.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent in gross
domestic product was recorded by several countries, including Guyana, the
Cayman Islands and Belize. Lower than expected earnings from banana exports
led to low growth in the Windward islands of Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia and
St Vincent.
Jamaica recorded low growth because of marginal expansion in bauxite and
agricultural commodities, while Trinidad and Tobago's economy contracted
because of the weak state of the international market for oil, the country's
main export. The National Planning Office of the Dominican Republic said
that the economy grew last year by 2.7 per cent.
The prospects for improvement in the short term depend on the performance of
the industrialised economies, mainly the US, the region's main trading
partner, and the European Union.
Government planners and economists say that if the signs of improvement in
some OECD economies can be translated into sustainable growth, this will
help to lift Caribbean economies out of their lassitude.
In the meantime, several governments are hoping that their move towards
economic deregulation, including the divestment of a range of state
enterprises, will increase investment flows. Power companies, hotels,
telecommunications firms and airlines are being offered for sale to foreign
and local investors.
The divestment has given a fillip to regional stock exchanges, mainly in
Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. Coinciding with the opening of
regional economies, this has stimulated the development of the financial
markets. Foreign and local investors are becoming increasingly involved in
the flotation of issues and the underwriting of privatisation issues. Unit
trusts are increasingly attractive.
There remain, however, some obstacles to the expansion of capital markets in
the region. In Jamaica the bond market has been killed by inflation which
was 30 per cent last year. The bond market is lively in Trinidad and Tobago,
where inflation last year was 4 per cent, and this helped to take up the
slack in the equity market.
The market for equities in the region is underdeveloped. While some private
issues are favourably received, many companies are highly geared, continuing
to finance their operations through debt rather than equity. The capital
markets in the region are dominated either by short-term, attractively
priced government paper, on the one hand, and instruments which are held as
longer term investments, with their owners unwilling to trade. This is
compounded by the absence of a secondary market in most countries in the
region.
Opportunities for investing in the Caribbean will improve later this year
with the establishment of a Dollars 50m investment fund for the 13 members
of the Caribbean Community (Caricom). The fund's investments are expected to
include equities in all Caricom member countries, with a portfolio which
will cover listed and unlisted stocks, including unquoted companies wanting
funds for expansion and likely to be listed on the stock market.
It will undertake equity investments in sectors such as export and domestic
agriculture, tourism, construction, utilities, financial services and real
estate development, but with more attention to those undertakings involved
in exporting to hard currency markets.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (9): Crucial test for
sleeping giant - Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With a government anti-inflation plan and general elections, many analysts
believe 1994 will be a crucial test of whether Latin America's 'sleeping
giant' is prepared to wake up and reform.
While the rest of the continent has beaten back inflation, Brazilian prices
soared by about 2,500 per cent last year, twice the 1992 rise, and are now
running at a rate of more than 5,000 per cent a year.
Under the plan, the inflation rate will probably fall substantially, at
least temporarily. This stabilisation, although accompanied by high real
interest rates, is expected to increase consumer demand and help gross
domestic product to grow by 2-4 per cent this year compared with nearly 5
per cent last year.
The stock market is likely to be highly volatile, particularly in the run-up
to elections.
'Brazil is such a special case,' says Roger Palmer, director of emerging
markets at brokers Kleinwort Benson, referring to the uncertainties
surrounding the continent's biggest economy. He adds that anyone investing
there 'is taking a complete gamble on whether the plan works'.
Gambling on Brazil paid off last year, when Sao Paulo's stock exchange index
was among the world's best performers, more than doubling in dollar terms in
spite of the increase in inflation.
That could fall dramatically under the plan, which involves a balanced
federal budget and a proposed dollar-linked currency anchored by the central
bank's record foreign exchange reserves of about Dollars 37bn. The market
thinks the new currency will be introduced in June or July.
But the doubt is whether lower price rises can be maintained. Most analysts
believe that to achieve long-term stability Brazil must reform its economic
and political structure. For example, under the constitution the government
must pass on most revenues to states and municipalities. The resulting
deficits have been financed by short-term debt paper that fuels inflation.
For this to be changed and for reforms in the tax and welfare areas, as well
as more privatisation, the constitution must be altered. A constitutional
review began this year but seems likely to be postponed until 1995, partly
because of problems in obtaining congressional quorums in an election year.
If the review is postponed, structural changes will depend in large part on
who wins the presidency and whether he has support in Congress. The front
runner is Mr Luiz Inacio 'Lula' da Silva of the left-wing Workers' Party. Mr
da Silva is regarded with suspicion by the financial markets, which fear a
halt in privatisation and a slowdown in moves to modernise the economy along
neo-liberal lines.
The markets want finance minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso to run for
president, in the hope he can build an alliance against Mr da Silva. If the
plan works and Mr Cardoso looked set to win the stock market would
'explode', say brokers. Investment bank CS First Boston predicts that
equities could double again this year. On the other hand, problems with the
stabilisation plan and a strong campaign by Mr da Silva could lead to heavy
losses.
In the first quarter, Brazilian stocks appreciated but were then affected by
the increase in US interest rates and by a partial withdrawal from the
market by foreign investors. Despite this, net foreign investment in the
capital markets remained positive, if reduced, compared with record inflows
last year.
In 1993, foreign investment in the capital markets, mainly in equities, was
Dollars 5.5bn, compared with Dollars 1.3bn the year before. Eurobond issues
hit record volumes and there was a surge of capital into the fixed income
market thanks to interest rates of about 20 per cent in real annual terms.
Brazil's success in sealing the Brady plan debt restructuring agreement with
its creditor banks this year was seen as important in the long run in
integrating the country with world financial markets but, because of the
rise in US interest rates, an increase in the volume of Brazilian Eurobonds
is unlikely in the short term.
Mr Jose Eduardo Martins, a director at investment bank Patrimonio, predicts
that more Brazilian companies will seek to launch American Depositary
Receipts to raise capital this year since, with last year's stock market
growth, many shares are approaching or above the company's book value. Most
of the equities growth last year was fuelled by hopes for a broader
privatisation programme and confidence in Mr Cardoso along with a belief,
particularly by foreign investors, that Brazilian shares were undervalued.
Analysts point to companies like Telebras, the government-controlled telecom
company, whose shares are still quoted below book value.
Ms Cristina Vervloet, a director at brokers Socimer do Brasil, says the
local market has become much more influenced by foreign investors, even
though the foreign share of trading is comparatively low, at 15-20 per cent.
While being welcomed in the stock market, foreign investors have had the
door shut to many local fixed income instruments and the central bank is
expected to increase a new tax on fixed income instruments if there is a
flood of foreign capital attracted by ever higher interest rates under the
anti-inflation plan. In the first quarter, real interest rates on the
overnight market were 30-40 per cent.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (7): Privatisation winding
down - Argentina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's great privatisation bonanza that helped revive its capital
markets, is winding down. Privatisations are not entirely over. The
government still retains substantial minority holdings in the privatised
companies that it will float on local and international stock markets.
But the financial industry has replaced privatisation as one of the
principal magnets attracting international funds to finance Argentina's
external deficits. Argentina is expected to need Dollars 12bn in foreign
capital this year. Much of it will be raised by private companies or
channeled into equity markets.
However, the rise in US interest rates in March affected Argentine assets
more than other countries in the region, underlining the fragility of its
external financing. The assassination of Mr Luis Colosio, Mexico's leading
presidential candidate, brought further turbulence, wiping out all this
year's gains in share prices.
Mr Steven Darch, managing director of Buenos Aires' Mariva merchant bank,
says: 'Argentina is being bridged by international cash flow. (There is)
growth in the local market, but the real boost has come from international
cash flows, a lot of which is not stable.'
But he says Argentina is beginning to attract 'long-term financial and
strategic investors looking for a 7-10 year horizon'. He says these
investors, plus entirely new markets will provide the other end of the
financing bridge.
For instance, the introduction in July of a private pension fund system will
bring greater stability and breadth to the market. Contributors will soon
start channeling Dollars 200m-300m a month into financial markets. Baring
Securities forecasts pension fund assets at Dollars 30bn in 2000. And the
World Bank in March approved a Dollars 500m, 15-year backstop credit line,
the first of its kind, to support longer term finance for the private
sector.
New boutiques have sprung up in response to changing market conditions and
established houses are struggling to adapt the new market context. One new
boutique is Buenos Aires Capital Partners, set up by former JP Morgan
executives, that started out as an adviser to the government and buyers of
privatised companies.
Mergers and acquisitions are likely to emerge as a staple activity for
investment banks. Mr Timothy Gibbs, president of Buenos Aires Capital
Partners, notes a 'significant increase in interest in Argentina by
international companies, as strategic investors get comfortable with
Argentina and Latin America as a whole'.
Recent months have seen a number of acquisitions by multinationals such as
Cadbury-Schweppes and Procter and Gamble as well as companies from Brazil,
Chile and Venezuela. However, the M&amp;A market is unlikely to explode into
life. One reason is a lack of targets. Few Argentine companies turn over
more than Dollars 100m a year. And owners, often families, give up control
of their companies only as a last resort.
Inevitably though, increased competition, lack of capital and modern
management techniques are likely to force a far greater restructuring of the
corporate scene than hitherto.
Linked to this is the resistance of private companies to raise capital on
the equity market. Little more than a dozen companies have gone public in
the past three years, even though investors will pay high prices for almost
any stock. Many medium-sized companies are unviable, while those with a
future are in the throes of restructuring and not ready for the market.
For the same reason, few Argentine companies have imitated Chilean and
Mexican companies in approaching the US equity market with ADR programmes. A
Buenos Aires banker comments that 'ADRs will pick up speed. The first phase
is the placement of debt, which is where we are now. Next will come more
IPOs locally. Only later on are we going to see a lot of ADR issues'.
Hyperinflation in 1989-90 wiped out companies' liabilities, giving them
considerable headroom to raise debt. The CNV securities commission
authorised companies to issue Dollars 523m in bonds in 1991, Dollars 1.88bn
in 1992, and Dollars 5.3bn last year. This has raised concern about
deteriorating credit risk and poor use of funds, although optimists insist
that Argentine companies are still undergeared by international standards.
Decades of neglect have left Argentina with a deficient infrastructure,
which will require substantial investments in future years. But Mr Gibbs
says banks are still unwilling to make long-term loans to Argentina. This
could mean that capital markets will play a greater role in project finance
than elsewhere.
However, as Argentine securities approach classification as investment
grade, long-term bank finance may become available. Projects may be financed
through a blend of conventional lending and imaginative capital market
instruments. The brave new world of Argentine finance will not be for
everyone. Senior staff at even large Argentine banks often have a poor grasp
of high finance.
Argentina has 170 banks and an equal number of brokerages, few of which have
much of a future. Too many are small and under-capitalised, presenting a
constant threat to the wider market.
Argentina still lacks a credible market regulator and systematic enforcement
of disclosure and trading rules. The sacking in March of Mr Martin Redrado
as president of the CNV on political grounds sent a disquieting signal to
the international financial system.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (6): Business begins to dig
in - Peru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Peru has suddenly become a fashionable country for investors,' said a
senior Citibank analyst on a late March visit to Lima. 'Foreign governments
may still have reservations about issues like democracy and human rights,
but business people are digging in here already.'
He is right. In the past three months, there have been many indications that
Peru can again be considered a fully-fledged member of the international
financial community. The principal goals set by the government of President
Alberto Fujimori when it took office in July 1990 have been largely - if
painfully - achieved.
Tight monetary policy has brought inflation down to steady levels of between
1.5 and 2 per cent a month: this year's target is 20 per cent. Deregulation
and economic liberalisation have struck further and faster against
deep-rooted statism than in any other country of the continent. And fences
have been rebuilt with the multilateral organisations: Peru's debt with the
IMF, IADB, World Bank and the Paris Club has been rescheduled and fresh
credits are flowing.
For the past two years, Lima's small but active stock market has flourished
with a flurry of investment from abroad. The 1992 performance (when the
index rose 125 per cent in dollar terms) made Lima the world's second most
profitable emerging market. Significant foreign funds now account for
two-thirds of all trading, which is averaging more than Dollars 20m a day.
Even more encouraging are recent signs of investor willingness to commit
medium- to long-term money to Peru. Spain's Telefonica on February 28 bid
more than Dollars 2bn for a 35 per cent controlling stake in the country's
twin telecommunications companies CPT and Entel - the highest price paid in
any Latin American telephone privatisation.
Royal Dutch Shell, meanwhile, is signing a contract with the Peruvian
government for feasibility studies which will lead to development of the
vast Camisea gas fields they discovered in 1986. Political problems had
stymied earlier accords but now, if all goes as expected, Shell will be
making the largest direct investment in Peruvian history (anything between
Dollars 1bn and Dollars 2bn).
Other big-name foreign companies are entering Peru through the sweeping
privatisations programme which is now forging ahead. Anglo American, Cyprus
Minerals and China's Shougang Corporation have already bought important
copper and iron deposits. RTZ and Phelps Dodge are among front-runners for
forthcoming minerals sell-offs.
There is keen Latin American interest in Peru's largely decapitalised
industrial sector. Chileans have bought into the bottled gas and paint
industries as well as supermarkets and private pension funds; they are also
keen to snap up parts of the electricity generation and distribution system
due for sale later this year.
Mexicans have acquired the state-owned airline, Venezuelans have embarked on
joint ventures in fishing and fish meal, while Colombians and Argentinines
have made direct investments in a series of manufacturing concerns.
All are betting on strong and sustained domestic growth. GDP plummeted 25
per cent in the five years 1988-92, driving per capita income back to around
the levels of 1970. But last year, global output expanded 7 per cent - the
highest growth in the continent.
In some respects, however, the revival of foreign investor interest has
proved a mixed blessing. Short-term capital inflows - now running between
Dollars 100m and Dollars 150m a month - have kept the sol sharply
overvalued. Exporters are struggling to survive while export earnings have
remained static for 15 years around or below Dollars 3.5bn.
The avalanche of dollars from privatisations - now expected to top Dollars
3bn this year - is paradoxically another headache. By law, revenue from
sell-offs is earmarked for poverty alleviation (half of Peru's 22m
population live in 'extreme poverty'), but the state lacks the managerial
capacity to spend such amounts. Additionally, injecting into the economy
sums in excess of the Dollars 450m already agreed with the IMF would be
highly inflationary.
One solution, which may prove politically unattractive but necessary, would
be to set aside a portion of the windfall against a future Brady plan. Peru
has so far made no real overtures to its commercial banking creditors to
whom it owes some Dollars 7bn of a total foreign debt of Dollars 22bn. The
commercial debt has not been serviced for 11 years.
Mr Jorge Camet, economy minister, has indicated he would like to embark on a
Brady before the end of 1994. That, were it possible to conclude
negotiations in such a short time span, should set the seal on what
Peruvians call their 'financial reinsertion'.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (8): Investment capital is
scarce - Ecuador
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's initiatives to privatise state-owned enterprises, attract
foreign investment and invigorate a fledgling capital market has produced
only mediocre results. Foreign investment has still not increased as
expected, while the securities markets are experiencing considerable
volatile growth.
An economic stabilisation programme and policy reform such as the
liberalisation of investment regulations have improved the general
investment climate in the country. Since President Sixto Duran Ballen took
office 18 months ago, tight fiscal policies brought inflation down from
nearly 60 to 31 per cent, while international reserves have reached the
highest in the country's history.
The January 29 petrol rise closed a budget gap caused by dwindling oil
prices, returning confidence in the government's economic programme.
Interest rates fell slightly and the national currency, the sucre,
stabilised against the dollar.
The government's fiscal discipline is beginning to reap benefits. Besides
reducing inflationary pressure, the government has reached a general
agreement with the IMF over its letter of intent. Its approval would reopen
the possibility of new bilateral government loans, which have largely been
frozen due to Ecuador's moratorium on serving about half of its USDollars
12.7bn foreign debt - the highest per capita debt in Latin America.
'Until the country's external debt is renegotiated, investment capital will
be rather scarce,' said Giovanni Di Mella, general manager of Banco
Consolidado. A USDollars 200m multisector line of credit, granted through
international lending agencies and administered through the National Finance
Corporation, is the principal source of long-term credit open to the private
sector.
Legislation introduced in May 1993 was aimed at stimulating and regulating
the country's dormant securities market. Though the Quito and Guayaquil
stock exchanges have experienced substantial growth in 1993, Ecuador has not
become the new emerging market some had expected.
For one, Ecuadorean firms have not exactly flocked to raise capital stocks
in the market. Ecuadorean companies, often family-owned and closed to public
trading, are reluctant to provide the financial information now required by
law to register in the securities market. Furthermore, both stock exchanges
are only now acquiring basic services such as a clearing house, electronic
transfer, and an internationally-recognised custodian bank.
Yet, above all, international investors have been disillusioned by the slow
and irregular privatisation process, after its grand announcement by the
government, said Arturo Quiroz Riumallo, executive director of the Quito
Securities Market. Poor management in the sale of state shares by the
government has led numerous investors to abandon Ecuador's securities
market, he says.
The total volume of securities traded in Quito and Guayaquil in 1993
equalled USDollars 242m. Until 2000 both buyer and seller of the first issue
of stocks receive a tax credit worth 50 per cent of the nominal value. Still
to go on the block are public shares in a hotel, a shipping company and
cement companies. The total divestiture may amount to USDollars 170m by next
year.
Whether there are bigger fish to be fried in Ecuador will depend on
Congressional approval of specific legislation required to privatise the
telecommunications, electricity and petroleum sectors. With the proper
legislation in place, the first so-called strategic sector company to go on
sale would be the telephone company Emetel, worth about USDollars 1.6bn.
Yet, given the president's lack of popular and Congressional support, the
odds are against a prompt approval.
Meanwhile, a key reform of the financial sector is in the making. The law on
financial institutions to deregulate the financial sector, increase
competition among banks and allow for increased foreign capital inflow,
including mergers with local institutions, will be sent to Congress shortly.
At the same time regulations over banks' offshore operations will be
tightened.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (5): Doubts cloud outlook -
Venezuela
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year, Venezuela's capital markets had to cope with a swarm of
uncertainties. These included three different presidents during a 12-month
period, terrorist bombings, an economic recession, high inflation, a large
fiscal deficit and weak prices for petroleum exports, which are the main
source of export receipts for this South American republic of 20m and a
vital source of revenue for the government.
In 1994, the markets must still deal with sagging oil prices, inflation, a
deficit and a recession, now in its second year.
But the country now has a new president, Mr Rafael Caldera, 78, who began a
five-year term on February 2. The political situation has stabilised, at
least for the time being, and the only bomb came in January, when the
failure of the country's second-largest bank, Banco Latino, set off a crisis
in the financial system and caused a run on the government's foreign
currency reserves.
Investors still have plenty to worry about in Venezuela, especially since
the new government's economic programme (new taxes, budget cuts, price
controls, plus a commitment to privatisation and new private investment) is
just getting off the ground. It is too early to say what kind of results the
programme will produce.
Interest rates remain high, and are a prime target of the new
administration. Average nominal rates for commercial loans in February were
65.4 per cent, while average rates for time deposits were 47 per cent.
Inflation was 46 per cent in 1993 and is projected to be between 35-60 per
cent this year. The low figure comes from the government, while the high
figure reflects pessimistic thinking by some businessmen.
The CPI rose by 4.3 per cent in January of this year, but declined to 1.9
per cent in February. The drop was due mainly to the application of selected
price controls.
The failure of Banco Latino last January provoked a rush to buy US dollars,
and the government's international monetary reserves fell by USDollars 1.4bn
in January and February, compared with a decline of Dollars 519m for
full-year 1993.
The Venezuelan bolivar, which lost 25 per cent of its value vis-a-vis the
dollar last year, continues to decline on a daily basis under a crawling peg
system implemented by the central bank.
As a result, dollar purchases continue to be stronger than the norm, and
many Venezuelans are buying dollars as a hedge against inflation and
devaluation.
In spite of all this, the country's equity market has been surprisingly
strong. The Caracas Stock Exchange Index, which rose by less than 1 per cent
in January, was up 28 per cent by the end of February and by March 28 had
dropped to 18 per cent above the 1993 year-end figure.
In 1993, the Caracas index rose by 10 per cent in nominal terms, but in real
terms declined by 17.5 per cent. The market went through a series of strong
ups and downs last year, a pattern that seems to be appearing again in 1994.
One stock analyst, Mr Alex Dalmady, pointed out that the roller-coaster
performance of the Caracas exchange in 1993 produced strong gains for some
investors, especially those who picked up blue chips during the slumps.
This year, he said, market rallies in January and February have left some
Venezuelan industrials undervalued and quite attractive. These include
Sivensa, a steelmaker, Madosa, an appliance company, and HL Boulton, a
diversified industrial and commercial group.
However, the Caracas equity market's outlook for 1994 is clouded by the
threat of a proposed tax on bank debits. This new levy, which is still being
considered by Congress, would tax most private sector and individual debit
transactions at banks by 0.75 per cent. The tax would cover cheques and
electronic debits.
The Caldera administration argues that the tax will only be in effect until
the end of 1994, and that it is necessary to cover part of a large fiscal
deficit.
The president of the Caracas Stock Exchange, Ms Norys Aguirre, requested
that the government exclude exchange transactions from the proposed tax. She
warned that it would significantly raise transaction costs and drive much of
the exchange's business offshore.
A similar tax in Argentina, Ms Aguirre said, was eliminated several years
ago soon after it was implemented. The Argentine authorities discovered that
the tax had driven much of Argentina's stock trading to neighbouring
Uruguay, and had encouraged Argentines to conduct as many business
activities as possible in cash.
Issues of Venezuelan corporate bonds in dollars have declined this year, but
new issues denominated in bolivars are quite strong, according to Mr Stephen
A. Haecker, head of Bank of America's local capital market subsidiary,
Bamerinvest CA
Leading companies such as the CANTV, La Electricidad de Caracas and Corimon
find that commercial paper offers an economical alternative to bank loans.
However, the commercial paper market has been somewhat disorganised this
year as new government regulators take over.
Several Venezuelan companies have placed their shares on international stock
markets in recent years (for example, in the shape of ADRs), and a small
group of other companies are looking at ADR issues for 1994.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (2): Fight to control
inflation - Colombia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like other Latin American countries that have been through an intense
liberalisation process, Colombia is inclining towards greater social
spending as a way of mitigating the effects of opening up the economy.
President Cesar Gaviria's government has also veered in this direction and
the two leading candidates for the May presidential elections are speaking
of the lessons to be learned from events in Caracas and Chiapas.
The immediate concern is not so much where the money will come from but how
to keep inflation under control and avoid revaluing the peso. Over the past
three years the government has brought the annual inflation rate down from
33 per cent to 23 per cent and the 1994 target is 19 per cent.
However, independent economists say the rate is unlikely to drop below 22
per cent, particularly as inflation for the first two months of the year
reached 6.9 per cent. At the same time devaluation is only 10-11 per cent a
year and exporters are losing ground.
Mr Rudolf Hommes, minister of finance all through the Gaviria government,
says the administration will hand over a fiscal surplus of 2 per cent of
GDP, the result of improved tax collection and extra income from the sale of
state-controlled financial institutions and cellular telephone concessions.
The aim is to limit this year's growth in international reserves to
USDollars 450mn and use some of the surplus to prepay foreign debt. Modest
export growth and a further, though smaller, rise in imports are expected
for 1994.
In the eyes of foreign investors, the stability of Colombia's economy is to
some extent offsetting risks associated with guerrilla warfare and violence;
foreign investment (excluding oil) rose by about 35 per cent last year.
While the privatisation programme is not as exciting as some and the stock
market remains very small, more banks are due to be auctioned off and a
range of opportunities is opening up in the transport and energy sectors.
The signing of the first bilateral investment treaty with the UK in March
ensures equal treatment for foreign and local capital and is an important
step towards cementing confidence among investors; agreements with other
countries are expected to follow.
Although BP's Cusiana and Cupiagua oil discoveries transformed Colombia's
earnings outlook for the late 1990s, foreign companies have been unhappy
with the terms of the state petroleum company's association contracts for
some time. Ecopetrol will be putting some 28 blocks up for exploration in
mid-April and the new contracts are expected to be more flexible, taking
into account the profitability of different fields. The majority of the new
areas - many of which were previously reserved for Ecopetrol - are in the
eastern plains or llanos.
With economic growth rates consistently higher than population increase,
Colombia's income per capita has been rising steadily. Last year's economic
growth was 5.2 per cent and the government is forecasting 4.5 per cent to 5
per cent for 1994. Recent studies suggest that income distribution has also
been improving (though this point is controversial), while the gap between
urban and rural areas has broadened during the modernisation process.
Agriculture improved slightly in 1993 but the next government will have to
tackle serious economic and social problems in the countryside, including
those related to the guerrilla influence on how municipal budgets are spent.
The main rivals for the presidency - Ernesto Samper, the governing Liberal
party candidate, and Andres Pastrana of the Social Conservatives party -
have committed themselves to consolidating the opening up of the economy.
Both candidates have also promised improvements in infrastructure, which has
failed to keep up with business needs. However, Mr Pastrana is aiming for
higher growth rates and places greater emphasis on internationalisation,
while Mr Samper stresses jobs and training programmes. Mr Samper says he
will give priority to fighting crime in the cities, especially Bogota, as
well as violence in the countryside, not only with weapons but with the
persuasive power of social investment.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (4): New faces, same
policies - Chile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The faces of Chile's new administration may be different but the policies
remain the same. President Eduardo Frei, who in March took over the helm of
an economy that has averaged 6 per cent annual growth over 10 years, has
stressed that continuity will be the abiding theme of his six-year
administration.
Less than 48 hours after donning the presidential sash, Mr Frei was
addressing a conference of international business leaders, acknowledging the
part foreign capital had played in driving export-led development and
inviting fresh participation. Foreign investment in 1993 reached record
levels of Dollars 2.7bn, 6 per cent of GDP.
Unlike in some other Latin American countries, most of these inflows were
neither short-term nor attracted by state sell-offs. Much was directed at
medium- and long-term projects, principally in the mining and industrial
sectors, while nearly Dollars 800m came through the purchase of American
Depositary Receipts (ADRs) issued in New York by private Chilean companies.
Such levels of investment testify to confidence in the soundness of Chilean
macro-economic fundamentals. These include foreign reserves of Dollars
10.3bn (more than a year of imports), regular budget surpluses, inflation
(though slightly stubborn) at 12-13 per cent and south-east Asian levels of
savings and investment at 21 and 27 per cent respectively. According to Mr
David Lubin, an economist at Samuel Montagu recently in Chile: 'Anyone not
impressed by these figures is just trying to be clever.'
One area that has prompted some concern, though, has been the widening
current account deficit which reached Dollars 2.1bn last year, nearly 5 per
cent of GDP. This was largely caused by falling prices for raw material
exports and surging demand for imports which together produced a trade
deficit of Dollars 978m, the first in nearly a decade. Mr Lubin, however,
says Chile's ability to sustain the deficit through foreign investment,
without increasing the debt stock, is convincing evidence of economic
health.
Furthermore, expectations that the deficit would widen this year are
beginning to look pessimistic, with the first two months of 1994 showing a
slight trade surplus.
Chile, which trades nearly two thirds of its GDP, is also witnessing the
internationalisation of its financial system. Eight Chilean companies are
actively traded in New York through the ADR mechanism and more than 10
others are hoping for international placements this year. Foreign interest
in Chilean paper helped to drive up the Santiago exchange last year: the
IPSA index of most-traded shares recorded real gains of 50 per cent.
Mr Eduardo Aninat, the new finance minister, is committed to continued
international integration though the promised opening up of the capital
account will be undertaken 'tremendously cautiously'. Mr Aninat points to
progress made through recent capital markets reform which permits trading in
new instruments and allows private pension funds to invest a greater
proportion of their Dollars 16bn assets abroad.
Chile also hopes to polish its image through a free trade agreement with the
US, either bilaterally or through accession to the North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta). Mr Aninat hopes a deal can be struck by 1995. By then,
Chile should also be a part of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec)
bloc, a region that accounts for a third of its exports.
Signs of Santiago's growing confidence, reflected in last year's triple
B-plus country risk assessment from Standard and Poor's, has attracted
foreign investment to increasingly long-term projects. British Gas and
Houston-based Tenneco Gas, which are negotiating participation in a Dollars
1.65bn project to pipe natural gas from Argentina, do not expect to recoup
their investment for 20 years. Until recently, such long-term strategies
would have been unthinkable.
Chilean copper deposits, the richest in the world, are also a magnet for
foreign capital. Last year a US/Canadian consortium of Cyprus Amax and Lac
Minerals agreed to pay Dollars 555m for 51 per cent of the El Abra deposit
which they estimate will require Dollars 1bn development costs. Although
there are difficulties, the large sums on the table demonstrate the premium
Chile is reaping for political and economic stability.
Few analysts disagree with Chile's belief that there are few obstacles in
the medium term to sustained annual growth of 6 per cent, though in the
coming year this is expected to fall to 4-4.5 per cent.
If anything, opportunities for the foreign investor should increase. The new
administration, which has set a Dollars 33bn target for investment in
infrastructure by 2010, will be looking for substantial input from private
capital. President Frei has also hinted that the stalled privatisation
process may be revived, though the biggest prize of all, state copper
company Codelco, is for the moment strictly off limits.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (3): Uncertainty about
growth prospects - Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate of the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party party, could not have come at a
worse moment for Mexico's economy.
Last year the economy grew by just 0.4 per cent, and shrank in the second
half. Despite the low growth, Mexico ran a current account deficit of around
Dollars 20bn, making it acutely dependent on short-term capital inflows.
The rise in US interest rates had put further strain on the economy. Higher
US interest rates have hit the stock market, one source of foreign capital,
and forced Mexico to push its rates higher than it would otherwise have
liked, potentially hurting the economic recovery.
The political situation was highly tense even before Mr Colosio's
assassination. The new year uprising in the southern state of Chiapas
seriously shook the government, and raised doubts about sustainability of
the economic and political model followed over the past decade. It
indirectly came close to causing a renegade presidential bid of Mr Manuel
Camacho, the peace envoy in the state, that could have split the ruling
party.
The adverse economic and political environment had taken its toll on
financial markets. From February to the penultimate week of March, Mexico's
stock market fell by nearly 15 per cent. The peso lost 7 per cent of its
value against the dollar, and Mexican interest rates reversed their downward
trend.
While financial markets proved unexpectedly resilient in the aftermath of
the assassination of Mr Colosio, the killing led to a further increase in
interest rates. If more violence lies ahead, then the political uncertainty
may force the government to choose between still higher interest rates that
would choke the recovery or a faster rate of devaluation of the peso that
could cause an upsurge in inflation.
The recession of the second half of last year has also raised questions
about the efficiency of Mexico's economy and its long-term ability to
compete in world markets. Mexico's strong exchange rate and openness to
trade has forced thousands of unproductive companies out of business - in
sectors such as textiles, toys, paper and pulp, which all contracted sharply
last year.
In a recent report the World Bank says Mexico's low savings rate at a time
of slow growth has made its economy overly dependent on foreign capital. It
concludes that the high current account deficit and only modest improvements
in productivity in recent years 'raises concern about the sustainability of
economic growth'.
The World Bank attributes Mexico's low economic growth to the 'substitution
of foreign goods for domestically-produced goods'. It believes this is a
result of the low competitiveness of Mexican companies, partly because their
old technologies have become obsolete, and new investment has replaced
existing capital stock rather than adding to it.
The government prefers to blame the recession on short-term factors: its
goal of single-digit inflation that led to high real interest rates and a
budget surplus last year, the uncertainty over the US Congressional vote on
the North American Free Trade Agreement which damaged business and consumer
confidence last year, and the sharp slowdown in lending as recently
privatised banks sought to resolve problems of past due loans.
There is no doubt that short-term conditions this year look more propitious
for growth. Monetary and fiscal policy has been loosened. Interest rates
have fallen to around 9 per cent from 15 per cent in June last year. The
government announced a large increase in spending that will at a
conservative estimate turn last year's surplus into a balanced budget.
The banks have also started to lend money again, as they have sorted out
most of the problems of non-performing loans. The passage of Nafta should
lead to an increase in direct foreign investment in plant and machinery and
should boost business confidence. Inventories have also been run down during
the recession, and if demand picks up, an immediate increase in output is
expected.
Some signs of economic recovery were evident in November and December with
construction activity, investment in machinery, and durable goods sales
(such as cars) all growing. Just as a drop in the sales of durable goods
indicated the beginning of the recession, their recovery seemed to indicate
the end of it.
However, events in Chiapas and the assassination of Mr Colosio may make the
recovery less robust than hoped for. Consumer spending accounts for about 70
per cent of private demand, and unless this picks up economic growth will be
sluggish. Non durable goods sales - such as food - which went into the
recession last, continued to fall in November and December.
Even if economic growth reaches the target of 3 per cent this year, there is
little doubt that after nearly a decade of pro-market economic reform the
Mexican public was expecting more from the last year of the Salinas
presidency. Assuming the official forecast is met, national income will have
increased little more than the rise in population over the six years of the
term of President Salinas.

FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (1): The picture darkens -
Despite a series of shock events in Latin America this year, the flow of
capital should continue, albeit at a slower rate. Stephen Fidler discusses
prospects for the future and suggests that external investors may become
more selective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER

<TEXT>
Investors in Latin American financial assets have been rocked this year by a
series of events that have provided a timely reminder of the risks of
investment in the area's emerging markets. They have been left questioning
their previous expectations about future economic growth and political
stability. Yet, although the shocks may result in more selectivity by
investors, there are reasons to expect a continued net flow of private
capital into the region.
As Latin America's main importer of capital, Mexico sets the tone for the
region's financial markets. The implementation on January 1 of the North
American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between the US, Canada and Mexico was
expected to provide a base for inward investment flows to Mexico and to help
avoid the usual financial uncertainty that plagued the country in each of
the three previous presidential election years.
It was not to be. The new year was also greeted by a peasant rebellion in
the state of Chiapas which shocked the administration of President Carlos
Salinas. Then the March 23 assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling
party's presidential candidate, further shook the government. To some
foreign investors, the two events underlined previously-underestimated
political risks associated with Mr Salinas's economic reform programme.
Outside Mexico, other events also shifted perceptions of investor risk. In
Argentina, unrest among provincial government employees in Santiago del
Estero was interpreted by some as a parallel to Chiapas in that it showed
signs of opposition to President Carlos Menem's market-oriented reform
programme. (The government argued that the cause was an unreformed
provincial administration.)
From Venezuela, where the administration of President Rafael Caldera was
elected on a platform opposing market reform efforts, the collapse of the
second largest bank, Banco Latino, increased concerns. Later, the government
suffered a downgrading of its debt, the first for a country that had
previously issued Brady bonds in a debt restructuring.
In Brazil, the one Latin country where inflation has not fallen, investors
worried about elections later this year given the leadership in opinion
polls of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, presidential candidate from the
left-wing Workers' Party.
Yet the event that engendered the largest market correction occurred outside
the region: an initial one quarter point interest rate increase by the US
Federal Reserve in February. The direction of the change was no surprise,
but it came earlier than many investors expected. US interest rates
influence Latin America's financial markets in many ways. Low interest rates
in the US have driven US-based investors - many of them Latin Americans - to
seek higher returns from regional markets where tight monetary policy and
high interest rates have held sway. Low US interest rates also encouraged US
retail investors to shift resources into mutual funds, a significant portion
of which have been seeking high returns in emerging markets including those
in Latin America.
But a third factor appears to explain the magnitude of the correction in
Latin markets. This was the extent to which buyers of Latin American assets
were highly leveraged - borrowing money to buy debt in particular.
Ms Cathy O'Donnell, senior vice-president at one of the largest emerging
market debt traders, Chase Manhattan, said: 'When a lot of investors are
leveraged and the market goes down, the investors' losses are magnified. If
you are in a downward spiral, it feeds on itself because of leverage.'
It was also clear that dealers in emerging market debt were on the whole
heavy with inventory following the price increases of last year and the
positive perspective encouraged by Nafta. They, too, were forced to lighten
their books and sell into a falling market.
Mr Neil Allen, head of emerging markets at Bankers Trust in New York, viewed
the rally in Latin America which ended in February as both a trend and a
fad. For those attempting to develop long-term business in the region, 'the
fad is not always your friend', he said.
Not all of Latin America's new investors are so interest-rate sensitive or
driven by fads. The emerging markets of Latin America, Asia and eastern
Europe are now recognised by institutional investors such as pension funds
as an important target for investment.
Sharp corrections in stock and bond markets in developed countries, such as
has been experienced in recent weeks, will inevitably slow flows to emerging
markets, but many observers expect that over the medium term the investment
will continue.
'We are seeing the beginnings of a large portfolio shift that can last 10 to
15 years,' said Mr Anthony Bottrill, deputy managing director of the
Institute for International Finance in Washington, a think tank owned by
international banks.
Mr John Purcell, head of emerging markets research at Salomon Brothers,
said: 'I think pension funds and mutual funds are going to come back to the
market.' Mutual funds - accounting for about 6 per cent of the financial
assets held by individuals in the US - have been growing rapidly but 'are
nowhere near as large as they are eventually going to get'. This suggests a
continued flow of funds to emerging markets.
Furthermore, Latin America's capital inflows are not totally dependent on
portfolio investors. Foreign direct investment has been spurred by economic
reform and, although much of this has been on the back of once-and-for-all
privatisation programmes, can be expected to continue - so long as economic
growth remains positive.
International banks, having been burned by the debt crisis, are returning to
the region, too. Most banks have changed substantially since the early 1980s
and are never likely again to use their balance sheets to provide
large-scale medium-term finance for the region. Now most prefer to be in
Latin America not as lenders, but as traders and underwriters. But there are
signs that some lending will take place, as suggested by a Dollars 1.1bn
financing arranged this year for Mexico's Petroleos Mexicanos by JP Morgan -
said to be the first voluntary bank loan for a Mexican sovereign entity
since the 1982 debt crisis.
If a slowing - rather than an outright halt - of capital inflows to Latin
America is what is in prospect, it may be no bad thing. The volume of the
flows in recent years has worried some observers and has caused problems in
monetary management in many countries. In the medium term, the
sustainability of inflows will depend heavily on economic performance. Since
performance will diverge from country to country, so it is likely that
capital flows will become more selective.
Despite the Brady plan and other debt reduction efforts, many countries
remain relatively heavily indebted and have yet to develop strong foreign
exchange earnings capacity that will be needed to service their foreign
liabilities in the future. According to Ms Marilyn Skiles, an economist with
JP Morgan: 'The current availability of external finance provides these
countries with an opportunity to develop competitive export sectors. Unless
this happens, the countries may be vulnerable at some point in the future to
a sudden shift in investor preferences.'
The international capital market is an often capricious master as this year
has forcefully demonstrated. While Latin America continues to need foreign
capital, its governments are likely to be subject to its whims. Liberation
will come only for those countries that succeed in the difficult task of
increasing their own domestic savings rates.

FT  11 APR 94 / Relief tinged with bitterness that the action came so late:
The mood in Sarajevo where residents are exhausted by war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Driving across the United Nations-controlled Sarajevo airport yesterday, a
British military observer said he was looking forward to home leave. The
Bosnian situation had become more peaceful and the military operation was
being scaled down.
Two hours later, Nato F-16s dropped their 500-lb bombs on Bosnian Serb
positions, guided to their targets by SAS soldiers hidden in the mountains.
Sarajevo residents were relieved at the news that Nato had intervened to
save their beleaguered compatriots in Gorazde, but bitter that decisive
action had come so late.
For the inhabitants of the Bosnian capital, slowly coming to life now after
a ceasefire in February, the plight of the enclave has revived memories of
their own two-year ordeal.
'This shows the war could have been stopped two years ago,' said Ms Senada
Kreso, spokeswoman for the Bosnian government. Another Sarajevo resident who
has endured two years of bombardment claimed not to be bitter, but just
thankful that Nato had taken action: 'All Sarajevo will be celebrating
tonight. Every cafe will be full. It is a small step for Nato, but a great
leap for Bosnia.'
That sounds like an exaggeration. Sarajevans are still too exhausted by war,
too suspicious of apparent good news, to show much exuberance in a town when
electricity supplies are still intermittent and bursts of gunfire can still
be heard.
Some townspeople have been irritated by the way that UN spokesmen, including
General Sir Michael Rose, the British commander of UN forces, have been
playing down reports of the worsening situation in Gorazde. On the ground,
UN observers and relief workers had been describing a starkly different
picture, stressing the heavy loss of life.
As if seeking to humiliate Gen Rose, the Serb forces on Friday seized a
patch of high ground overlooking the town in direct violation of a 24-hour
ceasefire they had agreed with him only the night before.
Mr Charles Redman, the US special peace envoy, had displayed the same
complacent attitude as UN spokesmen until yesterday afternoon. Only then,
when speaking to reporters, did he admit that the situation was 'very
serious'.
It is unclear whether Mr Redman, at that point, was aware that his pledge
that 'they (the Serbs) are going to have to be dealt with' was about to be
fulfilled.

</HEADLINE>

Sunday morning: Gen Sir Michael Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, abandons trip
to Brussels when told of renewed Serb attack on Gorazde. He says air strikes
are possible.
Afternoon: Serb forces overrun hill close to the centre of Gorazde. Hundreds
of Moslems begin to flee. UNHCR officials say 'all hell has broken lose'.
In Sarajevo, Charles Redman, senior US negotiator in the region, warns that
the Serbs 'will have to be dealt with'.
16.22 GMT: Air strike by two US F-16 aircraft 'in support' of UN forces.
Serbian tanks are thought to be the target.

FT  11 APR 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Monday: UK consumer credit figures for February will be analysed for further
signs that UK consumers have been cutting back on their spending ahead of
this month's tax increases. The average forecast is for net credit of Pounds
250m, against Pounds 235m in January.
Tuesday: Monthly producer price figures for the US are expected to show
rises of 0.2 per cent in both the headline and the core rate, indicating
that there is still little sign of an inflationary upturn, despite the
strong economic growth.
Meanwhile, figures for French inflation in March are expected to show that
prices are under control, with a 0.3 per cent month-on-month increase
allowing the annual rate to drop to 1.6 per cent. For much of 1993, French
inflation was hovering around the 2 per cent mark.
Friday: The strength of the US economy should be shown by industrial
production figures for March, showing a monthly rise of 0.7 per cent and by
capacity utilisation figures, which are forecast to have edged up to 83.8
per cent, from 83.4 per cent in February. Very strong numbers will awaken
fears that the Fed will move to tighten rates again.

11 MONDAY
Yeltsin visits Spain
Russian President Boris Yeltsin arrives in Spain for an official three-day
visit during which he will try to drum up investment and reassure the west
of Russia's continuing friendship despite its more assertive foreign policy.
The visit comes at a time of continuing political instability in Russia and
speculation about the president's health.
Air France ballot result
The outcome of a staff ballot on the rescue plan for Air France should be
known by this evening. Trade union officials expect a majority of the 40,000
workforce to support the package of job cuts and a wage freeze to secure
FFr20bn (Dollars 3.5bn) of state aid for the loss-making state-owned
airline.
Chairman Christian Blanc has said he will quit if staff do not give him a
clear majority. Prime minister Edouard Balladur has made staff approval of
the plan a condition for receiving government subsidy.
Council of Europe assembly
The Council of Europe parliamentary assembly meets until April 15 in
Strasbourg, France. During the session there will be a contest for the post
of secretary-general.
The Council of Europe has become the main forum for welcoming fledgling
democracies into Europe's institutional structures. Russia has applied to
join the Council and will send a parliamentary guest delegation. Russian
nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, whose extremist views worry the west, will
be part of the delegation.
IADB meeting
The InterAmerican Development Bank holds its annual meeting in Guadalajara,
Mexico, from April 11 to 13. The talks will centre on a proposed Dollars
40bn capital increase for the bank.
Iliescu trip to France
Romanian President Ion Iliescu begins a three-day visit to France (until
April 14), in his first official visit to the country since taking office in
1990. He will meet President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur. France has been more sympathetic to Romania than most EU states,
who are worried by the continuing dominance of former communists, including
Iliescu himself.
Senate returns
After a two-week recess, the US Senate returns today, the House tomorrow.
Funding Agency for Schools
The UK launches a government agency which will further erode the system of
local authority-run mixed ability education. The FAS will help administrate,
set up and fund grant-maintained but independently run schools which may be
wholly or partially selective in which pupils they take.
Holidays
Hong Kong celebrates the Queen's birthday; India is on holiday for Gudi
Padwa.

12 TUESDAY
Uruguay Round talks
World trade ministers will meet in Marrakesh, Morocco, until April 15. On
Friday they are due to sign the long-delayed final act of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) Uruguay Round, which was agreed last
December. The signing will come a few days before the expiry of US President
Clinton's 'fast-track' negotiating authority extended by the US Congress in
April 1993.
The US had demanded that the World Trade Organisation, the new permanent
body to replace Gatt, should be formally committed to discuss links between
trade and labour standards. This was attacked as a protectionist ploy by
developing countries. A compromise now appears to have been reached.
UK parliament returns
Interest will focus on the local elections next month and the European
parliament elections in June amid continuing speculation over the position
of the prime minister. Key pieces of legislation before parliament include
the criminal justice bill and the deregulation bill.
Texas Democratic primary
A run-off primary election for the Senate will be held in Texas to determine
who will face Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson in November.
Competing for the Democratic nomination are former congressman Jim Mattoz
and businessman Richard Fisher.
Japanese economic figures
This week a slew of economic figures will be closely watched for any signs
that the tentative economic upturn is here to stay.
Many analysts predict that Japan's recession, one of the worst since the
war, is coming to an end. Consumer activity has shown signs of responding to
the government's four economic stimulus packages while figures for
industrial output (released on Friday) are forecast by the Bank of Japan to
have risen in the first quarter.
Bolstering confidence in the possibility of recovery is a strong increase in
housing starts which has been evident since the autumn. From that,
manufacturers of consumer goods are expecting a pick-up in demand this
spring as consumer goods generally lag housing starts by six months.

13 WEDNESDAY
Macedonia deadline
This is the EU deadline for Greece to lift its two-month embargo of
Macedonia or face legal action in the European Court of Justice. Today
Macedonian officials hold talks in New York with Cyrus Vance, UN mediator in
the dispute over the former Yugoslav republic's name, flag and constitution.
Greece will meet Vance tomorrow but is unlikely to lift the embargo before
today's deadline.
Chinese trade mission
Trade minister Wu Yi leads a 200-strong delegation, the largest sent to the
US, to negotiate 800 contracts.  President Clinton has made a renewal of
China's 'most favoured nation' trade status dependent on human rights
improvements this year.
Party funding report
The House of Commons home affairs committee publishes its report into
funding of political parties. The inquiry began last year after the row over
disgraced entrepreneur Asil Nadir's donations to the Conservative party.
Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs will want either state funding or strict
controls on donations and election spending because of the scale of business
donations to the Conservatives, many from abroad.
Israeli withdrawal date
Israel is due to complete its military withdrawal from the occupied Gaza
Strip and West Bank town of Jericho in preparation for Palestinian self-rule
under last September's peace deal.
However, the final troop pull-out is dependent on Israel and the Palestinian
Liberation Organisation completing a comprehensive agreement in Cairo on
security and economic issues.
Israel has virtually completed its withdrawal but the talks have been bogged
down in wrangling over the role and size of the Palestinian police force and
the extent of Israeli legal jurisdiction.
In Strasbourg, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat will address the Council of
Europe's assembly and will undoubtedly comment on any delays.
US retail sales
A rebound in today's US retail sales figures for March may heighten fears
that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy. Also out today is the
consumer prices index for March, which is expected to have moved a notch
higher.
14 THURSDAY
Bundesbank meeting
Having been caught repeatedly on the hop by most of the Bundesbank's
interest rate shifts of the past 12 months, few economists are prepared to
call the odds on a discount rate cut at today's meeting of the German
central bank's council. Some tea leaf watchers suggest a move this week to
head off friction at the G7 meeting booked for Washington on April 23 and
24, but they are in a minority.
Although most indicators point firmly towards further reductions, the
Bundesbankers can easily blame any delay on the uncertainty caused by the
recent explosion in M3 money supply growth. Even though the bank claims it
has identified the 'special factors' responsible, and suggests there is
little need for concern, experience shows that it likes to be sure that it
is receiving all signals clearly before going into action.
UDF conference
Bulgaria's opposition Union of Democratic Forces holds a national conference
(to April 15). The UDF won the October 1991 elections but collapsed after
little more than a year in a welter of internal wrangles and scandals,
leading to the return of a government backed by the Bulgarian Socialist
party, the former communists, and breakaway elements from the UDF.
The UDF hopes that Bulgaria's economic problems will deliver them the next
election, which is due in 1995 but likely before then.
Pasok congress
Greece's ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement holds a party congress for
the first time in more than three years (until April 17). Although the
leadership issue is not on the agenda, potential successors to ailing Prime
Minister Andreas Papandreou will be jostling for position in the corridors.
The leading contender, interior minister Akis Tsochatzopoulos, expects to
boost his chances by winning re-election as Pasok general secretary.
Pawlak visits Germany
Waldemar Pawlak, Poland's prime minister, begins a two-day official visit to
Germany. Although relations between Bonn and Warsaw are very good, the
Polish government remains disappointed at the low levels of investment by
German companies in Poland.
Pawlak, who heads a coalition of the Democratic Left Alliance and the
Peasants party, will seek to assure his hosts that there is no turning back
from the economic reforms.
UK visible trade figures
Analysts will watch today's whole world trade figures for January for signs
that recovery in the UK is putting pressure on the visible trade deficit.
The last set of complete trade figures were disappointingly poor, with
higher imports in particular suggesting that the UK trade balance is
deteriorating.

15 FRIDAY
Italy's parliament meets
Italy's new members of parliament from last month's elections take their
seats today. The business of government cannot begin until Italian President
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has chosen a prime minister, which he cannot do until
parliament has reconvened. Media magnate Silvio Berlusconi appears
increasingly likely to be able to form a right-wing administration.
CIS summit
The former Soviet republics meet in Moscow to try to make progress on
economic union and military co-operation.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development begins a four-day
annual meeting in St Petersburg.
Brazil debt deadline
Brazil and its private bank creditors are expected to complete a Dollars
52bn debt rescheduling in New York, reducing the overall burden on Brazil,
the developing world's biggest debtor.
UK retail prices index
The March figure may have been boosted by the delayed end to January
discount sales, but the dropping out of increases in petrol and food prices
last year may cut the underlying rate.
16-17 WEEKEND
EU and GCC in Riyadh
Ministers and officials from the European Union and the Gulf Co-operation
Council (GCC) grouping of Gulf Arab states meet in Riyadh on Sunday. They
will almost certainly discuss the long-standing Gulf concern of
petrochemical access to the European market.
Pacific Grand Prix
The Formula One World Championship motor racing Grand Prix will be held in
Aida, Japan, on Sunday.
London Marathon
On Sunday the Nutrasweet London Marathon will begin at Greenwich and finish
in front of Buckingham Palace. It has a world-record entry of 36,500
runners.
Fifth Test match
England play West Indies in the fifth and final cricket Test match at St
John's, Antigua, from Saturday to April 21.

FT  11 APR 94 / Equity Markets: Switch to bearish stance may lift hedge
funds - Risk &amp; Reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the US House banking committee begins its hearings on hedge funds this
week, and the first US banks report their first-quarter results, attention
will again be drawn to the heavy losses incurred by fund managers and market
participants during the recent sharp price declines in many of the world's
financial markets.
However, the worst of those losses may be over, as many traders have managed
to reverse their positions to take account of the switch from bullish to
bearish conditions.
During the first wave of price falls in February, the main sellers were
hedge funds (which were forced to liquidate positions, largely in bond
markets, because of their high degree of leverage) and proprietary traders
(dealers at banks and securities houses taking positions with their
institution's own capital).
Many mainstream institutional fund managers held their fire during this
initial period, convinced there had been no change in economic fundamentals.
However, in March many institutions were forced to reassess this view.
Many fund managers appear to have sold futures to hedge their long positions
in bonds, creating record trading volume on futures exchanges in the first
quarter.
'Hedge funds have probably got out of about 80 per cent of their positions
and indeed have gone the other way,' said one fund manager.
As a result, he believes 'there is still some cash selling to come, but it
will be against buying in futures'.
The theory that many fund managers have at least gone some way to reversing
bull market positions held at the start of the year is backed up by better
performance figures for March.
The Managed Account Reports (MAR) trading adviser index showed a decline of
just 0.01 per cent in March, with just over half of the advisers showing a
positive return, to give a first-quarter fall of 5.19 per cent. According to
Ms Lois Pelz, managing editor of MAR, 'the traders who were able to realise
a profit (in March) took short positions on financials and the dollar'.
TASS Management, which also tracks futures funds, found a range for March of
plus 20 per cent to minus 15 per cent among the top 50 managers - which
leaves them down around 5 per cent for the year to date.
Of the two hundred-plus hedge funds tracked by TASS, the average decline for
the year to date is around 7 per cent. 'In February and March people were
reducing leverage. Those who did well (in March) did it in bonds, by
flipping round positions,' according to Ms Nicola Meaden of TASS.
Nevertheless, there is little sign that any of this has helped restore
confidence. One reason is the shock waves caused by the collapse of three
hedge funds managed by Mr David Askin, with total equity of Dollars 600m,
mainly invested in mortgage-backed securities.
One reason for the concern generated by the funds' collapse is that they
were supposed to be risk averse. In addition, there appear to have been
difficulties in valuing the rather illiquid instruments held by the funds.
'They were supposed to have a market neutral strategy, which means you try
to hedge out volatility. A lot of banks are re-evaluating relationships with
other hedge funds as a result,' said one hedge fund specialist.
Meanwhile, for those fund managers and traders who have created short
positions in the bond market, the next fear is the markets will now start to
rally strongly, forcing them to buy back into the markets at a higher level,
thus incurring further losses.

TOKYO
Investors succeeded in absorbing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's
unexpected resignation announcement quickly last Friday but uncertainty over
the political situation could weigh on share prices this week. The main
focus for the stock market will be the passage of the 1994 budget, which has
been stalled by the opposition parties.
FRANKFURT
The Bundesbank meets for the first time in four weeks on Thursday. James
Capel notes that the repo rate has fallen by 15 basis points from 5.88 per
cent since the last meeting. The broker says there is an outside chance of a
cut in the key discount rate at this week's meeting, although it expects the
more likely date for the next reduction is April 28.
MILAN
The Italian president makes known on Friday who will be the country's prime
minister. NatWest Securities says that while Mr Silvio Berlusconi is widely
expected to be asked to form a government, the brinkmanship and politicking
seen at the end of last week will continue.
However, this background should not detract from the momentum that is
driving equities, bonds and the lira.
PARIS
Michelin, the tyre manufacturer, reports on Wednesday and the consensus
estimate is for a full-year loss of FFr3.2bn as a result of the downturn in
the European automobile industry and exceptional charges relating to its
restructuring. Accor, the hotel and tourism group, also reporting on
Wednesday, is expected to announce a fall in net income of about 25 per
cent, depending on exceptional items.
COPENHAGEN
Today sees the first day of trading in Copenhagen Airport shares, and it is
also the first day of subscription for Tele Danmark for domestic,
non-institutional investors.
STOCKHOLM
The equity market is expected to continue last week's strong run. UBS says
news that foreign investors were net buyers of SKr8.3bn of equities during
February, a time when the market was falling, suggests domestic institutions
have already built up substantial reserves of liquidity in advance of the
hefty new issue programme.

FT  11 APR 94 / Equity Markets: Brokers look for calmer conditions - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
After Friday's bumpy ride, the fragile peace that Wall Street enjoyed in the
middle of last week should return this morning, but the beginning of the
corporate results season could bring fresh complications.
At least one market strategist is brimming with confidence. Late last week,
Ms Gail Dudack at SG Warburg went out on a limb by predicting that Tuesday's
82-point rally would go down as the end of the correction phase for
equities.
'The panic selling which characterised markets (around the Easter holiday).
. . reversed on Tuesday in a classic bottoming pattern,' says Ms Dudack. She
points out that 89 per cent of that session's volume was in advancing
issues, after a long sequence in which declines represented 85 per cent of
the activity.
Her counterparts are generally more circumspect, however. Most analysts
believe the underlying tensions of recent weeks are still lurking just below
the surface. Their presence was felt painfully on Friday, when a lazy
session was jolted to life by sell programs activated in the early afternoon
by a gradual erosion in bonds.
While generally confident that the worst of the volatility is over, analysts
warn of the possibility of a reprise in coming sessions. 'I see the market
struggling upward in the short term,' says Mr Alfred Goldman, technical
analyst at AG Edwards in St Louis. Although stocks have moved past their
'peak downside intensity', he believes there is still a chance of a milder
re-run of the Easter action.
Mr Hugh Johnson, chief investment strategist at First Albany, says there are
two reasons to expect smooth conditions this week. First, investors are
exhausted from the events of the past fortnight. Second, it is unlikely that
this week's producer and consumer price indices will produce any surprises.
Even if they do, the Federal Reserve is looking more closely at leading
indicators, such as commodity and industrial material prices, rather than
readings of current inflation such as the PPI and CPI.
The flood of results which will begin to trickle in to Wall Street this week
is likely to produce a few surprises, but with expectations running high,
the net impact on stocks could be negative.
'Unless earnings come in unexpected either way, they may not have any
effect,' says Mr Paul Stanton, head of over-the-counter trading at Johnson
Lemon. He says strong earnings projections are already priced into the
market and that disappointments could present a genuine threat to share
valuations.
However, speculation over the timing of the Federal Reserve's third
tightening of monetary policy will continue to dominate.
Action by the Fed seems almost inevitable to many observers, such as Mr Bill
Dodge at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. In the run-up, he sees stocks
taking more knocks, although he draws some encouragement from last week's
rally. 'It at least showed that the downside can be contained,' he says.

London
</HEADLINE>

Whatever deeper economic fundamentals may still overshadow UK stocks, one
significant feature of the market background has shifted. The UK tax-year
deadline has come and gone, and with it the close of a painful 1994
first-quarter performance by UK equities. Fund managers have presumably
taken the pain, cleared the decks, and must now decide whether to follow the
bulls or the bears.
The second quarter opens with investors clearly uncertain and market
strategists sharply divided in their views. The bears would argue that the
stock market did well to survive the Easter weekend without something like a
repetition of autumn 1987. Even without such alarms, the market ended the
first quarter some 12 per cent below its peak and the problems which brought
that setback - rekindled inflation worries and a tightening credit regime at
the US Federal Reserve - are still with us.
For the near term, there are signs that the European markets, having become
bored with minor adjustments to repo rates, are looking keenly for a
significant cut in rates in Germany when the Bundesbank meets on Thursday.
But analysts suggest the UK market may now concentrate on its own concerns.
There is general, if reluctant, agreement that UK base rates are likely to
be cut as consumers face up to the Pounds 8bn or so tax increases to be
implemented this month. Mr Nicholas Knight, at Nomura Securities, believes
investors may see this as a signal to sell equities, since it will imply
harsher treatment in the second half of the year. His forecast of a Footsie
at 2,800 in the near future has not been forgotten by the stock market.
But there is a case for the bulls. The strongest factor for equity optimism
is that dividend yields on equities are rising steeply, and have already
taken the yield relative to bonds below its 10-year average. Strauss
Turnbull puts the prospective yield on equities at 4.1 per cent, based on
forecast dividend growth of about 10 per cent. This is the aggregate
dividend rise so far this year.
The dividend argument is particularly significant for the water companies
The sector has underperformed by about 10 per cent since the turn of the
year, partly because impending regulatory developments have inhibited
investors and because rising gilt yields have reduced the attractions of
utilities.
BZW and Kleinwort Benson agree that Ofwat's pricing review, not due until
July, will continue to cast a shadow. But BZW predicts a major revaluation
of the sector, pointing out that regulatory risk will at least be reduced
dramatically after July. Kleinwort believes the sector will turn in higher
profits and dividend growth of around 8 per cent, albeit at the cost of
dividend cover.
At least part of the potential upside could arrive soon, according to BZW,
which discounts any further threat from gilts in the near term. The firm
focuses on water companies offering the significant dividend growth which
will be associated with equally significant cost-cutting programmes.

The main statistic of the week will be Friday's retail price index for
March. After February's disappointing numbers, the markets will be looking
for a fall in the underlying rate (excluding mortgage payments) to 2.6 per
cent. The headline annual rate is expected to be unchanged at 2.4 per cent.
Mr James Barty, UK economist at Morgan Grenfell, says he thinks the last
inflation numbers caused an over-reaction, but adds, 'the markets are going
to want an assurance there has been no pick-up in inflationary pressures'.
Another statistic that will be closely watched is the January whole world
trade figure. The December Pounds 1.6bn deficit awakened fears that the UK's
tendency to suck in imports was recurring. Analysts are hoping that the
January deficit will have dropped to Pounds 1.3bn.
Gilts seemed to have stabilised last week, despite strong data on UK
industrial output. By the time trading resumed on Tuesday, the US payroll
numbers, published on Good Friday, were digested with relative calm.
According to SG Warburg Securities, spreads versus US Treasuries have
narrowed to 70 basis points from 128 basis points two weeks ago. But a more
sustained rally may need firmer evidence that fears of a revival in US and
UK inflation are unwarranted.

In the notoriously cut-throat world of Eurobonds, the recent difficult
market conditions have brought to light one of the nastier syndicate
practices - bond-dumping.
Last week, Goldman Sachs brought a Dollars 1.5bn floating-rate note for the
Republic of Finland. Rival syndicate houses gave the deal the thumbs down,
saying it was too aggressively priced, especially as there was already
plenty of left-over floating-rate paper sloshing around the market.
When the deal broke syndicate on Thursday, Goldman said it had managed to
sell its portion of the deal to investors in the Far East and Europe, but
admitted it had had to buy back some Dollars 400m of the bonds that had been
dumped by other members of the syndicate.
Its rivals in the Eurobond business pointed out that Goldman could find it
was sitting on a large pile of unsold bonds.
The case above, like many of the deals launched in the first quarter, has
helped to focus Eurobond specialists' minds on two points - the trend
towards increasingly aggressive pricing, and the faults which have emerged
in the current system of selling and distributing bonds.
Many syndicate officials complain that international bond issues tend to be
brought at far too aggressive a price. This is often a reflection of the
highly competitive bidding process that takes place between banks to win the
mandate for the deal.
And as borrowers are usually driven by their bottom line when they award the
mandate, they have a tendency to choose the house which comes up with the
most aggressive pricing.
The consequences of this are especially obvious when the market is facing
difficult conditions, as they are now.
Investors are clearly nervous and in many cases appear to be adopting a
'wait-and-see' attitude, rather than regarding particular new issues as a
'must-buy'. As a result, deals are taking longer to place, and big chunks of
the new issues launched in the first quarter of 1994 are still stuck firmly
with the lead managers.
The second point being discussed more widely among syndicate managers
concerns the way bonds are underwritten and sold. Many feel some syndicate
members are not prepared to work for their fees, preferring to dump the
bonds they have been allocated once the deal has broken syndicate, spoiling
the deal and undermining investor confidence still further.
Enter CS First Boston, which is proposing that the system under which bonds
are underwritten and sold should be amended. It is holding informal
discussions with other houses and with IPMA (the International Primary
Market Association).
The fixed price reoffer method of syndicating Eurobonds was introduced in
1989. Under this system, the lead firm sets the price at which the bonds can
be traded (known as the fixed price reoffer).
Once it is satisfied most of the bonds have been placed with end investors,
the bond issue is allowed to find a free market price. Borrowers expect the
lead manager to support the bond price at the fixed price reoffer level:
however, other participants in the deal do not feel obliged to do so.
'The co-managers in the transaction are confident of getting their
allocation of bonds, and they know they will get their fees anyway, at which
point everyone dumps bonds on the brokers and pockets the fees. There's no
inclination among the syndicate to support the issue so the bond issue gets
off to a bad start,' points out one syndicate member at a UK house.
'We think the market has a problem: the fixed price reoffer system is
excellent, but the trouble is that it has become so rigid it is open to
abuse,' says Mr Marcus Everard, head of debt capital markets at CS First
Boston.
'The market has lost the distinction between underwriting and selling. In
the worst-case scenario (in the current market set-up where the lead manager
supports the transaction at the fixed price reoffer), where the co-manager
and co-leads often are allotted securities equal to their underwriting
commitment, they have little incentive to distribute them.'
CS First Boston has suggested that one way around this problem would be to
separate the underwriting and selling processes. The lead manager would
invite other banks to underwrite the deal for a fee but would not guarantee
to allot bonds to those houses. Instead, the underwriting banks would have
to request the amount of paper they felt able to sell to investors.
Some Eurobond specialists think the new system would also be open to abuse,
with lead managers hogging the bulk of the popular deals, and only allowing
the other syndicate members to participate fully in the less desirable
issues.
Mr Everard concedes this is a fair criticism, but stresses there would have
to be 'an element of reciprocity between the major participants' or it
simply would not work - even though the Eurobond business is not known for
its altruism. In other words, banks which failed to co-operate and only came
in for a free ride would be 'punished' next time around and squeezed out.
An alternative might be based on the method of book-building seen in the
international equities field.
'It would be lovely to have that sort of exercise in the bond market and to
some extent it already happens with World Bank issues where the deal is
pre-marketed with an indicated pricing range,' says one Eurobond specialist.
There are problems with this method though: the time taken to bring a deal
can be very short as it may be determined by fleeting swap opportunities, or
the perception of investor demand, so it might not be possible to spend days
or hours conducting a book-building exercise.
Bond specialists point out the debate is still in its early stages. However,
many feel the trend will have to be towards better distribution skills.

German government bonds gained around 0.25 per cent in local currency terms
last week, according to Salomon Brothers' world government bond index,
helped by the Bundesbank's continued step-by-step declines in the repo rate
and the improvement in market sentiment since the start of the second
quarter.
The Bundesbank cut the repo rate by three basis points to 5.73 per cent last
Wednesday, in line with forecasts, but analysts said the move was marred by
the Bundesbank's misjudgment of the liquidity situation in the money market.
Contrary to market expectations, the Bundesbank drained a net DM1.8bn from
the system on Wednesday but it was forced to allocate DM7bn via a seven-day
repo the morning after.
Traders expect the yield curve to steepen this week as rate cut speculation
mounts ahead of the Bundesbank's council meeting on Thursday. The Bundesbank
has scheduled a press conference after the meeting at which it is expected
to announce its 1993 profits, thought to be around DM20bn.
There is speculation that the Bundesbank will announce a half-point cut in
the emergency Lombard funding rate, which has remained at 6.75 per cent
since last October.

The fate of Japanese financial markets and the economy rests with how soon
the next government is formed following Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's
resignation announcement last Friday.
Political uncertainty is expected to last throughout the week, and investors
are unlikely to take on large positions until there is a clear indication of
what lies on the political horizon.
The worst case scenario for the economy, but a positive one for the bond
market, would be if the current coalition proved unable to decide on the
next prime minister, prompting a general election followed by a political
realignment.
Meanwhile, worries of oversupply may weigh on the bond market as municipal
governments and companies are likely to raise funds through the straight
bond this month.
Companies have had to refrain from corporate bond financing because of last
month's volatility on the bond market.
However, some traders expect instability stemming from uncertainty over US
interest rates to continue this week. Japanese bonds are likely to be
affected if
fears of further tightening by the US Federal Reserve Board destabilise the
US Treasury bond market.

Investors thumbed their collective nose at market trends last week and
lifted bond prices for three consecutive days: but on Friday, the rally
broke down as nervousness about this week's barrage of economic data set in.
The fear is that data pointing to inflationary pressures will provide the
Federal Open Market Committee with an excuse to increase interest rates.
Salomon Brothers predicts that, whether in one step or two, the committee is
poised to push the funds rate from 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent on or before
its May 17 meeting.
On Tuesday, the barrage will start quietly if the producer price index for
March shows the expected increase of just 0.2 per cent. But Wednesday will
be lively if the March increase in consumer prices is greater than
February's 0.3 per cent, and there could be worries about the likely
increase in retail sales of 1 per cent or more.
Thursday brings the figures for inventories held by manufacturers,
wholesalers and retailers, with analysts predicting increases ranging from
0.2 per cent to 0.4 per cent. The week could end with another busy day's
trading on Friday if, as expected, figures for industrial output show that
the overall operating rate rose to 83.7 per cent in March, the highest since
June 1989.

FT  11 APR 94 / World Bond Markets (This Week): German traders hope for
high-profile cut - Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank's 16 council members are scheduled on Thursday to hold their
first meeting since the Easter break, and traders of German government bonds
are hoping they will underline the recent but gradual decline in German repo
rates with a high-profile cut in official interest rates.
The cut of three basis points at last week's repo tender has brought the
cumulative fall in the repo rate to 27 basis points over the last six weeks
since variable-rate repos were introduced. The repo rate now stands at 5.73
per cent, compared with a discount rate of 5.25 per cent and a Lombard rate
of 6.75 per cent.
'The Bundesbank's policy is aimed at getting us ready for another official
rate cut, but it does not want the market to feel that it's a one-way bet
this week,' says Dr Richard Reid, chief economist at Union Bank of
Switzerland in Frankfurt. 'All markets want confirmation of lower rates in
Germany, but the Bundesbank is not in the business of placating capital
markets.'
Speculation is strongest for a half-point cut in the Lombard rate, which has
remained unchanged since last October. Optimists justify their stance by
saying that a cut in the Lombard rate will help to ease the pressures which
have built up recently in the German money market, because banks will find
it less costly to borrow emergency funds from the Bundesbank.
The change in reserve requirements for banks and the long Easter weekend
have contributed to the volatile conditions in the money market. The
shortage of liquidity has forced call money rates as high as 6.75 per cent
in recent weeks, and last week the Bundesbank badly misjudged the situation
in the market when it drained a net DM1.8bn on Wednesday but then had to
allocate DM7bn via a seven-day repo the morning after.
There are also hopes the Bundesbank will cut the discount rate by a
half-point, although a decision to keep this rate unchanged should not lead
to any great disappointment since the market would then look to April 28
with even greater confidence.
'The odds are 60-40 for a cut of 50 basis points in the discount and the
Lombard rates,' says Dr Helmut Kaiser, senior economist at Deutsche Bank in
Frankfurt. He adds that in the event of a cut, the Bundesbank could bring
the repo rate down to 5.50 per cent but then switch to a fixed-rate tender.
This would signal a shift in its recent policy of nudging down unofficial
rates by using variable rate tenders.
Traders expect the German yield curve to steepen as speculation mounts in
the run-up to Thursday. However, the market is likely to be kept guessing
until the moment the Bundesbank makes public its decision, because the repo
tender will not be held on Wednesday but one day later so that the
Bundesbank can offset the boost to liquidity as it transfers its 1993
profits, estimated at DM20bn, to the government. As a result, traders will
not have the usual 24 hours to consolidate their expectations either way.
In spite of the market's optimism, seasoned Bundesbank watchers believe that
the central bank will hold out until April 28, by which time it should have
more evidence of declining inflation in Germany and improving money supply
data.
'If we have a rate cut on Thursday it would be Kenneth Clarke style rather
than the more typical behaviour of the Bundesbank,' says Mr Julian Callow,
European economist at Kleinwort Benson in London. He adds that although the
Bundesbank has distanced itself from M3 in recent months, due to the wild
fluctuations in the numbers, the data are still too large to justify a cut.
In addition, several council members have been schooled in the M3 orthodoxy,
he says.
Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets in
London, says that unless the D-Mark breaks new highs for the year this week,
optimists are likely to be disappointed.
She believes the Bundesbank will not even serve up a half-measure by cutting
the Lombard rate on its own, something which it has done just twice in the
past 10 years and during times of immense international pressure.
Such a move would reduce the status of the Lombard rate as an emergency
funding rate, she says. 'The Bundesbank does not want the Lombard rate to
become used often, it should be only for emergencies,' Ms Cottrell says.
In her view, the Bundesbank would prefer to take the pressure off call money
rates by allocating funds through an extra tender, at 6.15 per cent for
example. In addition, the Bundesbank's transfer of its 1993 profits would
make it difficult simultaneously to cut official rates.
Mr Callow notes that the Bundesbank has ample room to keep cutting the repo
rate by another quarter-point before it would need to cut the discount rate.
Analysts estimate that the Bundesbank would encounter technical difficulties
if the yield spread between the two rates went below 25 basis points.

GREECE
The market will react this week to expectations that the socialist
government will reverse its decision to impose a 15 per cent tax on
dividends of mutual funds that invest in Greek government securities, writes
Kerin Hope in Athens.
The move, included in a fiscal reform package announced last week, took
brokers by surprise as the finance ministry had stressed that interest on
government paper would remain entirely tax-free. Confidence was also
affected by the European Commission's decision to take legal action against
Greece for imposing a trade embargo against Macedonia. The general index
fell by 2.1 per cent last week.
However, the index is still 4.7 per cent up on last year. Trading volume
averaged Dr8.7bn (Dollars 35m) daily for the first quarter, three times the
1993 average. The flow of new listings and rights issues, led by
construction companies in search of fresh capital to finance infrastructure
projects included in a new European Union asistance package, shows no sign
of abating.
Listed companies have raised Dr51bn in fresh capital so far this year.
CHINA
Shanghai Automation Instrumentation has said that it plans a B share listing
on the Shanghai stock market with an issue of 70m shares for foreign
investors at 24.8 US cents each. The shares will go on offer on April 29.
The company is also offering some 32m shares to domestic investors. The
group said that it planned to use the proceeds to build construction
facilities for automatic control instruments in power stations. Trading in
the B shares is expected to start on May 12. Four of the largest state-owned
Chinese companies selected for listing outside China are seeking a listing
on the New York Stock Exchange. Two power supply companies and two regional
airlines, expected to raise between Dollars 250m and Dollars 500m each, have
signed up with US investment banks, according to industry executives.

FT  11 APR 94 / Emerging Investor: Politics and trade influence yen -
Currency Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The yen will be in the spotlight this week as investors seek to assess the
impact of the resignation last Friday of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese
prime minister.
Although the initial focus will be on the appointment of Mr Hosokawa's
successor, few analysts believe the change has serious policy implications.
The weakness and confusion within the ruling coalition makes it difficult to
predict when a successor will be appointed.
For the markets, two key issues arise from his departure: What will it mean
for the passage of the Japanese budget and what impact will it have on
Japan's trade dispute with the US.
The opposition LDP has recently blocked passage of the budget, delaying
implementation of a Y15.25 trillion fiscal stimulus. Failure to pass this
package will harm economic prospects, depress the stock market and probably
spill over into a weaker yen.
In recent months the dominant factor affecting the value of the yen has been
the trade dispute between Japan and the US.
Any indication of a deterioration in relations has tended to strengthen the
yen.
This week is likely to see a new development on the trade front, with the
GATT conference in Morocco expected to provide the forum for a resumption of
bilateral trade talks.
Elsewhere, a raft of US economic data, and the first Bundesbank council
meeting for four weeks, will shed further light on the prospect of a
decoupling of US and European financial markets.
US producer and consumer price figures will be carefully watched for hints
of inflation. Retail sales figures will also offer an indication of the
economy's strength.
Short of some very unexpected figure, most observers are not expecting any
change of policy before the next meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee on May 17.
Talk of a cut in the German discount rate has also receded as the recent
strength of the dollar has put the D-Mark under pressure.
The repo rate will continue to be trimmed, but analysts now favour the April
28 meeting of the Bundesbank to produce a cut in the discount rate.
Two European currencies that will be closely watched are the lira and the
escudo. Continued progress towards forming a new government in Italy will
bolster the lira further, pushing it below L950 against the D-Mark.
In Portugal, meanwhile, markets will be watching to see if the central bank
has successfully warded off the speculators who drove the currency lower
over the past two weeks.

FT  11 APR 94 / Emerging Investor: Indian issue faces uncertain reception -
The Emerging Investor

India's ability to tap the capital markets for the funds it needs to lift
itself from the ranks of the world's poorer nations faces an important test
this week.
Videsh Sanchar Nigam, the state-controlled international telecommunications
utility, wants to raise Dollars 1bn in Euro-equity in the biggest-ever
Indian issue and one of the largest global issues this year.
Salomon Brothers and Kleinwort Benson, the investment banks which are
co-global co-ordinators for the issue, are now holding roadshows for the
issue, taking in cities in east Asia, Europe and the US.
Six weeks ago the VSNL offering would almost certainly have been a roaring
success - probably priced at a premium to the prevailing Indian domestic
price and almost certainly oversubscribed. Such was the popularity then of
emerging markets. Now, fund managers have grown more cautious, partly
because of the worldwide correction in stock markets which followed
increases in US interest rates and partly because of a sharp decline in
Indian equities.
Euroissues have in the past year been the most important conduit of foreign
investment into India - accounting for some Dollars 2bn of a total inflow of
Dollars 5bn in the year to March. A further Dollars 1.5bn came from
portfolio investment in the Indian stock market. The performance of the VSNL
issue will significantly influence how much India is able to raise this
year.
'VSNL will be a very significant test for the market and it will be the
bellwether for GDRs for several reasons, because it is a lot bigger than the
other Indian GDRs, because it is a telecoms stock, and because it is a
government disinvestment,' says Mr Jeff Chowdhry, director at Barclays de
Zoete Wedd Investment Management, which recently raised Dollars 510m for its
India Fund.
VSNL as a company is still seen as having great merits, holding a monopoly
of basic international telecommunications in a large developing country
which is trying to integrate its economy with the rest of the world through
foreign trade and investment. In the year ending March 1993, it made
after-tax profits of Rs1.12bn on revenues of Rs7.47bn.
However, the 10 per cent decline in prices on the Bombay stock exchange
since the end of February has made pricing the VSNL issue difficult. Prices
have fallen for a combination of reasons of which the most important is that
a correction was due after a sustained rally which had seen shares double
from lows reached last spring.
Also, investors were disappointed that the government's 1994-95 budget,
announced in late February, did not fulfil the highest hopes of those who
wanted to see strong measures to promote growth. They were concerned too
about the potential impact on inflation of the government's failure to curb
public borrowing as effectively as it had promised.
Moreover, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets watchdog,
enforced a long-threatened ban on Badla - the informal forward market in
shares which accounts for about 75 per cent of all stock exchange trading.
Badla brings liquidity to the market, but is subject to frequent abuse and
price manipulation.
As Indian equities fell, so did Indian Euroissues, often faster and further
than the underlying shares. This was mainly because these international
offerings had usually been sold at a premium to the Indian market price. So
strong was the demand for Indian paper, and so difficult is it to negotiate
the tortuous intricacy of Indian domestic settlement systems, that fund
managers were ready to pay extra for the convenience of Europaper,
particularly in those cases where they lacked the necessary FII status
allowing direct investment in the stock market.
With a few exceptions those premia have now evaporated, and most Euroequity
issues trade at discounts of up to 15 per cent of the equivalent Indian
stock exchange price.
The turmoil put a month-long stop on Indian Euroissues, which ended only
last week as three companies started road-shows: VSNL, Calcutta Electric
Supply Corporation, which launched a GDR and warrant issue (hoping to raise
Dollars 89.25m based on Friday's pricing of Dollars 53.34 per unit of five
GDRs and two warrants and an additional Dollars 35m if the warrants are
exercised), and Tube Investments, an engineering group, seeking Dollars 50m
in equity.
CESC, which supplies electricity in Calcutta, has had a difficult time
coming to market. It parted company with its original lead manager,
Kleinwort Benson, after disagreements surfaced over the price and timing of
the issue. Kleinwort wanted to bring CESC to market after VSNL, but CESC
executives wanted to go first in case investors were swamped by the giant
VSNL offering.
Paribas Capital Markets of France secured the mandate, and is now wooing
investors at exactly the same time as VSNL. Both Kleinwort and CESC declined
to comment publicly on the dispute.
Despite the setbacks in emerging markets, investment bankers believe there
is still strong demand for well-priced companies with strong prospects.
Mr Nanavati of Standard Chartered says at least two recent Indian Euroissues
 -Indo-Gulf Fertilisers, a chemicals company belonging to the industrial
grouping headed by Mr Aditya Birla, and Videocon International, the leading
consumer electronics maker - have retained premia of more than 30 per cent
above the Indian stock market price. But both issues were
attractively-priced, and both companies are believed to have particularly
good growth prospects.
Mr Chowdhry of BZW says that dedicated India funds like his prefer to invest
directly in India, while international equity offerings tended to appeal
more to the non-specialist funds. However, even the specialist funds were
looking more closely at the GDRs once they fell to a discount.
Officials at the Indian finance ministry are keeping their fingers crossed
over the VSNL issue, not least because the government is the main
shareholder. If the issue flops, India's reputation could suffer. But, if
the shares are offered too cheaply to foreigners, the government could face
domestic political attacks.

FT  11 APR 94 / The Markets: Deflation, the biggest threat to Japan's
economy - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's spring pleasures - cherry blossoms, the start of the baseball
season, changing the prime minister - seem to have an uplifting effect on
the Japanese economy. In the last three years, the end of winter has been
marked by official figures apparently showing the end of the long recession.
But in the last two years, the revival has disappeared as quickly as the
cherry blossom itself. Will 1994 repeat the pattern?
In the first three months of 1992 gross domestic product grew at an
annualised rate of 2.4 per cent. But that was as far as the recovery got. In
the remaining three quarters of the year output contracted.
Last year the first quarter produced growth at an annualised rate of more
than 3 per cent. Again the recovery proved short-lived.
All the indications are that the first three months of 1994 will again give
rise to more vernal optimism. Consumption, housing starts and business
confidence have all been rising, and the first quarter GDP figures are
expected to show the familiar resumption of growth.
Unabashed by previous premature declarations of recovery, Mr Yasushi Mieno,
the Bank of Japan's governor, claimed last week that there is something
durable about this revival.
He pronounced the economy to be 'near the bottom' of the current cycle - not
jubilant rhetoric, but from the cautious Mr Mieno, a significantly more
upbeat assessment than previous judgments.
His remarks led to a flurry of selling in the bond market as investors took
them as a hint that the official discount rate, currently just 1.75 per
cent, might also have reached the bottom of its cycle.
However, the Japanese authorities are likely to look especially hard at the
evidence before concluding that the recession is really over, and adjusting
policy accordingly.
For the most significant threat to Japan's economy is not inflation, but its
opposite.
The risks of a lasting deflation are probably now greater in Japan than they
have been in any big industrial country since the Great Depression.
Falling asset prices have been a feature of the Japanese economy for the
last few years as the 'bubble economy' burst. At first that disinflation was
seen as an unwelcome but healthy corrective to the excesses of the financial
boom.
But now the virus has spread to the rest of the economy.
The core rate of consumer price inflation (excluding seasonal food prices)
is now down to 1 per cent. But taking the last three months compared with
the previous three, consumer prices have actually fallen by 1 per cent.
Even that may understate the extent of the deflation. The CPI's basket is
revised just once every five years, and since consumer spending patterns
have changed, the likelihood is that real inflation is even lower.
Wholesale prices have been falling for more than a year. In the year to
February they dropped by 3.1 per cent.
Wages are also flat. Though the recent shunto spring wage negotiations
resulted in 3 per cent wage increases, this disguises the real picture.
Bonuses represent as much as half of a worker's salary and have been cut, or
in many cases, cancelled this year. Last year total wages rose by 0.6 per
cent and the 1994 figure could be lower.
The yen's strength is making matters worse. The latest endaka, a 15 per cent
revaluation in the last year, is only now filtering into prices. Though it
will be a once and for all hike in the price level, the higher yen will
depress demand further.
Bank lending grew at an historically low rate of just 0.5 per cent in
January, and the money stock (M2 plus cds) spent most of 1993 falling.
In short, the conditions are in place for a classic, 1930s-style deflation,
a downward spiral of falling prices and falling demand which characterised
the Great Depression.
In a deflation firms have to cut prices to remain competitive in a push
downwards, reducing wages, and so demand, still further.
Falling prices depress consumption in other ways; consumers defer spending
as prices fall, hoping to benefit from future lower prices.
But it is the financial aspects of deflation that most threaten Japan at
present. Firms are already labouring under real interest rates of around 4 5
per cent, even though nominal rates are at an all-time low.
Worst of all is the spectre of real debt inflation - the real value of
companies and individuals' debt is rising. The recession has forced
companies which borrowed heavily in the 1980s to strengthen their balance
sheets. Yet debt-laden firms now find that the real cost of servicing their
debt is rising.
Net debt to income ratios have fallen in the last few years, yet the number
of bad debts carried by the banks has risen sharply. If the real debt burden
were to rise again, the already weakened financial sector would be further
handicapped.
This may sound alarmist to a world weaned on the perils of inflation. Isn't
a bit of deflation merely a beneficial side effect of Japan's depressed
demand?
A feature of the post war economy has been relatively low inflation. Some
argue that the severity of the current recession has simply produced a huge
output gap - the difference between actual ouput and potential output - 10
per cent by some estimates. In those circumstances low inflation - even by
Japanese standards - is only to be expected.
But a deflation acts more like a spiral than a cycle. When an economy gets
pulled into such a vortex, counter-cyclical stabilisers may not be
effective.
Until now, the Bank of Japan has pursued an accommodatory monetary policy -
with the lowest nominal interest rates in the world.
But the real deflationary pressures at work in the economy mean that policy
is tightening by default.
Another spring glimmer of recovery may tempt the Bank to keep rates where
they are. If it does, this upturn may prove to be as durable as the average
Japanese prime minister.

FT  11 APR 94 / The Markets: Fighting off the spectral bear - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The coming week may be crucial in establishing whether the recent bounce in
US bond and equity markets signals an end to their sharp slide - at least in
the short run - or was merely a respite from bearish forces.
Last Tuesday's 82 point jump in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and its
further advances later in the week, certainly had many of the classic
characteristics of a market turning point, with an avalanche of anxious
selling suddenly switching to a surge of bargain-hunting buying.
The rebound was also statistically very tidy: a wide array of analysts had
forecast a 10 per cent market correction, and lo, the market turned after a
9.7 per cent drop - right in line with the historical average for a market
correction, both in scale and duration.
But relying on history can be dangerous, and this comforting picture could
be a little too neat. Certainly, Friday's market reversal demonstrated how
closely sentiment in the equity sector remains tied to continued nervousness
among bond traders over the prospects for growth and inflation, and the
possibility of further tightening by the Fed, at or before its May 17 policy
meeting.
This week fixed income desks have to weather a barrage of statistical data,
ranging from the consumer and producer price indices, which should give
comfort to the market, to figures for retail sales, business inventories and
industrial production, any one of which could spook traders if they are so
minded.
Still, the first quarter corporate results season beginning this week should
at least remind equity investors that the US economic outlook remains
remarkably benign, promising solid growth of 3 to 4 per cent, strong
productivity gains, and an annual inflation rate of 3 per cent or less.
Corporate profits in many sectors are likely to be up 10 to 15 per cent this
year, with double digit gains possibly extending to the end of 1995.
The Fed's tightening has had the beneficial effect of knocking a lot of
froth off a market which at the start of the year was beginning to look
dangerously overstretched.
It now looks much closer to fair value, judged by traditional yardsticks.
For example, Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs reckons the S&amp;P 500 is
selling at roughly 14 times 1994 operating earnings per share, whereas in
previous periods when inflation was 3.5 per cent or less, the average p/e
was 16.4. A further dip to, or below, the recent trough would throw up
attractive buying opportunities.
Mutual funds
The strength of the US equity market over the next few weeks will depend in
substantial part on the behaviour of the individual investors who have
poured cash into mutual funds over the past two years - and are now
suffering their first serious reversal.
In the wake of the Fed's February tightening, the first phase of the market
correction was driven mainly by market professionals - investment bank
trading desks and the overly maligned hedge funds, which were forced to
liquidate holdings to reduce their leverage. Fund managers window dressing
portfolios at the end of the first quarter also played a part.
Small equity investors remained reasonably sanguine, in part because until
two weeks ago the brunt of the market's decline was borne by the fixed
income sector. The latest statistics suggest there is still a net inflow to
equity mutual funds, albeit at a rate much reduced from the start of this
year, and there are signs of some movement back into the safe haven of money
market funds.
But will these investors will remain quite so relaxed when their fund
managers' first quarter performance statements pop through the letterbox?
The concern is probably overdone. First, small American investors have grown
used to large market swings since the 1987 crash. Second, the overwhelming
weight of professional advice, reaching them from brokers and media pundits,
is that they are not witnessing a prolonged bear market and that they should
avoid selling at the bottom.
Third, with short-term interest rates still very low in real terms, money
market accounts have limited allure, though that will gradually change as
the Fed goes on tightening.
A gradual shift back to money market accounts could exert some drag on
equities, but it is arguable that this will be offset by increased buying of
US equities from corporate pension funds and foreign investors, attracted by
the expanding economy and likelihood of a strengthening dollar.
Mexico
The recovery in US equities last week was mirrored in Chile and Argentina,
which were among the many emerging markets to take a nose-dive after the
Fed's February tightening. But notably absent from this Latin bounce was
Mexico, where stocks fell sharply on the week.
The Mexican market is now down some 25 per cent from its highs of early
February, as domestic political turmoil has reinforced the bearish
sentiments from across the Rio Grande.
Investor nervousness following the peasant rebellion in Chiapas and the
killing of Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate for the ruling PRI
party, have combined with rising US interest rates to put pressure on the
Peso and force short-term interest rates up sharply.
That, in turn, has analysts revising downwards their estimates for GDP
growth, with some cutting a half a percentage point off figures which
previously ranged from about 2.5 to 4 per cent.
Nor is there much hope of an early end to the political uncertainty, amid
growing evidence that Colosio's death was the result of a conspiracy, rather
than the action of a lone gunman, and continued rumblings from Chiapas.
The PRI's new presidential candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, who belongs to the
party's economic reformist wing, still seems likely to win the August 21
election, though that remains far from cer-tain, given that he has never
held elective office and the party's old guard dislikes him.
Geoffrey Dennis of Bear, Stearns does not see an imminent return to the kind
of virtuous economic and political circle which would substantially lift the
market, but argues that the uncertainty is simply delaying an eventual
upturn from the recent recession.
'Once you get recovery, and the North American Free Trade Agreement also
starts to kick back in, you logically set off on a four, five, six-year
period of sustained growth.'
Provided, of course, that the political upheavals in the first few months of
this year are not merely scratching the surface of more violent political
divisions, which have yet to emerge.
Australian dollar
The price of gold, which rose sharply in March on inflation fears and South
African violence, could move closer to the Dollars 400 mark over the next
few weeks if the run-up to South Africa's election in late April produce
more serious clashes between Zulu forces and the ANC. But given the
influence of South African politics on the metal, is it sensible to use the
gold price as an indicator of inflation psychology, as Mr Alan Greenspan,
the chairman of the Fed, said he was doing recently?
David Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial Services, argues that Mr
Greenspan should be paying more attention to the Australian dollar as a
barometer of inflationary expectations over the next few months: 'Most
international investors regard it as a good proxy for global inflation
trends because commodities account for about 80 per cent of Australia's
exports and commodity producing companies account for over one third of the
country's stock market capitalisation.'
What does its recent performance show? The currency rose sharply in
late-1993 but since the Fed tightened it has been in a trading range below
its January peak, suggesting that the Fed's tightening has successfully
dampened inflationary fears.

FT  11 APR 94 / International Company News: Race for control of Banesto
enters final lap
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The race to take control of Banesto, the troubled Spanish bank which the
authorities will auction to the highest bidder at the begining of next
month, has entered its final lap.
At the weekend Banco Central Hispano (BCH), which owns the biggest domestic
bank network, indicated it was not interested in Banesto. Argentaria, the
state-controlled financial group, said that it was, and Banco Zaragozano, a
medium-sized bank, spoke up for the smaller institutions saying it and
others like it might link with a larger group in a joint bid.
Mr Jose Maria Amusategui, BCH chairman, said a bid for Banesto was
'unlikely'. He told the bank's annual meeting: 'We should not divert our
attention from the merger process (BCH is the result of the 1991 union
between Banco Central and Banco Hispano Americano) and, much less, take on
risks.'
Mr Francisco Luzon , Argentaria's chairman, told shareholders the bank had
decided to study a bid for Banesto 'with the utmost detail'. He told the
annual meeting he was open to a single or joint presentation with other
institutions.
Banco Zaragozano shareholders, also at the annual meeting at the weekend,
were told that talks were being held with other medium-sized banks to form a
consortium with a larger bank to bid at the Banesto auction.
Banco Santander, the most profitable, and most internationally-based, of the
big domestic banks, officially kept quiet at the weekend as did a rival
contender in the auction, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. BBV, the second-ranked bank
in terms of size, lent its senior executives to manage Banesto following its
intervention by the Bank of Spain at the end of last year.
The bidding banks have little time left in which to make up their minds.
Under the terms of the auction they must declare their intentions, and also
any consortia arrangements, on April 18. They must deliver their final bids
a week later. The Bank of Spain is due to announce a decision on the auction
on May 9.

FT  11 APR 94 / International Company News: Crackdown on spread of futures
in China
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China has cracked down on the proliferation of futures markets and traders,
placing a ban on the establishment of new markets and requiring brokers to
re-register with the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
The State Council (cabinet) order tightening controls over fledgling futures
markets reflects growing official alarm at the spread of poorly regulated
exchanges and risks of substantial losses for inexperienced traders.
Mr Zhu Li, a spokesman for the CSRC, the industry watchdog, warned that
'rushed experiments could incur economic losses and even result in social
unrest'.
Some 30 futures markets and wholesale trading centres have sprung up in
China in the past year or so, including commodities' futures exchanges for
metals, cereals and petroleum located in Shanghai.
Representatives of the larger exchanges have been calling for national
regulation to govern futures markets, but these have been slow to appear.
Mr Zhu said some 500 futures trading corporations have emerged in China in
the past two years of which about 200 are unregistered.
The CSRC has been asked to 'closely review' all futures markets and report
to the State Council on its findings. Those given approval will be obliged
to re-register with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce.
All futures brokers, including Sino-foreign joint ventures, of which there
are about 50, will also be obliged to re-register with the CSRC.
The State Council directive also made clear that stricter controls would be
placed on state-owned enterprises engaging in futures trading. Law
enforcement agencies would be banned from speculating in the futures
markets.
The authorities have banned the use of bank credits in futures trading.
Trading in currency futures without permission has also been banned.

Addressing a shareholders' meeting called to approve the absorbtion of
Matra-Hachette, the missiles to magazines group, into Lagardere, the
chairman also indicated his company would play a role in the privatisation
of Renault, the state-owned car group.
Mr Lagardere confirmed Matra-Hachette achieved net profits of about FFr620m
(Dollars 108m) last year, in line with estimates, and confirmed net profits
at Lagardere of FFr154m. Lagardere Groupe now has a 93.4 per cent stake in

FT  11 APR 94 / International Company News: Ford Motor chief senses a sea
change - John Griffiths examines the group's attempt to become a truly
global force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In less than a fortnight Ford Motor's chairman, Mr Alex Trotman, and his
most senior colleagues will be assembling in Toronto to take stock of Ford's
accelerating drive to become a truly global company - and the restructuring
needed to achieve it.
Even at the opening of the New York motor show at the end of last week, Mr
Trotman was playing down mounting media speculation that major management
and other organisational upheavals were imminent as an integral part of that
drive.
But even though the Toronto meeting is unlikely to result in dramatic
headlines - as in the case of the boardroom coup at General Motors, which
saw the ousting of former chairman Robert Stempel - Mr Trotman makes clear
Ford is undergoing a sea-change which will dramatically alter the nature of
its operations by the end of the decade.
'If you're expecting something fantastic to happen at Toronto you'll be
wasting a lot of air fares coming,' Mr Trotman hinted to the pressmen in New
York. 'It's a closed-door management meeting where traditionally we discuss
our problems, such as who's not performing properly. What we call a woodshed
meeting.'
Nevertheless, he admits that part of the speculation has been caused by
'leaks' from study teams, which, he acknowledges 'we've been working on for
quite some while now on how to improve effectiveness - and yes, some of this
we may discuss at the Toronto meeting'.
Mr Trotman was in New York formally to launch the Contour, the North
American version of what Ford intends to be its first 'world' car, after the
failure of an earlier programme to create a Ford Escort 'world car' at the
beginning of the 1980s.
The Contour's European counterpart, the Mondeo, has been on sale for a year.
Ford has spent Dollars 6bn on the project. Much of this is on production and
research and development which will stand it in good stead for future world
projects.
A second 'world' project is already under way, at least in the sense that
work is proceeding apace on the basic body platform on which the next new
range of cars will be built and which is code-named DEW98.
While Mr Trotman insists that 'no final decisions have been made', it is
this platform which is expected to provide the basis for an intended 'small'
Jaguar and a replacement for the Granada/Scorpio in Europe, as well as a new
mid-size range of cars for Ford's core North American market.
However, it was Mr Trotman's thoughts about how the next Ford Escort may be
developed which illustrates in most startling terms what Ford's concept of a
truly 'global' company means - and how it may extend even to making Mazda of
Japan, in which Ford has a 25 per cent stake, a core part of the strategy.
'The next generation (of the Ford Escort) might mean that we have one
development for Ford and Mazda worldwide,' says Mr Trotman.
Both the European Escort and the similarly named but separately developed
North American model will be updated between now and 1998, and these
modernisations do not form part of the global programme.' In that sense,
1998 is already history,' says Mr Trotman.
'But early into the next century it might be that if Ford developed a common
platform for the Escort for Ford and Mazda to use worldwide, it could free
up resources at Mazda to do other things. That's the whole strength of the
global approach. Traditionally Europe and North America would have designed
unique replacements.'
Ford's thinking, already far down the road of discussions with Mazda - where
Ford recently significantly strengthened its board presence - is that
European operations, with their small car expertise, would lead the
development of a truly global Escort, to be built for all markets by both
Ford and Mazda.
This would free not only North American Ford operations to develop
complementary 'world' models using their larger car expertise - but would
allow Mazda to concentrate on parallel development of other, possibly niche
products like minivans or multi-purpose vehicles.
'It would give the companies a broader product range - essentially more
firepower for the same number of battles,' says Mr Trotman. 'The new Escort
would be basically a Ford of Europe design. And while the European teams
were doing that, American teams would be creating a new Windstar van,
Explorer off-roader, new Taurus car . . . all sorts of things.'
Mr Trotman insists a decision on whether the small Jaguar will be built in
the US or Europe is still months away. However, he warned that the strong
British connotations of Jaguar may no longer count for much. 'But he
appeared to lay to rest fears that further substantial restructuring might
still await its European operations: 'Europe is performing well. We've got
through what had to be done; it's behind us and Europe is in a stable
condition now.'
He also flagged Ford's intention substantially to increase its manufacturing
presence in Asia, particularly Taiwan, China and Indian. He predicted that
sales in the region will triple in the next 15 years, worth 'several million
units' to the major motor makers.

FT  11 APR 94 / International Company News: Neste trims deficit to FM1.52bn
for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Neste, the Finnish state-owned oil and petrochemicals group, announced a
FM1.52bn (Dollars 278m) pre-tax deficit for 1993, a 31 per cent reduction on
losses of FM2.22bn a year earlier.
Mr Jaakko Ihamuotila, group chief executive, predicted the group would be
back in profit in 1994, adding that its balance sheet would strengthen.
The company is benefiting from a recovery plan, launched last April, which
has brought asset sales, lower investments, cost-cutting, and reductions in
personnel.
The 1993 figures were hit by a sharp slump in oil prices, high interest
costs, and recession in the Finnish economy.
'No positive upswing has taken place in Neste's operating environment,' it
stated. It blamed an 'exceptionally low international oil price' for hitting
profits within its main oil businesses, adding that oil consumption had
fallen by 4.3 per cent in Finland during the year.
'Petrochemical and plastic prices remained at 1992's depressed levels and
international refining margins continued to be slim,' it stated.
Higher sales in all divisions helped lift group net sales by 9.9 per cent to
FM63.1bn. Oil sales rose 6.6 per cent to FM49.1bn and chemicals rose 19 per
cent to FM12bn.
There was an operating profit of FM540m, against a FM227m loss in 1992, but
net financial charges of FM2.06bn wiped this out at the pre-tax level.

FT  11 APR 94 / International Company News: First-quarter loss for Alcoa due
to charge
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Alcoa, the world's largest aluminium producer, reported improved operating
results for the first quarter, but a Dollars 117.9m extraordinary charge
left the company with an overall loss.
The group, battling against the debilitating effects of sagging world
aluminium prices, has been cutting costs and trimming production. Its first
quarter operating improvement was attributed to cost-cutting and slightly
higher aluminium prices.
It said operating earnings, excluding charges, rose to Dollars 9.6m, or 10
cents per share, in the quarter, a turnround from a fourth-quarter loss of
Dollars 16.7m but well below first quarter 1993 earnings of Dollars 27.6m,
or 31 cents per share. First-quarter revenue rose to Dollars 2.2bn, from
Dollars 2.1bn in the same period last year.
Including the extraordinary items, Alcoa suffered a loss of Dollars 108.3m,
or Dollars 1.22 a share, in the first quarter. The previously announced
special charges included Dollars 50m for closing a California forging plant
and Dollars 67.9m for early redemption of high-interest debt.
The company took Dollars 70.2m in restructuring charges in the fourth
quarter of 1993, and in February announced it would cut US aluminium output
by 100,000 per year in an effort by producers to boost prices.

forex loss

<TEXT>
The president of Kashima Oil, a Japanese refiner, has said he would resign
to take responsibility for the company's loss of Y152.5bn (Dollars 1.5bn) in
foreign exchange forward transactions.
The loss is the second biggest in foreign exchange forward transactions
after a Y166.3bn loss incurred by Showa Shell Sekiyu early last year. Its
reflects the vulnerable position of Japanese oil companies which have huge
foreign currency needs in the face of fluctuating currency markets.
Mr Hachiro Obata, the president, resigned over the weekend after the oil
refiner's loss was made public.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which last year launched
an investigation into the effect of forward contracts on oil companies after
Showa Shell's loss, plans to investigate Kashima. The ministry said its
investigation would not affect Kashima's normal business.
Kashima, an unlisted oil refiner with facilities in Kashima city north-east
of Tokyo, is 25 per cent owned by Japan Energy, a mining development and
petroleum refining company. Other leading shareholders include Mitsubishi
Petroleum, also with 25 per cent and Cosmo Oil, with 22 per cent.
The company's foreign exchange loss far exceeds its capitalisation of Y20bn,
so it will have to seek capital injections from major shareholders, as well
as assistance from the Industrial Bank of Japan, its main bank. Japan Energy
said it was in talks with the company on a rescue package.

invite shareholders to take part in the second tranche of its Pounds 248m
rights issue to fund the takeover of Westland Group.
The move signals GKN's confidence that its revised 335p cash offer will be
accepted this week by M&amp;G and Schroders, which together control more than 25
per cent of the helicopter manufacturer.
Their acceptance would push the engineering group's holding beyond the 75
per cent barrier required to trigger the second half of the rights issue.
Last month GKN received acceptances for 90.9 per cent of the first part of
the issue - involving more than 52m units of non interest-bearing
convertible loan stock - payable in two equal instalments of 240p.
Sir David Lees, the GKN chairman, announced the fund-raising two months ago
when he launched the hostile bid for Westland. The Yeovil-based company
rejected the initial bid, priced at 290p per ordinary share, saying it
undervalued order prospects and potential profits.
Two weeks ago, however, it reluctantly recommended a revised offer which
valued the group at Pounds 577m.

FT  11 APR 94 / UK Company News: Queue forms to bid for Chunnel rail link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is aware of about six consortia planning to bid for the
Channel Tunnel rail link, officials said yesterday.
Bovis, the construction subsidiary of P&amp;O, Ove Arup, the consulting
engineer, and Eurorail, which includes Trafalgar House and BICC, are all
among those groups expected to submit tenders.
The Department of Transport would not comment on names, but said yesterday
that it had received initial expressions of interest from about 30 groups,
of which half a dozen were expected to submit plans.
Pre-qualification proposals must be submitted by April 25, and a decision on
the groups which will be allowed to submit full tenders will be made in
June. These must be completed by the end of the year.
The Pounds 2.7bn 68-mile link between London's St Pancras station and the
Channel Tunnel is expected to be the largest joint public-private sector
construction project this decade.

Kingspan Group, the County Cavan-based building components manufacturer,
showed a marked upturn in 1993 helped by increased sales in both its metal
faced composite panels and flexible faced insulation boards.
Profits before tax in the 12 months to end-December jumped to IPounds 3.1m
(Pounds 2.98m), compared with IPounds 1.38m in 1992 and IPounds 2.56m in
1992.
The activities mentioned above contributed 71 per cent of total sales of
IPounds 61.2m (IPounds 53.1m) and strengthened their position in the market.
An increased final dividend of 1.5p is recommended, making a total of 2.5p
(2.2p) for the year.
Earnings per share advanced to 9.7p (3.8p).

FT  11 APR 94 / UK Company News: Companies slightly more optimistic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Britain's small and medium-sized businesses are only slightly more
optimistic about their prospects than they were six months ago, but there
has been a big improvement in confidence in Spain, according to a survey by
3i and Cranfield School of Management.
Expectations have also improved in France, where sentiment mirrors that seen
in the UK a year ago. According to the survey, this suggests that French
companies can expect their economy to strengthen in the second half of 1994.
There has been some improvement in German confidence over the past six
months, but most companies remain pessimistic about prospects.
In the UK there has been a 50 per cent rise in companies seeking external
finance.

FT  11 APR 94 / UK Company News: Hays buys Rockall Scotia Resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hays, the business services group, is paying Pounds 20m for Rockall Scotia
Resources, a records storage and data management company primarily serving
the oil exploration industry.
The deal will make Hays the market leader in oil records storage ahead of
British Data Management.
In 1993 it had turnover of Pounds 15.4m, nearly half of which was generated
overseas, and made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.1m.
In addition to its oil industry business, Rockall has been expanding into
local government and healthcare markets, and has a large contract with the
Inland Revenue.
Mr Ronnie Frost, Hays chairman, said the combined business would be well
placed to take advantage of the government's policy of contracting out
services such as data storage. 'Rockall's successful overseas subsidiaries
will also provide Hays with a springboard from which to expand its records
management services overseas.'

FT  11 APR 94 / UK Company News: Intermediate Capital has flotation value of
Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intermediate Capital Group, the niche provider of mezzanine finance to
unquoted companies, is to float late next month in a placing and
intermediaries offer that will value it at more than Pounds 100m.
The flotation will raise about Pounds 30m, some Pounds 18m of which will
repay existing preference holders.
ICG was formed in 1989 and is Europe's largest specialist provider of
mezzanine funds, a layer of finance that lies between equity and debt in
terms of risk and reward.
The core business is lending to UK management buy-outs, where demand has
been steady, and to buy-outs in continental Europe where there has been
'strong' growth in demand this year, according to Mr Tom Bartlam, one of
four founders and managing director.
The group is also aiming to lend more to companies seeking development
capital, but which do not need to pay the high cost implicit in issuing
equity.
ICG prices its loans at about 4 per cent over Libor but enhances its return
to between 16 and 20 per cent by receiving warrants or a redemption premium.
In January ICG also started managing funds for third parties when Postel
provided the group with Pounds 20m to invest alongside its own funds in the
mezzanine market. Postel bought a 20 per cent stake, most of it from Westpac
Banking, the Australian group.
ICG is likely to be regarded by institutions as a yield stock, unlike
Mithras, the mezzanine investment trust floated last month by Legal &amp;
General Ventures. 'We are run for profit and not assets growth,' Mr Bartlam
says. 'We are more a quasi-bank than a quasi-investment trust.' Its main
competition comes from banks such as NatWest, Samuel Montagu and Kleinwort
Benson.
In the year to January 31, ICG had operating income of Pounds 20.6m, of
which Pounds 11.1m represented gains on the disposal of shares in companies
that had floated. The previous year's income was Pounds 12.5m, of which
Pounds 5.5m was disposal gains.
ICG recognises that pre-tax profits will be volatile because it has no
control over when its investments float. Mr Bartlam said ICG would be
looking to pay a growing dividend from core income, while capital gains
would strengthen the balance sheet for more lending.
The four founding shareholders will retain about 80 per cent of their stakes
and hold between 10 and 15 per cent of the company after the float.

FT  11 APR 94 / UK Company News: Aegis directors expected to quit -
Shareholder pressure grows for top board changes as big write-offs revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Up to three directors of Aegis, the London-based holding company of Europe's
largest media buying and planning group, are expected to depart in the next
few months following growing shareholder pressure.
The details emerged as the company was preparing to reveal exceptional
write-offs of up to Pounds 40m in its 1993 results, due on Thursday.
Underlying performance is expected to be in line with City forecasts, but
the company is likely to report a substantial one-off charge for the
restructuring arranged with Warburg Pincus, the US investment firm which
owns 32 per cent of the company.
Aegis has come under criticism from analysts and investors for the strongly
French management of a company that has increasingly diversified its
operations and profits away from that country and is now listed only in
London.
Mr Michel Lefebvre, chief financial officer, is believed to be among those
departing, and headhunters are seeking out replacements for him and a
further two directors.
In addition, Mr Charles Hochman, the chief executive officer, may retire by
the end of next year.
Several dozen further redundancies of senior staff from the French
operations are expected to be announced shortly, in addition to about 300
job losses that have occurred in the past few months.
Last week the company announced its intention to move from its lavish
headquarters in Avenue Raphael in central Paris to La Defense within the
next two months.
The move will cost Aegis several million pounds in outstanding lease
payments and write-offs of expensive fixtures and fittings. Last year the
company also sold its two corporate jets.
Further exceptional write-offs of more than Pounds 10m are likely to be
shown in the accounts as a result of a restatement of the cost of the
company's Pounds 102m in bonds and loan stock which were part of the
refinancing last October.
Recasting the figures in the accounts using FRS 4, the new financial
reporting standard on capital instruments, would trigger debt interest
payments on Eurobonds of nearly Pounds 7m and refinancing costs of more than
Pounds 3m.

<TEXT>
The UK's second largest supermarket group is expected to announce tomorrow a
fall in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 581m to Pounds 520m-Pounds 530m,
after new depreciation policies but before one-off charges.
The figures for the year to February will reflect the impact of the group's
decision - announced in January - to start depreciating stores, which will
take Pounds 36m off reported profits, and land premiums, removing another
Pounds 32m. There will also be a one-off write-down of Pounds 85m on land
values.
On a headline basis - after all charges - the pre-tax figure is estimated at
Pounds 435m-Pounds 445m. On the old basis analysts believe profits would
have increased to Pounds 590m-Pounds 600m.

Burmah Castrol, the lubricants, chemicals and fuels group, is expected to
report 1993 pre-tax profits of about Pounds 186m today, up from Pounds
179.6m.
Trading has been tough in Germany, which accounts for about 20 per cent of
group business, but recession in Europe should have been counterbalanced by
more favourable conditions elsewhere. Following an enhanced scrip dividend
at the interim stage, analysts think the final dividend could rise by more
than 10 per cent.

FT  11 APR 94 / ASB tackles property lease gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Accounting Standards Board is expected to recommend changes to the
reporting of company profits from property leases, in the wake of heavy
losses incurred by Pentos, the speciality retailer.
Pentos, which includes Dillons bookstores and the Athena poster shops chain,
expanded rapidly during the recession. The Dillons chain received
substantial payments from landlords for taking on long-term leases. These
payments, known as reverse premiums, were then included in general profits.
Pentos would have reported a loss in 1992 if it had not had the benefit of
Pounds 6.3m in reverse premiums.
The company recently announced that it had lost Pounds 71m in 1993, passed
its dividend and launched a Pounds 45m rights issue.
Now the ASB is considering how the practice of reporting profits on reverse
premiums can be altered. Any move would also affect many other retailers
which have expanded in recent years. The ASB said that an 'urgent issues'
ruling may be published in the next two months.
Detailed proposals are still being discussed, but changes may include
forcing companies to spread the benefit of any initial payment from
landlords over the first five years of the lease. The ASB is also debating
whether to require companies to state explicitly the amount they have
received in reverse premiums. Treatment of other incentives, such as
landlords' contributions to shop fittings, may also be affected.
The review was welcomed by investment analysts. Mr John Richards, retail
analyst at NatWest Securities, commented: 'There is nothing wrong per se
with retailers taking advantage of landlords' offers, they would be silly
not to do so. What can be wrong and dangerous is if such financial
inducements lead to over-expansion and the distortion of financial
performance.'
NatWest Securities sparked controversy when it first drew attention to a
potential problem with reverse premiums at Pentos. Now, in new research
published today, the broker argues that many other retailing companies may
have benefited from the reverse premium incentives.
Retailers have also enjoyed rent-free periods on new stores. These, too, may
have boosted income in an unsustainable way with a sharp drop in profits
occurring once the full rent becomes payable.

FT  11 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Mishaps unlikely to tarnish
improvement - Gold Fields
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The ritual of South African gold mines' quarterly results kicks off tomorrow
with the publication of the latest figures for Gold Fields of South Africa.
After displaying improved results for the first six months, following a
four-year slide in earnings, the company's third-quarter numbers - along
with those of most of the other big mining houses over the next two weeks -
are expected to follow this favourable trend.
Nevertheless, analysts note that Gold Fields has been hampered by recent
mishaps at key mines, including a shaft accident at Kloof and fires at
Driefontein, the country's most profitable gold mine, although they do not
feel this will significantly affect the overall picture.
Offsetting this, the company will have benefited from its aversion to
forward hedging, which has allowed it to take advantage of the improved spot
price for gold, the effects of which have been magnified by a steady decline
of the rand against the dollar.
Overall, the results are likely to be in line with the previous quarter's
after-tax profits of R387.7m (Dollars 110m).
A recent R6m judgment against Gold Fields for unfair dismissals may affect
the results. Longer term, given Gold Fields' traditionally confrontational
labour relations, some analysts are wary of its prospects under a probable
African National Congress government.

FT  11 APR 94 / Ford and Mazda plan 'global' car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford Motor, which has just launched the North American version of its Mondeo
'world car', is considering with Mazda of Japan a more far-reaching 'global'
car project.
Ford's European engineering departments would lead the development of a
replacement for the Ford Escort range which would be built and sold by both
Ford and Mazda from early in the next century.
Ford and Mazda would use common sourcing of components, from wherever they
could be supplied most cost-effectively. The cars would have cosmetic
differences - as with the Mondeo and its North American counterpart the
Contour - but would share under-the-skin components such as engine and
gearbox.
Ford has collaborated with Mazda before on car projects, but this is the
first time that any two manufacturers have contemplated such a development
on a global scale. Its significance goes beyond economies of scale. Ford
envisages that both Mazda's and Ford's north American styling and
engineering resources could be focused more efficiently on complementary
projects.
Mazda would develop niche products, such as sports cars and multi-purpose
vehicles for both itself and Ford, while Ford's North American engineers
would use their expertise in larger cars to develop similar 'world' cars for
Ford and Mazda.

FT  11 APR 94 / Biotech Trust falls far short of Pounds 100m goal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rothschild Asset Management has raised less than half the original target
for its International Biotechnology Trust with the placing of shares with
institutions attracting only Pounds 35m to Pounds 40m.
The poor uptake came close to scuppering the launch but Rothschild is
pressing ahead with the issue. The public offer opens this week.
Rothschild and sponsor Robert Fleming originally set a target of up to
Pounds 100m with a quarter of the issue available to private investors.
The poor response is the latest sign of 'investor fatigue' in the face of
the continuing flood of new issues and follows a number of disappointing
investment trust launches.
Morgan Grenfell managed to raise only Pounds 64m for its Latin American
Companies Trust, compared with a target of Pounds 100m, and the total for
Edinburgh Fund Managers' similar Inca trust was also below expectations.
Many biotechnology stocks have fallen sharply in recent weeks, leaving
several recently floated companies trading well below their offer prices,
and at least one biotechnology flotation has been postponed indefinitely.
But the disappointing response to the Rothschild launch appears to be the
result more of general market conditions than sentiment towards the
biotechnology sector.
In spite of the Rothschild team's good record with its existing
Biotechnology Investments fund, the amount raised for the new trust in the
institutional placing was barely above the minimum needed for its strategy
to be viable. The trust plans to take stakes of Pounds 5m-Pounds 10m in
biotechnology companies by injecting new capital and aims to make between 15
and 20 separate investments.
The low uptake threatens the managers' ability to create a reasonably
balanced portfolio, which was presented as one of its key attractions for
investors in an inherently risky sector. This could still be achieved by
raising bank borrowings, although the pathfinder prospectus states that 'the
directors do no intend that the company should borrow to finance portfolio
investments on a long-term basis'.

FT  11 APR 94 / Ambiguous signals in a volatile market: Robert Corzine finds
that low oil prices are provoking an ideological debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arguments over the direction of oil prices have taken on the tone of an
almost philosophical debate on whether a symbolic barrel of oil is half full
or half empty.
Optimists, having taken heart at last week's price rally sparked off by the
entry of hedge and commodity funds into oil futures' markets, say current
price levels are too low. They point to the fact that, in real terms, oil
prices at the Dollars 13-Dollars 14 level for the benchmark Brent Blend are
about the same as before the first oil shock in 1973.
And current prices, they add, do not reflect oil's special status as a
scarce and strategic commodity. Low prices simply reflect a temporary glut
caused by a surge in production from countries such as the UK and Norway
which are outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
That view is one which both Opec oil ministers and the chairmen of western
oil companies like to hear. But it is one which the more thoughtful among
them may no longer believe.
As a recent report from brokers Societe Generale Strauss Turnball put it:
'Throughout the history of the world oil industry, one of the few constants
. . . is the tendency for producers in aggregate to supply more than the
market can bear . . . The underlying and inherent tendency is for oil prices
to decline over time.'
The present volatility in oil markets is as much a reflection of the
ideological divide within the industry, as the consequence of short-term
shifts in the supply/demand balance. And that volatility is likely to
increase in coming months as the implications of Opec's present policy and
the presence in the markets of the hedge funds become clearer.
The prospect of additional abrupt price swings is now a very real one
because of the market's uncertainty over the future strategy of the funds.
Mr Robert Mabro, of the Oxford Centre for Energy Research, says: 'They are a
new factor in the oil price picture,' and one which will make 'predicting
price movements even more difficult.'
The presence of the funds also means that oil prices in New York and London
will be influenced by events in other markets. Mr Mabro notes that the
withdrawal of the funds from oil markets late last year in search of
opportunities in rising stock and bond markets accelerated the fall in oil
prices.
'The question now,' according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates in
Paris, 'is whether fund managers will hold their positions until market
fundamentals improve . . . or whether they will sell off if near-term prices
weaken, thereby adding to market volatility.'
The volatility had already been enhanced by Opec's decision to maintain its
24.52m barrels a day production ceiling for the rest of the year.
The second quarter of the year is usually the time when Opec makes the
deepest cuts in output because of weak demand due to the end of the northern
hemisphere winter. Opec delegates at the meeting in Geneva last month
conceded that the strategy of rolling over the production ceiling could
weaken prices in the short-term, although they claimed that rising demand
would lead to a balanced market later in the year.
Mr Mabro points out, however, that 'balanced markets don't rise. If you want
a price rise, your strategy should be to unbalance the market.' He also
believes Opec's policy will lead to considerable price volatility well
beyond the second quarter. 'If you fix the volume for a long time you get
increased volatility with any changes in demand,' he says.
Another factor which could affect prices in the longer term is the apparent
willingness of oil markets to question the degree to which Opec producers
deserve the considerable 'rent' they earn even at today's prices. With
production costs of only a dollar or two per barrel in many of the Gulf
states, the profit margins from most Opec producers are substantial. The
entry of the funds into the oil futures' markets has been interpreted by
some as a sign that irrespective of long-term movements, short-term price
trends may now be upwards. But many traders warn against reading too much
into the timing of the funds' move.
'They (the funds) were just scrambling around for a market where the prices
were low,' and where they saw an opportunity to manipulate the market, said
one oil company trader in London. 'They just caught everyone unawares.'

FT  11 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Disposals create platform for
continental push - Forte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte's figures for the year to January, to be announced on Thursday, cover
an eventful period for the UK's leading hotels group. A successful disposal
programme has left it poised to pursue expansion into continental Europe,
where its efforts have been rather less successful.
Disposal gains will distort the headline figures, but underlying pre-tax
profits are expected to rise from Pounds 71m to Pounds 85m-Pounds 90m -
after a reduced interest bill that still stands at roughly Pounds 100m.
Profits from continental Europe are expected to be unchanged, with good
improvements from the UK hotels.
Analysts will be eager to hear about trends in rates and occupancy levels,
but some are concerned about the effects on US visitors of the IRA mortar
attacks on Heathrow.
They are also likely to question the company about the new FRS5 accounting
standard which deals with off-balance sheet debt. Forte has done sale and
leaseback deals on around Pounds 400m of hotels, and believes it can leave
the assets and liabilities off its balance sheet under the new standard.
Bringing them on would increase gearing and replace leasing costs with
higher interest charges, leaving profits unaffected.
Further asset write-downs are expected - following the previous year's
Pounds 344m hit - but the balance sheet is now much healthier thanks to
disposals, including the Pounds 177m injection from the flotation of the
Alpha Airports catering and duty free retailing business in February.
This has given it the wherewithal to enter the bidding for Air France's
Meridien chain after its offer for the Aga Khan's Ciga hotels was trumped by
Sheraton.
Following the dividend cut last year analysts expect maintained payments of
7.5p which are still unlikely to be covered by underlying earnings per
share.

FT  11 APR 94 / BCCI's creditors refuse to approve Pounds 23m liquidators'
fee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The committee representing creditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International is refusing to approve Pounds 23.7m in annual fees
demanded by the bank's liquidators, who are partners at the accountancy
firm, Touche Ross.
Touche is budgeting to receive Pounds 17.5m in fees for the UK portion of
the liquidation alone, for the year to next January. 'Everyone on the
committee believes that is too much,' one creditor said.
Although Touche's budget has not been approved, it can draw up to Pounds
550,000 a week on account.
The committee members cannot discuss their concerns about Touche's costs
with the thousands of BCCI creditors, because its six members have signed a
confidentiality agreement presented to them by Touche last year.
Creditors have yet to receive any cash from the realisation of the bank's
assets. All that UK creditors have received so far is payment from the Bank
of England's depositor protection scheme. The arrangement to keep committee
proceedings secret was introduced because Touche Ross became concerned that
there were too many leaks.
However, some creditors believe it is now stifling debate about how the
liquidation should be carried out and how much the liquidator should be
paid.
'The confidentiality agreement is draconian,' complained a lawyer. 'In
theory it even prevents the Bank of England's representative on the
committee from discussing Touche's pay with the Bank governor.'
It is understood, however, that the governor, Mr Eddie George, has been kept
informed of the committee's work and that the Bank is hopeful that a fees
discount can be negotiated with Touche.
The committee has been told that Touche had earned Pounds 98m in fees by mid
February from work on liquidating BCCI's UK operations. Payments to lawyers
working with Touche Ross in the same period were Pounds 35m, most of it
believed to have been received by the City firm Lovell White Durrant.
The figures cannot be compared with those on the costs of the liquidation
submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry, which were prepared on a
different basis.
A paper presented to the committee, dated February 1994, says BCCI's
liquidators throughout the world are budgeting to receive Pounds 31.2m in
fees in the coming year.
Of that, Touche expects to receive Pounds 23.7m, including Pounds 17.5m for
UK work. Touche's worldwide BCCI fees include Pounds 10.4m to be earned by
partners, with the balance earned by six grades of manager.
A Touche partner pointed out that the costs of the liquidation had been
falling since the bank was closed down in July 1991. 'At the peak, we had
450 people working on it,' he said. 'We are way down on that now.'
Touche is hopeful, though, that the courts will give their approval to a
recently negotiated arrangement with Abu Dhabi, BCCI's majority shareholder,
which would involve the emirate paying an estimated Pounds 1.8bn to
creditors.

FT  11 APR 94 / Japanese leadership deadlock may force election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's seven-party coalition government was yesterday close to breaking up,
as it failed to resolve a bitter power struggle over the successor to prime
minister Morihiro Hosokawa.
The impasse, over the policies and composition of the next government,
increases the likelihood of another general election. This would paralyse
the government as trade disputes with the US approach a critical juncture
and as it struggles to implement an economic stimulus package, which is
needed to pull Japan out of its worst recession since the second world war.
Mr Hosokawa will stay on as a caretaker leader until a successor can be
found. Coalition leaders did agree to try to form a new cabinet by mid-week,
allowing the new prime minister to deliver a policy speech to parliament
before the weekend. But a senior official of one party warned that any such
administration would be transitional.
Mr Hosokawa's decision to quit, announced on Friday, unleashed a new
struggle among Japanese political parties, thrown into flux by last summer's
defeat of the Liberal Democratic party. It has intensified the growing split
between the coalition's right and left wings.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the conservative foreign minister, remained the most likely
successor, with the apparent backing of Mr Hosokawa and three conservative
parties giving a majority within the coalition.
Leftwing coalition members voiced fears that Mr Hata would be the puppet of
his powerful colleague Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's backroom
strategist. Mr Ozawa's dominance over Mr Hosokawa enraged the Social
Democratic party, the alliance's largest member.
Mr Ozawa and Mr Hata jointly lead the Japan Renewal party, or Shinseito, the
second-largest coalition member, which has dominated foreign, trade, and
economic policy, despite Socialist opposition. 'There is a lot of resistance
to the idea of Shinseito taking control . . . If we are unable to form a
strong government, then we let the people decide,' said Mr Tomiichi
Murayama, chairman of the SDP.
Mr Hosokawa started the political realignment, after announcing his
resignation, by confirming the end of his own Japan New party's plans to
merge with another coalition member, the New Harbinger party.
He launched, instead, a new JNP-led group, called Reform, which was over the
weekend positioning itself as the heart of a new rightwing alliance, to
embrace Mr Ozawa's JRP and the Buddhist-backed Komeito clean government
party.

FT  11 APR 94 / BT and AT&amp;T alliance win telecoms contract: Pioneering deal
for pan-European network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ground-breaking contract to provide a Europe-wide telecommunications
network for 30 of the continent's leading multinationals has been won by
British Telecommunications and an alliance of AT&amp;T and the Swiss, Swedish
and Dutch state telecoms companies.
The contract, which might be worth Ecu500m (Pounds 394m) a year, is the
first step in a plan to build a pan-European telecoms network linking the
facilities of the 30 companies.
It is a milestone in the struggle by BT and AT&amp;T, the largest US operator,
to establish themselves in continental Europe.
The 30 companies - believed to include Rank Xerox, ICI, Philips, ABN Amro
and ABB - have formed a European telecoms association, aiming to gain tariff
reductions and upgraded services by acting jointly to provide for their
telecoms requirements.
Although a significant breach of Europe's monopoly telecoms regimes, the
corporate network plan has the approval of the European Commission, which
wants to accelerate the development of pan-European communications.
Companies will not be allowed to communicate with each other across the
network. It therefore qualifies as 'private', and is allowed under EU rules.
However, each company will be allowed to include its suppliers, customers
and part-owned subsidiaries.
Services planned for the network include short-code dialling and common
numbering.
Mr John Sale, Rank Xerox's network services manager, said the network, based
on leased lines and dedicated software, could provide savings of up to 40
per cent on the companies' existing bills for cross-border European traffic.
AT&amp;T's joint bid with Unisource - a consortium of the Swedish, Swiss and
Dutch state operators - follows the stalling of its attempts to link up with
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, the French and German state operators.
The main losers are France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, which bid jointly.
Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK group, Sprint, the third largest US operator, and
Telstra, the Australian national operator, were also unsuccessful.
The contract is initially for 12 months from September, with a view to
choosing one operator or more to provide a 'one-stop shop' for the
association from September 1995.
The association draws on experience in the US, where a group of large
companies - some of them members of the European group - operates a pan-US
private network to provide enhanced telecoms facilities at special rates.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of another thumping loss makes it vital that Lloyd's of London
continues to reform its capital structure. Last year's introduction of
corporate capital helped plug the gap caused by the last round of
underwriting losses. Whether or not the market's solvency is called into
question by the looming tide of red ink, more imaginative measures would
help maintain confidence in its ability to thrive. In particular, a
secondary market in syndicate participations would enable Names to raise
cash by selling their rights to future profits.
The introduction of pre-emption rights promised for next year would be a
step in this direction. Without such protection the value of a syndicate
participation could be eroded over time. But the creation of a fully-fledged
trading system looks some way off, not least because the market value of
participations would be extremely volatile. Regulating such a market and
keeping the lid on insider dealing is also a headache Lloyd's could do
without.
These problems may eventually be overcome. In the meantime lifting
restrictions on corporate capital could achieve much the same effect.
Allowing companies to provide all the capital of a syndicate - from 50 per
cent at present - would open the way for corporate vehicles which looked
more like insurance companies than the investment trusts launched last year.
If syndicate participations were swapped for shares, and the Stock Exchange
could overcome its reluctance to list such new companies, Names would have a
welcome chance to realise value.

FT  11 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Air France
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's ballot on Air France's restructuring plan may be a defining moment
for the French economy. After only six of its 14 trade unions recommended
the deal, Air France raised the stakes by seeking direct approval from its
40,000 workers. If they reject the plan, the chairman has vowed to resign,
the government's FFr20bn subsidy package will be withdrawn, and Mr Edouard
Balladur's government will be plunged into a fresh political crisis. With
the government under pressure following recent student unrest, that
political uncertainty may further disturb the franc, which has been wobbling
of late.
Approval is critical if the government's reformist credentials are to remain
intact. Yet Air France's future is far from assured even if the
restructuring is supported. By international standards, Air France is a
desperately uncompetitive carrier. The restructuring proposals, including a
salary freeze, changed working practices and the shedding of 5,000 jobs, are
modest in relation to the scale of its problems. Air France lost FFr7.5bn
last year and carries total debts of about FFr37bn. The goal of privatising
Air France remains a distant prospect.
The political difficulties preventing sufficiently radical restructuring may
ensure that Air France lingers in the land of the living dead, halfway
between state control and commercial reality. With the European Commission
bearing down on state subsidies and competitors stepping up the pressure in
Air France's backyard, that is an uncomfortable place to exist.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fund managers have already squeezed the value out of property shares. They
are in danger of spoiling the fun in the investment market, too, after
chasing yields on prime properties down to 6.5 per cent. But about Pounds
11bn of institutional money is still looking for a home in property,
according to Healey &amp; Baker. It is little surprise that some fund managers
are being enticed by the prospects of building their own assets. That such
investments would have been unthinkable just a year ago emphasises the
astonishing speed of the turnaround in market sentiment.
There are undoubtedly good development opportunities in selective sectors.
Many tenants still complain about the dearth of good modern space.
Construction and finance costs are low. The more adventurous property
companies, such as Helical Bar, have already taken the plunge. Big
institutional investors, such as The Prudential and Scottish Amicable, are
following close behind.
The worry will be what happens to the rest of the property market if
development activity takes off on any scale. Prime properties, which offer
secure rental growth, may be little affected but widespread development
could dull the edge of recovery elsewhere, damping rental and capital
growth. That is especially bad news for most secondary and tertiary
properties, where yields are already beginning to climb again as long term
rates rise. Substantial development activity would hasten the creation of a
two-tier property market. Perhaps it is a good job bankers are so reluctant
to lend.

FT  11 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Up front on leases
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be welcome if the Accounting Standards Board clarified accounting
guidelines in the wake of the Pentos fiasco. It remains to be seen, however,
whether its reforms will be enough to prevent abuse of reverse premiums -
payments by landlords to tenants who take on a long-term lease. If the ASB
simply recommends that the benefit is spread over the first five years,
shareholders may remain unaware of the full risks a retailer is running. The
low average rents which retailers will pay in that time may still encourage
reckless expansion. Equally, shareholders may be in for a nasty shock after
a five-year rent review when the full impact of the lease hits home.
There is thus a strong case for accounts to separate out the amount received
in reverse premiums and their contribution to profits in any one year. Had
NatWest Securities not raised the issue in the Pentos case, shareholders
might have remained completely unaware of it until the rope trick collapsed.
Equally, it can be argued that rent-free periods and landlords'
contributions to fitting-out expenses should also be disclosed.
Reverse premiums are becoming less common as the property market recovers,
but the issue remains important because retailers that have expanded or
recycled their store portfolios during the recession will approach the
critical rent review hurdle in the next few years. Inflation may not bail
out expensive purchases as it has in the past. For some companies the
increased cash outflow may be insignificant, for others critical.
Shareholders should be allowed to judge the sheep from the goats.

Only a poet of Roger McGough's calibre could appear on the BBC's Desert

who has probably done as much for poetry as the Beatles have done for music,
said that all his records sounded 'much the same'. But if he had to take
one, it would be a record of foghorns on the River Mersey. If he played it
loud enough, it might attract a passing ship and lead to his rescue.

</HEADLINE>

The flying fickle finger of fate strikes again. Even before The Sunday Times
had published its list of Britain's 500 richest people, some of its
information was looking a bit obsolete.
Take Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw and brother Trevor, who are chairman and
vice-chairman of the Lancer Boss lift truckmaker. The Sunday Times, worried
that it had 'seriously undervalued' the brothers' business, decided to more
than double the size of the family fortune to Pounds 66m. 'It is clearly a
company run with a conservative balance sheet by its far-sighted
management,' concluded The Sunday Times's wealth-watchers.
Unfortunately, Sir Neville had to call in receivers to several of Lancer's
British subsidiaries on Friday after German banks withdrew support for
Steinbock Boss, its Munich subsidiary.

FT  11 APR 94 / Observer: Irish conspiracy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A fresh twist to the speculation about why Ireland's European commissioner
is throwing his weight behind Sir Leon Brittan's bid for the Commission
presidency.
One suggestion is that Padraig Flynn may be doing it because he wants to
secure a plum job. However, old Dublin hands speculate that his support for
Sir Leon has more to do with a concern to keep his current job. For some
reason Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, is keen to be helpful to
Britain at the moment. By supporting Sir Leon, Flynn keeps in Reynolds's
good books and increases his chances of being reappointed.
Why should he be worried? Because Peter Sutherland is getting itchy feet as
director-general of Gatt and, despite denials, could be a runner for Delors'
job. If he got it, Flynn would have to make way since Ireland can only have
one commissioner. Stranger things have happened.

FT  11 APR 94 / Observer: A peer into Orwell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When will Britain's leading Tories stop trying to recruit George Orwell to
the cause of sentimental English nationalism?
First, the prime minister quoted Orwell's evocation of a slumbering England
of warm beer and '. . . old maids biking to Holy Communion through the mist'
in a St George's Day speech last year to the Conservative Group for Europe.
Now we have employment secretary David Hunt, in a recent pamphlet on
Conservatism and the Social Market, quoting Orwell on 'the gentleness of the
English civilisation' and that 'England resembles a family'.
But the point about Orwell is that he did not want his English readers to
wallow in complacent self-congratulation. Just before Orwell's biking maids,
for example, come the 'queues outside the labour exchanges'. And the
gentleness which Hunt finds so appealing was, to Orwell, 'mixed up with
barbarities and anachronisms'.
The selectivity of the quote about England resembling a family is even more
crass. As Orwell's The Lion and the Unicorn (subtitled Socialism and the
English Genius), makes clear, England is 'a family with the wrong members in
control'. A phrase that might, indeed, sound rather chilling to the most
unpopular Conservative government this century.

FT  11 APR 94 / Leading Article: Anglo-German understanding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The post-second world war partnership between the UK and Germany - once
dubbed 'the quiet alliance' - has become uneasy. Anti-German jingoism in the
British press, for example over the UK's plans to involve Germany in next
year's end-of-the-war celebrations, has been accompanied by differences on
policy issues.
The good personal relationship between Mr John Major, the UK prime minister,
and Chancellor Helmut Kohl has had little impact on broader ties. An
international opinion poll last week indicated mutual trust between Britons
and Germans well below the confidence each country's citizens feel towards
Japan and the US. It is time to take seriously these resentments and
misunderstandings, and to consider what can be done about the causes.
The problems are more pressing because the strains of German unification are
likely to persist. The misguided opposition to unification of the then Mrs
Margaret Thatcher has left a legacy of bruised German feelings. Britain, for
its part, is irritated when the Germans flex their muscles, for instance
during Bonn's 1991 drive to give Croatia diplomatic recognition. But the UK
is also disturbed by German weakness in failing to control post-unity budget
deficits or to play an adequate role in international peacekeeping.
Striking tensions
Over Europe, there are striking tensions. Any attempt to relaunch monetary
co-operation will be bedevilled by memories of both sides' mishandling of
the UK's departure from the exchange rate mechanism. Last month's British
debacle over European Union voting weights was also apparently caused in
part by London's failure to realise that its position would not be backed by
Bonn. Mr Major is still caught between fears of being ensnared in a
German-dominated federal Europe and of being excluded from a Franco-German
'core'. Yet, in reality, the UK's chances of avoiding either outcome have
grown. Germany's stance on Europe has become closer to Britain's, manifested
by Bonn's support for EU widening, as well as by the German electorate's
scepticism over economic and monetary union.
As these examples indicate, far more unites the UK and Germany than
separates them. Rather than increasing Germany's dominance, the
incorporation of economically ravaged eastern Germany has in some ways
narrowed Anglo-German differences. United Germany's per capita gross
domestic product is only about 10 per cent higher than the UK's, on a
purchasing power parity basis, although western Germany's is about 25 per
cent higher.
Similar problems
Germany's financial and business sector is also, under the strain of
recession, responding to Anglo-Saxon influences. The size and effectiveness
of German capital investment in the UK, the large numbers of German students
at UK universities, and the good relationships enjoyed by British military
personnel in Germany all point to matching Anglo-German temperaments and
attitudes. Many problems are similar, too; high unemployment, strains in the
welfare state and a vicious strain of racism among them.
To improve Anglo-German understanding requires action on a broad front.
Political parties should learn to co-operate better, for example in the
European Parliament. Business and trade union leaders should pursue mutual
understanding and common cause in international institutions. Traditional
exchanges, such as the annual Konigswinter conferences, which have brought
together politicians, academics, business people and journalists for 44
years, should be widened in scope and participation. There is a special need
to counter ignorance among ordinary British people about life in modern
Germany. The two governments, backed by business, should try to broaden
links through wider exchanges of young people at the educational, cultural
and sporting levels, and in broadcasting, perhaps along the lines of
successful Franco-German projects.
Once divided in two world wars, the two countries have been united by nearly
half a century of joint attachment to parliamentary democracy and economic
liberalism. That unity will only be deepened by a sustained act of willpower
on both sides.

FT  11 APR 94 / A long walk for the shops: A saturated home market is
forcing US retailers to look for growth opportunities abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When US retailers start expanding overseas, something must be wrong at home.
By and large, ever since the nation's first trading post opened, US store
groups have held the view that the domestic market offers such vast
potential for growth that there is no need to look anywhere else.
Listen, for example, to Mr Leslie Wexner, chairman and chief executive of
The Limited, the US fashion retailer, rejecting the idea of international
expansion in his company's last annual report: 'I believe that our customers
and shareholders are best served when we focus on our immense opportunities
in the US. Sales of Dollars 10bn, perhaps Dollars 20bn, are within our
grasp, right here. Considering the complexities of retailing overseas, I do
not yet see similar volume and profit opportunities from global expansion.'
Yet suddenly, sentiments like these are beginning to sound out of date. Toys
R Us, the toy superstore group, has already opened in 15 countries outside
North America and plans to add Denmark, Sweden, Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates to the list this year. Kmart, the discount store operator, has
bought 13 stores in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and is about to open
two stores in Singapore. Price/Costco, the membership warehouse company, is
already in Canada, Mexico and the UK, and plans to open stores in Taiwan and
Korea this year.
This is not the first time US retailers have explored overseas. Woolworth
took its 'five-and-dime' variety stores to the UK and Germany in the 1920s,
and there have been sporadic adventures by US companies since. But the
current interest is on a much bigger scale than anything seen before.
From the US retailer's point of view, the most satisfactory explanation is
that this is a case of sheer opportunism. US retailers are among the most
innovative in the world, at the forefront of developing new shopping formats
such as discount stores, speciality superstores and electronic home
shopping. It would be more surprising if they failed to exploit that
competitive advantage overseas, particularly when trade barriers are
falling.
But there is another factor driving them to do what they have so rarely seen
as necessary in the past: the US no longer provides the opportunity for
seemingly limitless growth. Over the years, retail square footage has
increased so rapidly that the market has become saturated. If the market
itself were growing, this might matter less: but, notwithstanding an upward
blip in sales reported by some US stores groups last week, retail sales have
barely changed in real terms over the past five years.
Worse, few can see a day when the growth rates of the past will return, even
when people have more money in their pockets. Partly, this is because the US
population is ageing, and older people spend less in the shops. But industry
analysts say the bigger factor is the sociological trend that the consumer
excesses of the 1980s have given way to a new era of thrift and
conservatism.
According to Mr Ed Meyer, chairman and chief executive of the New York
agency Grey Advertising, US consumers are reassessing their lives in the
1990s in much the same way as US companies are re-engineering their
businesses. 'They are putting the brake on their whole approach to living,'
he told a retailing conference in New York. 'They are not just limiting
their spending; they are cutting back on their wants and their needs.'
Whether or not Mr Meyer is right, the fact remains that almost the only
opportunity for a retailer to increase sales in the current state of the US
market is to capture market share at someone else's expense.
Yet the competitive pressures have become so intense that few companies
introducing a successful format can hope to keep their edge for long. One of
two things tends to happen: everyone jumps on the bandwagon, leading to
saturation of the emergent sector, or someone comes along with a better
idea.
Take warehouse clubs - the big retailing phenomenon of the 1980s. Mr Sol
Price, inventor of the concept, had barely opened his first warehouse before
other operators moved into the market. By the end of the decade there were
too many warehouses for too few customers, profits began to dwindle, and a
wave of consolidation set in. Last year Mr Price's ailing warehouse
operation was taken over by the rival Costco, to form Price/Costco.
Or look at electronic home shopping, one of the latest retailing formats. As
currently understood, this means parading goods on television shopping
channels and inviting viewers to place a telephone order. But already this
concept is obsolescent. The new home shopping channels about to be
introduced will be interactive, allowing viewers to choose what goods they
want to look at, and order them at the push of a button through automatic
debiting of their credit card.
With so little potential for domestic growth, the arrival of each new store
group and each new concept further saturates the market, with predictable
consequences for the weakest. According to an analysis by Salomon Brothers,
the Wall Street investment bank, more than half the top 20 US discount
department stores that existed in 1980 are no longer around.
Small wonder that US retailers are looking for growth opportunities beyond
their traditional market. There are few big store groups today that are not
at least considering international expansion. Some are attracted by the
cultural similarities of western Europe, and others by the growth potential
of eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia.
Most, however, seem to favour dipping a cautious a toe into neighbouring
Canada or Mexico first. Wal-Mart, the discount store group which is the
world's biggest retailer, has just bought 120 Woolco stores from Woolworth's
Canadian subsidiary, while JC Penney, the department store group, is opening
its first three international stores in Mexico this year.
But will it work? Few previous US ventures into overseas retailing have
survived. Most, coincidentally, ended in the 1980s. Woolworth sold its UK
general merchandise stores; Sears Roebuck pulled out of Spain and Latin
America; JC Penney sold its Sarma stores in Belgium; Safeway sold its UK
supermarkets after a leveraged buy-out; Schering-Plough sold its worldwide
Scholl chain; Singer sold its worldwide chain of sewing machine shops; Tandy
demerged its electronics shops outside the US; Zale sold its UK jewellery
shops; and Wickes went bankrupt, leaving its European do-it-yourself stores
to fend for themselves.
Today's adventurers acknowledge that expansion abroad has its perils. Mr
Larry Bouts, international division president of Toys R Us, says it is a
brave company that risks taking its eye off the ball in the competitive US
market to start up overseas; and companies entering the European market need
nerves of steel to contemplate the much higher costs of property, labour and
distribution there. Mr Warren Hashagen, senior vice-president (finance) of
The Gap, the fashion store chain, says the dilemma faced by retailers going
anywhere abroad is that they have to adapt their formula to suit local
conditions, yet in doing so they risk undermining whatever it was that made
them successful in the first place.
It might all be different this time though. Woolworth was profitable in the
UK for decades before its retailing formula became outdated, and the company
is still in overseas markets as a speciality retailer with its Foot Locker
sports shoe chain. Other US retailers entering overseas markets are more
aggressive and experienced than their predecessors. In the food service
sector, the phenomenal success of McDonald's has demonstrated that US
products and US retailing techniques can prove a devastating combination
when applied effectively. Retailers of the world, beware.

FT  11 APR 94 / Leading Article: Supersonic subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's three largest aerospace manufacturers have a problem. All are
suffering from a weak civil aircraft market and cuts in spending on defence,
which has long provided much of their most lucrative business. Despite heavy
restructuring, two of the companies, Aerospatiale of France and Dasa of
Germany, made losses last year. The third, British Aerospace, is only just
profitable.
Apparently in quest of a solution, the companies have fallen back on a
well-tried industry ploy - a costly prestige project calculated to set
politicians' pulses racing. This time, it is a joint feasibility study for a
long-haul supersonic airliner. The companies argue that the scheme would
give Europe a head start in the race to build the next generation of
commercial aircraft.
The mere fact that the project has been dubbed 'Son of Concorde' should
cause taxpayers to shudder. The Anglo-French programme, subsidised to the
tune of more than Pounds 7bn in today's money, produced only 14 operational
aircraft. The sole customers were the two countries' state-owned, flagship
air lines, which acquired their Concordes at knockdown prices. Though BA has
turned its fleet into a cash-spinner, Air France has not even managed that.
Untested market
The dangers of the fiasco being repeated seem all too clear. In contrast to
the European Airbus, which has thrived by focusing on established airline
needs, the project aims at an untested market. Recent experience also
suggests the premium prices which airlines would need to charge to make a
supersonic service viable are acutely vulnerable to recession. The
manufacturers' talk of making as many as 1,000 aircraft and of big potential
demand on Pacific Rim routes sounds highly spec-ulative.
So, too are estimates of the pro gramme's cost, which has been put as high
as Pounds 10bn - much of which governments would be expected to finance. In
one sense, the exact figure is almost irrelevant. As the sponsors of
Concorde discovered, beyond a certain point it can be as expensive to cancel
a white elephant project as to see it through to completion.
The manufacturers say the costs would be shared through wider international
collaboration. That is debatable. The European Airbus consortium, for all
its technical achievements, is far from a model of manufacturing efficiency
or corporate transparency. Furthermore, for all the industry's talk of big
global partnerships, none attempted to date has survived beyond the design
stage - and some have not got off the ground at all.
Driving seat
One reason is that manufacturers have often been unable to agree on which
should be in the driving seat. The bigger problem is that their engineering
and technological prowess, their roles as defence contractors and the
glamour of their business have made them potent symbols of national
sovereignty. Invested in their fortunes are the pride and ambition of
governments.
The result has been policies which have too often preserved excess capacity
and, in the case of Airbus, thwarted commercially desirable restructuring.
Indeed, the consortium has, in practice, enabled Britain, France and Germany
each to maintain a civil aircraft manufacturing industry which none could
otherwise afford. The price in reduced efficiency and scale economies can
only be guessed at.
In these circumstances, international competition can easily become a battle
between political power and national treasuries. That danger has been
highlighted by the Clinton administration's central role in the recent sale
of Boeings to Saudi Arabia, and its apparent about-turn on civil aircraft
subsidies. After years of pressing to have them subjected to stricter
international curbs, the US now seems to favour stepping up aid to its own
industry.
The longer such political attitudes persist, the more manufacturers will be
encouraged to plead for special treatment. The harder, too, will be the task
of applying normal commercial and financial disciplines to an industry which
has too often identified its own welfare with the national interest. 'Son of
Concorde' offers an excellent opportunity for governments to demonstrate
that they understand the force of this point.

FT  11 APR 94 / Matriarchal era in the making: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why does Hillary Rodham Clinton attract such venomous criticism, especially
from males of a conservative bent? I suspect the attacks reflect her gender
as well as her politics: some men are unsettled by the presence in the White
House of a genuinely powerful First Lady.
This thought was prompted, oddly enough, by a history of intellectual ideas:
Richard Tarnas's The Passion of the Western Mind (Ballantine Books, Dollars
16). Tarnas, a Californian academic, believes we are about to experience a
transformation in our 'world view' as profound, say, as the shift from
classical Greek culture to medieval Christianity. It will involve the
'death' of the aggressive male ego and its replacement by a more inclusive,
holistic, feminine approach to the world.
Nonsense, I thought at first. Yet change is under way. The shift of women
out of the home and into the market economy in recent decades is an economic
and social transformation without precedent in western history. As women
gain influence in every sector, from medicine to financial services, they
surely will begin to shape the world in their image. In contrast to past
periods, the 21st century may well turn out to be the 'century of women'.
Today's career women still face some discrimination - because men still
occupy most of the very top positions. But educational trends suggest their
daughters will be unstoppable. In the US, a higher proportion of women than
men now attends college. And in an age of 'knowledge-based' capitalism,
women are at least as likely as men to possess the qualities needed for
economic success. Brute strength and aggression are no longer advantages;
today you need perseverance, flexibility and inter-personal skills - virtues
that women possess in abundance.
Women's empowerment is already bringing fundamental social change, as
illustrated by last month's Washingtonian magazine. A local career woman in
her late 30s decided she wanted a baby without the hassle of finding a
suitable partner. She found the genes she required (high IQ, good eyesight
and tall physique) in a Californian sperm bank, and now has a bouncing baby.
Modern man's position is not entirely secure in either the home or the
workplace.
Tarnas is not content with purely economic or technological explanations for
this revolution. Put briefly, his thesis is that the rise of women is
necessary to resolve an impasse in a western cultural tradition long
dominated by masculine values.
The absence of women in any list of great minds from Plato to Freud, he
claims, reflects the nature of western man's intellectual quest as much as
social repression. Man started in a state of primordial unity with nature,
worshipping 'earth-goddesses'. But from the Greeks onward, he strove to
differentiate himself from the natural world and to dominate it. By
exploiting a cold and fiercely rational intelligence, he scaled breathtaking
intellectual heights: in the age of Newton and Descartes, everything seemed
within his grasp.
Yet as man compulsively analysed the world, the certainties of the
Enlightenment began to dissolve. After Darwin, man lost faith in God. After
Freud, he lost faith in his own rationality. After Heisenberg and the rise
of quantum mechanics, he even lost faith in the simple verities of science.
By the 20th century, complexities seemed to be multiplying in all
directions. Solid matter was superseded by fuzzy, indeterminate wave
functions, just as strict ethical codes were superseded by a pervasive moral
relativism. The analytical approach left man feeling alienated, without a
deep sense of purpose.
At the same time, man's parallel project of gratifying his ego by subduing
nature ran into unexpected difficulties. Capitalism produced a stupendous
increase in economic productivity, but it did not eliminate poverty. And by
the late 20th century it hit a new set of ecological constraints. The
masculine desire to ravish nature found itself battling a feminine desire to
protect it.
In Tarnas's view, the rising influence of women is an inevitable response to
this whole battery of problems. Women are beginning to assume a leadership
role because the masculine analytical tradition is exhausted. It achieved
scientific and economic miracles, but has not led to harmonious relations
between people nor catered for spiritual needs. The 'green movement' is just
one element in what is likely to be a more general 'feminisation' of social
and economic relations. The intellectual rebirth of the 21st century will
require a new synthesis, stressing holistic approaches to knowledge,
'oneness' between man and nature, and participatory solutions in the social
sphere.
Is this merely politically correct verbiage, designed to placate feminists?
Not necessarily. Tarnas admittedly fails to realise that less competition
and individualism in the economic sphere would have disastrous consequences
for living standards. Nor is it clear that masculine and feminine values can
be separated in the way he claims: as women take on the former functions of
men, their values may change. Mrs Clinton seemed to be more macho than
nurturing in her career as a cattle futures trader.
Yet Tarnas is surely right to pinpoint the rising influence of women as the
most significant social trend of our times and to link this with perceived
(if often illusory) shortcomings in a network of beliefs and institutions,
or world view, created largely by men.

FT  11 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Competitiveness is not at risk from
strong labour movement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT PHELPS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Clearly discussion of the merits of a social clause in international
trade is hotting up. But the assumption that a country's competitive edge in
world trade is necessarily sharpened by the absence of a strong labour
movement can be questioned.
In an economy where labour is repressed, unskilled labour is likely to be
repressed the most. The result, since manufacturing workers are usually more
skilled than those in most services, is to discourage the production of
tradeable goods. Service-sector output expands, compared with an economy
with market-determined wages, as intra-marginal profits are the higher. As
service-sector output expands relatively, its price falls relatively. An
effective revaluation of the currency results and competitiveness is lost.
In such an economy, the development of a strong union movement would ideally
raise the relative level of unskilled wages, correcting the tradeable,
non-tradeable imbalance and bringing an effective devaluation to retrieve
competitiveness. If this is correct, the International Confederation of Free
Trade Unions is being far from protectionist ('A bid to push the world to
rights', April 5) in seeking global acceptance of workers' rights. Setting
further barriers to expansion of exports from an uncompetitive economy may
be the wrong way to proceed.

human resource management (3)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TOM BARRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The notion of measuring 'better management-employee relations'
illustrates precisely why many HR professionals are not delivering:
(1) The HR function's objective must be to help a company achieve its
business strategy by maximising the performance of its employees. If
professionals believe better management-employee relations are a measure of
their function's success, they will never find a place on the board.
(2) The assumed validity of the notion of 'management-employee relations' is
indicative of the continuing prevalence of command-control management style.
In our experience, a manager who still considers himself a 'boss' will not
get the maximum out of people. A manager who says he wants to 'empower his
employees' will not get the maximum out of his team.
Why not? Because individuals empower themselves. And when do they empower
themselves? When they recognise the self-interest in the job they are
performing.
Individuals do not take a job just to further the business goals of the
company. They take a job to further their personal goals. Only when the two
coincide can a company hope to maximise the commitment of its people, and
thus facilitate the attainment of its business objectives. Tom Barry,

<TEXT>
Sir, I fear Sue Fernie and David Metcalf may have been asking the wrong
question. By asking managers responsible for personnel matters to rate
management-employee relations on a seven-point scale, they have collected
data on those managers' own perception of the states of their organisations.
Fernie and Metcalf go on to confuse these perceptions with the 'actual'
state of these organisations. Is it surprising, then, that managers who use
HRM methods are more aware of the problems they have with their people, see
the benefits of improving things and rate their current position accordingly
modestly, whereas those who do not are satisfied with things as they are and
report good results?
Would Captain Bligh have reported good relations with the crew of The
Bounty? I suspect so.

   From Mr DUNCAN I BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sue Fernie and David Metcalf's criticisms of human resource management
(Recruitment, April 6, UK edition; April 8, international) betray both a
lack of understanding of the concept, and of what personnel specialists are
trying to achieve in applying it. HRM was in large part a reaction against
prior over-specialisation and the lack of business impact of the personnel
function which had helped to create the appalling industrial relations
record and rigid work practices of UK companies in the 1970s.
'Measuring and monitoring the HR function' is the subject of a major
conference for personnel practitioners in June, and it demonstrates that
they are indeed evaluating what their contribution is. And the standard they
are applying is not that of Fernie and Metcalfe - subjective view of good
management/employee relations, for its own sake. It is instead a
demonstrable contribution to improved business performance and the
achievement of the organisation's strategic goals.
The research only reinforces my opinion that the titular allusion to people
with 'lots of pretensions but few practical results' rests more
appropriately with business academics than with those HRM practitioners who
have been making major strides in fighting 'The British disease'.

FT  11 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Government should act on electronic
mail confidentiality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P S MEIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, By chance I have been exposed to a furious debate in the US over the
use by private individuals of military-strength encryption. I simply want to
be able to send confidential information, some of it about personnel
matters, by electronic mail from my business in Kent to my home in
Shropshire. The most useful e-mail facilities are on the Internet, but such
facilities are far from confidential, which brings up the need for
encryption.
In addition to my humble use of it, I would argue encryption is essential
for several new commercial services to develop over the Internet which will
benefit us all in time by lowering transaction costs.
Applications in publishing and software distribution have already sprung up
which depend on encryption. Rather than give a long list of examples, I ask
you to imagine whether you would want your credit card details to be
broadcast en clair round the world. If, like me, you would not, you need
encryption to buy and sell over the network.
The debate, which has not started properly in the UK, is about whether the
government should either ban the use of encryption by private individuals,
or limit its use to some system, such as the American Clipper chip which can
be bugged by government. In the US, the Netherlands and, I believe, France,
such restrictions are already being debated by their legislatures. Their
concern is supposedly about law and order.
My concern is that restrictions should not be imposed in the UK without a
proper public debate. Strong encryption software, PGP for example, is now
widely available worldwide.
Those crooks who need it already have it. An opportunity for significant
economic development of the Internet could be lost if governments are able
to push through ill-conceived restrictions just because the subject seems
too obscure for most of us to take an interest.

FT  11 APR 94 / The FT Interview: Earnest about important allies - Rudolf
Scharping, leader of Germany's SPD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past 10 months, Mr Rudolf Scharping, the leader of Germany's Social
Democrats (SPD), has been earnestly and anxiously seeking to prove to German
electors that he and his party are 'fit for government'.
Today in Washington he will carry on, in effect, the same campaign - but
this time directed at Capitol Hill, the White House, and the opinion formers
of the outside world.
If the German opinion polls hold true, 46-year-old Mr Scharping, currently
state premier of the Rhineland-Palatinate, is the most probable successor to
Chancellor Helmut Kohl after October's elections. Following the sharpest
recession to hit postwar Germany, the SPD is seen as the party most likely
to solve the problem of rising unemployment.
Yet foreign policy could be his Achilles' heel: it is the one area where
German voters agree that the present chancellor is far more experienced, and
Mr Scharping is an unknown quantity. Over the coming week in the US, he is
keen to prove otherwise, and show US President Bill Clinton that an SPD
government in Bonn would be a partner just as good as, if not better than,
the Kohl regime.
As he says, with disarming understatement: 'There may be a need for rather
more information in America about the policies of the Social Democrats and
their leader. I will very happily take the opportunity to provide that.'
For a start, he is determined to knock on the head fears that a 'red-green'
coalition in Bonn, between the SPD and the Green party, might see Germany
pull out of the Nato alliance and abolish the Bundeswehr, the German armed
forces. Such Green policies, he says, are 'pure nonsense'.
Since he became party leader last June, his main achievement has been to
shift the SPD firmly into the middle ground of German politics, away from
the temptation of becoming a coalition of minority interests. 'Rainbows are
very pretty,' he says, 'but rainbow coalitions simply cannot take the
strain. Only a party with a strong centre has the strength and independence
to face new questions and new developments, to protect small groups and
minorities and take up their ideas.'
He is adamant that a Social Democratic administration in Bonn would not mean
any growth in trade protectionism, in spite of the party's commitment to the
protection of jobs. 'There is no other economy in the world which is so
(internationally) interconnected, especially in Europe, as the German
economy,' he says. 'Protectionism makes matters worse. So does isolationism.
There is no debate on that any longer. The only question is how one should
organise one's open trade relations.'
As for the European Union, he sounds as passionate a believer in European
integration as Mr Kohl. 'There is no domestic political reason which would
justify undermining European integration,' he says. He fears, however, that
Mr Kohl is increasingly isolated among his own conservative allies on that
issue, whereas the Social Democrats are part of a genuinely pan-European
movement.
He maintains that both the EU and Nato must be open to membership of the
central and east European democracies, and a central theme of his trip will
be the need for the US, as well as Europe and Japan, to do more to support
the fragile democracies and economies of that region.
His other main theme will be the common ground that exists between the SPD
and the Clinton administration - on questions of population control and
protection of the environment.
It seems that, as far as foreign policy is concerned, Mr Scharping belongs
firmly in the mainstream of Germany's postwar European and Atlantic
commitment. 'There are various voices on the political extremes in Germany,
including occasional voices even in the SPD, which say we could do without
Nato, either replacing it with the CSCE or other instruments of European
security policy,' he says. 'I believe that is wrong. One cannot give up the
best functioning security instrument we have, in the uncertain hope that a
new one may arise.'
He is also clear that continuing US involvement in Europe is essential. 'The
Europeans have sadly not got very far with their own efforts at a common
foreign and security policy. The example of Yugoslavia is tragic evidence of
that. Europe cannot do without America's involvement, and not only for
reasons of security policy.
'In the development of world trade, help for underdeveloped countries, and
in the stabilisation of the freedom process in eastern Europe, a common
involvement makes more sense than for every country to act on its own.'
He supports the Nato programme of partnership for peace as 'a good first
step' to involve both Russia and the east Europeans in its processes. Yet
after a visit to Prague last week, he also knows the urgency with which the
central European states are seeking full membership of Nato and the EU.
'Perhaps they feel that they must use the present opportunity, because they
don't know if the chance will be as good in five years. Perhaps they are
also concerned that they don't know how things will turn out in Russia.'
He says it is essential for the 'prospect of membership' to be held out for
the central Europeans, but equally essential to avoid 'simply moving the old
(east-west) border a few hundred kilometres further east'. He cannot see how
Russia can be given some sort of 'special relationship' by Nato beyond that
it has by virtue of size and nuclear weapons.
'Since no one can say today how Russia will develop, one can only set a
goal: to do as much as possible to ensure it is as stable, democratic and
peaceful as possible. How that can be accomplished in detail, we will have
to work out as we go along.'
Mr Scharping's first foreign trip of 1994, Germany's marathon election year,
was to Paris, and he still believes firmly in the importance of the
Franco-German alliance within Europe. He quotes former Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt as saying that, in foreign policy questions, 'Germany should
wherever possible follow a common path, at least with France, and the French
should rather even be allowed to keep one step ahead'.
As for any greater assertion of German national interest, 'if you want a
common (European) foreign and security policy, you should not always try to
take the first step. One should not try to compel one's partners to follow.
'Germany has, thanks to its size, its population and its geography, a very
strong position in Europe. It is better for this weight to be bound into
Europe, otherwise we would be very rapidly back to the old axis-politics,
and everyone knows where that led.'
His party is in favour of a permanent seat on the UN security council for
Germany, but not as a top priority. And anyway, he says, 'if Germany gets a
permanent seat, we would wish it to be seen as a European seat'.
He denies that his party's opposition to the use of German troops outside
the Nato area would undermine UN peacekeeping missions. The SPD supports the
use of blue helmets, with the right to defend themselves and carry out their
mission, as well as the use of military force to support UN embargoes.
'That means everything the UN has done in the last 30 years, and which it
can realistically be expected to do in the coming years, can be done with
German participation, as far as the foreign policy of my party is
concerned.'
Mr Scharping is adamant that foreign policy in Germany will not decide next
October's elections: unemployment and the state of the economy will be far
more important. Yet he also knows that it is not entirely irrelevant, which
is why he is taking this week's trip to the US so seriously.

FT  11 APR 94 / The case against Major's foes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The campaign against the British prime minister is typified by a Jak cartoon
in the Evening Standard showing a Scottish laird in a baronial hall telling
his wife: 'The trouble with John Major is that he just doesn't understand
ordinary people]', while two retainers bring on refreshments to the sound of
the bagpipes.
Old parliamentary hands used to tell new MPs: 'Your enemies are your own
side of the House. Your opponents sit opposite.' I can merely add that I
have seen nothing as hysterical, vicious and disproportionate to the faults
of its victim as the long-running anti-Major campaign.
The main complaint of the anti-Major camp against the Labour party is that
the latter cannot deliver some knockout propaganda blow to topple the prime
minister. It would, however, be surprising if mere political opponents could
rival the Tory anti-Major faction in pure venom. Things have reached a
ridiculous level when cabinet discussion becomes dominated by jockeying for
position for the succession: translated, this means that ministers vie with
each other to seem Euro-phobic.
What, then, are the charges against the prime minister? The first, partisan,
one is that Conservatives are doing very badly in the opinion polls and
could face a catastrophe in the Euro-elections. Governments doing badly in
mid-term elections are, however, among the oldest phenomena of democratic
politics. By-election losses of safe Conservative seats such as Torrington
and Orpington were par for the course in the Macmillan administration. Not
only is this natural; it is not regrettable. No serious student of politics
ever supposed that governments should depend on a day-to-day plebiscite. The
purpose of general elections is to enable voters to deliver a by-and-large
judgment every four or five years. Even that is a highly fallible system
but, as Churchill said, it is less bad than any other.
Let it be conceded straightaway that the present British government is
thoroughly second-rate, nowhere more so than in John Major's choice of
cronies with whom he feels most comfortable. But then so have most
governments been in the history of the world, except for those that have
been third-rate or diabolical. To bemoan this fact excessively is to commit
the cardinal sin of supposing that human progress comes from governments: it
comes from scientists, artists, engineers, business leaders and less
celebrated human beings acting individually or in combination. The
deliberate playing down of this fact by the supposedly free market right is
breathtaking.
The greatest fault of John Major is a lack of public facility with words -
he is fine in private. This lies behind almost every recent disaster. The
European voting volte face was partly due to a hyped-up negotiating stance.
The tragicomedy of 'Back to Basics' is another example. But pause for a
moment. Most of the prime minister's enemies on the right - with the
honourable exception of Frank Johnson in the Sunday Telegraph - want more
'Back to Basics' rather than less: that is, more self-appointed guardians of
puritan public virtue probing into the private lives of people in office.
Have you ever seen the anti-Majorites uttering a word of criticism of the
intrusive hypocrisy of the tabloids?
The fact is that Conservative leaders since Winston Churchill have all
lacked the gift of of words. Eden's speeches were greeted by Ernest Bevin
with the remark: 'one bloody cliche after another' (pronounced 'cluytch').
Macmillan, like Margaret Thatcher herself, was mainly recognised as an
orator in retirement. When he was attacked for lack of leadership, he
replied that people who wanted it should look to archbishops. As for Edward
Heath, it was a constant source of amazement that someone so sensitive to
music could be so insensitive to the nuances of the spoken word.
I have left until last the most obvious feature of the anti-Majorites, their
hostility to Europe - although they never make it clear whether they would
leave the Union or not. This came about almost by accident, because European
issues triggered off, although they did not cause, the departure of Lady
Thatcher. One result has been that paternalists and militarists, who could
not hide their disdain for the former prime minister when she was mainly
associated with free market policies, have now climbed on the anti-Majorite
bandwagon in her name.
Because of the infusion of this element, members of the free market right
have deteriorated abysmally in quality. Whereas in the early 1980s, they
supported the Thatcher government against the 365 economists who wanted more
expansionary economic policies, their typical stance now is 'cheap money and
plenty of it'. They have joined with the left in pedalling the myth that
there is something called 'government competence' that can remove the
business cycle and secure unending prosperity.
If anti-Major Tories had really read the works of their professed
intellectual inspirers such as Oakeshott and Hayek, they would appreciate
that the purpose of government is to provide a framework in which individual
citizens and voluntary associations can follow their own self-chosen
purposes. Leadership may be necessary in war (although Tolstoy had his
doubts - see War and Peace); but there is something deeply inadequate about
people who cannot get on with their peacetime lives without a scoutmaster in
Number 10 blowing on a tin whistle to show them the way.

FT  11 APR 94 / Arts: Merchant of Venice - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shylock and his office computer; Bassanio amid the champagne-swigging hooray
Henries; Launcelot Gobbo with his sandals and mug of coffee. . . Seeing The
Merchant of Venice relocated into the modern world, as it is in David
Thacker's RSC staging, is a very salutary shock. No Renaissance glamour
here, no glowing Venetian colours. This production, new last May in
Stratford and now at the Barbican, reminds us that Shakespeare's Venice is
simply a hub of finance and trade. It is here a very FT world, with city
gents busy at their screens.
The most distinguished such gent is Shylock. As David Calder plays him -
with great distinction, and with marvellously eloquent vocal tone - he is
the most civilised man in Venice. This Shylock only turns to usury and his
bond because the Christian gents keep brandishing their antisemitism in his
face. This highly tendentious reading smooths over the unpleasant fact that
Shylock stipulates a pound of Antonio's flesh in the very first scene we
meet him (Calder suggests this forfeit like a mere whim of fancy), and it
proposes that Shylock only starts to behave like an orthodox Jew because
everyone else insists on casting him as such. Shylock is more sinned against
than sinning.
As far as it goes in whitewashing Shylock, this production is very
satisfying. But it is better in satisfying our modern liberal instincts than
our knowledge of Shakespeare's play. The Belmont scenes - Portia, the
caskets, and the final act of lovers' reconciliations - become grey and
lightweight.
And Thacker is so pc that he edits out Portia's racist remark about the
Prince of Morocco's failure: 'Let all of his complexion choose me so'.
(There are other editorial alterations, too, mainly to help the new-look
Shylock.)
Calder's Shylock and Penny Downie's Portia have acquired a wealth of new
nuances. Too many, in fact. All of Calder's effects are individually
sensitive and intelligent, but I am now aware that some of them are just
that: effects. He pauses too long and too often. Downie has gained in
authority, but not in conviction or fluency.
One supporting role is brilliantly taken - the Launcelot Gobbo of
Christopher Luscombe, a ineffectual little chatterbox whose every silly word
becomes vivid, funny, and telling. The production is better spoken than
before; every word carries into the Barbican's difficult auditorium. But too
many of the supporting roles are weakly played. I cannot conceive why the
RSC is casting Mark Lewis Jones as Lorenzo. He speaks high-flying poetry
about moonlight, love and music, with a voice so tight and manner so tense
that he wrecks the scene.
This is still a bracing and exciting production. Of all the stagings that
will come from Stratford to London this year, this is the one I would most
urge people to see. It has changed my conception of Shylock and
Shakespeare's Venice. A shame that it affords only incomplete pleasure.

FT  11 APR 94 / Arts: Kurt Cobain - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kurt Cobain has taken the quick route to pop immortality - the 27-year-old
singer with the band Nirvana shot himself at his home in Seattle last week.
Cobain's death seems certain to place him alongside another premature victim
of excess, Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols, who with a similar Nihilist
approach to Society, and an extravagant drug abuse, rushed headlong to the
grave.
Cobain, the child of divorced parents, had a difficult upbringing in
Washington State. By the late 1980s he was playing the guitar and helping to
pioneer grunge music, the sound coming out of Seattle. Grunge was directly
descended from the British punk of the mid 1970s - loud, discordant,
deliberately amateurish, and representing the alienated life style of youth,
at odds with a complacent, ordered, adult world.
Cobain formed a trio, Nirvana, in 1988 and for Dollars 600 produced an
album, Bleach, which won a cult following. The band was signed up by the
influential Geffen Records which in 1991 promoted Nevermind, combining the
energy and anarchy of grunge with some attractive tunes. It was the perfect
cross-over album and sold more than 10m copies; won many awards; and spawned
'Smells like teen spirit' which topped the American charts and broke Nirvana
in the UK and Europe. Another successful album, In Utero, was released last
year.
Like many young musicians from an underprivileged background Cobain could
not cope with success. He found refuge in drugs and violence, and the
extremism of his stage act followed him into his private life. His wife, a
neo-punk singer, Courtney Love, was also an heroin addict, and welfare
workers feared for their child, Frances. In Rome last month Cobain took an
overdose.
Cobain briefly had a tremendous impact on a large minority of youth. He was
producing music that appealed to young people who enjoyed the pretence of
rebellion. If he had wished, he could have followed the path of earlier
iconoclastic bands like Guns 'n' Roses into international arena touring and
the making of millions. But Cobain chose to stay outside the system - and
life.

Up to now there has been two episodes a week of the BBC's highest rated
programme, Eastenders, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Today the lives of the
cockney stallholders and pub goers are extended into a third weekly episode,
starting at 8.00 on BBC1. To meet the threat, and of course as a spoiling
operation, ITV is moving British Television's highest rated programme,
Coronation Street forward by 10 minutes to start at 7.20 so that the
following programme, a movie, inherits the Street's millions and has 10
minutes to hook them and keep them from zapping.
British camera crews in South Africa must be having an awful job keeping one
another out of shot. Tonight in Panorama Michael Buerk reports on 'Mandela's
Promised Land' (9.30 BBC1) and Channel 4 shows the first in a three-part
series called Soweto - A History (10.55).
Two outstanding pieces of drama clash, but at least the first is a repeat.
Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit (10.10 BBC1) is about a girl growing up with
religious extremists. The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (10.40) is a new
episode in ITV's series about the neurotic sleuth.

FT  11 APR 94 / Arts: Glass-fancier's feast illuminates 4,000 years -
Computerise, modernise, popularise are the watchwords of the V&amp;A's latest
gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slowly, expensively, and not without controversy, the Victoria and Albert
Museum is turning itself into a museum for the 21st century. The latest
stage is the new Glass Gallery which opens on 20 April. Not only does it
look good, it looks different. This is important, because the gallery marks
the first step in an ambitious programme reaching into every corner of this
huge museum. Three words seem to summarise the new V&amp;A now in the making;
computerise, modernise, popularise.
A first impression of the 350 square metre gallery is of colour and sparkle.
Lumbered with a boring design by Edwardian architect Aston Webb, Penny
Richards of Pringle + Richards Architects has created within it a
light-filled, mirrored space. Green glass treads ascend to a mezzanine with
a balustrade of gleaming ice-green float glass by artist Danny Lane.
A redesigned museum display used to mean violent purging. Glory be, the
fashion for parsimony seems to be over. The new Glass Gallery is crammed
with stuff, a lot on the ground floor and twice as much again on the
mezzanine which is deemed to be more for specialists than the general
public. That seems a pretty artificial distinction. Miss going up the glass
steps, and you miss superb Roman beads and the nostalgic sight of glass
Christmas-tree ornaments, the last still in production, given last year by a
German firm.
This is a glass-fancier's feast of things marvellous and ghastly, from
exceptional mosque lamps to Restoration punchbowls, from Lalique and Czech
modernism to Pyrex cookware. The display is chronological over four thousand
years, since the Egyptians used dollops of glass to make jewellery. One
third of the display is 20th-century, very little previously exhibited. A
dozen pieces get cases to themselves, such as the famous 13th-century
Saracen goblet known to legend as the Luck of the Edenhalls. The mild
disappointment is to find only three chandeliers; Venetian, 18th-century
English and Victorian. I had hoped for a constellation.
Forty-three display cases made by Glasbau Hahn of Frankfurt mopped up
two-thirds of the Pounds 1m cost of the gallery. Beneath the gallery windows
runs one of London's most polluted streets. Since the new gallery was not to
be air-conditioned, the display cases had to be as nearly airtight as
possible, and yet these are so designed that a curator can open a case
unaided.
Conservation made a new gallery urgently necessary. Most of us imagine that
glass out of elbow-reach is durable stuff, yet this is to reckon without
'glass disease'.
Five years ago, a survey showed symptoms of glass disease in ten per cent of
the V&amp;A's National Collection of some 8,0000 objects.
Roman and Islamic glass-making is magnificently proof against the disease,
as is 18th-century English lead crystal. Scandinavian glass can sicken and,
although Italian conservators dispute it, the V&amp;A view is that all Venetian
glass has this fatal flaw.
Look for sweaty surfaces on the glass in the Murano tourist shops, says Dr
Oliver Watson, curator of the Ceramic and Glass Department. The cause is the
chemically unstable relationship of flux to stabiliser, made worse by
environmental fluctuations. Crystals leach out and build up until the
surface 'crizzles'. To illustrate every collector's nightmare there is a
cloudy half-shattered goblet in the new gallery.
On top of Pounds 1m for building the Glass Gallery, largely found from the
museum's own resources, Watson had to find Pounds 115,000 for computers and
a software programme from the Gloucestershire company, Art of Memory. In the
end, the Corning Glass Museum in upstate New York went halves on the cost.
The system is more sophisticated than anything the V&amp;A has used so far in
its campaign to make its collections accessible and entertaining.
I have seen only a demonstration and cannot vouch for how the three computer
'pods' will actually perform.
The idea is that one moves rapidly around 'The Story of Glass', from film of
glass-blowing through data on types, glass-artists and factories. Somewhat
misleadingly, half the objects illustrated actually turn out to be in the
Corning Museum, which points to one drawback of this kind of deal. On the
plus side, the video is blessedly silent.
More innovative is the electronic labelling programme. There are 6,000
objects in the new display, twice as many as in the old one. Printed labels
could never supply enough data, so the curious visitor is meant to note the
exhibit or shelf number, then consult the terminal.
Watson, a computer enthusiast, has achieved still more behind the scenes.
His is the only department in the museum to boast a computerised catalogue.
The standard catalogue for the V&amp;A is an unmanageable set of volumes
recording pieces as entered in the collection. Particularly in early years,
entries were often vague, not infrequently wrong. Selecting pieces for the
new gallery revealed that many glasses labelled as 17th-century Venetian
were 19th-century imitations.
It has taken three years for the department's ten members to produce a
data-base of the 70,000 glass and ceramic collection. 'Before, if someone
asked what Venini glass we had, it could take two days' work. Now we can
give the answer at the press of a key' says Watson. Will that kind of
inquiry be answered free? Probably not, he admits.
Watson sees the Glass Gallery as only the start of introducing more
innovative techniques essential if the V &amp; A is to compete in an industry
classified as entertainment, not education. 'For the government to spend
Pounds 30m a year is predicated on getting people in to see the stuff.'
He believes that only the most dessicated curator could regret the solitude
which reigned in the old glass gallery.
'There simply wasn't an audience, and the only people who came wanted to see
18th-century English glass'. Dim and glum, the glass stood in antiquated
wooden cabinets. Take a look at the remaining study galleries, and you see
at once how it was. There stand cases like a thousand oubliettes, packed
with beautiful things displayed in a way which induces instant torpor.
The Glass Gallery is the first of the Materials and Techniques galleries, as
opposed to the Art And Design galleries, which show the material culture of
an era or society.
More M and T galleries are meant to follow. Yet notices at the museum
entrance, announcing that the cast iron collection is to remain closed for
lack of a sponsor, are not encouraging.
Glass and ceramics are far more widely collected so they have more popular
appeal. Even so, it would take ten new galleries for Watson to get the
ceramic collection attractively shown.
A long road lies ahead of the V&amp;A. At least the Glass Gallery, sparkling
with interest, is a good place to measure the distance already travelled.

FT  11 APR 94 / Arts: The Sleeping Beauty - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND JOHN WILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today a producer of The Sleeping Beauty must compensate for lavish amenities
which Tchaikovsky and Petipa enjoyed, long vanished in different mores and
austerities of budget, yet leave a mark on this iconic work that is at once
distinctive and reverent of the ballet's tradition.
Telling eternal verities again, flaunting perfect execution, and seeking
fresh expression beneath the burden of authority were the challenges facing
Anthony Dowell as he revived The Sleeping Beauty in a new production
sponsored by the Friends of Covent Garden, with financial and practical help
from the American Friends of Covent Garden, given its first performance at
the Kennedy Centre in Washington on Wednesday night.
Apart from Stephen Wicks's superior mime as Carabosse, the uninvited seventh
sister, the parable of good and evil in the new version has more the look of
duty than belief, running a long second to the visual splendor of the stage.
Maria Bjornson's arresting set for The Sleeping Beauty is an imposing swirl
of columns and windows - presented to us as if a long perspective had been
twisted and compressed. These symbols of a castle persist throughout the
ballet and frame a large oval centrepiece which changes motif with each act.
The disjunction between its distorted angles and curves and the realistic
lines and groupings among the dancers is jarring at first.
But with time the eye adjusts, and in the second act, set in winter, the
effect of the decoration would be magical - so in keeping in its season with
the metaphor of the sleeping kingdom - had we been spared a drop curtain of
crude icicles set against a bright rainbow.
Miss Bjornson's costumes are lavish, and run a gamut of increasing
brightness.
Yet the paleness of effect is telling in the prologue and first act, making
the set more intrusive and muting the effect of Aurora's entrance - her
costume in the Rose Adagio being hardly discernible in hue from the
ballerina's skin.
Far from flaunting perfection, the quality of execution was mixed at the
first performance. Darcey Bussell is a ravishing Aurora, dancing with
pliancy and grace throughout, showing excellent line and resplendent poise .
But even this wonderful artist was cautious in bringing off the prodigies of
balance required by the Rose Adagio, a caution which echoed through the
ranks of first soloists in slow tempi and slight mis-coordinations of
gesture and music.
Zoltan Solymosi is a commanding and elegant Prince Desire, who dazzled the
audience with his frenetic turns in the last act.
Fiona Chadwick is an elegant Lilac Fairy, though lacking the amplitude of
gesture that a taller dancer would bring to the part.
The ensemble dancing, after a spate of failed unisons in the prologue,
improved in the later acts, the polonaise and mazurka of Act III achieving
an effect of genuine panache, as befits a utopia.
Throughout the production, Anthony Dowell's concern for persuasive mime is
much in evidence; the artists acted with unabashed conviction.
Dealing with the weight of tradition is a dilemma, which Dowell resolved by
following the best of Marius Petipa's choreography while compensating for
its deficiencies.
These changes bring the work of later choreographers into the ballet but do
not create a stylistic disparity in the dances as conflicting as the clash
of decoration and movement.
Small but fussy changes have been made in the mise-en-scene supposedly to
enhance the coherence of the story for modern audiences.
In the dream entr'acte, for example - an actionless tableau in the original
production - Carabosse and the Lilac Fairy reappear on stage coincident with
their music in Dowell's production, making explicit the triumph of good over
evil.
For the purist, Dowell has preserved unmistakable accents of the 1890
production in St. Petersburg, as when the huntresses torment Desire's tutor
with little lances in Act II, and when, at the moment Desire kisses Aurora,
the vast cobwebs of a hundred years instantly fall away.
The new Sleeping Beauty is a production for the late twentieth century -
when even timeless parable is tinged with the material and the extrovert.

FT  11 APR 94 / The Monday Interview: Fortune hunting in east Europe - Gabor
Varszegi, former rock star and diamond trader, tells Nick Denton how he
became the region's richest man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gabor Varszegi, chief executive of Hungary's Fotex retailing group, likes to
show off the view from his penthouse office. The Fotex Plaza, the company's
imposing post-modern headquarters in the Buda foothills, towers over the
commercial centre of Pest.
It is lonely at the top. No nearby building reaches even to the Fotex
Plaza's knees. Nor does anyone come close to rivalling Gabor Varszegi as
eastern Europe's richest individual.
A 23 per cent stake in the Fotex group and other interests add up to a
personal net worth of well over Dollars 100m. Some investment bankers call
Fotex 'the best private business in eastern Europe'. Its subsidiaries
dominate a whole swathe of retailing in Hungary from household goods and
cosmetics, to furniture, photograph developing and optical products.
That is just the start. Varszegi is today in Paris as part of a roadshow to
finance further expansion by raising Dollars 100m through eastern Europe's
largest ever international equity offering.
'Here you can build a serious empire in five to 10 years,' says Varszegi. He
began business in 1985 with a Dollars 200,000 investment in a one-hour
photograph developing shop and has expanded his empire by buying companies
which the state is privatising. 'It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Part
of the world is on sale. It never happened before and it will never happen
again.'
But many east European entrepreneurs have botched this chance. In Hungary,
where private business has been establised the longest, most of the stars of
four years ago have fallen as meteorically as they once rose.
Gabor Varszegi is a rare exception, and not just because he has survived.
The stereotype of the showy, fly-by-night, vaguely criminal east European
entrepreneur is all too often true. By contrast, Varszegi is proud to call
himself 'conservative'.
'I was born this way,' he says.
Not that there is anything drab about Varszegi's past. He made his first,
modest, fortune as a bass guitarist for Gemini, a 1970s Hungarian rock band.
But Varszegi, now 46, says he was always a better manager than a musician.
'I was a conservative rock musician,' he says. 'I always had short hair.'
Since his days in the music business, Varszegi has avoided the spotlight. 'I
never give interviews to Hungarian newspapers.' Few recognise his face; he
avoids social events and photographers.
He cites fear of the Russian mafia; but, like many east European
entrepreneurs, Varszegi is also Jewish. Prominence invites attention from
nationalist groups and fuels their fantasies about the international Jewish
conspiracy.
His caution can be seen too in Fotex's avoidance of expensive debt financing
that fuelled and then crippled many growing east European businesses. 'We
followed a very different philosophy. We discovered early on that credit is
the highest risk.'
Another vital ingredient of Varszegi's achievement is ruthlessness.
Colleagues describe the Fotex boss as 'brutally realistic'. When a cold-eyed
Varszegi prefaces a sentence with 'I like you very much as a person', as he
often does, you know that he is coming in for the kill.
Varszegi's uniqueness owes something to his time in the west. He gave up
music to emigrate to the US in 1980, worked as a diamond trader in New York
and has retained his US citizenship. 'I came back as an American to do
business,' he says.
A Fotex prospectus once appositely called the group 'an island surrounded by
Hungary'. Fotex unashamedly targets what its chief executive calls Hungary's
'high society', the tenth of the population which he reckons controls half
of the disposable income. Fotex offers the elite everything from gold
Cartier spectacle frames to mobile telephones: an 'infrastructure' for the
rich. 'We don't wish to deal with the average public,' Varszegi once said.
The Fotex boss sniffs too at east European manufacturers - unless they are
companies within his group: 'Either we have to make products ourselves or we
have to import them.' Fotex prefers western institutional investors to
fickle Hungarian stockmarket punters. Since it is not practical to import
labour, Fotex hires staff in their twenties, uncontaminated by communism.
But success can go to the head of even the most westernised businesses. Some
of the warning signs are there. Until recently Varszegi worked shared an
office with his secretary in a villa whose modesty must have appealed to
Fotex shareholders. Now he has built Hungary's most luxurious corporate
headquarters.
And he has begun to indulge in 'the usual tycoonery', as an adviser terms
it: a Bell helicopter to lift him from the roof of the Fotex Plaza, a
Beechcroft turbo-prop for longer journeys and a yacht for the occasional
bout of intense relaxation.
Varszegi has enlarged his ambitions too. He who once eschewed grandiose
plans, dreams of building a Dollars 1bn-a-year company by the year 2000 and
says: 'I hope that one day you can say what is good for Fotex is good for
Hungary.'
But Varszegi has not gone soft yet. The Fotex Plaza may be a prestige
building but it is also fully let at some of Budapest's highest rents while
other developments stand half-empty.
It is said that Varszegi has taken to calling acquisition his hobby but he
does usually draw back from the brink of over-diversification, says Paul
Greatbatch, a financial adviser to Varszegi: 'He knows what he is good at.
Basically he is a retailer and he always comes home. He hasn't made a
mistake yet.'
Nor has the excitement of deal-making dampened the tycoon's enthusiasm for
the essential detail of retail. He takes seriously the 'quality' slogan. And
he jumps over to his desktop computer to recite the exact number of
customers at his stores (378 at the last count) in the previous month:
1,187,016.
Of pride coming before a fall, Varszegi says he needs no reminder: 'If you
get richer and richer, sooner or later you lose your self-control.' In any
case, the moment of truth remains distant; the next downturn is probably a
long way away.
And then there is the yacht and the other little luxuries. Fotex's strategy
was to enable the rich to be rich. Now, Varszegi has begun to listen to his
own pitch. Eastern Europe's wealthiest man is allowing himself a little bit
of conspicuous consumption.

FT  11 APR 94 / People: TWA - Erickson switches sides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last spring, Jeffrey Erickson was on the winning side of a David-and-Goliath
battle which pitted upstart Reno Air against Northwest, one of the biggest
US carriers, writes Frank McGurty.
With a lot of help from the US justice department, Reno's chief executive
succeeded in forcing Northwest to abandon plans which he said were intended
to stop his airline from expanding its services into mid-western markets.
Erickson, recently appointed president of Trans World Airlines, now finds
himself on the opposite side of the great divide. His challenge is to revive
another of America's flying behemoths, humbled in recent years by
competition from smaller, low-cost airlines such as Reno.
That Herculean task may prove to be humbling to the 49-year-old industry
veteran. Erickson is taking over a carrier which stumbled badly this winter
after emerging from two years of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
In January, the airline endured the embarrassing departure of two senior
executives, including its chairman William Howard, who quit under a cloud
after only six months.
Howard's successor, Donald Craib, has no experience in running an airline -
which can only enhance Erickson's value. After cutting his teeth in
management jobs at Aloha, Midway and Continental airlines, Erickson took the
helm at Reno at the time of its 1990 initial public offering.
But his record there was mixed, analysts say. The so-called 'niche' carrier,
with 17 leased aircraft and a mere 1,200 employees, increased losses with
each year of operation. Whether Erickson can succeed in turning round TWA -
with 26,000 employees, nearly 200 aircraft and a more tangled route system -
remains an open question.
Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York, is pessimistic. He
believes the airline's days are numbered, and expects Erickson to serve as a
'caretaker' while it follows Pan American into oblivion.
If so, Erickson, who began his career 25 years ago as a senior engineer at
Pan Am, would have travelled full circle.

FT  11 APR 94 / People: Passing the baton at New York Times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Though it is a leading institution in the biggest city in the US, deep in
its heart the New York Times has always considered itself a reporters'
paper, writes Jurek Martin.
That tradition should be preserved with the passing of the executive
editor's baton from Max Frankel, in charge for the past eight years, to his
deputy Joe Lelyveld, one of its greatest foreign correspondents, and with
Lelyveld's intriguing recruitment of a new number two.
This is Eugene Roberts, an old Times-man who left to take the Philadelphia
Inquirer to new heights for 18 years (and 17 Pulitzer prizes) before
retiring to the gentler climes of Maryland University.
At 61, Roberts will not, barring accidents, succeed Lelyveld, 57, because of
the newspaper's mandatory retirement at 65. This implies some jockeying for
position among junior ranks in the years ahead, with early money on Howell
Raines, editorial page editor, and Gerald Boyd, now assistant managing
editor and the paper's senior black journalist.
Lelyveld and Roberts are a team of contrasts. The former is austere and
quite shy. Though he reported from London, New Delhi and Hong Kong and
served two glittering terms in South Africa, it is hard to imagine him
wearing a safari jacket.
Roberts, on the other hand, is the quintessential green eye-shade editor, a
throw back to the old-fashioned hard news days now under threat from the
proliferation of life-style pages that have even made their mark on the
Times.
Lelyveld, the son of a rabbi, has been groomed for the top for the past four
years and only the timing of his elevation comes as a small surprise. Not
that Max Frankel, 64, is retiring. Like his illustrious predecessor, Abe
Rosenthal, he is ascending into Times heaven as a regular columnist.

FT  11 APR 94 / People: Wilmot's hopes for multimedia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robb Wilmot, once the enfant terrible of the UK electronics industry, is
approaching 50 but his enthusiasm for all things digital seems undiminished,
writes Alan Cane.
The former chairman of International Computers is spending increasing
amounts of time in the US where he is busy starting new companies. He is
buying a residence on the West Coast but intends to keep his riverside home
in Oxfordshire.
Wilmot likes vintage boats almost as much as he likes starting companies.
Since leaving ICL in the mid-1980s, he has been the motive force behind a
slew of innovative but patchily successful ventures, including European chip
manufacturer ES2, pocket computer-maker Poquet and Oasys, recently sold to
Sybase.
Now he is caught up in the explosion of excitement over 'multimedia'. He
foresees a battle between the big equipment manufacturers and the
entrepreneurs; he is firmly on the side of the latter.
He is taking a down-to-earth approach and is eschewing grandiose schemes to
run fibre optic cable to every home in favour of ways of delivering high
quality services using the existing infrastructure - telephone lines, cable,
radio.
Others, inevitably, are focusing on the same approach. Some, like Microsoft,
are big and powerful. How does Wilmot intend to make money? 'That,' he says
cryptically, 'is the secret', and promises greater enlightenment anon.

Somewhere in France there is a very unhappy chief executive. Until recently
he had complete responsibility for the profitability of his company, part of
a multinational, in the French market.
In future, however, he is losing control of most of his marketing, and will
be completely dependent on warehouses in Belgium and Italy for his stock.
'The centre will control this company. I will be left to run a shell,' he
laments.
The anonymous manager is quoted in a big new report* on logistics in Europe
by Ernst &amp; Young, the accounting and consultancy group. His fears underline
the central finding of the survey - that the biggest barriers to modifying a
logistics system are people-related.
Logistics is a big issue for European manufacturers operating in the single
market. Many have integrated their logistics nationally but more recently
have had to decide to what extent their distribution and warehousing should
be pan-European.
For many, a completely new approach is necessary: others, probably a
minority, are right in seeing no need to make changes. Either way, it is
something companies have to think about, says Paul Bysouth, head of E&amp;Y's
supply chain practice in the UK.
Also, as barriers to business have fallen in Europe during the last decade,
companies are having to adopt concepts of 'integrated logistics' which focus
on the entire value chain - the design and co-ordination of a company's
physical network, use of suppliers and other third parties, information
technology systems and the way staff are organised and trained to think in
'integrated' terms.
The aim, says Bysouth, is to see the supply chain as a profitability issue,
where the aim is to increase service and value to the customer.
The good news from the report is that European industry understands that the
issues are important. Unfortunately, however, it seems to be tackling the
problem the wrong way.
A survey conducted for the report found that only 29 per cent of companies
had developed an integrated logistics network, with a further 11 in the
process of developing one. That leaves 60 per cent of companies which have
not integrated their logistics.
The changes which industry believes it needs to make to integrate its
logistics reveal where things may be going wrong. Sixty-seven per cent of
companies believed the best route was through IT-led integration, compared
with 18 per cent which thought their infrastructure needed changing and only
6 per cent which thought they needed to change their organisation and their
employees' attitudes.
Conversely, while excessive emphasis is being placed on IT, not enough is
being done about the real problems. Internal barriers to integration were
identified by 65 per cent of companies questioned, and 62 per cent of all
such barriers were linked to some form of resistance from staff.
The survey found a number of methods being used to overcome change, such as
training, meetings, or simply allowing 'time to heal'. But in contrast to
IT, the process is generally left unmanaged or poorly managed. What is
needed, says Bysouth, is a strong internal 'sponsor' for change, and good
communications, both internally and with customers.
That, he says, might help win over people like the disgruntled French
manager. Or the Spanish transport manager whose company is moving to
third-party hauliers, leaving him with merely a monitoring role. 'How will I
know what to do each day? How will I be able to get on with my boss when he
sits in a different country? I am just scared of what is going to happen.'

FT  11 APR 94 / Management: Nurturing the bottom line - It makes good
business sense to be a family friendly employer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIZA DONALDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do you work for a family friendly company? The concept has been familiar in
the US for some time but it should become better known in Britain from
tomorrow when the UK Association of the International Year of the Family -
part of an United Nations initiative - launches the Family Friendly
Employment Agenda.
The agenda is a 36-point consultative document, with 12 key areas, which
could eventually form the basis of a quality kitemark. Progress on the areas
to be addressed will be reported in a September conference.
The launch will take place at the London headquarters of the Midland Bank -
it started its own nursery programme in 1989 and now boasts 114 nurseries
and 60 play schemes - and has won backing from Howard Davies, director
general of the Confederation of British Industry, and John Monks, general
secretary of the Trades Union Congress, representing employers and
employees.
Joanna Foster, chair of the UK Association of the International Year of the
Family, says their support confirms that the new agenda will benefit both
sides. 'Family friendly work is now a key area. Everybody used to think this
was just about policies for women. It was marginalised, when in fact it is
about being family friendly to everybody and helping them get a better
balance between their family responsibilities and their employment
responsibilities,' she says.
So how do companies approach the new family friendly agenda? Foster says:
'Companies and organisations can use it as a benchmarking activity. I hope
very much that people will use it as an instrument for auditing, that they
will consult their men and women and look at whether they are a family
friendly organisation and will debate why it makes good business sense.'
The concept of the family friendly company is still in its infancy in the
UK, so there is little evidence of financial benefits resulting, Foster
concedes.
In the US, however, The Conference Board, which has the aims of improving
both business and the business contribution to society, has produced a
report* which finds strong evidence to suggest that 'work family programmes
can improve a company's bottom line'.
The report, which reviews research spanning 40 studies in individual
companies and a further 40 on employees drawn from a wide range of
organisations, says: 'A body of small, but consistent, research suggests
that childcare centres, parental leave policies, flexi-time and employee
assistance programmes offer some pay-back to the company.'
It suggests that family friendly policies have helped improve recruitment,
retention and performance as well as reduce absenteeism. Conversely, the
report identifies negative costs to companies that do not have family
friendly policies. These include problems with staff recruitment, retention,
productivity, absenteeism, tardiness of employees and stress when employees
experience conflicting demands between work and family. The effects on
employees of caring for elderly relatives was highlighted as a particularly
acute problem.
In the UK it is perhaps significant that the companies implementing family
friendly policies are those most likely to keep a tight rein on company
costs. They include the big four clearing banks - Midland, Barclays, Lloyds
and National Westminster.
Midland Bank, for example, used costings from the Institute of Manpower
Studies to calculate that it would cost Pounds 18,000 to replace an
assistant manager with 11-15 years' experience, including recruitment,
advertising and training. Since a nursery place costs Pounds 2,500 a year,
savings of Pounds 8,000 over four years are generated by retaining assistant
managers.
The Alliance &amp; Leicester building society, the UK's fourth largest society,
has also adopted family friendly policies. It argues that its term-time
working arrangements for parents, the option of 10 weeks' unpaid leave with
employment rights protected and flexi-time, made good business sense -
attracting and retaining quality staff.
In retailing, Boots introduced family friendly policies to reduce turnover
of its 35,000 staff by 1 per cent and therefore employee costs per head.
These measures it calculated would save Pounds 1m, or Pounds 2,850 for each
of the 350 employees. Its policies include part-time working (also for
senior staff), term-time working for 300 office staff meeting certain
criteria, job sharing, flexi-time, maternity and paternity leave, a summer
activity scheme for children and a nursery place scheme.
Despite the recession, Boots has taken a long-term strategic view of its
staffing levels and benefits, while other companies have preferred
short-term options, such as reducing staff numbers or, for example, relaxing
childcare provision.
The company now has 50 per cent of women on maternity leave returning,
compared with 7 per cent four years ago.
Boots does not just calculate policy benefits in financial terms - it
believes staff commitment and loyalty are as valuable, if more difficult to
quantify.
Becton Dickinson is a previous winner of the Working Mothers Association's
Employer of the Year Award**. The company manufactures medical care products
such as syringes, surgical instruments and gloves and has 650 employees on
sites in Plymouth and Oxford. It has introduced a committee which reviews
family friendly policies and makes recommendations on reconciling family and
work-related problems.
Foster says such committees provide an important consultative mechanism
which is advocated in the agenda. She stresses, for example, the importance
of consulting employees before introducing a new family friendly policy. 'It
is no good saying that 'we are going to have a nursery' if nobody wants
one.'
Neil Gibbs, UK human resources manager at Becton Dickinson, admits that the
company culture favoured moves towards flexi-time, job sharing, part-time
work, employee counselling, family illness days, leave for sick dependents
and maternity information packs. He says managers still had to adapt to the
changes - for example, viewing the positive elements of changes such as job
sharing took time. Now, instead of seeing two job sharers in terms of two
people to manage rather than one, the company emphasises the benefit of two
brains for the price of one.
Simon Sperryn, chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, whose 3,000 members employ 500,000 people, says: 'I think Britain
has a problem compared with the rest of the EU. We have the highest rate of
divorce and the lowest level of childcare. That is a fairly rotten start.'
Peter Moss, senior research officer and co-ordinator for the Thomas Coram
Research Unit, which investigates family life and employment issues, points
out that there is more than the bottom line to be considered. Kids' Clubs
Network, which campaigns for more out-of-school playcare, says one in five
children are 'latch-key' children. It says there are only 1,000
out-of-school clubs in existence, while 25,000 are needed.
Foster says companies and employees need to rethink the concept of work to
cope with today's family and social pressures. She points to the fact that
one in seven adults are responsible for the care of elderly relatives.
Changes in employment requirements - government figures suggest that women
will make up 80 per cent of the labour force by the year 2006 - also need to
be considered, she says.
'We have some blue-chip leaders who see that this is important in terms of
capitalising on the investment and development potential of their people,'
she says. 'But there is a massive revolution still to be done.'

FT  11 APR 94 / Business Travel: Run around history - Joggers' Guide to
Istanbul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE COUNSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Istanbul caters well for the moderately serious to fanatical jogger. The
more casual runner, however, is likely to be deterred by the effort and
energy required to seek out, locate and then get round its widely dispersed
parks and recreational areas.
Jogging in the streets is not advisable, even for those with maximum life
insurance and full medical protection plans. The risk factor is high, the
enjoyment value nil. Traffic is heavy and drivers hold pedestrians in
contempt. On top of that, there are steep hills, poorly lit streets,
precipitous pavements (where they exist) and uneven surfaces.
So head for the public parks and recreation areas, many of which are a taxi
ride away. The municipal public parks are reasonably well-maintained, with
varying ratios of paved pathways to grassy areas.
On the European side, there is Yildiz park. The open spaces and greenery in
the grounds of its namesake palace are a 15-minute taxi drive from the main
hotels. Gulhane park incorporates a small zoo.
Many of the larger parks have, or are near, kiosks and cafes, where lost
fluids can be replaced with fresh juices. The smaller 'parks' tend to be
paved squares in elongated roundabouts or traffic junctions, such as Taksim
 -sufficient for a short, if uninspiring, stretch of the legs.
Emirgan park and Naciye Sultan Kurucesme are good running areas close to the
Movenpick hotel in the business district, where the new stock exchange and
bond market are being built.
On the Asian side of the Bosporus are the Beykoz Abraham Pasa park, the
Gubukla and Gamlica parks and, out towards the airport, the Florya Ataturk
Ormani coastal recreation area.
If you can manage only one outing, set aside an afternoon to visit Belgrad
Ormani (the Belgrade forests), about 45 minutes from the city centre. Among
the wooded picnic and amenity areas, you can take a jog around history - the
seven Byzantine and Ottoman reservoirs - and admire the breathtaking Moglova
aqueduct. It should be avoided at weekends, however, when picnickers clog
the more pleasant areas with campfires and barbecues.
If jogging does not appeal, the five-star hotels all have swimming pools
and/or well-equipped health and fitness centres. The pools at the Swissotel
and Dedeman are the best for length swimmers.
For replenishing energy levels, the health-conscious will find that dried
fruits, including figs, apricots, mulberries and sultanas, are readily
available. Most food stalls and shops offer light, unprocessed yoghurt and
untreated nuts.
While in Istanbul, take advantage of the continuing weakness of the lira to
stock up on sports wear. An extensive range of branded sports apparel is
made in Turkey under licence. The choice is wide, the quality good and
prices low, at about TL730,000 (Pounds 19) for Reebok running shoes and
TL450,000 for Adidas lightweight jogging trousers.

Istanbul Municipality, tel: 514 0882

FT  11 APR 94 / Business Travel: A passenger's kinda town - Chicago's
airports act as a gateway to the rest of the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The steady globalisation of trade and the stirrings of economic recovery in
the US and Europe are bringing more business travellers to America's
heartland. For most of them, Chicago is the gateway to other, less populous
destinations.
Although there are cheap flights to other US destinations from Chicago's
O'Hare Airport, travellers should consider using the city's second airport,
Midway. Served by 16 domestic airlines, many of which are short-haul
carriers with cut-rate prices, Midway gives budget-conscious business
travellers easy access to places such as Detroit, Kansas City, St Louis, New
Orleans and Dallas.
And for weary travellers concluding business in Chicago and looking for a
warm-weather holiday destination, Midway offers a handful of carriers, with
names such as Kiwi and Private Jet, which specialise in flights to Florida.
These airlines can be more flexible than the big carriers, making it
possible to reserve a seat to Florida on notice of a day or two for a
round-trip fare as low as Dollars 200.
Midway is a no-frills airport. The one-storey terminal is a second world war
relic with only two restaurants and, because it is offers only domestic
flights, no duty-free shops. Conference rooms and business services are not
available.
However, flights from Midway have a better record for departing on time than
those from O'Hare, and the terminal, which served 6.3m passengers last year
compared with O'Hare's 66m, is less congested and quicker to pass through.
Midway is an island, 30 miles south of O'Hare and a 20-minute drive south of
downtown Chicago. It was connected by rail to the city centre late last
year. You can board a Chicago Transit Authority train (the orange line) in
downtown Chicago and, for Dollars 1.50, ride to Midway in about 30 minutes.
The trains are the newest in Chicago, and have special racks for luggage. At
Midway, there is a five-minute walk through a covered walkway from the train
stop to the airport.
Any travellers with stamina and light luggage can - for the same Dollars
1.50 - board a CTA train in O'Hare airport (the blue line), travel into
Chicago, change to the orange-line train at the new, Helmut Jahn-designed
State of Illinois building (the Clark/Lake stop) and continue south to
Midway in about 90 minutes.
Midway can also be reached from Chicago by scheduled minibus service from
most downtown hotels for about Dollars 10, while a taxi ride takes about 40
minutes and costs about Dollars 25.
Construction on the main highway leading to Midway this summer will extend
driving times to more than an hour, making the train an attractive
alternative. Long-term parking is available at the airport for Dollars 6 a
day.
Once at Midway, travellers have their pick of some of the most
entrepreneurial airlines in the US. Southwest Airlines is the leader: for
the past three years, the Dallas-based carrier has won the US Department of
Transportation's designation as best US airline for on-time performance, for
baggage handling and for fewest customer complaints. Its success has forced
the big carriers to rethink their policy and pricing on competitive routes,
generating cuts in fares to many US destinations.
International business travellers who have to use O'Hare can still benefit
from these cut-rate domestic flights. American, United Airlines and other
large US carriers now offer flights from O'Hare to other US cities at prices
designed to compete with their Midway-based rivals.
Connections to these domestic flights can be made by taking the 'people
mover' from O'Hare's new international terminal to domestic terminals two
and three. The light-rail transit ride between terminals takes about five
minutes and is free.

FT  11 APR 94 / Business Travel (Update): 777 unveiled
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Boeing, the US aircraft manufacturer, raised the curtain on Saturday on its
new twin-engine 777 aircraft, the company's most ambitious development
project since the 747 jumbo jet.
Boeing executives said they saw the wide-body 777 as the beginning of a
'family of airplanes' that will meet airline needs for the next 30-50 years,
and maintain the company's worldwide 65 per cent market share against rivals
Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas.
The aircraft is scheduled to make its initial flight in the first week of
June. The first commercial model is to be delivered to United Airlines in
May 1995.
Boeing so far has received 147 orders for the aircraft, which sells for
between Dollars 116m and Dollars 140m. Analysts have said Boeing needs to
sell about 300 aircraft to break even on the initial production cost, which
they have estimated at Dollars 4bn - a sum being shared by three Japanese
manufacturers.

FT  11 APR 94 / Business Travel (Update): Detection of bombs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's first automatic bomb detection system for airline luggage is
being installed by BAA, which runs most UK airports.
The new equipment - devised on government orders after the 1988 bombing of a
Pan Am aircraft over Scotland - uses computerised X-ray machinery to analyse
materials and match them to profiles of explosives, says BAA. A suspect bag
will be examined by sensors that detect explosives' vapours.
BAA says the equipment can check up to 20 bags a minute and will not prolong
existing check-in procedures. The system will be positioned in the
baggage-sorting area, to examine luggage after it has been checked in.
The system has been on trial at Glasgow airport and will initially be
installed at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports to check international
transit baggage.
It will be installed to screen all hold luggage at BAA's seven airports by
1996 at a cost of Pounds 150m (Dollars 220m).

The Nottingham Evening Post and its sister magazine, the weekly Longeaton
Advertiser, are up for sale.
A spokesman for T. Bailey Forman, which owns the family-controlled titles,
said the shareholders were 'evaluating some recent offers'.
If none of the offers were considered 'exceptional' the titles would remain
in the ownership of the current shareholders.
Staff at the Post yesterday said they had been given no more details.
The newspaper has been owned since the end of the last century by the Forman
Hardy family which also has local brewing, farming and property interests.
Mr Nicholas Forman Hardy took charge of the business four years ago.
In 1976 the Post became the first UK newspaper to be produced by journalists
using direct inputting on computers. Other papers quickly followed.

FT  11 APR 94 / Financial services 'more confident'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The volume and value of business in the financial services sector rose
sharply in the first quarter of this year, although not as sharply as
expected, the Confederation of British Industry says today.
The quarterly CBI and Coopers &amp; Lybrand financial services survey shows an
overall rise in business confidence. However, the 'disappointment gap'
between expected and actual performance was reflected in a fall in
confidence, or a flat response, among general insurers and building
societies. Securities traders also reported a fall in confidence.
Although volumes of business across the sector rose at almost the fastest
rate for more than four years, that too included a variety of results.
For the sector as a whole, the survey found that business with private
individuals had increased in the first quarter and was expected to rise in
the second quarter, in spite of tax increases.
Mr Sudhir Janankar, CBI economics associate director, said 'the impact of
tax increases may not have been fully taken on board' by those taking part
in the survey.
The pace of job cuts fell to the lowest rate since December 1990. But
optimism about employment prospects remains clouded because only smaller
employers are planning to create jobs. Large employers are experiencing only
a slowing in job losses.

FT  11 APR 94 / Fimbra to raise fears over PIA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concerns from Fimbra, the self-regulating organisation for independent
financial advisers, about the new watchdog to protect private investors are
to be raised today with Mr Anthony Nelson, the junior Treasury minister.
Fimbra will tell Mr Nelson of its doubts about arrangements for handing over
its responsibilities to the Personal Investment Authority.
Giving evidence last month to the cross-party inquiry by MPs into financial
regulation, Sir Kenneth Clucas, Fimbra chairman, stressed that Fimbra was
urging independent financial advisers to apply to come under the new
regulator.
It was a report by Sir Kenneth that originally proposed the establishment of
a single regulating organisation to cover all retail financial services.
But continuing uncertainties about how much support the PIA will attract
have led some Fimbra council members to question whether they should
acquiesce to their organisation being wound up before the PIA's future is
assured.
The Fimbra concerns relate to matters such as the transfer of assets and
liabilities, but also reflect a deeper anxiety about the PIA. Mr Nelson is
expected to tell Fimbra that it will definitely go ahead.
The meeting will take place on the same day that Lord Oliver of Aylmerton,
who was appointed by SIB, begins hearing representations appealing for the
continuance of the existing regulators, as a part of the formal process
before they can be wound up. The hearings are to last about six weeks.

FT  11 APR 94 / US bids are sought in coal sell-off
</HEADLINE>

US mining groups could become owners of significant parts of the British
coal industry if a government marketing drive in the US succeeds.
A decade after the year-long miners' strike over pit closures, the
government's financial advisers are hoping to attract US groups to buy parts
of British Coal when it is privatised by early next year. Details of the
privatisation are to be published later this week.
Government advisers believe US companies are the most likely among overseas
groups to tender to buy parts of British Coal, in spite of the sharp fall in
demand for coal in the UK. Bids from abroad would considerably raise the
selling prices of the five regional groupings of pits to be sold.
The number of UK companies considering bids is growing, but so far only two
foreign groups have expressed interest publicly. Both are North American.
Jim Walter Resources, of the US, is part of a consortium involving the Union
of Democratic Mineworkers that is considering making bids.
Alcan, the Canadian aluminium company, has teamed up with Ryan Group of the
UK to study the feasibility of a bid for the north-east region.
The government, advised by NM Rothschild, hopes to stir interest among other
US companies such as Consol, Cypress Amax, Ashland Coal and Ziegler.
Companies all over the world will be sent details of the sale. However, it
is thought that the South Africans will be constrained because of their
shortage of foreign exchange. And Australian companies such as BHP are
believed to be more interested in extending their Asian interests than in
the UK coal industry.
The US coal industry is in a period of consolidation, with many energy
companies selling coal properties that do not perform as well as other
businesses.
Mr Paul Chellgren, president of Ashland Oil, which owns 41 per cent of
Ashland Coal and has an interest in Arch Minerals, another US coal producer,
said US companies might be interested in bidding for British Coal
properties, but only under certain conditions.
He said: 'If the purchase opportunity came with guaranteed sales contracts
with prices and volumes that would allow the properties to generate gross
margins, I'm sure there would be some interest.'
British Coal has contracts to sell more than 30m tonnes of coal a year to UK
electricity generators, but the contracts expire in 1998.
Another coal company executive said: 'We will take a look at anything
offered to us but we are unlikely to make a bid for companies that do not
have long-term contracts. It comes down to what price they are willing to
take.'

FT  11 APR 94 / Regional voices with Whitehall's ear: Appointment of 10
civil servants to oversee urban funds wins guarded welcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, JOHN WILLMAN and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten new government regional offices open their doors today to provide
businesses, local authorities and voluntary bodies with a single point of
access to the Pounds 1.4bn annual budget for urban regeneration in England.
Each is headed by a senior civil servant who will act as regional director
for the departments of employment, environment, transport, and trade and
industry.
They will administer more than Pounds 3bn a year of government programmes on
behalf of each of the four government departments.
According to Sir George Young, the environment minister, the regional
directors will act as 'the eyes and ears' of the government in the regions.
But they will also provide a strong regional voice in Whitehall, he
believes, strengthening the input of the regions into policymaking. 'They
will be the people that local people can do business with,' he said. 'They
in turn will feed their opinions and experiences into the policy process.'
The move has been generally welcomed in the regions by business and local
government, in spite of worries over whether the offices will have the
freedom to make a difference.
The theory of devolving decision making and listening to local views
commands strong support in the north-east. But there are doubts about just
how much will change.
'It's a good idea in principle,' said Mr Jeremy Beecham, leader of
Labour-controlled Newcastle upon Tyne City council and chairman of the
Association of Metropolitan Authorities. But he has doubts over many aspects
of the new approach, including the absence of guidelines for bidding and the
unclear role of the training and enterprise councils (Tecs).
'I would be far from happy if Tecs were meant in some way to be in the
driving seat for regeneration,' he said. 'They have no legitimacy or
accountability for that role.'
Mr Derek Horsfield, chief executive of the Tyne and Wear Development
Company, which is funded by land investments and the property portfolio it
inherited from the defunct Tyne and Wear County Council, worries that not
enough has been done to merge different Whitehall interests.
'We need a single organisation, effectively a regional development
organisation, government-led with input from local politicians,' Mr
Horsfield said. 'Why didn't they roll them up into one super-ministry? They
have missed a great opportunity.'
Birmingham will be home to the west Midlands regional office, whose
director, Mr David Ritchie, has been featured in half-page advertisements in
local newspapers to drum up interest.
There are political misgivings in the region about the attempt to strengthen
the government's regional administration, even if, as Mr Ritchie suggested,
'it is not about taking powers away from local government. It is about
taking decisions down from Whitehall to a more local level.'
Mrs Theresa Stewart, Birmingham's Labour leader, finds a 'democratic
deficit' in what she calls 'regional government with neither answerability
nor accountability'. However, she conceded that integration of government
offices is 'probably useful' for administrative purposes.
In spite of the Pounds 1.4bn total in the single urban regeneration budget,
the regional offices will have little to distribute this year, since most of
the money is already committed to existing projects. There will be about
Pounds 100m to be awarded in the bidding round for next year, which begins
in the autumn.
The north-east expects to get between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m in the first
year. Newcastle's Mr Beecham worries about the time and effort which will be
spent on bidding for relatively small sums.
Mr Neil Etherington, chief executive of Teesside Tomorrow, a business
leadership team supported by 65 of Cleveland's big companies, said he hoped
that the pot would grow if the new unified budget was seen to work.
'While Pounds 100m doesn't seem a lot of money one would hope political
pragmatism would follow the quality of the bids. If we are up to the job the
money should be up to the mark,' he said.
In Birmingham there are hopes that the new regional offices will help in
obtaining the Pounds 300m of European Regional Development Fund money
available for declining industrial regions.
'Increasingly, when you're looking at European Union money, the way in which
it is looked at and distributed is on a regional basis,' said Ms Sue Battle,
deputy chief executive of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce.
But there remains scepticism over how much will really change. Previous
experience suggests the offices will be advocates, selectively, of the
region in Whitehall.
If the regional directors are to contribute local views to the formation of
government policy, that raises the question of the independence of civil
servants, another observer commented. 'It would be helpful if we had an
outspoken, charismatic maverick,' he remarked. 'We have our own corner to
fight and we need somebody who is pretty good with a pair of gloves on.'

FT  11 APR 94 / More arrests expected in mortgage fraud probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Police are expected to arrest several individuals early this week at the end
of an investigation into one of the UK's largest mortgage frauds.
The action would follow arrests and charges brought last Thursday and Friday
against more than a dozen people linked to an alleged fraud connected to the
collapsed Harrovian Group, the development company based in Harrow, north
London.
A total of up to 18 people are expected to be charged after a three-year
investigation by the Metropolitan Police fraud squad since Harrovian's
failure in 1991.
The total sums involved in the fraud could be as large as Pounds 100m, and
have triggered payments from the Solicitors' Compensation Fund believed to
be between Pounds 30m and Pounds 40m.
At the end of last week police brought a total of 101 charges against 13
people from the home counties, mostly on grounds of conspiracy to defraud
various banks and building societies. Barclays Bank is believed to have lost
about Pounds 10m.
Of those arrested late last week, Mr William Johnston, 36, described as a
consultant, of Kenton, north-west London, was charged on 22 counts of
conspiracy to defraud banks and financial institutions.
Mr Guy Lucas, 38, was also charged with 22 offences.
Mr Andrew Trowbridge, 50, a surveyor from Bushey, Hertfordshire, faces 17
related charges, and Mr David James, 40, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, who
is unemployed, faces 11 charges. A second surveyor, Mr Colin Pryke, 39, has
been charged with three fraud-related offences.
Mr Frank Bradbury, 57, from Beaconsfield, who is unemployed, faces eight
charges. Mr Gerald Dunleavy, 40, unemployed, of Ipswich, and Mr Paul Keeler,
40, a financial consultant, of Bexhill, face six charges. Harrow residents
Mr John Campbell, 58, a consultant, Mrs Beryl O'Shea, 37, a housewife, and
her husband Mr Lee O'Shea, 34, a taxi driver, each face one charge.
Mrs Valerie Milsom, 29, of Kenton, faces two charges of securing the
execution of a valuable security, and her husband Mr Martin Milsom, 32,
faces one similar charge.
Those charged will appear at Bow Street magistrates' court for a further
hearing on July 5.

FT  11 APR 94 / Further fixed-rate mortgage rise likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nationwide, the UK's second-largest building society, is this week likely to
raise the rate it offers to borrowers for fixed-rate mortgages.
Other leading societies are also keeping their rate under close and constant
review. 'Twenty-four hours is now a long time for a fixed-rate mortgage
offer,' said one.
Last week Halifax building society, the UK's largest, increased its
fixed-rate mortgage offers by up to 0.75 of a percentage point.
While societies' variable rate mortgages are funded through retail savings,
fixed-rate mortgages are funded from the wholesale money market.
Mr David Gilchrist, Halifax corporate development manager, said he believed
that the significant adjustment in fixed-rate offers had now taken place and
that there would not be much further change.
About half of societies' new lending is estimated to be through fixed-rate
mortgages.
Their continued popularity has led some societies to renew their questioning
of the approach to lending adopted by the Building Societies Commission, the
sector's statutory regulator.
Last year it issued a draft guidance note proposing a limit on fixed-rate
lending of 20 per cent of a society's commercial assets. That draft is still
under discussion. There are no similar constraints on banks' fixed-rate
lending.

FT  11 APR 94 / Mixed performance by financial services sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The volume and value of business in the financial services sector rose
sharply in the first quarter of this year, although not as sharply as was
expected, says a survey published today.
The quarterly CBI and Coopers &amp; Lybrand financial services survey showed an
overall rise in business confidence among respondents. Within that total,
however, the 'disappointment gap' between expected and actual performance
was reflected in a fall in confidence, or a flat response, among general
insurers and building societies. Securities traders also reported a fall in
confidence, because of an expected fall in profitability.
Although volumes of business across the sector rose at almost the fastest
rate for more than four years, that too included a variety of results.
Many elements, including banks, securities traders, fund managers and
insurance brokers, saw business volumes rise strongly. But building
societies saw a fall in business volumes in spite of expectations of an
increase.
For the sector as a whole, the survey found that business with private
individuals had increased in the first quarter and was expected to rise in
the second quarter, in spite of the tax increases which came into effect
last week.
Mr Sudhir Janankar, CBI economics associate director, said 'the impact of
tax increases may not have been fully taken on board' by those taking part
in the survey.
The pace of job cuts fell to the lowest rate since December 1990. But
optimism about employment prospects remains clouded since only smaller
employers are planning to create jobs. Large employers are experiencing only
a slowing in job losses.

FT  11 APR 94 / Managers' pay rises 'lowest since 1975'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN WHEELER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Management pay rises have averaged only 2.8 per cent during the past 12
months, the lowest level recorded by The Reward Group pay analysts since
1975.
In its survey of management salaries, Reward said the average figure for the
past four months was down to 2.3 per cent.
The figures, based on 19,864 job recordings, put managers about 0.1 per cent
behind clerical and operative staff for the past four months, but slightly
ahead for the year as a whole.
Mr Steve Flather, managing director of Reward, said the survey 'confirmed
the continuing low level of pay increases for management'. He predicted that
low inflation and high unemployment would mean that 'there is unlikely to be
a wage explosion in the short term'.
Reward is expecting data for the next 12 months to show a healthier
increase. It forecasts a rise of about 3.2 per cent for the next year.
Reward also reports that London is the highest paying region and the west
Midlands the lowest, while Scotland defies the north-south comparison by
being the third highest paying area.
The survey shows that the energy sector provides the highest comparative pay
levels, with metal-goods manufacture the lowest.

FT  11 APR 94 / Ex-Matrix chief in venture with Tory MP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paul Henderson, the businessman at the centre of the Matrix Churchill
case, has launched a business venture with a Tory MP who is a former
minister at the Department of Trade and Industry.
It is Mr Henderson's first venture since the collapse in November 1992 of
his trial for alleged breaches of export regulations.
Mr Henderson has teamed up with Mr John Butcher, MP for Coventry South West,
and Mr Peter Brasier, a merchant banker, to take an 88 per cent stake in
Production Systems International. The company, which had annual turnover of
Pounds 3.5m last year and was formerly called Ryefast, has interests in
welding machines and waterjet cutting equipment. The terms of the takeover,
completed last month, were not disclosed.
Mr Butcher's tie-up with Matrix's former managing director puts him at
apparent loggerheads with Lord Trefgarne, a former trade and defence
minister, who told the Scott inquiry into the Matrix Churchill affair on
March 30 that Mr Henderson had deceived him about the true purpose of
machine tools sold to Iraq. This was immediately denied by Mr Henderson's
solicitor.
Mr Butcher said he was delighted to be working with Mr Henderson. 'I knew
that Paul would re-emerge to run a company which would exemplify the best
practices of industrial management,' he said.
Mr Henderson disclosed yesterday that he had been contacted by Mr Butcher
within a day of the end of his trial, where he was found not guilty. The two
men have known each other for about 12 years.
Together with Mr Brasier, the two men have undertaken a year-long search for
the right opportunity in UK manufacturing industry. 'We looked at about four
or five companies, and went to the wire with one of them,' said Mr
Henderson.
Mr Butcher will be chairman of PSI, with Mr Henderson and Mr Brasier as
chief executive and corporate finance director respectively.
Mr Henderson said he had great hopes for the company, which owns Welding
Machines Automated, a loss-making welding specialist, and Cox &amp; Wright,
which makes materials cutting technology.
Overall, the company broke even last year, but Mr Henderson is confident
profits will rise as sales and marketing is improved. His target is annual
sales of Pounds 6m to Pounds 7m by the end of next year. Since taking over
the company last month the directors have introduced new working capital and
restructured the management.
Mr Henderson plans to raise profitability at Welding Machines Automated by
introducing some standardisation into the product range. He hopes Cox &amp;
Wright can benefit as a niche player in the market for waterjet cutting
machines, which cut everything from cakes to titanium using a high-pressure
band of water.

FT  11 APR 94 / Let-down for lift-truck brothers: The 1983 takeover of a
German company has come back to haunt the founders of Lancer Boss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a bitter irony for Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw and his younger brother
Trevor in the receivership of much of Lancer Boss Group, the
Bedfordshire-based lift-truck producer which they founded and own.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Lancer Boss acquired a reputation for
being pipped at the post in the takeovers which created the big players in
the world lift-truck industry.
It finally broke its duck in 1983 with the purchase of the virtually
bankrupt Steinbock in Germany. Other acquisitions in Spain, Italy and France
followed, and by the early 1990s Lancer Boss had reached the top 10 in an
industry where a wide product range and geographical diversity are
increasingly important. It has latterly slipped to 13th.
Now however, the Steinbock acquisition has returned to haunt Sir Neville.
The German company is understood to be in a form of receivership after
German banks took issue with his plans to expand the group. Several British
subsidiaries have been put into receivership in consequence and Sir Neville,
the chairman, has lost his executive powers.
The brothers have weathered many setbacks in the past 37 years, but nothing
quite like this. Sir Neville, who sold encyclopedias after leaving the army,
and his brother, who sold vacuum cleaners, started importing Dutch-built
sidelift trucks in 1957.
Within a year they had parted company with their supplier. With the help of
some engineering drawing books from WH Smith they began designing their own
equipment. The front axle fell off their first machine the day after it was
delivered but a decade of rapid growth followed.
It nearly went under in 1974 because of over-expansion and supply problems
on components, and a period of retrenchment followed before the European
expansion of the mid-1980s and early 1990s.
Sir Neville has criticised the 'bloodlust' of bankers who went for the
company's jugular in 1974, but yesterday he stressed that the recent
behaviour of his British banks, led by National Westminster, was 'excellent
and beyond reproach'.
Steinbock's German banks, however, objected to the outside investors with
which Sir Neville had been negotiating on expanding the group, and withdrew
their support. Sir Neville had no option but to call in the receivers to
protect the UK companies.
The debacle is a personal tragedy for the Bowman-Shaws, but will almost
certainly not be the end of the Lancer Boss story.
Innovative new products are to be launched next week and Mr Allan Rawnsley,
a consultant on the industry, believes interest in the company from rival
lift-truck producers and other companies could be 'red hot'.
He suggested Jungheinrich of Germany would be attracted by Lancer Boss,
whose internal combustion-engined trucks would complement its own strong
position in electric trucks. Toyota of Japan, which through Toyoda Loom is
the world's second-biggest producer, may be lured by the prospect of a
stronger base in Europe.
Such a deal may not necessarily spell doom for all the 700 UK employees of
Lancer Boss. Sir Neville points out that Leighton Buzzard is the cheapest
manufacturing location in the group, and one observer even suggested that a
long-awaited manufacturing reorganisation at Leighton Buzzard, replacing
several small plants with one big new factory, may at last go ahead.
If it does, however, it will be under new - possibly foreign - owners,
ending large-scale UK ownership in the industry. Lancer Boss's great UK
rival, Lansing Bagnall, was bought by Linde in 1989, and as Lansing Linde is
now an integral part of the German company's global strategy.

FT  11 APR 94 / Speculation on Major is over says Fowler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, insisted yesterday that the
speculation about the prime minister's future had 'faded away'.
As MPs prepared to return to the Commons tomorrow after the Easter recess
Sir Norman tried to damp talk of a leadership challenge which had been
fuelled by calls from backbenchers for Mr John Major to resign.
The prime minister gave a robust defence of his leadership in an interview
with the Mail on Sunday. He said: 'Some people equate what they call strong
leadership with not consulting your colleagues, not listening to other
people and sometimes with noise rather than substance. I do not.'
Mr Major went on to warn that he would not change his policy, style or
objectives to appease his critics. He stressed that he was not 'overly
concerned' with his own position.
Sir Norman said on BBC television's Breakfast With Frost programme that he
was happy with the prime minister's position. He said: 'I think what the
Conservative party wants is to get behind the prime minister. I think that
all the stuff about leadership has faded away and what we want to do is to
get into the election and get into the real issues of the election itself.'
He dismissed talk of a leadership challenge.
Sir Norman was criticised privately by some backbenchers for predicting that
the Tories would gain seats in the local government elections on May 5. A
survey in yesterday's Sunday Times predicted the Tories could lose up to 329
seats in the council elections.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, denied that speculation over Mr
Major's leadership had faded away.
But he played down Labour's chances of success at the local elections. 'We
expect to do well in terms of the share of the vote, but it is an
arithmetical fact that it is extremely difficult for us to win more seats in
some areas,' he said.
Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat president, said his party was 'very
cautious' about its prospects for the elections, but because it did badly in
1990 it would expect 'modest improvements'.

FT  11 APR 94 / Works council 'hit list' drawn up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'hit list' of transnational companies operating in the UK has been drawn
up by unions. The TUC claims these companies will have to introduce
company-wide works councils for employees by 1996 under a European Union
draft directive.
The measure is expected to be approved by all EU states, except the UK, by
the end of this year. However, many companies in the UK will be directly
affected. Under the directive every company or industrial group employing at
least 1,000 workers in the EU with 100 workers in at least two member states
will have to introduce a works council. This will cover mainland-owned
companies with plants in Britain but also British-owned transnationals with
operations on the mainland.
UK unions have already established steering committees in preparation for
the works councils with their mainland colleagues in 12 British-owned
enterprises. These are Unilever, Coats Viyella, Reed International Elsevier,
Cadbury Schweppes, Watmoughs Holdings, Ferguson International Holdings, BPB,
Lucas Industries, GKN, United Biscuits, Guinness and GEC-Alsthom.
In a further nine companies UK unions have already met their mainland
equivalents. These are BET, Rolls-Royce, Pilkington, BAT Industries,
Redland, Hillsdown Holdings, Securicor group, ICI and Meyer International.
Five more British companies are also being targetted by the European unions.
These are SmithKline Beecham, Bowater, Glaxo Holdings, Blue Circle
Industries and Clark C and J.
Mr Nick Clark, co-ordinator of the British union works council campaign with
a Pounds 190,000 grant from the EU, estimates that 12 mainland-owned
transnationals already have UK union representatives involved in their works
councils. They are Elf Aquitaine, Generale des Eaux, BSN, Renault, Kone,
Pechiney, Thomson CSF and Thomson Elec, Bull, Asaea Brown-Boveri, Nestle and
Rhone Poulenc.
As many as a further 34 mainland transnationals have UK unions on joint
union steering committees preparing for the works councils.
In a further 16 companies UK union officials have attended meetings with
their mainland colleagues.

FT  11 APR 94 / Managers' pay rises 'lowest since 1975'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN WHEELER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Management pay rises have averaged only 2.8 per cent during the past 12
months, the lowest level recorded by The Reward Group pay analysts since
1975.
In its survey of management salaries, Reward said the average figure for the
past four months was down to 2.3 per cent. The figures, based on 19,864 job
recordings, put managers about 0.1 per cent behind clerical and operative
staff for the past four months, but slightly ahead for the year.
Mr Steve Flather, managing director of Reward, said the survey 'confirmed
the continuing low level of pay increases for management'. He predicted low
inflation and high unemployment meant there was 'unlikely to be a wage
explosion in the short term'.
London is the highest paying region and the west Midlands the lowest.

FT  11 APR 94 / Harsher crime penalties opposed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Harsher prison sentences would not cut crime, Ms Anne Mace, chair of the
Association of Chief Officers of Probation, said yesterday presenting the
association's annual report.
Consistent policies aimed at gaining positive behaviour changes had
apparently been replaced, 'by a populist sound-bite campaign, characterised
by the slogan 'prison works''.
She said that harsher penalties were largely irrelevant to crime levels, and
the US was a salutary reminder of the limited use of more prisons to tackle
rising crime.

FT  11 APR 94 / Carrier drawings contract awarded
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Conmarque Engineering, set up in February in Tyne &amp; Wear, has won a
six-figure contract to produce working drawings for the helicopter carrier
order awarded by the Ministry of Defence to VSEL, based in
Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.
The chairman-designate of Conmarque is Mr Ken Chapman, a former managing
director of Swan Hunter, and one of the 'gang of four' who re-privatised the
shipyard in 1986. Swans went into receivership last May after it lost the
order for the helicopter carrier to rivals VSEL.
The work was placed by Clyde-based Kvaerner, VSEL's subcontractor for the
helicopter carrier's initial construction, with Isle of Man-based Sutton
Engineering, a substantial stakeholder in Conmarque, on the basis that the
work would be carried out by Conmarque.

FT  11 APR 94 / Pounds 50m revamp for Selfridges store
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sears, the retailing group, is planning to spend Pounds 50m over three years
on its Selfridges department store in London's Oxford Street.
The 450,000 sq ft store has some of the highest sales densities in Europe in
its ground floor cosmetics departments. But average sales per sq ft, at
between Pounds 400 and Pounds 500 a year, are low compared with other Oxford
Street stores.
One problem is that inside the store is an irregularly shaped building which
customers cannot circulate easily. To improve customer flows more than half
the Pounds 50m will be spent on structural changes.

FT  11 APR 94 / Unions urge Pounds 4 per hour minimum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour is under pressure from some union leaders to set a figure for its
national minimum wage as high as Pounds 4.05 an hour, Roland Rudd writes.
However, the party said such a figure would never gain support on its
national executive committee. It added: 'There is a document which
underlines current party policy. There are no proposals in it to change
policy and there is no proposal to set a figure for a national minimum
wage.'
Labour faced criticism during the last general election over its policy of a
national minimum wage of Pounds 3.40 an hour and any suggestion that the
level be set at more than this would prove controversial.
The Confederation of British Industry has warned that a minimum wage could
cost industry up to Pounds 50bn a year, with the loss of 100,000 jobs.
Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, fiercely defended the party's
commitment to a minimum wage on ITV's Walden programme yesterday.
He said: 'It's not been proven yet that it will cost any jobs.'

FT  11 APR 94 / Consumer credit holds up despite tax rise fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Borrowing by consumers appeared to hold up well in February in spite of
publicity about the negative impact on disposable incomes of this month's
tax increases.
Two reports published today point to a strong increase in borrowing to
finance car purchases and increased borrowing for other high-value items
compared with the year before.
Infolink, a credit information organisation, said February's credit demand
continued 'to suggest a steady economic improvement'. The Finance &amp; Leasing
Association said its February consumer credit figures were 'the strongest
since the recession began', although Mr Tony Mallin, chairman, warned that
members were concerned about whether the recovery could be sustained in the
wake of higher taxes.
The association, which represents providers of 80 per cent of consumer
credit and about 30 per cent of finance for investment in plant and
equipment, reported that consumer credit in February totalled Pounds 1.24bn,
a 49 per cent increase compared with February 1993. Consumers borrowed
Pounds 567m to buy cars, an increase of 58 per cent compared with the year
before, while association members reported a 35 per cent year-on-year
increase in personal loans to Pounds 191m and 47 per cent growth in retail
credit to Pounds 373m compared with February 1993.
Infolink, which estimates consumer credit demand through the number of
credit inquiries it receives, reported a 16.7 per cent increase in requests
for new car loans in February compared with the same period last year. But
requests for credit from finance houses and retail outlets showed weaker
growth of 9.3 per cent and 5.9 per cent respectively compared with February
last year.
The association's figures for February showed 4 per cent growth in consumer
credit compared with January. While personal loans, secured loans and car
finance increased between January and February, retail credit was down 9 per
cent over the month. 'This was to be expected following heavy discounting in
the January sales,' the association said. Business finance and leasing
totalled Pounds 920m in February, up 13 per cent compared with February 1993
but down 12 per cent from January, it said.
The Central Statistical Office publishes figures for consumer borrowing in
February today, which, unlike the association's data, are seasonally
adjusted.
The consensus of City economists polled last week by MMS International, a
financial information company, points to a slight increase in net consumer
credit to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 250m in February from Pounds 235m in
January.

FT  11 APR 94 / Imports anger mushroom growers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British mushroom prices are being undermined by cheap Irish imports which
has led to about 1,000 job losses since 1988, UK growers say.
The European Commission called on the Irish government to stop illegal tax
breaks for its mushroom growers by the end of last week. It is still
investigating the legality of a Pounds 1.3m market development fund which
was set up to help Irish producers compete after the devaluation of sterling
in 1992.
Mushroom production in the Irish Republic has increased by 92 per cent since
1988 to 43,000 tonnes, with the bulk of this exported to the UK because
mushrooms only have a shelf life of about two days.
British growers estimate that 13 per cent of the Pounds 200m industry's jobs
have been lost in the past six years as prices have dropped to just below
Pounds 1,000 per tonne from about Pounds 1,300 a tonne in 1988.
Mr Ken James, who runs the British Mushroom Growers Association, said:
'We're concerned about the amount of production generated by aid to the
Irish industry where they've been expanding beyond the market's capa-city.'
Increases in Irish production are part of a larger structural surplus within
the European Union. British mushroom growers wrote to the commission last
week to warn of the crisis facing the EU industry and asking for imports
from countries outside the EU to be restricted.
'The English industry spent millions of pounds in promoting mushrooms in the
1980s and now it has lost 35 per cent of its market share to Irish imports,'
one grower said. A promotional campaign in the 1980s succeeded in doubling
UK consumption.
Mr Miles Warnick at Chesswood Produce, one of the UK's biggest growers, said
that producers are finding it difficult to compete with the cheaper Irish
mushrooms. 'Last year I closed two of my farms and made 120 people redundant
because I just can't compete,' he said.
