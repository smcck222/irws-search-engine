<TEXT>
Accountants and lawyers have been actively involved in avoiding financial
reporting regulations, an academic told the European Accounting Association
annual conference in Venice yesterday.
The involvement of lawyers, auditors and corporate financiers in developing
capital instruments had undermined rule-based regulations, Mr Atul Shah, of
the University of Bristol, said.
In a case study of convertible capital bonds he said the instrument was
designed to exploit tax and accounting loopholes. He said rule-based
regulation was 'doomed to failure' because professionals actively helped
their clients to evade these rules. He quoted advertisements and articles in
trade journals which he said were marketing initiatives by lawyers selling
avoidance schemes.
He also cited interviews conducted with bankers saying that they could not
have designed and implemented these schemes without close co-operation from
lawyers and auditors.
Mr Shah said no single professional was involved in packaging the whole
avoidance scheme, suggesting that ethical considerations did not limit their
actions.

FT  11 APR 94 / Brown sets out high-skill vision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain needs to become a fairer society if economic efficiency is to be
significantly improved, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, will argue
today.
Mr Brown will use a Fabian Society lecture to set out a vision of a highly
skilled Britain in which all forms of privilege and discrimination have been
removed.
Building on remarks before last month's jobs summit of the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations in Detroit, the shadow chancellor will argue that
enhancing the value of labour is the key to Britain's future prosperity.
This would require a programme of investment and training, including the
creation of a university for industry modelled on the Open University. This
should be accompanied by policies to reduce unemployment and reform the
welfare system to ensure that it is geared to the modern labour market,
rather than the one of 1945.
Mr Brown will argue that the casualisation of the labour market over the
past 15 years has produced a situation in which the root causes of
unfairness in society are increasingly work-related. The government has
falsely equated de-regulation with flexibility. Better regulation and not
necessarily less regulation is what is needed.

FT  11 APR 94 / Pounds 50m revamp for Selfridges store
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sears, the retailing group, is planning to spend Pounds 50m over three years
on its Selfridges department store in London's Oxford Street.
The investment is on top of Pounds 12.6m spent last year on creating a new
escalator well from the basement to the fourth floor at the store's eastern
end, and Pounds 2.5m on new electronic sales terminals. That means total
investment will be Pounds 65m in four years.
Mr Liam Strong, Sears' chief executive, said the programme was an investment
in the Selfridges brand. He is confident of earning a return.
The 450,000 sq ft store has some of the highest sales densities in Europe in
its ground floor cosmetics departments. But average sales per sq ft, at
between Pounds 400 and Pounds 500 a year, are low compared to other Oxford
Street stores.
One problem is that behind the grandiose front is an irregularly shaped
building with a mass of columns obscuring eyelines. Customers do not
circulate properly.
Mr Tim Daniels, Selfridges' managing director, says research found that only
4 per cent to 5 per cent of shoppers ever visited the fourth floor.
To improve customer flows, more than half of the Pounds 50m will be spent on
structural changes.
In addition the haphazard layout, with related products often scattered
around six selling floors, will be rationalised.

Mr John Smith, the Labour party leader, has severely damaged the ligaments
in his right ankle and has cancelled his engagements for the coming week,
his office announced yesterday.
He injured himself while climbing in the Scottish Highlands on Wednesday. He
will be unable to attend the Commons this week.
In 1988, Mr Smith suffered a severe heart attack from which he appears to
have made a complete recovery. Since then Mr Smith has taken to climbing in
the Highlands - particularly the 'Munro' mountains, those over 3,000 feet.
He slipped in the snow while climbing with friends his 108th Munro, Eididh

FT  11 APR 94 / Economic growth in Britain forecast for this year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The economy will enjoy robust growth and low inflation this year and the
government has no pressing need either to cut or raise interest rates,
according to an independent panel of forecasters using the Treasury's
computer model of the economy.
The Ernst &amp; Young Item Club said its latest 'central forecast' predicts both
growth and inflation will average 2.75 per cent this year and that
unemployment will continue to fall from 2.76m in February to 2.6m in the
final quarter of 1994 and, ultimately, to 2.24m in mid-1997.
The Item Club said fears on financial markets of an imminent rise in
interest rates 'are unfounded'. It suggested the government might make a
'token cut' in bank base rates to 5 per cent from 5.25 per cent in response
to the tax increases.
Inflation has little upward momentum at present, the Item Club said.
However, it forecasts a rise in the annual rate of retail price inflation to
a peak of 4.7 per cent early in 1996, with underlying inflation, which
excludes mortgage interest payments, rising to 4.4 per cent at the same
time.
It expects short-term interest rates will rise to 5.5 per cent in the second
half of next year as underlying inflation exceeds the government's 4 per
cent target ceiling.

FT  11 APR 94 / France signals irritation over dissident arrests
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France signalled its irritation at the weekend over a further rash of
dissident arrests, including the detention in Beijing of Xu Wenli, a
prominent figure in the 'Democracy Wall' protests of the late 1970s, Tony
Walker reports.
Reports also surfaced of additional arrests in Shanghai on the eve of the
arrival there of Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, on a
four-day visit to China.
Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, indicated growing French disquiet
that 'we've got to the point where we are not appreciating this'.
However, Mr Balladur had attracted criticism in France for his failure to
speak out on dissidents. Earlier he had said that 'being efficient (on human
rights) very often means being discreet'.
China denied it had arrested more dissidents during Mr Balladur's visit,
saying reports were 'completely groundless'.

FT  11 APR 94 / International Press Review: Buthelezi finds himself cast as
a demon - South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, is a public
relations disaster, but that is only half the reason that he has featured -
this week like every week - as a demon in most South African media.
Most of the South African media - like the majority of the country's
citizens - are frantic to put apartheid behind them once and for all.
Elections must take place on April 26-28 as planned, and be declared free
and fair, whatever the evidence to the contrary.
That is what the country wants and that, in mirror image, is what the media
wants. So it takes no great foresight to predict the line which most leader
writers will take in the aftermath of elections: there were isolated
problems (like Natal, where one quarter of the population lives); but
overall, polling was free and fair. In short, a triumph for democracy, they
will say, and one which only a demonic tyrant (the likes of Chief Buthelezi)
could wish to resist.
The crudest demonisation of the Chief comes, not surprisingly, from this
week's Sunday Nation, virtually the mouthpiece of the African National
Congress. Under the headline 'Nothing will satisfy Gatsha Buthelezi', the
paper's leader writer comments on Friday's failed peace summit between the
country's four top political leaders, President F W de Klerk, ANC president
Nelson Mandela, Chief Buthelezi and his nephew, the Zulu King Goodwill
Zwelithini.
The Sunday Nation asserts categorically: 'there is absolutely nothing that
the ANC and the government could possibly do to satisfy Inkatha leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi', going on to conclude that 'summits with Buthelezi are
nothing but a blatant waste of taxpayers' money', and that 'the only
reasonable thing to do is to ignore Buthelezi and move ahead with the
transition process'.
No other newspaper is so blunt in its condemnation. But the message is the
same from most others nonetheless: Chief Buthelezi wrecked the summit, for
reasons which are incomprehensible to most leader writers. They implicitly
accept the ANC's view of the summit: that the Zulu King was offered
everything he could ever have wanted by the ANC - the Sunday Times, the most
widely read South African newspaper, says he could have become 'a
constitutional monarch in KwaZulu Natal with all his rights, privileges and
status entrenched' - but this magnanimous offer was inexplicably rejected by
Chief Buthelezi, on the king's behalf.
Few point out that the offer would have guaranteed the king only ceremonial
powers, and that the monarchy's communal lands - the crux of the dispute -
would have become assets of the state. It is simply not fashionable to take
the king's or Chief Buthelezi's complaints seriously.
However, the Johannesburg daily Business Day regularly gives Inkatha's
concerns a fair hearing, and some Durban newspapers - including this week's
Sunday Tribune, which bemoans 'a failure in statesmanship all round' - also
adopt a more balanced approach. But there remains a marked tendency among
leader writers and radio commentators - especially the popular Johannesburg
station Radio 702's Election Watch commentary - to believe that the ANC has
bent over backwards to satisfy Chief Buthelezi (an impression cleverly and
vigorously promoted by ANC officials), and that he has spat upon their
magnanimity.
There was scant local condemnation of the fact that ANC president Nelson
Mandela refused to allow police (bearing a legal search warrant) to enter
ANC headquarters to investigate the murder of Zulu marchers who were shot by
ANC security guards in the recent 'Battle of Johannesburg'. Most media
condemned Chief Buthelezi for that battle, despite the fact it was mostly
pro-Inkatha marchers who died, and that all evidence suggests they did not
fire first.
But if most media agree that Chief Buthelezi is wrong - largely his own
fault for failing to convey his position more effectively - at least there
seems to be a growing consensus that he cannot (pace the Sunday Nation) be
ignored. Even the liberal Johannesburg Weekly Mail, the flagship of the
alternative press which bravely fought apartheid, argues for a
constitutional solution to the problem of Chief Buthelezi. True, the paper
wants a mailed fist used against violence in Natal (through measures which
the paper opposed when used against the anti-apartheid movement); but it
recognises that this will not be enough. Politics, not might, must provide
the ultimate solution.

FT  11 APR 94 / Skeleton in Hosokawa's cupboard may be a dummy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The past few days have provided tragi-comic proof that nothing is quite what
it seems in Japanese politics.
The skeleton that prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa found in his cupboard,
startling him badly enough to resign, appears, by his own account, to be a
dummy.
Suspicions over his personal finances were 'just a trick', Mr Hosokawa told
fellow members of the Japan New Party on Saturday, according to the Asahi
Shimbun, the left-leaning daily newspaper.
The real reason for giving up the prime ministership was to break up the
opposition Liberal Democratic Party, he was reported to have said. The Asahi
offered no explanation of this baffling news. Yet it should be believed. The
Asahi must be a reliable newspaper, because Mr Hosokawa started his career
as a journalist there before going into politics.
All this is, however, in keeping with the quirky events leading up to Mr
Hosokawa's announcement last Friday. At dinner with two professional
comedians-turned-politicians early in the week, he joked that he wanted to
stand down. He denied he said it a few hours later, and then really did say
it at a cabinet meeting.
Not surprisingly, Japanese newspapers were buzzing with speculation over the
weekend about exactly what prompted Mr Hosokawa's final U-turn.
Mr Hosokawa indicated, tantalisingly, that he uncovered irregularities in
investments made on his behalf in the early 1980s by a close friend. This,
he hinted, went deeper than the LDP's two accusations of accepting an
improper political loan from Sagawa Kyubin, a trucking firm, and trying to
cover up a share transaction, both of which Mr Hosokawa denies.
The explanations offered by the Japanese media are bewilderingly various.
NHK television claimed that Mr Hosokawa invested Y80m (Pounds 524,000)
unwittingly, with a loan shark, contravening a law against usury.
Another version, provided by the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper, is that Mr
Hosokawa's friend, an investment consultant and company president, offered
to obtain a guaranteed 12 per cent annual return on Mr Hosokawa's behalf to
help him raise the cash needed to form an LDP faction. They met in 1980,
according to the Mainichi, when Mr Hosokawa was a member of the upper house
of parliament and the friend became a 'fan'.
The problem with the Mainichi's version is that Mr Hosokawa never did form
an LDP faction. He did in 1992 leave the LDP to form a party, the Japan New
party, dedicated, among other things, to breaking the cosy, often corrupt,
links between business and politics.
The potential legal problem is in any case too trivial to warrant
resignation. At worst, the friend might not have had a licence as investment
manager. But the law on investment managers has a three-year statute of
limitations - and all this was supposed to have happened at least 10 years
ago.
Yet another version, supplied by the Japan Times, is that Mr Hosokawa's fund
manager, the publisher of a monthly economic magazine, invested around Y60m,
derived from the sale of land that Mr Hosokawa inherited from his
grandfather, former prime minister Prince Fumimaro Konoe. The investment
performed badly, and was worth only Y10m by 1991, claimed the Japan Times.
Mr Hosokawa was said to have been introduced to this friend by his own
private secretary, Mr Masatoshi Miyama, who left Mr Hosokawa's employ under
a cloud in 1991. The prime minister has refused LDP demands to allow his
former secretary to be questioned in parliament.
Speculation is rife that Mr Miyama knows what dark secret it really was that
prompted Mr Hosokawa to resign. On the other hand, there is a school of
political gossips who prefer the simple alibi - that Mr Hosokawa had simply
lost patience with the aggressive LDP's attempts to wreck his clean image.

FT  11 APR 94 / Western troops in Rwanda rescue

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France, Belgium and the US were last night rescuing expatriates from Rwanda
in central Africa, where thousands of people have been killed in tribal
massacres after the president's death in an air crash last Wednesday.
French troops secured the airport outside Kigali, the capital, on Saturday
to evacuate some 600 French nationals living in Rwanda. US Marines were sent
to neighbouring Burundi to assist Americans fleeing overland in a long
convoy of cars.
Belgian paratroops were reported to have landed in Kigali last night, after
the Rwandan army lifted its objection to the arrival of the former colonial
power.
Tribal tensions between the majority Hutu and the Tutsi people led to an
ethnic bloodbath when the government accused guerrillas from the Tutsi-led
Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) of shooting down the aircraft of the
president, Gen Juvenal Habyarimana. President Cyprien Ntaryamira of
neighbouring Burundi was also killed in the crash.
A force of 4,000 RPF soldiers was reported to be marching towards Kigali to
free the battalion pinned down by government troops, and their arrival may
lead to escalation of the fighting.
About 1,500 Belgians live in the small central African state, and there were
fears in Brussels that the violence might turn into an anti-Belgian
movement. There were apparently rumours circulating in Rwanda that Belgians
were responsible for shooting down the presidential aircraft.
'We have a duty to restore order,' Ms Christine Umotoni, an RPF official,
said. 'We cannot leave innocent civilians to be butchered by lawless gangs
and renegade members of the presidential guard.'
Thousands have already met that fate. Despite Rwanda's history of genocide,
the scale of the massacre has shocked relief workers. The International
Committee for the Red Cross says tens of thousands of bodies are lying in
the streets and houses of the capital.
Ambulances venture out during lulls in the fighting to rescue the wounded.
'Each trip is an adventure,' said a Red Cross doctor.
Medecins Sans Frontieres, the medical charity, said it was evacuating its
Belgian staff because of the anti-Belgian sentiment in the capital.
A new government was named at the weekend, but it has not succeeded in
gaining control of rampaging troops, and its authority has been rejected by
the RPF.

<TEXT>
Prospects for a peaceful election in South Africa appeared dim last night
after the country's political leaders acknowledged the failure of last
Friday's peace summit, and Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi predicted
this would lead to further bloodshed.
African National Congress leader Mr Nelson Mandela, speaking at a rally to
mark the first anniversary of the assassination of ANC leader Chris Hani,
said he would seek a further meeting with Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini
despite lack of progress at the summit. He said the ANC had offered King
Goodwill 'the same rights as Queen Elizabeth of Britain', but the king had
rejected his proposal.
Mr Mandela was addressing some 15,000 ANC supporters at the Orlando football
stadium in the black township of Soweto. They laughed and jeered when he
said he had asked the Zulu King three times whether he wanted 'the same
rights as Queen Elizabeth or more rights than Queen Elizabeth enjoys', but
was unable to obtain a clear answer. 'In spite of that, I am working for
peace,' he said, 'because our people in that province (Natal) are dying in
scores'.
However most political analysts said they believed last Friday's summit
marked a watershed in South African politics. Local newspaper headlines
proclaimed 'the end of the road', with few commentators confident that a
political solution could be found to the ANC-Inkatha dispute before the
poll.
The ANC-dominated Transitional Executive Council, the multi-party body which
oversees government ahead of the April 26-28 elections, is expected to take
stronger measures against the KwaZulu government this week, in the wake of
the failed peace summit and in response to complaints that the recently
declared state of emergency has not quelled violence. Some 144 people have
died in Natal since the emergency 10 days ago.
The leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, Chief Buthelezi, predicted further
bloodshed, saying: 'I have never seen the level of anger (among my
supporters) as high as the current level.'
Violence has cast doubt over the prospects for elections in the province,
but South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission, charged with conducting
the poll, made clear at the weekend that elections would go ahead none the
less. Mr Roelf Meyer, the government's constitutional development minister
believed only 60 per cent of Natal's population could vote freely.
To overcome obstacles to voting, the IEC said it would erect polling
stations on the borders of the KwaZulu homeland, where Inkatha's election
boycott campaign is strongest. This would permit KwaZulu residents to travel
to peaceful areas to vote. However such measures are likely to have little
impact, as Inkatha militants will prevent voters from leaving their homes if
they believe they are going to vote.
ANC officials say international mediation of the country's constitutional
dispute is still due to go ahead this week, but prospects for progress
appear slim.
Meanwhile the ANC leader also lashed out at the rival National Party at the
Soweto rally. 'The NP is a mouse and they think they can fight the ANC, an
elephant.'

FT  11 APR 94 / Algeria devalues in deal with IMF

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Algerian government, struggling with a collapsing economy and hostility
from Moslem fundamentalists, is to devalue its currency by 40 per cent and
raise interest rates as part of a programme worked out with the
International Monetary Fund, AP-DJ reports from Algiers.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said on Algerian television the
programme - which includes a timetable of measures to open up the Algerian
economy - would allow Algeria to draw Dollars 1bn immediately from the IMF
under a one-year stand-by agreement. He described the programme as 'sound
and courageous' and said the IMF stood ready to work out a longer-term,
three-year adjustment plan.
The Algerian dinar, which is not convertible outside the country, had
already been devalued by 7 per cent against a basket of foreign currencies a
week ago. The new official exchange rate of the dinar is 36 to the dollar
and about six to the French franc. On the black market recently, the franc
changed hands at up to 16 dinars.
The IMF deal is expected to free loans from other lending agencies,
including Dollars 175m from the World Bank and Dollars 180m from the
European Union. Japan is also understood to be considering a Dollars 150m
loan.
The stand-by agreement will clear the way for Algeria to start negotiations
with creditor governments and banks on rescheduling part of its Dollars 26bn
external debt. Previous Algerian governments had refused to consider a
rescheduling accord, arguing that it would turn off the flow of commercial
bank lending that the country so badly needs to finance its hydrocarbons
industry.
The programme also calls for a steep rise in interest rates set by the Bank
of Algeria.

China will freeze the number of vehicle assembly plants until 1996 under a
new automotive policy to be unveiled soon, the official Business Weekly
reported at the weekend.
The policy, sketchy details of which were published, lays down local content
rules and sets out a blueprint for the industry's development beyond the
year 2000. It appears to close the door, for now, on foreign makers which do
not already have ventures.
Foreign manufacturers involved in the assembly of vehicles in China include
Volkswagen of Germany, Citroen and Peugeot of France, Chrysler of the US,
and Daihatsu, Suzuki and Fuji Heavy Industries of Japan.
Conspicuous by their absence are the larger Japanese manufacturers,
including Toyota, Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi. The Japanese were slow to
respond to opportunities in China, preferring to rely on exports.
The moratorium on new plants is aimed at allowing local industry to
consolidate after recent rapid changes, including the entry of a number of
foreign manufacturers.
Local content rules laid down in the policy call for 40 per cent locally
sourced parts for new ventures rising to 60 per cent after three years,
according to Business Weekly.
China produced 234,000 cars in 1993 and plans to increase output to 350,000
this year. Imports reached 310,000 units in 1993 but this almost certainly
understates the number of vehicles entering China as smuggling is rife.

FT  11 APR 94 / China dissidents feel lashes of a leadership nervous of
change: Tony Walker explains the government's insecurity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wei Jingsheng, the pro-democracy activist at the centre of the dispute
between a modernising China and the west, occupies a position in modern
Chinese history that even he perhaps cannot quite appreciate, and certainly
could not have imagined when he embarked on his lonely crusade almost two
decades ago.
China's apparent readiness to jeopardise access to its most important
market, the US, over the actions of an individual is an indication of just
how seriously the Chinese leadership views threats to its authority in this
uncertain phase.
Beijing's pursuit of Mr Wei, who is being interrogated for so-called 'new
crimes', might seem oddly dysfunctional given the stakes involved; but his
treatment is consistent with the government's general approach in this
uneasy climate amid persistent reports of industrial and peasant unrest.
The leadership knows it faces enormous political challenges in the next
several years as it makes the transition to a new generation of leaders now
that the ailing Mr Deng Xiaoping has virtually shuffled off the stage.
Waiting for Mr Deng to die has become something of a national preoccupation,
feeding leadership anxieties about a whole range of issues, including
possible factional strife and social upheaval. Prominent figures in the
dissident community are far from alone in predicting that Mr Deng's death
will precipitate a convulsion, either within the leadership itself or in the
streets.
Mr Liu Xiaobo, the writer and philosopher accused by the authorities of
being one of the 'black hands' behind the Tiananmen pro-democracy protests
of 1989, echoes the views of many of his dissident colleagues when he says:
'As Deng Xiaoping approaches death people feel a palpitation in their
hearts. Everybody feels that something big is going to happen. But no one is
sure where it is going to start.'
This may be merely wishful thinking on Mr Liu's part since a tiny,
fragmented dissident movement is hardly in a position at present to organise
national disturbances, but activists are more than capable of taking
advantage of any hint of chaos that might arise from a weakening at the
centre.
Among nagging issues in the background is the unresolved question of
responsibility for the Tiananmen massacre. Tackling this issue is simply
taboo while Mr Deng is alive.
The leadership's quarrel with Mr Wei is not that he heads anything
approximating an organisation, but that he symbolises, more than any of his
dissident colleagues, disaffection with the established order, and daringly
he appears prepared to confront.
He has also captured attention in the west, which is no small achievement
for someone who speaks no English and who was hidden from view during a
14-year jail sentence from 1980 to 1993.
His meeting in Beijing recently with Mr John Shattuck, the US assistant
secretary of state for human rights, deeply angered the authorities and will
have contributed to his re-arrest. Chinese officials described the encounter
as an intolerable affront and muttered darkly about US envoys meeting
'criminals' - Mr Wei was still on six months' parole after his early release
from jail last September.
A western official in Beijing, who monitors the dissident community, says
that while dissident numbers are 'very small', 'the thing that worries the
government at the moment is that conditions are ripe for recruiting new
people'. These concerns appear to be especially acute where the labour
movement in concerned.
The authorities showed little tolerance recently when labour activists
petitioned them to be allowed to establish a non-government group known as
the 'Association for the Protection of Labour Rights'. The organisers were
summarily detained and their request dismissed. The last thing Beijing wants
at this traumatic moment for state industries, with thousands of workers
being laid off or placed on subsistence wages, is the emergence of an
overtly political organisation like Poland's 'Solidarity'.
The authorities also stamped on an attempt by a disparate group of activists
to promote a 'Peace Charter' which called on the Communist party to respect
human rights and introduce political reform. Qin Yongmin, the chief sponsor
behind this attempt to spread democratic ideals, was sentenced earlier this
year to two years' re-education-through-labour for 'disturbing public order
and security'.
Whether Wei Jingsheng will suffer a similar fate, or worse, is unclear.
Whatever the authorities have in mind for him, however, his name will not
disappear from the human rights debate, and nor are tensions between China
and the west over such issues likely to recede as long as a nervous
leadership feels under pressure to respond to almost every challenge to its
authority.

FT  11 APR 94 / Algeria devalues in deal with IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ALGIERS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Algerian government, struggling with a collapsing economy and hostility
from Moslem fundamentalists, is to devalue its currency by 40 per cent and
raise interest rates as part of a programme worked out with the
International Monetary Fund, AP-DJ reports from Algiers.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said on Algerian television the
programme - which also includes a timetable of measures to open up the
Algerian economy - would allow Algeria to draw Dollars 1bn immediately from
the IMF under a one-year stand-by agreement.
He described the emergency programme as 'sound and courageous' and said the
IMF also stood ready to work out a longer-term, three-year adjustment
programme to ensure Algeria's economic recovery was deep-rooted.
The Algerian dinar, which is not convertible outside the country, had
already been devalued by 7 per cent against a basket of foreign currencies a
week ago. The new official exchange rate of the dinar is 36 to the dollar
and about six to the French franc. On the black market recently, the franc
changed hands at up to 16 dinars.
The IMF deal is expected to free loans from other lending agencies,
including Dollars 175m from the World Bank and Dollars 180m from the
European Union. Japan is also understood to be considering a Dollars 150m
loan.
The stand-by agreement will clear the way for Algeria to start negotiations
with creditor governments and banks on rescheduling part of its Dollars 26bn
external debt.
Previous Algerian governments had refused to consider a rescheduling accord,
arguing that it would turn off the flow of commercial bank lending that the
country so badly needs to finance its hydrocarbons industry.
Oil and gas exports account for 98 per cent of Algeria's export revenue, and
the country has been crippled by the weakness of the international oil
market that has pushed the price of crude oil down to around Dollars 14 a
barrel.
Officials said the IMF had initially been pushing Algeria for a 60 per cent
devaluation.
The immediate effect of the devaluation will be to increase sharply the cost
of imported goods, especially food. In dinar terms, however, the country's
export earnings will be increased considerably.
The economic adjustment programme agreed with the IMF also calls for a steep
rise in interest rates set by the Bank of Algeria, although they will remain
below the official inflation rate, which reached 25 per cent in 1993. The
official rate is based on a narrow range of goods and services, however, and
experts say the actual rate of inflation is much higher.

FT  11 APR 94 / IADB warns on growth hopes: Latin Americans must distribute
benefits of reform more fairly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Latin America's growth and economic modernisation efforts are unlikely to be
sustainable unless there is a fairer distribution of the benefits of
economic growth, the InterAmerican Development Bank says.
In its annual report, released today to coincide with the bank's annual
meeting, the bank argues: 'Economic growth and modernisation are not likely
to be sustainable in the absence of political and social stability, which in
turn will depend upon a more equitable distribution of the benefits of that
growth.'
The message has been underlined by the meeting's venue in Mexico, where a
peasant uprising in the south and the assassination of the country's leading
presidential candidate this year have increased concerns about social
stability.
The meeting will concentrate on discussions to finalise a Dollars 40bn
(Pounds 27.3bn) capital increase for the bank, which will allow it to expand
lending to Dollars 7bn-Dollars 8bn a year and take its total capital past
Dollars 100bn.
Final agreement was being held up early yesterday by a disagreement between
European and Latin American shareholders about an extra seat on the board
for Chile. European governments have argued that if Chile wants the seat it
should increase its stakeholding in the bank - as many of them, with the
exception of Britain, are proposing to do.
The annual report says economic reforms adopted to date have been essential
to social development in that they encouraged investment and growth, thereby
bringing about a more egalitarian distribution of income. But the reforms
must also be broadened to tackle social policy - improving the efficiency of
government action in social sectors, assisting education, health and
nutrition and reducing poverty.
Nonetheless, the prospects for sustained economic growth are positive, the
bank says. The region enjoyed its third successive year of economic growth
last year, with the regional economy expanding 3.3 per cent. Growth in 1992
was 2.9 per cent and in 1991 3.7 per cent.
The conclusions of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay
Round of multilateral trade talks and the momentum of market-oriented
reforms support the positive expectations, the report says.
Some Dollars 65bn of net capital flows entered Latin America last year,
exceeding the region's current account deficit and allowing a build-up of
international reserves by some Dollars 23.9bn. The region's current account
deficit was Dollars 42bn, about 3.8 per cent of regional GDP, as the overall
trade deficit expanded to Dollars 17.7bn last year from Dollars 10.6bn in
1992.
The larger trade deficit was a result of continuing rapid growth in imports
 -9.1 per cent in 1993 after 18.2 per cent in 1992 - although exports also
grew, by a more modest 3.6 per cent in real terms.
The report remarks on notable declines in import activity in Argentina,
Mexico and Venezuela that 'is generally associated with a transition to more
sustainable rates of output growth'. Import growth had been fuelled
throughout the region by 'the vigorous demand for capital goods'.
The bank authorised Dollars 5.96bn in new loans last year, slightly below
the 1992 figure of Dollars 6.02bn. Its last capital increase, of Dollars
26.5bn, was agreed in 1989.
The bank expects to raise Dollars 3.3bn in international borrowings this
year, compared with Dollars 3.9bn in 1991 and Dollars 5.1bn in 1992. The
bank repaid last year nearly Dollars 1bn equivalent of high coupon
borrowings, against Dollars 1.1bn in 1992.
This year's lower borrowing expectations reflects lower debt repayments and
the need to make only small additions to the bank's cash.

</DATELINE>

The World Bank plans to strengthen its efforts to help people who are forced
out of their homes or farms by the development projects it finances, after a
year-long review of the forced resettlements resulting from its loans.
Mr Ismail Serageldin, the World Bank's vice-president for environmentally
sustainable development, said the Washington-based development institution
had already improved its procedures but would now make sure it agreed with
borrowing countries on a complete resettlement programme before a project
began.
Over the last seven years the bank has been involved in projects forcibly
displacing about 2.5m people - mostly dams - and non-bank projects have
probably displaced more than 30 times as many.
The resettlement review was partly triggered by the bank's involvement in
the Narmada dam project in India, from which it withdrew last year after
months of controversy over its resettlement programmes.
Publication of the resettlement report comes just days before the World Bank
board is due to vote on a loan for the Xiaolangdi project in China, another
controversial dam to be built on the Huang He, which will displace 181,000
people.
Mr Serageldin said that China, the World Bank's largest borrower, was now a
model for resettlement, because the government had adopted its own policies
that concentrate on resettling people in new jobs or land, rather than
simply compensating them for the property they had lost. 'The key lesson is
that it works best when governments themselves buy into the idea of
people-based resettlement, not property-based resettlement,' he said.
Outside environmental and development groups, however, are more critical of
the extent of compulsion in China's resettlement programmes, and the bank's
own report does not back up the idea that it has succeeded in meeting its
resettlement goal of restoring or improving the incomes of the displaced
populations.

Ukraine's first post-Soviet parliamentary elections were declared valid
yesterday as fears of voter apathy proved unfounded.
As Ukrainians flocked to polling booths, preliminary turnout returns showed
that voting surpassed the 50 per cent threshold to make the election valid
in more than 310 of the 350 constituencies which held a final-stage ballot
yesterday. Ninety MPs had already been elected in previous rounds for the
450-seat legislative body which began on March 27.
Although about 75 per cent of the electorate voted in the first round, voter
turnout was an important issue in the campaign.
President Leonid Kravchuk's aides predicted that voter apathy would elect
less than a quorum of 300 MPs and enable Mr Kravchuk to establish direct
presidential rule.
'A parliament will be formed,' said Mr Ivan Yemetz, chairman of the Central
Electoral Commission, on television last night.
Although results were not expected until today, the parliament's composition
is likely to be divided between Moscow-leaning communists and allies and
western-oriented nationalists, along with an equally large group of
independents.
Casting his ballot yesterday morning, Mr Kravchuk reiterated his intention
to delay presidential elections, scheduled for June, until the new
parliament defined presidential powers.
Throughout the capital, Kiev, voter turnout fell short of the 50 per cent
threshold despite the closing-hour extensions granted to polling stations.
Only eight of its 21 constituencies elected MPs.
Contrary to expectations, the independence-seeking region of Crimea and its
Russian-dominated Black Sea fleet base of Sevastopol elected all but one of
its 23 MPs to the Kiev parliament.

Israel prepared for a prolonged closure of the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip yesterday, in spite of warnings from some of its ministers that it
would impoverish Palestinians, harm Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and fuel
violence in the territories.
The cabinet agreed to grant new work permits for 18,000 foreign workers to
be substitutes for Palestinian labourers banned from crossing into Israel,
suggesting that the government is preparing for a extended closure of the
occupied territories.
The closure, to be reviewed by the cabinet next week, has serious
implications for the already low standards of living of hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip who are dependent
on income from jobs in Israel.
By increasing Israel's trend towards independence and separation from the
territories, the measure could also have negative implications for the
long-term prospects of the Palestinian economy and for Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks which resumed in Cairo yesterday.
Gen Matan Vilnai, army chief of the southern command, said the maintenance
of a rigid closure policy, which has barred up to 70,000 Palestinians from
travelling to their jobs in Israel, would provoke an upsurge in violence in
the West Bank and Gaza. The territories were sealed on Thursday after
extremist Islamic guerrillas killed eight Israelis.
Cabinet ministers said the government was determined to maintain a lengthy
closure to prevent Palestinians from making further attacks against
Israelis. Although the cabinet agreed to review the closure at next Sunday's
meeting, Mr Yacov Tzur, minister of agriculture, said a full closure would
last until the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana in September 'to free
ourselves from the dependence of Palestinians which endangers our security'.
Left-wing cabinet ministers warned that a lengthy closure would impose
tremendous suffering on the Palestinians and called for the immediate
injection of increased aid into the territories to alleviate poverty. Mr
Yair Tsaban, minister of absorption, feared the closure could harm peace
talks and make it impossible for Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, to take
over the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho under the Palestinian
self-rule agreement currently being hammered out in Cairo.
The cabinet move came hours before Israel and the PLO resumed talks in Cairo
amid increasing Palestinian frustration and signs that it is now almost
impossible for the two sides to reach final agreement before the April 13
deadline.

Pakistan and the US yesterday concluded talks without progress on
Washington's proposal to supply up to 38 F-16 fighter aircraft in return for
a verifiable cap on Islamabad's alleged nuclear weapons programme.
However, the departure of Mr Strobe Talbott, US deputy secretary of state
and the most senior US official to visit Pakistan for almost six years, was
followed by a joint statement in which both sides played down any suggestion
of a deadlock. The two countries said they would continue efforts towards
halting, then reducing and finally eliminating weapons of mass destruction
and ballistic missiles in South Asia. But they gave few indications on
specific steps to promote that goal.
Mr Talbott's arrival in Islamabad followed weeks of speculation over
Washington's latest efforts to encourage Pakistan to open its nuclear
facilities for a one-off inspection, to verify that the programme is capped
at a level below that required to produce fissile material.
In return, Washington offered to supply up to 38 of the 71 F-16 fighter
aircraft which Pakistan had ordered four years ago. Despite Islamabad's
payment of almost Dollars 650m (Pounds 445.2m) towards the Dollars 1.4bn
dollar deal, their delivery has been blocked by concerns over the nuclear
issue.
The US offer was rejected by Pakistani leaders including Gen Abdul Waheed,
the chief of the army staff. Islamabad says any move to open up unilaterally
its facilities without forcing India to do the same would compromise
security interests.
However, both sides emphasised that they had much in common as a basis for
close relations. 'The end of the cold war has unquestionably put some strain
on our relationship these past few years,' acknowledged Mr Talbott, in a
reference to Pakistan's role in former US attempts to resist Soviet
expansion.

FT  11 APR 94 / WHO urges drugs groups to develop Aids vaccine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drugs companies should concentrate their efforts on developing a vaccine for
Aids, the World Health Organisation said yesterday.
Most pharmaceuticals companies are working on Aids treatments such as
Wellcome's AZT, rather than vaccines, which immunise in advance of
infection.
Last week AZT, still the leading Aids drug, was shown in trials to have
little if any effect on people infected with the virus who do not yet have
the disease.
The change to vaccines should come even though 'pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies have been reluctant to become fully committed to the
development of an HIV vaccine', said Dr Peter Piot, WHO's director of
research and intervention development.
He backed up his message with the organisation's latest estimate for the
spread of HIV. 'Well over 14m adults and a further 1m infants have been
infected with HIV. As of 31 December 1993, over 850,000 Aids cases had been
reported.'
About two thirds of cases are in sub-Saharan Africa, but the region where
the infection is spreading fastest is now south east Asia.
'Five years ago, fewer that 200 people in Thailand were known to be
infected. By late 1993 (the figures was) over 500,000,' he said
'In most areas, heterosexual transmission is now by far the predominant mode
of spread,' he said. In some parts of the region, HIV is believed to be
spreading as fast as it did in Africa a decade ago.'
Dr Piot acknowledged that science did not fully understand the Aids virus
and that he saw 'signs of discouragement among those working on vaccine
development'.
Nevertheless, a vaccine was needed to complement existing strategies of
containment through the use of condoms and viricides.
These strategies had worked well in Europe, with condom use among Swiss aged
between 17 and 30, for example, rising from 8 per cent in 1987 to more than
half in 1992.
In the US, the story was more mixed with rapidly rising rates of infection
in inner city populations.

Clinton administration officials have spent the past week trying to clear up
the diplomatic mess caused when Mr William Perry, the defence secretary,
said forthrightly that the US was not about to intervene in Bosnia to save
the Moslem-held town of Gorazde.
Yesterday, diplomatic clarifications gave way to bombs as two US F-16
warplanes struck at the Serbian troops who were overrunning Gorazde's
defences.
Viewed charitably, Mr Perry's statement accurately reflects the Clinton
administration's policy not to deploy US ground troops in Bosnia until a
peace agreement has been reached. 'We will not enter the war to stop that
(the fall of Gorazde) from happening,' he said.
Ironically, Washington pundits at first welcomed Mr Perry as the strong
voice the administration needed in foreign policy. The same pundits have
been quick to dismiss him as a blundering neophyte who does not understand
the subtleties of diplomacy.
Few in Washington are now willing to view Mr Perry's remarks as an accurate
version of official policy. Instead, they are seen either as the mixed
message of an administration that in foreign policy does not know its own
mind, or as a case of the military tail - forever reluctant to put US troops
at risk - once again wagging the foreign policy dog.
The latter impression was reinforced by Gen John Shalikashvili, chairman of
the joint chiefs of staff, who backed his civilian boss by emphatically
insisting that the military circumstances around Gorazde made it impossible
for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to repeat the threat of air
strikes that had achieved considerable success in relieving the siege of
Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital.
Yesterday, Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, had to disavow Gen
Shalikashvili, insisting that there were indeed targets for possible air
strikes around Gorazde although they might not be as inviting as those
around Sarajevo.
Mr Christopher managed to be more gentle in his treatment of Mr Perry's
remarks, but had his work cut out explaining that they were consistent with
administration policy.
He insisted that the US was ready to respond promptly to provide close air
support for the protection of UN troops, although he implied the idea of air
strikes for the sake of preserving Gorazde as a safe haven was some way off.
Hours later, when the US warplanes dropped their bombs on Serbian tanks,
they were, as it turned out, responding to a request from UN peacekeepers
for close air support.
Administration officials said that the earlier signals from Washington had
been intended to reassure the Serbs at a moment when the efforts of Mr
Charles Redman, the US peace envoy, to secure a peace agreement or at least
a ceasefire seemed to have some chance at success.

FT  11 APR 94 / Nato's air onslaught risks alienating diplomatic ally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By using one of the most powerful military weapons at its disposal - air
power - the west has run the risk of throwing away one of its most powerful
diplomatic weapons: a united front at the UN Security Council.
The Nato air strikes will test to the very limit the common front between
the west and Russia, which has transformed international diplomacy and given
new teeth to the United Nations since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
As one of the Security Council's permanent members, Russia is a party to all
the resolutions which the west has invoked in justification of its action
against the Bosnian Serbs.
But Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister who represents the most
liberal and pro-western part of the country's political spectrum, has often
called into question whether these resolutions give Nato absolute freedom to
launch attacks.
Yesterday's action will echo loudly in Russia, where any sign that Moscow is
cast in the role of lapdog to the west will provide the hardline opposition
with a new stick with which to beat President Boris Yeltsin.
In recent months western officials have been astonished by the trenchancy
with which Russia has demarcated its perceived interests across a whole
range of foreign policy issues: from respect for the rights of
Russian-speakers abroad to the question of access to foreign markets for its
arms industry.
The US was surprised and initially dismayed by the firmness and skill of
Russian diplomacy in February, when Moscow simultaneously protected and
reined in its traditional allies by sending peacekeepers to the Serb sector
of Sarajevo.
Paradoxically enough, the resurgence of the old adversarial relationship
between the 'superpowers' - with each side having clearly defined interests
 -brought a new dynamism to the Bosnian peacekeeping effort.
Mr Charles Redman and Mr Vitaly Churkin, the envoys of Washington and Moscow
respectively, established a close working relationship that paved the way
for a ground-breaking deal between Croats and Moslems on establishing a
federation.
But the involvement of the US and Russia on opposite sides has also raised
the stakes in the conflict.
In a state of affairs that is all too reminiscent of the cold war period,
the Bosnian war is now a 'regional conflict' whose status unavoidably
affects the wider relationship between the great powers.
If the Yeltsin administration feels politically secure enough to make a cool
judgment of its own strategic interests, it will not turn Bosnia into a
make-or-break issue in its relations with the west.
As some Russian nationalists will grudgingly concede, Moscow has far more at
stake in managing its relations with Germany - the traditional friend of the
Croats - than in shoring up, at any cost, a friendship with a small and
unpredictable ally.
A heavy-handed intervention in support of the Serbs and against the Moslems
could also threaten the internal stability of Russia, which has at least 10m
Moslem citizens of its own - from the independence-minded enclave of
Tatarstan to the warrior nations of the northern Caucasus.
However, opposition to the idea of punitive action against the Serbs runs
across a wide political spectrum in Russia, and all factions in the Russian
parliament can now be expected to redouble their campaign to end the
country's participation in sanctions against Belgrade.
Friendship with Serbia is a rallying cry for old-guard communists, for the
maverick nationalist Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky and for traditional Russian
patriots who recall their country's role in liberating the Serbs from
Ottoman rule in the 19th century.
The wilder fringes of Serb nationalism provoke almost as much exasperation
in Moscow as they do in the west. But Russia, in its newly self-confident
form, cannot expose itself to the risk of diplomatic humiliation.
In February, Russia was able, by some subtle diplomatic footwork, to raise
its profile in Bosnia and score a diplomatic triumph, at the very time when
the Serbian cause looked doomed to a humiliating reverse.
Even more skill will be needed now to shore up Russian prestige, without
damaging its broader strategic interests or upsetting the country's internal
political balance.

FT  11 APR 94 / EU in grip of new monetary realism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The ERM is dead, long live the ERM. This might be an appropriate epitaph to
the two-day meeting of European finance ministers and central bankers in
Athens, which ended on Saturday.
Barely a word passed about the old exchange rate mechanism, still less was
there any talk about how to restore the narrow fluctuation bands for EU
currencies - the cause for which billions of dollars and several political
reputations were lost in 1992-3.
Plainly, the 15 per cent fluctuation bands in operation since the collapse
of the ERM last August have won converts. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank
president, was not alone in defending a system which no longer imposes
obligations on the strong to intervene to prop up weaker currencies, but
which has still encouraged the old 'hard-core' currencies (Benelux and the
French franc) to cluster around the D-Mark.
The 'dirty float' has given everyone a respite from the speculators, but it
still raises questions about the European Union's road-map to a single
currency by the end of the decade. The old plan of moving to European
monetary union using the discipline of narrow bands to move progressively to
fixed exchange rates looks out of date. So what comes next?
Athens ducked this question, but one senior EU official predicted that
ministers would have to take decisions before the end of the year if the
earliest date for EMU - 1997 - was to remain credible.
The most important concerns the interpretation of the Maastricht treaty,
specifically article 109J which covers the criteria on inflation, budget
deficits, interest and exchange rates necessary to qualify for EMU.
The treaty says that member states must respect 'normal' margins of
fluctuation within the ERM for at least two years, and that there must be no
devaluations. But what is 'normal' now that the ERM exists in name alone?
One option is to judge member states' exchange rate performance against the
central rate as represented by the Ecu; but this would impose a tougher
standard than the old 2.25 per cent fluctuation inside the narrow ERM bands,
said one official.
Meantime, the accent is on each member state taking the necessary corrective
action to bring their economies into line.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, British chancellor of the exchequer, may be criticised
for his tax rises in the UK; but in Greece he was happy to stand alongside
Mr Theo Waigel, his German counterpart, as the fearless pruner of budget
deficits.
Nor was the mood too sombre in Athens. One senior official noted that for
the first time in at least two years there was a widespread feeling that the
European economy may be moving decisively into recovery.
If there was a fear, it was that the recent upward pressure on US interest
rates could cross the Atlantic, dashing hopes that the downward trend on the
continent will continue.
Despite misleading suggestions from the Greek delegation, this did not
translate into an appeal to the Bundesbank to accelerate cuts in short-term
rates.
'Everybody realises that this is counterproductive,' an official said.
This realisation suggests a new realism about monetary union. It also
underlines the extent to which the central banks are in the driving seat.

The remains of eastern Germany's privatisation programme are of no interest
to the German private banking sector, according to Mr Jurgen Sarrazin,
chairman of Dresdner Bank.
The family silver had all been sold and eastern German companies still in
the hands of the Treuhand privatisation agency were those with little hope
of survival, he said in a brisk rejection of government criticism of the
banking community's stance.
'The caricature figure of a banker unwilling to open up his full money bags
for needy, weaker neighbours does not become any more convincing no matter
how often it is published,' he said. Rich and profitable German banks have
been criticised recently by politicians for allegedly not doing enough to
help economic recovery in the east.
Mr Sarrazin was speaking at a press conference on Friday to announce the
bank's annual results. Dresdner revealed a 24 per cent increase to DM2bn
(Pounds 800m) in operating profits for 1993.
The banking industry had promised Bonn last year that it would contribute
DM1bn to aid the privatisation process, as part of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
so-called solidarity pact.
However, it had made clear at the outset that banks would only take over
businesses which had an economic future, Mr Sarrazin said.
'Unfortunately, our serious intentions to co-operate fruitfully with the
Treuhand have not often been crowned with success,' he added.

FT  11 APR 94 / Workers set to back Air France rescue
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A vote by Air France's 40,000 employees is likely to show support for a
rescue plan for the loss-making airline when results are announced tonight,
according to union officials at the state-owned carrier.
But they said it was still uncertain whether the margin of approval or the
participation rate would be enough for Mr Christian Blanc, the airline's
chairman, to claim the clear show of support he has demanded to proceed with
his restructuring plan.
Mr Blanc has said he will resign if he fails to receive sufficient support
for his package, which he claims is vital for the survival of Air France.
His measures, which include 5,000 job cuts and a wage freeze, are designed
to curb losses estimated at FFr7.5bn (Pounds 870m) last year. A capital
injection of FFr20bn from the French government over the next three years is
dependent on staff acceptance of the plan.
Opposition from airline workers, and a wave of violent strikes, prompted the
collapse of a previous rescue package in October last year.
Mr Blanc decided to hold a referendum after he failed to win the backing of
all 14 of the airline's unions for his rescue package. His chances of
success in the vote have been boosted by the support of Force Ouvriere, the
largest union at the airline, and one of the six unions which signed the
restructuring plan.
Mr Blanc has not specified the level of support he requires for the plan,
but is thought to be seeking more than 60 per cent approval.

FT  11 APR 94 / Nato strikes leave peace in balance: Attacks could bring new
realism to Serbs or ruin joint diplomatic initiatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fate of peace-making efforts in Bosnia hung in the balance last night as
the Damocles' sword of Nato air strikes finally dropped.
At best, the air attacks will bring a new realism to the Bosnian Serbs who
in recent days have brazenly tested the will of the international community
and exploited every sign of hesitation and departmental infighting among
western governments. At worst, the Nato action will alienate Russia and thus
ruin the chances of co-ordinated diplomatic action by the Security Council.
The most optimistic view of the Bosnian Serbs' bid to capture Gorazde, one
of three so-called safe areas for Moslems, is to see it as a final grab for
territory before bowing to international pressure and making peace with the
newly established Croat-Moslem federation.
The outlines of a deal already exist: the Serbs would trim their share of
Bosnian territory from 70 to 49 per cent, and in return regain international
respectability. But the precise contours of the ethnic divide have been left
undecided, creating an irresistible temptation to take advantage of a fluid
situation.
The Bosnian Serbs have made no secret of the fact that, for them, the
existence of Gorazde and two adjoining safe areas is an irritant. It
obstructs their dream of creating a greater Serbia by linking eastern Bosnia
with Serbia proper and the Serb-controlled parts of Croatia.
There is speculation that in exchange for full control of eastern Bosnia,
the Serbs would cede territory in the centre and north of the republic,
where their army is over-stretched and under pressure from the Moslem-led
government's well-trained infantry.
But the passions unleashed by the latest fighting - both inside former
Yugoslavia and beyond - could complicate the peace-making process.
Progress has been made over the past two months by a mixture of
old-fashioned 'superpower' diplomacy and the personal authority of Gen Sir
Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia.
The US and Russia have largely taken over the 'glamorous' side of
peace-making in Bosnia.
But more recently, western policy has been compromised by embarrassing
public squabbles between the Pentagon - which has been hesitant about the
use of force - and the State Department, which has been less so.
Because of the political disaster which a failed intervention in Bosnia
could entail, different sections of the American administration have been
passing responsibility to one another, and to Gen Rose.
Nor can Russia be counted on to exercise a moderating influence over the
Serbs - especially now that the air strikes have inflamed passions
throughout the orthodox Slav world.
Lord Owen, British co-chairman of the EU-UN conference on Yugoslavia, has
predicted a 'crucial eight weeks' in which the current settlement plan will
live or die.
If the opportunity is fumbled, it will mark the third Bosnian peace plan to
have died - and will cast a shadow over the prospects for stability in the
Balkans.

FT  11 APR 94 / Bossi spells out conditions to right-wing allies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PONTIDA, NORTHERN ITALY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's Northern League will help form a new Italian government, but only if
its federal, free-market and anti-fascist values are respected, Mr Umberto
Bossi, the party leader, told followers yesterday.
Mr Bossi addressed an estimated 30,000 to 45,000 banner-waving leghisti at
an open-air rally in Pontida, the supposed birthplace of the 12th century
Lombard League, in the hills near Milan.
His speech opens the final week of unsettling political limbo in Italy,
following last month's elections in which a right-wing alliance of the
League, Mr Silvio Berlusconi's new party, Forza Italia, and the neo-fascist
National Alliance, won a clear victory over the left.
On Friday, new members of parliament take their seats. Following
consultation with the newly elected speakers for the two chambers of
parliament, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro will choose a prime minister and
the real negotiations for the formation of a government can begin.
Yesterday's message from Mr Bossi to his allies in the electoral pact was
raw and uncompromising.
For example, he said the National Alliance should 'take note' that the
League would not tolerate regurgitated (fascist) ideology'. But he avoided
direct attacks on Mr Berlusconi, whom he last week dubbed 'Berluskaiser' in
a reference to the media magnate's autocratic style, and the National
Alliance, which he has referred to as 'the gallows party'.
His uncharacteristic moderation in an otherwise rabble-rousing speech
reflects the delicate stage of government talks.
At the end of last week, the League and National Alliance began to lay the
groundwork for reconciliation of their apparently contradictory ambitions.
The League now appears ready to accept the principle that the Italian prime
minister should be directly elected, in return for National Alliance
concessions in favour of federalist constitutional reform.
But any progress could easily be undermined. For example, the League managed
to upset its allies almost immediately after Friday's positive meeting with
the National Alliance, by proposing that Italy should change its name to the
Italian Union.
Yesterday, Mr Berlusconi - who is widely expected to be asked to form the
new government - tried to paper over the differences between the allies by
describing the victorious electoral pact as centrist rather than right-wing.
'I give my word that I will be the bearer of common sense and firmness, and
will keep the tiller always in the centre,' he told a political meeting in
Rome.
The difficulty for any Italian premier of steering a steady course was
underlined by Mr Bossi's speech at Pontida. He won a resounding Yes from the
crowd for his proposal that the League act as a guarantor for anti-fascist
and liberal values in any new government. But the biggest cheer of the
afternoon was reserved for the old separatist threat that, if the latest
democratic changes do not achieve the League's goals in a short time, 'the
North will simply break off' from the rest of Italy.

FT  11 APR 94 / Riding a chariot of fire on the screen: Film maker David
Puttnam wants a more dynamic and businesslike approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Puttnam, producer of such influential European-made films as
Chariots of Fire, The Killing Fields and The Mission has, he believes,
entered his 'fifth age' as a film maker.
It is an age in which he is more likely to fly to Brussels to lobby members
of the European Commission on the future employment potential of the
audio-visual industry than to see one of his films in the making.
With as much passion as he ever put into his films, Mr Puttnam has been
trying to persuade the Commission, which last week published its discussion
document (green paper) on the audio-visual industries, that no other
industry offers such potential and that the need for action is urgent.
On the present state of the economic battle between the European and the US
industries, Mr Puttnam says: 'It's like going into the home-made lemonade
business and wondering why you are not adequately competing with Coca-Cola.'
An earlier Commission white paper on competitiveness and employment, he
emphasises, identified only three areas which could create large numbers of
new jobs for Europe - biotechnology, energy related to the environment and
the audio-visual industry.
But of these only the last offered, high employment potential, high economic
generative potential, and cultural and informational influence.
As US feature films continue to dominate at the European box office, Mr
Puttnam says simply: 'Either you get into it (the audio-visual business) in
a serious way or take your ball home and find another place to play.'
In his 'fifth age', Mr Puttnam has divided his time between making films and
other activities - seven years as president of the Campaign for the
Preservation of Rural England, chairman of the National Film and Television
School, professor of film at Bristol University training young European film
producers under the Ace programme and trying to persuade Brussels that the
time to intervene is now.
'I'm happy to say no one has noticed,' says Mr Puttnam of the fact that he
is no longer a full-time film maker.
His 'first age' in the profession was spent working in the advertising
industry, followed by a period of juvenalia including rock music films. Then
came the burst of frenetic energy that produced 10 films including the ones
that made him famous and won Oscars.
It was followed by the disastrous time from 1986 to 1988 as chairman and
chief executive of Columbia Pictures, although it was a decision he does not
regret.
Hollywood was something he needed to get out of his system. But now Mr
Puttnam is trying to find ways of doing something about a European
audio-visual industry that he believes is hopelessly fragmented and often
equally hopelessly whimsical.
His ideas do not all involve intervention in the marketplace and the
application of large sums of money.
Mr Puttnam was a member of a European Think Tank of producers and directors
that fed its ideas into the Commission green paper.
They put forward three main proposals:
The first was the creation of two or three significant European-wide film
and television distribution organisations appointed by competitive tender.
They would be capitalised at around Dollars 1bn each and have access to soft
loans.
The second envisages a levy on the entire audio-visual industry to fund new
production. Mr Puttnam insists that the term 'audio-visual' is the correct
one because it is one industry. The scale of the levy would be up to each
European Union member country to decide.
The third proposal is, he believes, the most important of all and involves a
fundamental change of attitude in Europe rather than money. It is a move
away from a supply-led industry to a demand-led industry.
'The first question you have to ask is: Who is the audience for this
picture? It is the last question everyone asks in Europe,' says Mr Puttnam,
who believes the European industry has been sidetracked by the conceit that
cinema is 'different' without realising that the difference equalled a niche
market.
'You create a generation of film and television makers who understand the
marketplace,' Mr Puttnam says of the task ahead.
He tells of a friend, a Hollywood marketing director who has four staff
permanently dumping every piece of available information on every potential
competing film on a computer on his desk.
By comparison, he believes, the state of research in Europe is 'lamentable'.
While it may be a daunting task to compete head-on with Hollywood, he
believes the American industry can be outflanked and, anyway, there is also
the hugh potential of the educational sector.
He finds nowhere in the UK government either a sense of urgency or a sense
of the scale of the issues involved. In Brussels, the audio-visual green
paper followed the normal process - after a year's work it identified
questions rather than options.
Meanwhile, in Hollywood, Mr Puttnam warns that Sony has been putting up a
new building to house interactive computer programming to try to dominate
the emerging multimedia industry. For the European industry Mr Puttnam
believes 'the next five years could be extraordinary or just a crushing
defeat'.

FT  11 APR 94 / Ailing EU film industry awaits policy script: A Brussels
audio-visual paper has posed more questions than answers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In Brussels-speak it is democratic debate. For the rest of the world it may
seem more like waffle.
As the television and film industry digests the European Commission's
audio-visual green paper unveiled last week, suspicions about the problems
of doing business with Brussels bureaucracy are unlikely to have been
dispelled.
Although the Commission and the industry fully agree that 'urgent' action is
needed to boost Europe's ailing audio-visual sector, many might wonder why
it has taken a year to draw up a document that does not provide policy
answers - but simply poses more questions.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, European Union audio-visual commissioner,
suggested some reasons last week. The Commission, he said, had been
unwilling to act during the long-running row over audio-visual policy during
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations last year. And, as a
sign of the delicacies of Brussels protocol, he had also been forced to wait
until Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, had issued his own white
paper on competitivity in December.
Meanwhile, the new spirit of post-Maastricht democracy required the
Commission to promote a full discussion with green papers, before it could
proceed to draw up policies, he added.
But privately, Commission officials admit that the delays in last week's
discussion paper serve as a sorry illustration of the difficulties of even
drawing up policy questions when the political devil almost always lies in
the detail. After wrangling their way through three 'official' drafts of the
paper - and scores of 'private' compromises - the real problem, they
suggest, has been the linguistic sensibilities of the French and English
language lobbies.
The French word faut created a long delay, after English speakers objected
to the way the Commission was posing its questions. Asking the industry if
it 'must' reform - the most literal translation of Faut-il? - was, they
argued simply too dictatorial. 'A word like faut-il might seem like a small
detail, but people are very sensitive,' admitted one embattled official. He
insisted that by Brussels standards, the paper had been written 'quite
fast'.
An early reference to the possible introduction of a European-wide tax on
cinema tickets along the lines of the French system, for example, provoked
an uproar from some of non-French Commission quarters. Although the concept
survived into the final document, it has been tactfully buried at the back
of the paper, with a diplomatic disclaimer stating 'the Commission is fully
aware of the political sensitivity. . .of any such scheme'.
In the event, the rhetorical questions that the document finally resorted to
 -such as 'what should be the priority themes?' - are largely too vague to
provoke much controversy. And though the final French version still reads
slightly more aggressively than its English equivalent, this is unlikely to
upset the French film industry which has long been pushing for a more
authoritative - and interventionist - policy.

FT  11 APR 94 / UN backs further raids to defend safe areas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
United Nations secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali has given UN
peacekeepers 'carte blanche' to make further use of air power to protect
Bosnian safe areas, his spokeswoman said after the raids.
Mr Boutros Ghali's spokeswoman, Ms Therese Gastaut, said: 'The
secretary-general would like to make it very clear that he will not hesitate
to use close air support again to protect the UN-designated safe areas.'
The raids won swift endorsement from Nato governments as a way to further
efforts to find a comprehensive peace in Bosnia. However, the Bosnian
ambassador to the US said the raids were 'too little, too late' in response
to the sustained Serb attack on the Gorazde enclave. There was no official
reaction from Moscow, which has cautioned Nato strongly against enforcing UN
policy in Bosnia.
Ms Gastaut said the decision to ask Nato for air support had been taken by
Mr Yasushi Akashi - Mr Boutros Ghali's special representative in former
Yugoslavia and head of UN peacekeeping operations there - after
consultations earlier on Sunday with Mr Boutros Ghali.
Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian ambassador to the UN, told CNN news that
the attack was more of a message than a real response to the Serb advance on
Gorazde. He called for the Serb troops to be withdrawn to lines previously
agreed with the UN.
Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister, acknowledged reports of a
direct hit on the headquarters of the Serbian troops attacking the town.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, was informed of the air strikes minutes
before they took place. Downing Street later said: 'This is the sort of
action that Nato always said might be necessary. It did not need his (Mr
Major's) approval since the actions have been sanctioned by UN resolutions.'
The German government spokesman, Mr Dieter Vogel, said Bonn hoped the air
strikes would advance the Bosnian peace process. He said: 'The attackers of
Gorazde have no one to blame but themselves for this answer from Nato.'

FT  11 APR 94 / Nato air strike halts Serb shelling: US jets attack to
protect embattled Bosnian enclave - Clinton warns of tough resolve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nato aircraft attacked Serb forces advancing on the Moslem enclave of
Gorazde last night, the first time the alliance has acted on its
long-standing threat to use air power to protect Bosnian towns.
The United Nations said the air strike, aimed at an artillery command post,
succeeded in stopping the Serb shelling. But President Bill Clinton quickly
warned that Washington would support further air attacks on Serb positions
if requested by UN military commanders in Bosnia.
He said the raid by two US F-16 fighter bombers, based at Aviano in Italy,
was a clear signal of UN and US resolve. He urged the Serbs to roll back
their two-week-old offensive on Gorazde, one of three 'safe areas' for
Moslems in eastern Bosnia. At least 100 people have been killed and 400
wounded in the fighting around the enclave.
General Sir Michael Rose, the head of UN forces in Bosnia, said he had
called for the raid after a tank began firing into the centre of the town.
He said the shelling stopped 18 minutes after the aircraft dived out of a
rain cloud to drop their bombs.
According to Mr Michael Williams, the UN's chief spokesman in former
Yugoslavia, the action was taken under Security Council resolution 836,
which 'allows for the use of air power, in and around the safe areas, to
support Unprofor (the UN protection force) in the performance of its
mandate'.
He added that UN military observers and humanitarian personnel, as well as
Bosnian civilians, were at direct risk from the shelling, and that the
Bosnian Serb leadership had been warned of this yesterday afternoon.
He said General Bertrand de Lapresle, head of UN forces in former
Yugoslavia, hoped to meet the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, and
Bosnian Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic today. 'We would hope that the
peace process is not seriously impaired,' Mr Williams said.
However, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister, said the Moslems
would not join the talks unless the Serbs retreated to the positions they
occupied before the battle over Gorazde.
General Milan Gvero, deputy commander of the Bosnian Serb armed forces,
accused Nato of bombing civilian targets, and described the strikes as 'an
attack on Serbian civilisation', but did not threaten reprisals against Nato
or the UN.
However, the Nato action raises the possibility of a dispute with Russia,
where the Serb cause is strongly supported. According to the Yugoslav news
agency, the Serb army's Hercegovina Corps warned: 'By this act, Nato carried
out a clear act of aggression against Serb people, striking at civilian
targets far from the front line.'
Gen Rose has struggled unsuccessfully in recent days to arrange a ceasefire
in Gorazde in preparation for a longer-term truce. The Nato operation
followed reports of heavy artillery and small-arms fire reaching as far as
the centre of the enclave, home to 65,000 Moslems.
Mr Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the UN High Commission for Refugees, said
shortly before the air attack that thousands of desperate villagers were
pouring into Gorazde amid a heavy artillery barrage. 'People can see
villages around Gorazde burning and there is constant fire from howitzers in
and around the centre.' He added that the UNHCR building had come under
small-arms fire and people had been targeted by snipers.
The US involvement marks a turning point in the conflict. In recent days,
Pentagon officials had questioned whether air strikes would be effective in
ending the conflict over Gorazde, and played down the scale of the fighting.
However, the administration came under pressure to act as the UN reported an
intensification of the Serb assault and warned that the townspeople were
increasingly desperate.
Gen Rose told Reuter news agency he had warned Serb commanders three times
in telephone and fax messages they would be bloodied if they continued
advancing on Gorazde. 'We warned them very firmly that if this continues we
would have to resort to appropriate action and they knew exactly what we
meant,' he said.
The UNHCR, concerned about reprisals against its staff, said it would
suspend aid convoys through Serb-controlled territory.

FT  11 APR 94 / Lift-truck maker Lancer Boss calls in the receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lancer Boss Group, one of the UK's biggest privately owned manufacturing
companies and the last big UK-owned producer of lift trucks, called in
receivers over the weekend.
The move was prompted by a disagreement between the company's German unit,
Steinbock Boss, and its German banks over expansion plans. The banks
withdrew their support for Steinbock, leaving the unit with no option but to
go into receivership.
Receivers were also called in to the protect the British companies, although
Lancer Boss is likely to continue operations if - as expected  - it is sold.
The move ends 37 years of control of Lancer Boss by the founding brothers
and owners, Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw and Mr Trevor Bowman-Shaw.
The probable sale of Lancer Boss is likely to generate intense interest
among rival lift-truck manufacturers and could herald a new round of
consolidation in the lift-truck industry.
Lancer Boss, based in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, has annual sales of
about Pounds 180m, 1,200 employees worldwide (including 700 in the UK) and
one of the widest and most modern product ranges in the industry.
Sir Neville yesterday said: 'I hope the group is welded back together again,
although it will be under new ownership.'
He said a receiver was appointed for Steinbock Boss after its banking group,
led by Bayerische Hypo-Bank, withdrew its support from the Moosburg-based
producer which Lancer Boss bought in 1983.
Later on Friday, in order to protect the British companies in the Lancer
Boss group, Sir Neville asked British banks led by NatWest to appoint a
receiver for several British subsidiaries. Mr Allan Griffiths of Grant
Thornton has been appointed receiver and, with a team of 20 people, has
spent most of the weekend at the company's offices in Leighton Buzzard.
Sir Neville is believed to have been planning to link up with a non-German
company, possibly Komatsu of Japan. However, the German banks may have
wanted Steinbock to link with Jungheinrich, the Hamburg-based lift-truck
producer, which is ranked third biggest in the world.
Lancer Boss had pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.7m on sales of Pounds 200m in
the year ended April 1993, but was expecting to report a big loss for the
following year.
Mr Griffiths said he had no doubts that Lancer Boss would be sold as a going
concern, but he still has to clarify the status of Steinbock Boss's
receivership.
Lancer Boss is expected to hold a press conference today to outline its
position.

FT  11 APR 94 / Japanese power struggle over new leadership: Impasse
increases likelihood of another general election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's seven-party coalition government was yesterday close to breaking up,
as it failed to resolve a bitter power struggle over the successor to Prime
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.
The impasse, over the policies and composition of the next government,
increases the likelihood of another general election. This would paralyse
the government as trade disputes with the US approach a critical juncture
and as it struggles to implement an economic stimulus package, which is
needed to pull Japan out of its worst recession since the second world war.
Mr Hosokawa will stay on as a caretaker leader until a successor can be
found. Coalition leaders did agree to try to form a new cabinet by mid-week,
allowing the new prime minister to deliver a policy speech to parliament
before the weekend. But a senior official of one party warned that any such
administration would be transitional.
Mr Hosokawa's decision to quit, announced on Friday, unleashed a new
struggle among Japanese political parties, thrown into flux by last summer's
defeat of the Liberal Democratic party. It has intensified the growing split
between the coalition's right and left wings.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the conservative foreign minister, remained the most likely
successor, with the apparent backing of Mr Hosokawa and three conservative
parties giving a majority within the coalition.
But left-wing coalition members voiced suspicion that Mr Hata would be the
puppet of his powerful colleague Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's backroom
strategist. Mr Ozawa's dominance over Mr Hosokawa has enraged the Social
Democratic party, the alliance's largest member. Mr Ozawa and Mr Hata
jointly lead the Japan Renewal party, or Shinseito, the second-largest
coalition member, which has dominated foreign, trade, and economic policy,
despite Socialist opposition.
'There is a lot of resistance to the idea of Shinseito taking control . . .
If we are unable to form a strong government, then we let the people
decide,' said Mr Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the SDP.
Mr Hosokawa started the latest political realignment, shortly after
announcing his resignation, by confirming the end of his own Japan New
party's plans to merge with another coalition member, the New Harbinger
party.
He launched, instead, a new JNP-led group, called Reform, which was over the
weekend positioning itself as the heart of a new right wing alliance, to
embrace Mr Ozawa's JRP and the Buddhist-backed Komeito clean government
party. About 10 members of parliament from Mr Hosokawa 's JNP - less than a
third of the total - said they would defect because they did not like Mr
Ozawa. The JHP, the JNP's former partners, led by Mr Masayoshi Takemura,
chief cabinet secretary and a fierce rival of Mr Ozawa, has meanwhile joined
the left.
Mr Hata called on sympathetic LDP members to join the alliance amid growing
speculation that Mr Michio Watanabe, an LDP faction leader and former
foreign minister, could lead such a defection and emerge as an alternative
leader of a new conservative coalition. Mr Watanabe said he might consider
'playing a role'.
Coalition members ended their weekend meetings as divided over the operating
rules of a new government as over the party line-up. Mr Ozawa and his
supporters want coalition members to agree common policies on the most
important matters - like relations with the US, the threat from North Korea
and tax reform - before choosing a new prime minister, to avoid the policy
U-turns which have crippled the current government.
This idea is anathema to the left. The Socialist party wants its members to
be free to follow their own views.

FT  09 APR 94 / Knight takes a tilt at the markets: Dominic Lawson hears the
voice of doom on his radio and asks who is making the news and why?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People who insist on listening to the news on a bank holiday should perhaps
not expect very much in the way of enlightenment. I imagine that BBC radio's
newsdesk is more than usually depleted on public holidays, and those who are
working are probably not very happy to be there.
All the same, I was still caught quite unawares by the announcement which
headed the Radio 4 8am news last Easter Monday: 'Share prices in London,'
the voice said, 'are expected to fall sharply when the market re-opens
tomorrow, on fears of a stronger than expected rise in the US economy.'
Now, I do not care very much for 'news' bulletins which tell me what might -
and, therefore, what might not - happen tomorrow. Call me old-fashioned but
I regard that sort of thing as opinion, not news.
But my gast was also flabbered by the apparent reason for this expected
'news': the great surge in the US economy. Again, I might be behind the
times, but I was always taught that a strong US economy was good for Britain
and, therefore, the London stock market because Britain's balance of trade
would benefit from increasing exports to its former colony.
But let us not always blame the BBC. It was, after all, only parrotting what
was already in the newspapers. The Sunday Times on April 3 had led its
business section with the banner headline 'Markets fear selling frenzy'. And
in turn, the Sunday Times was only repeating what someone else was saying.
We are getting close to the source of all this gloom now: Nick Knight, chief
equity strategist at the London branch of Nomura, the biggest Japanese
investment house. According to the Sunday Times: 'On Thursday, after London
had closed for Easter, (Knight) faxed his clients a deeply disturbing note
predicting that Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Index will fall by 400
points to 3,200 and London's FT-SE index by 300 points to 2800.'
What Knight's clients were expected to do with this information while the
markets closed over Easter is something of a mystery. Panic, I suppose. Or
perhaps not. After all, Knight predicted earlier in the year that the FT-SE
index would rise to 4,000 by the year-end. Average that with the revised
prophecy of 2,800 and you probably get a comforting
middle-of-the-range-figure that Nomura clients could live with.
I am told that Knight's boss in Tokyo keeps in his desk a Xeroxed photograph
of Knight's smiling face surrounded, in the manner of crazily orbiting moons
around a planet, by a plotted graph of Knight's differing forecasts of the
international stock markets.
So Knight's boss would not have panicked when he saw his London man's
'deeply disturbing fax' predicting 'quasi-crashes' in London and New York.
But the Sunday Times and the BBC, not to mention their audiences, who had
not got the benefit of seeing the humorous diagram lying in an important
desk in Nomura's Tokyo office, could not be so sanguine.
Perhaps those poor saps, the small investors who faithfully read the Sunday
Times business section or listen to the BBC's financial 'news,' rushed to
their telephones on Tuesday morning and told their brokers to sell, sell,
sell. And perhaps, on the next morning, they picked up their copy of the
Financial Times to read on the front page: 'US stocks and bonds rise
sharply' and, for good measure, that 'the FT-SE index closed up 29.8 at
3116.2.'
Yes, the BBC 'news' got it wrong. They believed the Sunday Times. The Sunday
Times believed Nick Knight. And what of Knight's clients, the myriad
heavy-hitting Japanese institutional investors who make up Nomura's client
list?
I would not be surprised if they were among the people mopping up the stock
being sold by smaller investors who were panicked by a BBC news bulletin
based on a forecast prepared originally for quite a different audience.
These institutional clients are now sitting on a nice little profit, to be
translated into yen at the appropriate moment.
And when will that be?
When the BBC leads a bank holiday bulletin with the 'news' that a run on the
Japanese currency is expected on the following day.

FT  09 APR 94 / Hawks and Handsaws: The sun also rises over Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have been catching up on new Russian writing. There are plenty of new
Russian writers to choose from, including Zufar Gareyev, Yevgeny Kharitonov,
Olga Sedakova, Alla Latynina and Victor Pelevin. Especially Victor Pelevin,
who was born in 1962 and whose inimitable humorousness, it has been said,
'enables him to bid farewell to Russia's communistic past with a final
laugh.'
Pelevin can be funny. But he can also move you to tears - not in the way
that John Major moves people to tears (tears of outrage and disbelief) but
tears of fellow-feeling for Pelevin's countrymen as they are dragged from
the lightless depths into the blinding solar day.
Until I read a short piece by Pelevin called The View from the Window, my
attitude to Russia's plight was lackadaisical - not frivolous, especially,
but casual and negligent and zestlessly satirical.
Not any more. I found The View from the Window electrifying. It made me sit
up straight and try to understand the terror and despair in so many people's
lives as they contemplate what Pelevin calls the 'psychic storm of
immeasurable violence . . . raging in the skies over Russia.'
Pelevin's narrator says that Russians were in such a hurry to sink their
floating concentration camp that when it finally began to keel over, they
suddenly realised that they were its passengers, and that the guard dogs who
had snarled at them for so many years from behind barbed wire had long since
left and gone to read lectures on perestroika in small American
universities.
He says that the most expensive and opulent horror film of the last 50 years
is now being shot in Russia. And he likens his countrymen to the half-blind
fish that live under the sea, resisting immense pressure. If one of these
fish is pulled from the depths to the surface, it explodes like a bomb.
'We are the same kind of fish. For 70 years we have lived under the pressure
of tons of terror, which has permeated everything around us so thoroughly
that we have ceased to notice it. It has become an integral part of
ourselves, and now that they have tried to drag us up to the surface in a
few short years, up to freedom and the sun, we feel terror advancing on us
out of the future. But there is no terror in the future  - what we are
feeling now comes from inside us. We are being torn apart by the terror that
used to be balanced by the inhuman pressure applied to our souls. They keep
on pulling us up higher and higher, and we've already swollen perceptibly,
but if only we don't burst in the next few metres, at long last we shall
finally glimpse the sun.'
If only . . . the power of this passage rests on those two words. If only
Pelevin's countrymen can withstand the pressure, they, too, will enjoy life
at the surface. And what a life it is. Reading Pelevin has made me grateful
for aspects of life in London.
For our queen, and for her salty-tongued escort. For all our princes and
princesses. For our generals and vice-marshals. For John Major and his wife,
and all John Major's ministers, be they tatty and infirm. For our judges and
policemen and our newly-skirted clergy. For our tabloid newspapers, whose
efforts to please and serve us have awakened understanding of the bedroom
part of life. For cricket and football. Oak trees and bulbs. For our great
industrial processes. For Scotland, Ulster and Wales - our precious,
productive regions. And for the men and women who write law reports in The
Times.
I read one of these reports last week. 'Organ grinder is not liable for
VAT,' it was headlined, and was an account of a ruling made by the Court of
Justice of the European Communities (Sixth Chamber) regarding interpretation
of article 2(1) of the sixth council directive (77/388/EEC) of May 17 1977,
on the harmonisation of the laws of member states relating to turnover
taxes.
It was decided that an organ grinder, named Tolsma, who grinds his barrel
organ 'on the public highway in The Netherlands,' is not liable to pay VAT
on the proceeds he solicits by waving (while grinding) a collecting tin in
people's faces.
This struck me as enchanting - the sort of thing exactly, humdrum and
puerile, that Victor Pelevin and his countrymen can look forward to reading,
in the comfort of heated homes, if only they survive their ascent without
bursting - and live to see the sun.

FT  09 APR 94 / Disaster strikes in middle England: Adam Raphael explains
the sense of betrayal among fellow Names at Lloyd's who now face ruin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADAM RAPHAEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shortly after 5pm on his first day as chairman of Lloyd's, the London
insurance market David Rowland heard a knock on his door. It was a waiter,
resplendent in a Victorian navy blue and crimson tail coat, bearing a glass
of champagne on a silver salver.
'The chairman always has a glass of champagne at this time,' he was told.
Champagne is no longer served on the 12th floor, the Rolls-Royce has been
sold and the waiters are gone.
The days when Lloyd's chairmen lived like Renaissance princes have
disappeared. So, too, have the conflicts of interest, the incompetence and
the amateurishness which brought the market to its knees. But the losses
continue.
There is no English word for Schadenfreude, the joy that comes from watching
other people's misfortunes, but the crisis at Lloyd's has undoubtedly given
pleasure to many. The gloating over those who were seen to have gambled on
unlimited liability and lost everything is based on a myth that only the
seriously rich have been stung. Not so - most of the Names who are now
facing ruin are neither rich nor famous. As most shy away from publicity,
the results are rarely obvious However, lives have been wrecked, careers
ended, children forced to leave school, houses sold, marriages sundered. In
a few cases, the consequences have been even more tragic.
A year ago this month, Diana Weston found the body of her husband hanging
from a noose tied to a banister in their north London home. Harold Weston, a
51-year-old solicitor, had told his wife that he could see no end to his
losses at Lloyd's, which he feared would result in his professional
disgrace.
'They asked for more and more money; that's when he started to sleep badly,'
Diana Weston told the coroner. 'He was told he might go bankrupt.'
Two years earlier, when Lloyd's was about the announce its first losses for
two decades, David Coleridge, then chairman, said in an interview: 'We have
the misfortune to blush very publicly. We had 30,000 members. Many of them
will have lost money and they make a lot of fuss . . . Most of the people
who are bitching and whingeing are doing it because they don't like losing .
. . No-one has been swindled and it has nothing to do with unlimited
liability. It's simply pure losses.'
But the crisis at Lloyd's is not simply a result of pure losses. Given the
belief of some underwriters that they could ignore the basic principles of
insurance, it was perhaps inevitable that a complacency born of 300 years of
successful trading would sooner or later be shattered.
The scale of the catastrophe is nevertheless extraordinary. Losses have
exceeded more than Pounds 7bn in four years, more than than the loss of any
other British financial institution in history.
Those who have been caught in this financial disaster are understandably
angry. One bankrupt Name went up to David Coleridge and shouted, an inch
from his nose: 'Remember this face - I hope you have nightmares over it. You
have ruined me.'
Clive Francis, a former RAF fighter pilot, who has had to sell his house and
move into a rented flat having lost nearly Pounds 3m says: 'To think that my
fortune is now in the hands of those fools.' Nick Gratwick, a 36-year-old
insurance broker, was in a militant mood when I sat next to him at a Lloyd's
general meeting. 'Why should I mortgage my future for that bastard down
there,' he said pointing at Coleridge. 'I am going down to the county court
next week to declare personal bankruptcy. If they want my future, they can
whistle for it.'
The bitterness of those who have lost everything has been increased by a
feeling of betrayal. How, they ask, could a market, which had built up a
reputation for integrity and fair dealing over three centuries, allow itself
to be turned into a cauldron of insider dealing?
As one disillusioned Name put it: 'What has been destroyed is trust. People
joined Lloyd's confident in its reputation for 'utmost good faith'. To be a
member of Lloyd's was a distinction, something of which one could be proud.
No longer.'
The factors leading to the downfall of Lloyd's are complex, but undoubtedly
a root cause was its failure to control capacity. Between 1983 and 1988, the
market doubled in size while premiums grew by less than a fifth. Insurance
has always been a cyclical business, depending on the flow of capital. But
there had never been anything quite like the mid-1980s premium frenzy. A
leading members' agent, James Sinclair, managing director of Willis Faber
Dumas, is refreshingly blunt: 'Lloyd's recent history is an outrageous
disgrace, with greed, bad management, incompetence and catastrophes bringing
the market to its knees.'
During the 1980s boom a very large number of new Names joined with
inadequate capital resources. Often they were persuaded to join by
individuals on commission who were paid undisclosed fees by members' agents
anxious to expand their capacity. The British tennis player, Buster Mottram
was relaxing in a bath in the changing rooms at Wimbledon after losing the
men's doubles final in 1983 when he was approached.
Did he know anything about Lloyd's? asked a fellow member, who then outlined
the glowing advantages of joining. An introduction was effected and,
persuaded by the agents' enthusiastic endorsement, both Buster and his
father, Tony, signed on, a decision that was to land them with losses of
more than Pounds 1m.
Buster looks back with bitterness on how he was snared. 'I knew nothing
about excess of loss insurance. I was never given any explanation. The whole
thing has been a nightmare.'
Lloyd's not only connived at such practices as commission payments, it
allowed its own entrance requirements to be undermined. Names are not
allowed to use the value of their principal residence either for their
deposit or as evidence of their net wealth. But this precaution was
sidestepped by the use of bank guarantees, a device which lured many who
should have never have gone near such a high risk market. One such innocent
was Bridget Milling Smith, the 26-year-old widow of a Royal Marine officer
killed on active service in Oman. On her return to England in 1979 with her
two small children, she was advised by Charterhouse Japhet to join Lloyd's.
'I don't want you to think I was a wimp, but I had been married since I was
21, and I didn't know anything about how to manage my financial affairs,'
she explained later. Her financial adviser listened to her worries about how
she would be able to bring up and educate her children on her own.
'Join Lloyd's, I know just the right man,' he advised his client, who had a
small cottage but no job and no income apart from dividends from her capital
of Pounds 70,000 in shares. A decade later, Milling Smith now continuous
calls from several open year syndicates with huge asbestos and pollution
liabilities. She has given up counting how much she owes, but it must be
more than Pounds 200,000. 'It doesn't make any difference to me any more,'
she says.
The consequence of encouraging thousands of Names with only moderate means
to gamble their homes away is now admitted to have been a disastrous
mistake. 'I think we should have been asking in crude terms - if you join
Lloyd's, can you write a cheque for Pounds 100,000 and not disturb your
lifestyle,' says Sir Peter Miller, chairman from 1984-1988. 'We failed to
raise deposits sharply enough.'
The large intake of new Names provided the cannon fodder for the market's
greatest folly - the notorious reinsurance spiral in which catastrophe risks
were shunted incestuously around the market so that the original liability
became completely obscured. The availability of exceptionally cheap
reinsurance led to basic principles being flouted. Primary insurers were
able to accept dubious risks, confident that, however bad the claims record
turned out to be, they could lay off the risk and still make a handsome
profit. The result was doubly damaging. The spiral undermined underwriting
standards at the same time as exposing thousands of Names to enormous losses
in the event of a series of catastrophes.
The fortunes of Names and those who act for them should have been closely
aligned, but this crucial relationship was undermined by the
get-rich-quick-mentality of the 1980s. Agents, remunerated by profit,
commissions and fees, stood to gain greatly from expansion. The temptation
to expand capacity regardless of risk was increased by the agents' desire to
capitalise their businesses and sell out for large sums while the going was
good.
Conflicts of interest also exacerbated the most serious threat that Lloyd's
faces - the problem of old year losses. The market's system of trading, a
three-year accounting period at the end of which a syndicate's financial
position is finalised by means of an internal reinsurance premium paid to
the successor year, depends almost entirely on trust. During the late 1970s
and early 1980s, many long-tail syndicates paid out illusory profits and
reaped equally bogus profit commissions as a result of inadequate reserving.
Thousands of newly-recruited Names found that they were trapped on
syndicates which had inherited billions of pounds worth of pollution and
asbestos claims dating back half a century. Were they gulled into joining
such under-reserved syndicates in order to dilute the losses?
Robert Kiln, a distinguished former underwriter, says: 'Many Names who
joined Lloyd's in the 1980s have suffered unfair and enormous losses due to
the gross inadequacy of the reinsurance to close made over the past 40 years
and which was well known about in the early 1980s.'
The discrediting of its traditional system of trading leaves Lloyd's with a
difficult structural problem. A no less serious difficulty is the mis-match
between the increasing volatility of the market's capital base and the
long-tail business it has traditionally underwritten.
When the highest-level direct tax was at 98 per cent, the risk of
underwriting losses was borne largely by the Inland Revenue. The destruction
of the market as a tax shelter has coincided with a realisation that the
risks of underwriting with unlimited liability are folly for all but the
seriously rich.
After the devastating losses of the past four years and the bankrupting of a
sixth of its capital base, few believe that a market, in which professionals
were trusted to run the business on behalf of amateurs, can be brought back
to life.
The new Lloyd's that is emerging is one in which big corporate players with
limited liability will call the shots. Robert Hiscox, deputy chairman, is
among those who believe there is no future for the individual Lloyd's Name
trading on the basis of unlimited liability. 'It causes too much grief,' he
says.
Anyone who seeks to forecast what will happen next is faced by the
difficulty familiar to portrait painters - the sitter refuses to keep still.
Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, noted shortly after his
appointment: 'No British institution has ever taken the losses that Lloyd's
has and survived.' Yet the market has professional skills, a world famous
brand name, and an institutional resilience which should not be
underestimated.
Adam Raphael, is a Name at Lloyd's, chairman of Syndicate 90 Names
Association, and a member of the Lloyd's Names Associations' Working Party
steering group. His book Ultimate Risk - the inside story of the Lloyd's
catastrophe, is published by Bantam Press on April 28 at Pounds 16.99.

FT  09 APR 94 / Arts: Perchance to dream - Lynn MacRitchie finds an artist
sharing her bed with visitors in an art gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We are such stuff as dreams are made on . . .' and dreams themselves provide
the stuff that Janine Antoni has used to make a work especially for the
Anthony D'Offay Gallery.
There she sits, in the recently-opened exhibition space dedicated to showing
young artists, at a simple loom, weaving an endless blanket of undyed wool.
Through the neutral warp and weft run two parallel curving lines of blue
cloth, their shapes based on the mappings of the artist's dream activity, as
drawn by the polyosomnograph machine which stands in the opposite corner,
the folded heaps of graph paper on the floor beside it echoing the fall of
the cloth.
Beneath the loom stands a bed, where the artist sleeps each night, tearing a
strip from her blue cotton nightgown the next morning to become the marker
of her dreams. Above the bed, like a canopy, stretch the woollen threads
which form the warp, curving up to a wooden rack which rests against the
wall, stacking the 316 spools of wool in neat rows.
It is a charming tableau. The artist welcomes visitors, explaining the work
to them. In turn, they tell her their dreams and often, their secrets too,
the quiet ambience encouraging confidences. Antoni, from the Bahamas and now
based in New York, describes her work as an attempt to render ordinary human
activities, those things that everyone must do  - sleep, eat, wash, clean up
 -into sculpture.
This starting point leads to the creation of works various in form and
complex in reference. She has made self portrait busts out of soap, washed
art gallery floors with her hair and, at last year's Whitney Biennial in New
York, showed two huge blocks, one of chocolate, one of lard. She used part
of each to make models of lipsticks and cosmetic boxes by biting lumps off
and chewing until the material was malleable enough to form into the
counterfeits.
Such work throws up a veritable maze of references. These are both artistic
 -the rectangles of minimal sculpture, for example, or the fat so favoured
as a material by Joseph Beuys - and political, the relation of women to
domestic work for one, or the ambiguous nature of 'beauty', enhanced by
products made almost entirely of its supposed enemy, fat.
Antoni is conscious of what could be a heavy PC loading for her work; it
remains essentially serene, however, unlike the sometimes shrill protest art
favoured by some of her contemporaries. The questions in her work are muted,
raised and resolved as an integral part of its realisation rather than
screaming slogans.
Following through the creation of Slumber illustrates how its final form,
unusual though it may be, was arrived at by a carefully considered process.
Realising that she wished to do a work based on sleep, Antoni, who is
diligent in her research, turned first to 'all the classics', including the
work of the Surrealists and their mentor Freud. She then decided that she
did not want to work with dream 'contents' such as they had striven to
depict or describe.
Turning to the world of science, she discovered at a sleep disorder clinic
in Yonkers, a doctor who collected art work about sleeping. He taught her
how to use a polyosomnograph, which gave her what she had been looking for -
a means of representing the dream state, achieved by plotting periods of
rapid eye movement during sleep. These became her pattern, weaving her
process, chosen because of its own fundamental status as a human activity,
rendering the fragile filaments of thread into an object of substance. She
learned to weave, designed a loom small enough to fit into the gallery space
and, her own Rumplestiltskin, set about transforming not straw into gold,
but sleep into art.
Although not seeking to be a performance or process artist, she accepts her
'live' role during this piece, trying to get a couple of hours weaving done
in the morning before the number of visitors gets too great, sleeping
peacefully in her woollen nest at night.
A selection of work by gallery artists celebrates the opening of the new
space, including a powerful new video installation by Bruce Nauman, whose
important retrospective is about to begin its progress across the US. Antoni
is pleased to be surrounded by her older contemporaries, many of whom she
recognises as influences. 'It's good to have Kiki Smith around the corner
and Bruce Nauman upstairs,' she says, and the show is indeed a useful
anthology of some of the most significant artists of the last 15 years,
including Johns, Hamilton, Baselitz, Gilbert &amp; George and more. It is a
handy marker to set against Picasso at the Tate and Dali at the Hayward.
Antoni is grateful for this contextualisation of her work, appreciating the
boost to its understanding this gathering of her elders may bring.
And it has other benefits. Aren't you frightened, I ask, sleeping here
alone? 'No,' she says quick as a flash, 'with all this art around, the
security must be good]' Sweet dreams.
At the Anthony D'Offay Gallery, 24 Dering Street, London, until April 15.

FT  09 APR 94 / Arts: American songfest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When does a British orchestra sound like an American orchestra? Hardly ever
 -except when Leonard Slatkin conducts it; as he did the Philharmonia on
Wednesday in an all-American programme, the first of their three
contributions to the Festival of American Music on the South Bank.
An immensely professional conductor with a sharp ear, Slatkin knows exactly
how to obtain the sound he wants for this repertoire.
William Schuman's unadvertised American Festival Overture, expertly rackety
and hard-edged, made a rousing start, though it took the concert well beyond
its advertised length. Its title must be a homage to Brahms, whose Academic
Festival Overture was equally an unbuttoned exercise by a conservative
craftsman, not unlike Sir William Walton.
In fact, the Schuman rather shaded the Four Dance Episodes from Copland's
Rodeo. Though the final Hoe-Down is a Copland evergreen, his lively ideas in
the rest of the suite seem pasted together with routine crudity, as in most
ballet suites. Next week the Third Symphony should represent him better. In
Barber's Cello Concerto, Ralph Kirshbaum replaced the originally advertised
soloist - and very well, with much flair and feeling. It was not his fault
that Barber's romantic, sedulously neo-European idiom sounds more and more
like a historical sport.
Its expansive, 'heartfelt' melodic gestures sit badly with its
short-breathed 'symphonic' workings-out: one is disinclined to believe any
of them. Something analogous may eventually prove true of Leonard
Bernstein's 1977 Songfesttoo, a mixed bag of songs for six singers that
lurches wildly in different directions ' all of them familiar, from his own
earlier music and/or from his favourite models. While the huge impact of
Lenny-the-unbridled-musical-personality still reverberates, however, a
personal work such as Songfest is infernally interesting.
For a start, he chose his texts with the male lover for whom he briefly
abandoned his wife. Thus we get not only mordant reflections on marriage and
passion from Mistress Anne Bradstreet, Edna St Vincent Millay, Gertrude
Stein and the respectable Beats - Ferlinghetti, Corso  - but also Langston
Hughes - black, gay and narcissistic - and Walt Whitman in 'rough male kiss
of blankets' mood. Here that song went to the baritone Thomas Hampson,
eloquently straight, instead of the prescribed bass: presumably because
Brian Bannatyne-Scott was one of two last-minute stand-ins of the solo
sextet.
In the Stein duet, however, B-S. and Faye Robinson made cleverly wry
partners. Cynthia Clarey struck bright character in her every number; Jean
Rigby and young Salvatore Champagne, respectively the lowest and highest
voices among their sexes here, seized their opportunities to good effect.
How much Songfest amounts to is still unassessable, until Bernstein's own
psychodramas have become dry archive material. Now, we seem to hear Lenny
everywhere: in the West Side Story offshoots, in the sentimental Mahlerian
devices of his Whitman setting, even in the opening mock-chorale a la
Stravinsky.

FT  09 APR 94 / Arts: Hint of genius on a leaky boat - Alastair Macaulay
finds Vanessa Redgrave tap dancing on a shaky 'Brecht in Hollywood'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an under-prepared production of a long sprawling anthology called Brecht
in Hollywood, Vanessa Redgrave is currently putting to sea in a sieve.
Aircraft noise is audible and distracting; some of the material is read, and
not all the rest has been adequately learnt; the programme shows which
last-minute cuts have been made; large chunks of the evening are performed
in German . . . The list of problems goes on. Brecht in Hollywood has
nothing going for it except strobe-like flashes of genius.
Do not expect a story, or consistent roles, or sets. Do not expect a show
which will re-tell parts of the life story of Bertholt Brecht. Do not expect
material selected solely from Brecht's years in America (1941-47). Do not
expect what the title Brecht in Hollywood leads you to expect: ie a survey
of serious socialist anger marooned amid the entertainment industry at its
most capitalistic.
(The programme reveals that there have been efforts to give the show the
more appropriate, less catchy, title of Brecht in Exile.)
Expect only scenes, and songs, and readings, that show facets of Brecht's
unflinching scrutiny of the great cultural ironies of his (and our) time.
Wilful blindness to fascism and anti-Semitism; exile from home, and social
displacement; nihilistic despair amid the lures of capitalist luxury; moral
seriousness co-existing with the weakness of the flesh . . . Brecht remains
a uniquely disturbing artist and this show - like (though unlike) The Life
of Galileo, seen recently at the Almeida - reminds London of his importance.
And indeed his prescience. His ironic and eloquent sketch here, Visit to the
Banished Poets, reminds us of the famous exiles of Ovid, Euripides, Villon,
Dante; and it ends with a memento of the poets whose work has been
destroyed. We, however, hear it with ears that have heard more than Brecht
had about the exiles and silencings of Soviet artists, and it startles us
all the more.
One of Vanessa's two colleagues is Ekkehard Schall, long celebrated for his
acting with Brecht's Berliner Ensemble, and here demonstrating some acting
of truly Stanislavskian intensity and characterful detail. (Just how
detached the correct Brecht style should be is one of world theatre's
endlessly debatable mysteries, like how comic Chekhov should be.)
He gives us scenes as the rising fascist Arturo Ui - a terrifyingly forceful
time bomb, whom he irradiates with dark slyness, fierceness, and, most
alarming of all, a certain driving stupidity. And his Galileo is a
conception more startling than Richard Griffiths's at the Almeida - more
burnt-out, more burningly ironic - or it would be were it not for the
excessive thickness here of his German accent.
As for Vanessa, she keeps doing everything that you might regard as shooting
herself in the foot.
She starts the show, by reading, head down, in that extraordinary Vanessa
monotone that can sometimes, but not here, be so infuriating. She sings, not
often in tune, and with a voice that is notably hoarse in its upper notes
even when speaking. She does a tap dance and (kind of) the splits, neither
with particular distinction. For heaven's sake, the woman is 57.
And yet she is luminous. There have been times when I have been irritated by
(this is tricky to explain) how carefully she has worked to achieve an
effect of spontaneity. Here, however, she is marvellously fresh. Even tap
dancing in a Mahagonny excerpt, she manages on the one hand to convey a kind
of charmingly enthusiastic tackiness, while on the other keeping up a
relaxation in her upper body and face that is a reproof to those tensely
tapping Australians in Hot Shoe Shuffle. (And then she takes off her shoes,
and carries on dancing, blithely.)
Her Jewish Wife (from Fear and Misery of the Third Reich) beautifully evokes
the conflicts of feeling in a woman who is about to leave the husband who
will not realise the doom that encompasses her here. Her account of How to
Seduce an Angel - spoken while occasionally licking the creamy froth from a
bowl of egg whites - is a gem of naughty charm.
The simplicity of her playing, and her attention to her colleagues, are all
exemplary in themselves, and do great honour to Brecht's many layers. Rade
Serbedzija, the third member of the team, has great charm in a wide range of
roles.
These are some of the many virtues of Brecht in Hollywood, and they grow
larger in my mind as I think about them now. But it is a messy, long,
under-cooked meal of an evening. Goran Stefanovski devised it, and Lenka
Udovicki directed it, and if they had done so with more discipline they
would have done everybody a favour. Not least Brecht.
At the Bridge Lane Theatre, Battersea, SW11, until April 30.

FT  09 APR 94 / Arts: Nature, nurture and nastiness - Television / A look at
the key questions in the debate about violence on our screens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Q: Now that Professor Elizabeth Newson and 24 other 'experts' have offered
the opinion that there is a link between violent crime and video nasties, is
it not time that television and the broadcasters began to accept some
responsibility?
A: Blaming broadcasters and television is about as sensible as blaming
plastics manufacturers on the grounds that cassettes are made from their
materials. Video nasties may be viewed via television sets but they are
produced by the cinema industry and rented out by video shops. They are not
made by broadcasters, nor shown on British television channels.
Surely these 'experts' are only confirming, finally, what anyone with common
sense could always see: that many violent deeds committed in real life are
imitations of deeds in video nasties or on television programmes.
This ignores the fact that mankind has always been violent. Were there no
murders before television? No wars? Doubtless Ronald Reagan's would-be
assassin did indeed copy the methods he saw in a video, but that is not to
say that without the video he would not have attempted the assassination.
What about all the other people who saw that video; why didn't they try to
assassinate Reagan? Presumably because they were not murderous lunatics. Did
Abraham Lincoln's assassin copy a video?
What about the James Bulger case which finally drove Professor Newson to
declare her change of mind?
What about it? No evidence in that case was ever given to show that either
of the two 10-year-old boys found guilty of the murder had seen a video
nasty. A comment from the judge to the effect that the father of one boy had
rented many video nasties has been widely publicised by people who
desperately want to blame something other than man's violent nature for
man's violence. What about 11-year-old Mary Hayley Bell - who killed two
boys aged four and three in 1968 - did she watch videos? What about the
princes in the tower - would they have survived but for the videos watched
by their killers?
You cannot pretend that it is sheer coincidence that violent deeds are done
so often by people who watch a lot of violent videos.
Of course it is not coincidence, any more than it is coincidence that Steve
Cram, Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett all watched countless athletics videos
and all became top athletes. Would you attribute their prowess to their
abnormal intake of videos or argue that they watch the videos because they
have an abnormal interest in athletics? Videos cannot make you a champion
any more than videos can make you a murderer, though they may give you ideas
about technique: a longer stride pattern, a sawn-off shotgun and a black
balaclava. If you doubt this and believe that screen violence really can
turn non-murderers into murderers, would you apply this to yourself or
merely to everyone else?
Given all the money that advertisers spend on commercials, how can you argue
that screen violence does not 'sell' violence?
Do advertisers sell sausages to vegetarians? Cars to non-drivers? Tampons to
men? Television commercials sell products to those already predisposed to
buy. They are largely concerned with winning market share, not with
converting people, which is extremely difficult. Furthermore, the intent of
the advertiser is of paramount importance, and if programme makers intended
to 'sell violence' and used all the tricks of the trade to make it appear
attractive then we should, indeed, be in trouble. To the extent that modern
programme makers have lost sight of the traditional black hat/white hat
morality and are themselves confused, we are in trouble. That, however,
stems from a confusion in society generally and not from a box of electronic
tricks in the corner of the sitting room. If you doubt the crucial
importance of the intent behind the image, you have to explain why
impressionable young (or old) people don't rush around crucifying one
another, given that the most familiar violent image in the Christian world
for the last few hundred years has been that of a man nailed to a cross.
However sceptical you may be about cause and effect, it is surely a good
idea to control children's access to extremely violent material?
Yes, just as it is a good idea to control children's access to pans of
boiling chip fat and bottles of weedkiller. Professor Newson and her
colleagues may have changed their opinions, yet the existence of a direct
causal connection between screen images and crime is still arguable, whereas
we know for a fact that chip fat and weedkiller are frequent killers. Yet
they are not banned: we continue to allow a free market in chip fat and
weedkiller because people want them, and adults are expected to be
responsible for protecting children. The same principle should apply to
violent screen material, from King Lear to Driller Killer.
Has there been any progress in this debate over the past 20 years?
Yes. Even the most bigoted now seem to have stopped tacking the word 'sex'
onto the word 'violence'.

FT  09 APR 94 / Arts: Voice of an age - Richard McClure assesses the
standing and reputation of the career of Sir John Gielgud as he approaches
his 90th birthday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MCCLURE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tributes to mark Sir John Gielgud's 90th birthday on April 14 were
frustrated last month when a campaign to have London's Apollo Theatre
renamed in his honour was rejected by its owner, Stoll Moss.
It was a rare display of dissent about the actor regarded by his many
admirers as keeper of the theatrical flame; last in that distinguished
lineage which, through his great-aunt Ellen Terry, connects him to Irving,
Kean and beyond even to Shakespeare.
The Stoll Moss controversy is a contrast to the general adulation. Only the
Queen Mother's birthday, according to one recent eulogy, prompts comparable
'gratitude and rejoicing'. Perhaps, but just as the role of the monarchy is
being questioned, Gielgud's artistic legacy surely demands more critical
appraisal.
'Times have changed,' argues Nica Burns, production director at Stoll Moss.
'I was recently negotiating for a light variety production to come to the
Apollo and was somewhat perturbed when its two young producers, one of them
under 30, told me they would take the show elsewhere if the theatre was
renamed.'
Such disrespect is uncommon among the profession's younger generation, even
though most are only familiar with Gielgud through his sometimes unwise
choice of screen appearances. While Olivier received an Oscar for Hamlet,
Gielgud won his for playing Dudley Moore's foul-mouthed valet in the
lamentable Arthur.
Too often, he has squandered his talents on a succession of dons, dukes and
other patrician bit parts, most notoriously as a senator in Penthouse Films'
soft porn Caligula. On television he has fared better. The 'doorknob face'
that Kenneth Tynan described has lately been seen assisting both Inspectors
Morse and Alleyn in the course of their inquiries, though this year
threatens the US mini-series, Scarlett, an unpromising sequel to Gone With
the Wind.
Bills must be paid, insists Gielgud, and, Lear aside, good roles for
nonagenarians are few. Tomorrow night he plays the 'foolish, fond old man'
one last time in a Radio 3 broadcast co-produced by Kenneth Branagh's now
disbanded Renaissance Theatre Company. Radio provides the perfect medium for
Gielgud's famous vocal agility. As Peter Greenaway, who directed him in
Prospero's Books in 1991, observed: 'His qualities are not physical - he has
a magnificent voice and a thinking mind.'
Tim Supple, artistic director of the Young Vic, witnessed Gielgud's
recording of the Ghost in Branagh's 1992 radio production of Hamlet. 'When
he read, a sound came from him that one just doesn't hear,' he recalls.
'It was remarkable and immediately put you in touch with the sensation in
the words, something that is not available when any modern actor speaks
text. It was an awesome feeling. One sensed there was something impenetrably
old about what was being done by him.
'It still had a magic spell but also not quite life.'
Gielgud claims to dislike what Branagh calls his 'miraculous' tones, though
he has confessed that as a youth he could make himself weep simply by
listening to his own voice. His plummy declamation and unfettered tear ducts
offer rich pickings for satirists, who also point to the taste for cravats,
the oft-repeated anecdotes and the peacocks at his Buckinghamshire home as
evidence of actorly affectation. Indeed, an earlier attempt to have the
Queen's Theatre renamed after Gielgud was dropped when a producer pointed
out it would invariably be dubbed the Old Queen's.
But if Gielgud is guilty of the self-obsession customary in actors, it
springs from commitment to his craft. Certainly, he is immersed in acting to
the exclusion of all else.
Beverley Nichols recalled a visit from Gielgud in the 1930s. 'We were
sitting around wondering whether we were all going to be swept up in the
approaching holocaust. 'Why don't you turn on the radio,' said John. 'There
isn't one,' I replied. 'Excellent news,' said John, 'because I shall be able
to listen to myself talking.' And talk, he did, brilliantly, till the small
hours - not about Hitler or Mussolini or any of the ogres haunting us, but
about the theatre, which was all he knew about or thought important in this
distracted world.'
But the mood of post war society and its theatre was out of tune with
Gielgud's often mannered style of acting. While he was collecting a
knighthood in the Coronation honours, Ionesco was dispensing with language -
the tool of Gielgud's trade - as an adequate form of communication. At the
same time, Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop was launching a working-class
assault on the genteel complacency of post-war drama, based on a physicality
which Gielgud, with his self-conscious gait, has never possessed.
'Gielgud is an Edwardian; he must still hear the echoes of Ellen Terry,'
says Littlewood. 'In that horizon which he sees and which is in his
background, I think he is superb - an opinion I don't extend to the rest of
his generation. But because old Olivier, whom I couldn't stand, did that
appalling Osborne play The Entertainer, Gielgud wanted to move into that
dubious world too.
'He asked to work with me and, although I would have loved him to play
Edward II, he didn't want to. He wanted to do something new to match Look
Back in Anger. Later, I was given free tickets to go and see him in a modern
play. I thought, 'Oh my God, he's not dressed. And where's the poetry?' I
couldn't get over it.'
However anxious to move with the times (his performances in Storey and
Pinter were much praised), Gielgud has seldom been comfortable with the
avant-garde, preferring the old school reassurance of Coward or Rattigan. He
dissuaded Alec Guinness and Ralph Richardson from acting in Waiting for
Godot and, in 1958, declined to appear in the British premiere of Endgame
('It nauseates me. I hate it and I won't play it'). He opted instead to take
his tried and tested Shakespeare readings, The Ages of Man, on a tour of
North America, a caution that has persisted into later life.
He remained rooted in the decorous conventions of half a century ago.
'What has happened in the theatre from Beckett onwards has happened without
Gielgud,' says Tim Supple. 'He has not left a legacy of breakthrough as have
directors like Peter Brook and actors like Olivier, who was dangerous and
kept on being so. One looks at Gielgud as a package of things that were
about England and about English acting. And yet when you watch him as
Clarence in Olivier's Richard III you realise he was a master. To be fair,
he delights in the radical things happening around him.'
This deference is shared by Supple's contemporary, Dominic Dromgoole,
artistic director of the Bush Theatre, who believes Gielgud should be
'cherished and revered as a sublime monument to a certain sort of theatre'.
If that sort of theatre is now ebbing away, the affection for Gielgud
endures vicissitudes of fashion. As Edgar says of Lear: 'The oldest hath
borne most; we that are young shall never see so much, nor live so long.'

LISTENING TO PROZAC by Peter D Kramer Fourth Estate Pounds 16, 409 pages
Prozac is a drug which, with few side-effects, transforms depressed or
anxious people, or those with low self-esteem or poor social skills, into
confident, quicker-thinking, more assertive and less inhibited achievers. It
is, in short, a 'psychopharmacological cosmetic', a safe chemical
personality enhancer; and it is raising a storm of debate.
Peter Kramer is a psychiatrist and one of Prozac's earliest prescribers and
most eloquent defenders. In this fascinating and sometimes disturbing book
he explores the dramatic questions it prompts about mind, selfhood and
ethics.
The real significance of Prozac lies not so much in its mind-brightening
effects as its safety. Other psychotherapeutic drugs carry risks. In
promising nearly costless relief from psychological problems - and not mere
relief, but enhancement - Prozac opens new possibilities. Is Prozac the
miracle drug that can make life easier and more successful for all?
The ethical dilemmas thus prompted come attached, as Kramer fascinatingly
shows, to other questions. The efficacy of psychotropic drugs suggests that
the argument between those who think of mind as a wholly physical entity,
and those who think it cannot be explained solely in such terms, is being
handsomely won by the former.
Among many other things, the success of the biological view suggests that
all mental illness reflects brain damage. Kramer argues that such damage,
whether caused by genetic factors or trauma, might be degenerative, so that
a present mild depression might augur major illness later in life; and that
chemical treatment of early signs is important.
Should anyone have Prozac who wants it? In effect Kramer says yes. His
answer is characteristically American. The stereotypical American assumes
that he has a right to a happy, feel-good life. If he has less he feels
short-changed. To be worried, or hesitant in speech, or shy; to feel tired,
or downhearted; to to have few friends, to be single; all this is failure.
Prozac solves the problem. One safe and simple pill a day, and where a wimp
entered the telephone box, superman flies out.
What is wrong with that? Nothing, except that to erase one's anxiety and
sense of struggle is to dull one's contact with reality, to forego the
possibility of emotional growth, to lessen one's ability to cope with major
grief when it comes, to be less sensitive to oneself and others, to reduce
one's autonomy by putting a chemical compound in the place of the
personality forged by experience and endeavour and to make one's creativity
less fully one's own.
To such points Kramer replies that Prozac simply gives people what they
would have had if they had enjoyed a 'more benign childhood' and other early
advantages. But this precisely exposes the flaw in the pro-Prozac case. You
have to make a large value judgment about what life 'should' be like, and
about our model of what a successful, flourishing person is, before you can
claim that Prozac provides it. Is the American feel-good model the highest
ideal of human existence?
If autonomy, endeavour, and full contact with the world and other people do
not much matter, there seems to be no barrier to following Aldous Huxley's
Brave New World suggestion, and adding Prozac to the water supply. Kramer
stops short of suggesting as much; but in coming close, he gives us an
absorbing insight into scientific and psychological questions that we
urgently need to resolve.

THE HIPPOPOTAMUS by Stephen Fry Hutchinson, Pounds 14.99, 259 pages
If it is true that a bad book makes a good film, then Stephen Fry ought to
get on to his old chum Kenneth Branagh immediately. Do not close Renaissance
Films yet - this one is a winner. On the other hand, if a pyrotechnic
display of obscenity is an acceptable substitute for plot; if caricature is
preferred to character; if meretriciousness is valued above intelligence -
then Fry has written a major novel.
As his central character, Ted Wallace, failed poet, pen-for-hire womaniser,
might say: 'So what old love? The scrumptious PR girlies will do a number,
whizz it up the bestseller list and make another packet for yours truly to
squander on all sorts of nasty.'
Part of the problem with this novel is that Stephen Fry the public persona -
a mixture of superbrain and guttersnipe, a phonetic veneer highlighting a
semantic leer - cannot be separated from 'Ted Wallace'. The two are
indistinguishable, even though Wallace is an avowed heterosexual while Fry
has different tastes, in particular, it seems, celibacy. If it were not by
Fry - justifiably popular for his television performances - then this novel
would - equally justifiably  - languish unloved and unread.
Unfortunately, Fry's TV persona does not work when transferred to 'Ted
Wallace', who has a knack for sophisticated swearing but not much else.
Ultimately, absurdly, Fry asks us to accept Wallace as representative of
some kind of transcendent but unfocused insight into humanity's frailties.
But by then Wallace is just a cartoon who spouts clever crudities over the
crudites. When the other characters talk they all are indistinguishable. In
other words, Stephen Fry, on the evidence of this book, is very good at
delineating Stephen Fry but either weak or careless when it comes to
interesting us in his other characters. The game is given away by the use of
Fry's photograph on the outside of the book's jacket, not just on the
flyleaf; what is being sold is not so much a novel as a written vehicle for
the promotion of Stephen Fry.
Of course there are witty lines and some moments of farce which would
translate well onto the big or small screens, where it will no doubt end up
very soon, with Fry playing Wallace to perfection. 'Civilisation, after all,
is not an attitude of mind, it is an attribute of wealth.' But the
smart-alec aphorisms sound like they have been absorbed from elsewhere by
Fry's prodigious memory, dusted off and trotted out in a self-conscious
fashion.
Fry may have been aiming at a contemporary Vile Bodies. But in spite of the
scattered references to a decrepit contemporary London literary scene,
inoffensively expunged of any real personalities or places, the novel lacks
satirical depth. What we have is a relentlessly flourished clever-coarseness
masquerading as humour. In the age of Zit, Viz, Spit and all the rest, this
is a class act. Fry is a very bright man, indeed. If only he could distance
himself sufficiently from his screen image, he might still write a lasting
book.

HOUSE OF SPLENDIDISOLATION by Edna O'Brien Weidenfield &amp; Nicolson Pounds
14.99, 216 pages
Mention Edna O'Brien, and somebody is sure to exclaim: 'I loved the early
books]' Readers were enchanted by those green-eyed country girls and when
their heroines' lives became messy and urban, women looked back on their own
lost innocence. No writer, though, wants to be remembered only for the early
work, and since her starry debut O'Brien has produced a large oeuvre which
includes some superb short stories with sympathetic, sometimes beautiful and
scorned protagonists.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to feel anything kinder than exasperation
with Josie O'Meara, the heroine of House of Splendid Isolation, and O'Brien
has assembled such a cruel and prurient cast around her that it is hard to
know whom to dislike the most.
Josie, once beautiful, now old, ill and alone in her decaying mansion, might
excite more pity if she had not chosen to pay for the Big House in
humiliation and subservience to a brutish husband, or if she had not aborted
their child for unconvincing reasons. She would be easier to like if she had
not fantasised thus about the priest with whom she fell in love: 'To shower
him with things, wordly things, and the fruits of nature. Looking at the
thrushes so sleek and plump she longed to catch them with her bare hands and
grill them and serve them on toast for him, the way they did in Southern
Italy.' Her unconsummated affair with the priest made her a scandalous
woman.
She was inadvertently betrayed by Paud, who thought her 'the Queen of the
Munster Fairies'. Paud was also the unwitting cause of Josie's husband's
death when he persuaded him to hide a cache of weapons for the Fenians.
O'Meara, drunk as usual, was shot in a brawl with Guards. It was Josie who
tipped off the sergeant. Deranged with guilt, she wandered around sucking
the spittle from the stems of wild irises. 'Having to be put away for a
while. A small room in a nursing home named after St Jude Help of the
Hopeless.' Years later, Paud suggests to an IRA terrorist on the run that he
hide out in Josie's house.
McGreevy, known as the beast, breaks in and holds Josie hostage. A
delicately-handled relationship grows between them. That, and the scenes
involving the police pursuing McGreevy, show O'Brien at her best. Too often
elsewhere the prose goes stravaging and maundering down memory lane with its
hair streeling down and its clothes in flitters. Sometimes a remarkable
image is skewered on a sharp pin of observation, but those that linger are
moistly unpleasant.
There is a sickening complicity and voyeurism in the episode where Josie's
husband traps her in a sash window and beats her. Then there is lusty Brid,
the servant girl, who imagines herself with her lover: 'out of doors in the
soft unruly underlay of bog and bogland, everything seeping into her, his
instrument in tooraloora fettle.'
Josie's husband saw her as a horse: 'Her haunches were what he liked best,
wide and yet with a daintiness to them. A good mare.' When Josie is shot,
there is less sense of tragedy than of a wounded animal put out of its
misery after a wasted life. The crescendo and climax of the book are
excellent, but then Paud, who provided its portentous prologue, has to get
in on the act with a sententious epilogue. McGreevy was no more the
legendary hero Cuchulainn with whom he was compared than Josie was the Queen
of the Munster Fairies, although O'Brien succeeds in personifying two sides
of a seemingly insoluble problem; a much harder novel struggles to get out
of the bogland of history and whimsy, and sometimes breaks free.

ASPECTS OF ARISTOCRACY: GRANDEUR AND DECLINE IN MODERN BRITAIN by David
Cannadine Yale University Press Pounds 19.95, 320 pages
The author of this uneven book has published another on the same theme, The
Pleasures of the Past, which he subtitled 'The Decline and Fall of the
British Aristocracy'.
In his new book the aristocracy is still on its way out, but not yet fallen.
The difference is significant. David Cannadine cannot deny that the
aristocracy has shown a remarkable capacity for survival, not so much in
power or esteem as in economic resilience.
A great part of the book is about money, its acquisition, investment and
profligate expenditure by titled families. It is a mopping-up of material
left over from the earlier book. He calls it a 'rather random accumulation'
of essays, and the effect is that of a thick mattress of compacted facts.
It is lively, deeply researched and thoroughly disagreeable. He finds little
to admire in what these families have achieved, except, strangely enough,
the Curzons' gift for staging stupendous shows like the Delhi Durbar.
He thinks the cult of the country house snobbish and nostalgic, as 'if the
owners of these houses were or are persons of greater merit than the rest of
us'. He is not a man to appreciate the audacity, beauty and irreplaceability
of these houses, nor of the works of art that they contain. In fact he is
not a man to find much joy in anything.
The delight that members of the aristocracy took, and still take, in
improving their estates, in their recreations, marriages and friendships are
to him all different forms of self-indulgence.
He faces a problem with the 19th century parvenus, whether to applaud their
breach of the aristocratic circle or to deplore their imitation of it. But
on the whole the class is depicted as contemptible and their survival, it is
strongly implied, is much to be regretted.
Cannadine illustrates his theme by examining the case-histories of a few
families and individuals. One of them is irrelevant, the Cozens-Hardy family
of Norfolk, brewers and solicitors, who gained a peerage, but in no other
sense claimed to be aristocrats. The others are Curzon, Lord Strickland of
Malta, Winston Churchill, the Dukes of Devonshire and my own parents, Harold
Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West.
The purpose of these pen-portraits is to show that on the whole the
aristocrats were a pretty poor lot. Cannadine may preface a chapter with the
caveat that so-and-so was remarkable, but then devotes the next 40 pages to
proving how unremarkable he was.
His chapter on Churchill is a good example. He is bound to acknowledge that
his performance in three years of his life, 1940-43, redeemed the rest of
it, but basically Churchill was selfish, snobbish, disreputable and, more
often than not, drunk.
His progenitors and children (all except Mary) were appalling examples of
aristocratic decadence. His extravagance threw him into the debt of
questionable men like Sir Ernest Cassel and Henry Strakosch. He cared little
for social reform, and his belief in democracy was largely humbug. He saw
himself as a British Mussolini.
Much of this portrait is undoubtedly true of Churchill, just as the Graham
Sutherland portrait of him was partly true. But both leave out the elements
of magnificence, daring, iconoclasm and the common touch which Cannadine
surprisingly concedes to Curzon. The other figures in this gallery escape
less lightly.
Lord Strickland was a failure, 'ridiculous in his self-importance'. The
Devonshires, whose finances are examined in detail, are credited with making
a killing with the development of Barrow-in-Furness, and then ridiculed for
losing it.
The eighth Duke emerges as one of the few men for whom Cannadine feels any
respect, because he restored the family's fortunes to the extent that the
present Duke is probably the richest of his line that there has ever been.
He cannot suppress a certain admiration for the aristocratic millionaire,
much as we might admire the Great Train Robbers.
I cannot be impartial in judging his long chapter about my parents. I think
it monstrously unfair that they should be taken as representative of all
that he finds most despicable in the combination of arrogance and flaccidity
in our aristocracy.
He has picked the wrong couple for this demonstration. He confuses elitism
with snobbishness. Vita and Harold came from the aristocracy, but were not
part of it. They despised and avoided The Tatler set. They inherited little,
but created much that was new, in literature politics, horticulture and
their concept of marriage.
The evidence, which is vast, is used selectively by Cannadine to sustain a
prejudice endemic to his whole approach.

FT  09 APR 94 / Books: A brother born to be wild - Teddy Kennedy's life has
its own gripping dramas

<TEXT>
THE LAST BROTHER. THE RISE &amp; FALL OF TEDDY KENNEDY by Joe McGinniss Little,
Brown and Company Pounds 18.99,626 pages
Next bank holiday weekend (there are several to come) pick up this book, as
I did at Easter, and you will find it immensely hard to discard. There is
more drama in the Kennedy dynasty than in most works of fiction; more
corruption, too. Not much of the information is new, but The Last Brother is
an attempt to put it all together under the wrapping of a slightly
ruminative life of Teddy.
Teddy is the youngest and only surviving son of ambassador Joe Kennedy, the
man who was recalled from the American Embassy in London shortly after the
start of the second world war because of his sympathy for Nazi Germany.
Ambassador Joe is the main villain of the piece. At one stage he had visions
of becoming the US president himself. When he was rumbled by Roosevelt, he
set his sights on the presidency going to one of his sons. Joe John, the
eldest and favourite, was killed in a crazy bombing mission over Europe in
1944.
Jack, the next in line, suffered from a then mysterious and near fatal
disease, but was groomed for the job and made it to the White House in 1960
only to be assassinated in Dallas three years later. The mantle passed to
Bobby, who had been attorney-general under Jack and whose politics had
turned increasingly liberal.
Bobby is the nearest to a hero that the book has to offer, though even he
could be ruthless and manipulative. He was assassinated in Los Angeles while
campaigning for the Democratic nomination in 1968.
That left Teddy, the youngest son who had never been taken seriously by the
family. His mother had hoped that he might go into the priesthood: he was
the first American citizen to receive his first communion from the Pope. Yet
he had no obvious abilities and was found cheating at Harvard. His elder
brothers regarded him as a mixture of a liability and a joke. It was not so
much that his conduct was unbecoming; it was his tendency to get caught in
the act that mattered.
Still, after the death of Bobby, Teddy was the last of the brothers and
already the junior senator for Massachusetts. The pressures for him to run
for the White House at once were strong. When he declined, there was a
widespread assumption that the nomination would be his for the taking in
1972. Then came Chappaquiddick. Joe McGinniss's sometimes speculative
account is not unsympathetic. He thinks that Teddy was never fit to be a
presidential candidate, let alone president, in the first place. The thesis
is that he suffered from being the youngest son, not fully appreciated by
the family elders. Only after Jack's death was Teddy introduced to the
family secrets, by Bobby.
Some of those secrets were - and remain - horrendous. Not only did Joe
Kennedy have links with the Mafia, so had Jack. The abortive Bay of Pigs
invasion of Cuba may have been launched partly to repay debts to the Mafia
bosses.
Never abstemious with women or drink from the start, Teddy reacted by
becoming even wilder and more unpredictable, though there were also times
when he could pull himself together and speak, like Bobby, as the liberal
conscience of America.
As McGinniss comments: 'One of the most remarkable things about Teddy was
that no matter what he had been through the day or night before, he always
showed up for work in the morning.'
Apart from ambassador Joe, the real culprit was the American press which for
years allowed the Kennedys to get away with almost anything. Only
Chappaquiddick, and the inconsistencies in Teddy's stories about the
late-night drowning of Mary Jo Kopechne, woke up editors who should have
known better. No wonder the media subsequently went so hard for Richard
Nixon on Watergate and are looking so closely at President Clinton now.
After the Kennedys, the American press had a lot to live down.

ROTTEN: NO IRISH, NO BLACKS, NO DOGS by John Lydon Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds
14.99, 342 pages
Rock star autobiography, as with the saccharine accounts by movie actors and
politicians of their lives, is not a highly regarded form. With reason: few
of these memoirs betray a desire to discover the truth rather than settle
scores, and even fewer have any literary merit. Bob Geldof's book Is This
It? illustrates that he is a better writer than singer, but it is an
exception.
For years John Lydon, aka Rotten, has been promising, or threatening, to
give his side of the Sex Pistols story. Other versions of the history he
helped create, notably those given in interviews by Malcolm McLaren,
Vivienne Westwood and others, he has derided.
He also refused to co-operate with Jon Savage on England's Dreaming, the one
masterly account of that mad time of dazzling street-level cultural anarchy.
Lydon was a rancid howling boy with decomposing teeth who led the group that
changed British rock music - blowing out the monstrous over-inflated
post-1960s bands - and whose echoing yells of hatred can still be heard
today, particularly in the voice of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain.
Unfortunately this is a long book, and Rotten's mind circles around the same
concerns - who exploited whom, and what Vivienne and Malcolm did to him -
like a rat in a wheel. The boy, once so bitingly sarcastic, has become very
serious in his old age and cannot manage much colour, self-knowledge or wit.
I think, too, that I would rather read Nigel Lawson's memoirs - twice - than
hear another word about that dismal Romeo and Juliet of the Welfare State,
Sid and Nancy.
But at his most eloquent, and in particular when recalling his childhood,
Rotten does have something to say. He tells of a London inhabited by
spiteful Dickensian boys and uncouth girls, of petty thieves, junkies,
dealers, hooligans, wasters, of sex-in-toilets and bottles-in-faces. He
refers to Richard the Third, Clockwork Orange and Brighton Rock as
influences; Pinkie and Alex as role-models.
It is a shame the book is dull and repetitive, for Rotten's experience could
stimulate and provoke anyone uninterested in rock music but concerned about
Britain. For those gobbing and hating droogs of 15 years ago have been
succeeded by a new generation which considers politicians scurvy liars and
culture - including the 'enterprise culture' - a middle-class con. Punks,
then and now, cannot be dismissed. They are our children.
What release do many young people have for any creativity not bashed out of
them? Their saving grace, amply expressed in a lot of rock music, is knowing
that they have been conned, put-down, written-off.
Ineptly educated and badly housed they are offered nothing constructive to
live for, apart from, if they are lucky, some mindless badly-paid job.
No wonder people were horrified by punk in the mid-1970s and are now
terrified by its legacy. Fasten the doors, fix the alarms, build more
prisons: your children are coming for your homes, cars and wallets. What
else can they do to live?
In the end, after all the tedious recrimination and bitterness is mercifully
put aside, what remains of Rotten's magnificent rage is one record, Never
Mind The Bollocks, It's The Sex Pistols.
And what a record it is. If you play it today, like the early Rolling
Stones, or the Who, it has an energy, caustic joy and subversive passion
which is the essence of English rock music. It represents the dark, knowing
and resistant edge of this wretchedly run, sinking-fast country. If
'England's dreaming', as Rotten once memorably howled, it has become a
nightmare.
It's enough to make you spit.

FT  09 APR 94 / Property: A chance to make hay by the Spey - Cadogan's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unusual property totalling about 25,000 acres is for sale beside the
river Spey in Morayshire, Scotland. Most of it comprises the Rothes estate
and its near-20,000 acres, for which the price is Pounds 11.25m. The rest is
the Carron estate, for which Pounds 850,000 is sought. Buy both for Pounds
12.1m (through Bidwells in Perth: tel. 0738-30 666).
For the money, you get an attractive package (if not sold in separate lots)
of forestry, farming and fishing over a vast tract halfway between Aberdeen
and Inverness. It lacks only a laird's mansion, although a six-bedroom
farmhouse is available. But the local council probably would be sympathetic
if the new owner wanted to build a grand house to match his outlay on a
bonny piece of Scotland.
The forests are a mixture of trees of different ages and species, from
mature Scots pines ready for felling to young sitka spruce. All have been
tended carefully and thinned. Whether whole trees for telephone poles or
building timber, offcuts for fencing or thinnings for chipboard, they are
close to major timber plants in Inverness and Stirling. And there are good
roads through the forests.
The vendor is Eagle Star Insurance and Ian Grant, the company's forestry
manager, says: 'When people tell you what a marvellous infrastructure a
forest has, there's only one question to ask. Have they actually used the
roads to extract wood? Can they take the heavy trucks?'
Immediate income from cutting the mature trees awaits the buyer; UK and
Scandinavian prices have risen 17 to 20 per cent lately. It is all free of
income tax. Working forests and farms also receive 100 per cent relief from
inheritance tax and the value of the growing crop - the principal item - is
excluded from any assessment for capital gains tax.
There is plenty of space for re-planting with money from the various
woodland grants and management grants offered by the government. The forests
also offer deer-stalking and some shooting, while rarer species of wild life
include capercaillie and ospreys.
The ospreys like to search for salmon and sea trout along a long stretch of
the river Spey, which is the other major asset in the sale. The season lasts
from February 11 to September 30. After poor years in 1990-92, 1993 was good
for salmon, with 603 caught.
Thus, with fishing on either bank for five rods, Eagle Star is looking for
offers of around Pounds 4 to Pounds 4.5m for the fishing beat if sold
separately. Otherwise, it is part of the Pounds 11.25m asking price for
Rothes.
*****
The Lower Dess estate near Aboyne, Deeside, is an alternative. Its annual
average is 136 salmon, but it does offer a sizeable house as well as a
300-acre let farm and 73 acres of woods. Strutt &amp; Parker in Edinburgh
(031-226 2500) is seeking offers over Pounds 1.35m. This is the first estate
with salmon fishing to be available on Deeside since it was last sold in
1975.

FT  09 APR 94 / Property: Buy now while new homes last - Gerald Cadogan
foresees some major changes in how and where people live
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New homes are as old as residential property. They started thousands of
years ago when men first moved out of caves into shelters they had built.
Since then, humans have never stopped building and moving.
New homes are a reliable indicator - anywhere in the world, at any time - of
an economy's strength. And revived interest in them probably is the clearest
sign that the tide of a recession is turning.
Although business is slow in the higher reaches of the UK market, where many
potential vendors are not yet confident enough of recession's end to offer
their houses, business has been booming at the lower end where you find most
new-home sales - so much so that builders have been able to clear units that
were in the pipeline, and too late to stop, when recession struck.
The House Builders' Federation (HBF) has reported that a steadily-growing
number of people viewed houses in February while 28 per cent of companies
reported price increases (the March figures will be out soon). The HBF says,
too, that more detached houses are selling and fewer flats.
The Corporate Estate Agents are not quite so optimistic. Viewing the market
as a whole, they reported a 4 per cent fall in offers subject to contract in
January and February, compared with 1993. This suggests that builders of new
homes have been taking a larger share of a slightly reduced overall market;
housing starts rose 18 per cent in 1993 over 1992.
Several builders have gone public (such as Beazer Homes and Wainhomes, both
now on a small discount to offer price reflecting the general change in the
stock market) or are going public (such as Redrow). And, with a purr of
pleasure, companies report that more clients are buying off plan before
building has begun. This more or less guarantees a sale.
Builders, however, are starting to complain that development land prices
have risen too sharply, which soon works its way through into higher house
prices. Many blame restrictive government planning policies for producing a
shortage of what they see as good sites (those in greenfield areas being top
of the list).
A fundamental change of government attitude seems to be emerging in that
there appears to be a tilt against the motor car. That would, for instance,
have the immediate effect of making planning permission far harder to
acquire for out-of-town shopping centres. The patterns of American-style
daily life to which Britons have grown used in the past five to 10 years
are, apparently, going into reverse. If true, the effect on new homes would
be dramatic.
Drive around now and you see that most of these are being erected on the
edges of towns and villages on the greenfield sites which the builders find
easy to work. Such developments are in the mainstream of modern new homes,
and not just those in Britain. Fundamentally suburban, such as the UK's
'garden suburbs,' they grew quickly after the first world war through the
spread of commuter trains and cars, coupled with a belief in owning a house
on your own plot.
Sooner or later, though, builders of new homes will have to turn to such
town-centre eyesores as derelict factories and warehouses, and open spaces
sprouting nothing more productive than weeds. These need more initial
clearing and preparation of the ground than greenfield sites, and there
could well be social problems in the middle of a town or city. But, with
imagination, these can be overcome.
In the meantime, buy that traditional, edge-of-town new home while they
remain available. Local newspapers offer plenty of choice, although without
the discounts and extras that enticed buyers two years ago in the worst of
the recession. Pebble dash renderings and rising sun motifs in the garden
gate or the fanlight over the front door - popular themes in the 1930s - are
out; indeed, garden gates have almost disappeared as another US habit
reaches the UK. (This also saves the builder money). Contrasting brickwork
is the fashion just now in new homes, shopping centres and office blocks.
Expect also that a new home will be far more energy-efficient than its
predecessors, and ask what certification it has.
Ideal Homes finds that its three-bedroomed 'Surrey' house, designed for the
growing family, is particularly popular. One feature is the amount of
wardrobe space, including making proper use of the dead area under the
stairs. And two-bedroom houses go well with the 'trade-down' section of the
market, perhaps for such buyers as professional (perhaps divorced) women who
need an extra room for guests or even visiting children.
At the top of the market, Crosby Homes in Cheshire (part of the Berkeley
Group) is selling new houses at up to Pounds 500,000. Several are in a
consciously Victorian style (and, thus, use polychrome brickwork). One
development at Broom Lane in Higher Broughton, Salford (Greater Manchester),
is intended for the local Hasidic Jewish community. Almost opposite the
synagogue, it is ideal for those who must walk to worship. Further
information: Crosby Homes, Altrincham (061-928-9516); House Builders'
Federation and New Homes' Marketing Board (071-580-5588); Ideal Homes,

FT  09 APR 94 / Motoring: Life in the new Laguna - Renault is undercutting
its rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Laguna went on sale in Britain this week at prices and equipment
levels that make it clear Renault is going for its rivals' jugular.
At Pounds 10,570 the entry model RN 1.8 undercuts an equivalent 1.6-litre
Ford Mondeo by almost Pounds 1,200; a Citroen Xantia 1.6i by Pounds 580 and
a Vauxhall Cavalier by Pounds 425.
Price differentials are just as great in the 2-litre class with a Laguna RT
2.0 listed at Pounds 12,275 compared with the cheapest Mondeo 2-litre at
Pounds 13,275, Xantia (Pounds 12,900), Cavalier (Pounds 12,650) and Honda
Accord (Pounds 13,795).
A top trim level RXE 2.0 Auto (Pounds 14,645) is priced Pounds 585 under a
two-pedal Mondeo 2.0 GLX.
Remarkably, the flagship V6 3-litre Laguna Auto with absolutely everything -
air conditioning, cruise control, heated front and rear screens,
power-adjusted front seats, volumetric alarm and trip computer  - costs only
Pounds 18,565, which is almost Pounds 2,500 less than a 2.5-litre V6
Vauxhall Cavalier Diplomat automatic.
As a bonus, Renault says that, model for model, Laguna insurance groupings
are one below those of its market rivals.
Does this mean Renault is selling Laguna at 'loss leader' prices simply to
gain market share? Competitors will be tempted to think so and Renault UK
boasts of having an extremely aggressive pricing strategy. But, of course,
the last thing fleet managers who order cars like Laguna by the hundreds,
even thousands, think about is the retail price. They operate in a world of
mega-discounts. Renault UK will be in there, fighting.
Retail buyers, though, are bound to see a 1.8-litre Laguna RN as a bargain.
Even this 95 horsepower entry model has power steering, rear wash/wipe,
reach-adjustable steering wheel, electric front windows and
remotely-controlled central locking. It is a quietly competent car with a
good ride. Providing it does not have to make too many cold starts and short
journeys, it should average 35 mpg (8.07 l/100 km).
The most economical Laguna will be the 2.2-litre diesel, due to become
available in the near future. This has a similar performance to the
1.8-litre petrol engined model but should average more than 41 mpg (6.89
l/100km). With diesel cars now taking 25 per cent of all sales in Britain,
it will probably be a popular choice among fleet and retail buyers alike.
Every Laguna has the same five-door hatchback body which bears a family
resemblance to the bigger Safrane. It provides more passenger and luggage
room than the Renault 21 which Laguna replaces.
Laguna is by no means a mould-breaker among upper-medium sector cars; just
rather a good one, selling at prices that will give the the competition no
pleasure. Whether the V6, which according to Renault offers outstanding
luxury and sophistication, will persuade BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Rover
user-choosers to make a change remains to be seen.
As value for money it is exceptionally attractive but this is an area of the
market in which a car's perceived status is crucial.
The big Renault 25 which the Safrane replaced was highly successful in
France but failed to attract business motorists in Britain. True, the
company car rules have changed since then.
Now the taxman's take is based simply on price, not a formula combining
price and engine size which, until this week, made cars of more than 2-litre
cylinder capacity financially unviable to many who would have liked to run
one.
At Pounds 18,565 the fully-loaded, air-conditioned, 3-litre automatic Laguna
looks incredibly cheap compared with a two-pedal BMW 325i (Pounds 24,860) or
Mercedes-Benz C-280 Elegance (Pounds 28,462), on both of which
air-conditioning is a costly extra. Even an Pounds 22,950 air-conditioned,
2.3-litre Rover 623GSi automatic is Pounds 4,385 dearer than a Laguna V6.
So, will prestige be paramount? Or will financial objectivity rule? The
traditional providers of lavishly equipped, multi-cylinder cars to business
motorists will be watching the registration statistics closely. The answer
will become clear later this year.

FT  09 APR 94 / Travel: China in just a day - splendid - The idea of
creating user-friendly cultural Disneylands is catching on - even in the far
east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

If you are in a hurry and want to experience the glories of China in a
single day, try going to Splendid China. According to its promoters it is
the world's most extensive miniature panorama of famous sights. It is run by
the splendidly-named Splendid China Development Company, and located in
Shenzhen, the special economic zone across the border from Hong Kong.
Splendid China consists of scaled-down versions of all the great buildings
of China, set in a leisure park of sweeping green lawn. These range from the
Potala Palace in Lhasa to the Great Wall, the Confucius Temple and the
Mausoleum of Genghis Khan.
Near the park, teams of day labourers are working hard on recreating famous
structures from other parts of the world as well. London Bridge is more or
less complete; what looks like one of the waterfronts in Amsterdam is still
under scaffolding.
'It's just right for the people of Hong Kong,' remarked my Chinese guide as
we weaved through jostling crowds of Hong Kong day-trippers. 'After all,
they're so busy making money that most of them can only afford to take a day
or two off work to visit the motherland. What better than this place, right
across the border? They can take in all the wonders of China and get back to
Hong Kong in less than 24 hours.'
The brochure for Splendid China echoes the same sentiments. 'In a word,' it
says, 'you will get a good idea of the ancient civilised country with a
history of 5,000 years and travel over numerous famous rivers and mountains
all over China only in one day.'
The idea of creating user-friendly cultural Disneylands is catching on in
various parts of China. In Beijing there is now a World Park full of famous
buildings in miniature, from the White House to the Kremlin. And in Kunming,
in south-west China, you can visit the newly-constructed Nationalities
Village, which recreates the village dwellings of every significant ethnic
group in that part of the world, from Mongolian to Bai.
Girls dance in wooden courtyards, bells tinkle on gleaming stupas, and
glossy Buddhas gaze out from squeaky-clean temples, far smarter than the
real temples tucked away in the hills. For busy tourists - especially
overseas Chinese tourists - the Nationalities Village, like Splendid China,
is just the thing. Close to the hotels and the airport, it gives quick
access to China's inaccessible history and diversity.
In China this practice of re-creating famous and interesting buildings goes
back a long way. For instance, the summer resort of Chengde, north of
Beijing, which the Kangxi emperor built for his amusement nearly 300 years
ago, is graced with a life-size replica of the Potala Palace, built to
entice Tibetans to Beijing. In Shenzhen, though, the practice seems a
particularly apt one. Shenzhen is, after all, the mecca of Chinese economic
reform, an example of how enterprise and investment can provide China with
the glamour and adventure of the modern world, all at once and in the same
place.
Splendid China is not the only adventure awaiting the traveller to Shenzhen.
The whole place feels like Hong Kong transplanted into the American Wild
West. There is a sense of frenetic activity with no one accountable for the
outcome. Cars, trucks and taxis vie ruthlessly for space. Construction is
under way everywhere, with motorways, container terminals and two airports
at various stages of development.
The centre of the zone is filled with high-rise apartments, shopping malls
and factories dealing in everything from bicycles - one of Shenzhen's best
exports - to fiber optics. Fifteen years ago Shenzhen was a village; now it
has a population of more than 1m, manufacturing and reprocessing goods from
materials supplied not just from Hong Kong but from the whole Pearl River
delta.
The city authorities are proud of Shenzhen's rapid growth. The mayor's
assistant, a confident, persuasive woman in her forties, reminded me over
lunch in a five-star hotel that the economic zone's current GDP growth rate
is around 40 per cent per annum. Still, the strains of this rapid
development are showing.
Stories of triad gangs, smuggling, prostitution, the dumping of hazardous
wastes and other less salubrious aspects of free enterprise abound. Some
take these problems to be no more than teething pains. Other see them as a
more serious indictment of the Shenzhen model. One well-known Chinese
economist, a dogged critic of Shenzhen, warned me before my recent visit
that it combines 'the worst of socialism and the worst of capitalism put
together.'
I glimpsed some of these strains when I parted from my hosts and tried to
travel on to Hong Kong at the end of my day in Shenzhen. My hosts assured me
I could jump on the mid-afternoon ferry to Hong Kong from the Shekou
terminal at the western end of Shenzhen. The ferry, they said, was another
example of Shenzhen's fine communications and openness to the outside world.
But it did not turn out quite that way. After queuing for 40 minutes while
two Chinese customs officers read their way solemnly through every single
passport and permit presented to them, I found myself in the middle of
another jostling crowd, this time of angry Hongkongers trying to get home.
The ferry was in dock but would not sail. It was 'under repair,' I was told
by a lone sailor washing his shirt in the cabin. The only other news -
conveyed by a bored ticket attendant - was that later ferries were 'fully
booked,' and that other border crossings were clogged with day-trippers.
This did not seem to leave many options. At this point, however, as is often
the case in China, I was rescued by a resourceful and helpful local.
She was a Beijing lawyer based in Hong Kong - one of thousands of mainland
Chinese emigres in Hong Kong whose interests and loyalties serve to bind the
colony ever more closely to China. We chatted for a while, then she lowered
her eyelashes, expressed sympathy, and offered to help.
She produced half a carton of king-sized cigarettes from a plastic bag. I
would understand, wouldn't I, that a little gesture to the ticket attendant
would secure me a seat. This was not corruption, just the Chinese way.
Clutching a packet, she wandered nonchalantly into the crowd of angry,
gesticulating passengers, and disappeared from sight.
Shortly afterwards she reappeared empty-handed. 'He is such a kind man,' she
told me, 'and so eager to help you.' Sure enough, the attendant soon showed
up, though his eagerness had worn off. He beckoned us ahead of the crowd to
a boat that had mysteriously appeared from nowhere, and ushered us on board.
Behind us a fight broke out between two groups of young men, both vying for
seats. Shouts and curses filled the air; fists started to fly. 'Hooligans,'
whispered my new friend, pulling me hastily towards the front of the ferry.
'Come with me before it is too late.' I held back. 'What's going on?' I
asked her son, who by this time was caught up in the melee. He smiled
reassuringly, regaining his breath and his patriotic composure. 'Nothing to
be concerned about,' he said. 'Just a little . . . friction.'
As we settled into our seats, the captain rushed out of his cabin and
engaged in a loud altercation with the crew. 'Too many people,' he declared,
and returned to his cabin. Minutes later he re-emerged, again muttering
about the numbers on board. 'I must count up the passengers,' he announced.
'We can't leave until I do.' My friend, pouting a little, said she hoped the
boat didn't capsize.
After a long wait, the ferry set off, reassuringly high in the water. As we
drew away from the jetty my friend's son looked up from his magazine and
pointed to a crowd of people still milling around there. 'See those people?'
he said. 'They've been told there's another boat coming. But there isn't.
They were cheated, but they weren't smart enough to realise.'
I leaned back and prepared for the ride ahead. My friend took a notebook
from her handbag and noted down the name of the ticket attendant. 'Just in
case I need his co-operation again.' There were dozens of names in the
notebook, all of them, presumably, kind and eager contacts in Shenzhen.
'Now,' she said, smiling and closing her handbag. 'Tell me what you think of
China's modernisation, and what will happen to the country when Deng
Xiaoping passes away. And tell me what you think of Shenzhen. Isn't it going
to be the Hong Kong of the future?'
By this time I was weary, so I answered elliptically, the Chinese way. I
told her all about Splendid China.
Shenzhen can be reached from Hong Kong by train, ferry, bus and taxi. Most
convenient are the frequent trains from the Kowloon terminal of the
Kowloon-Canton railway to Lowu on the Hong Kong-China border. Ferries to the
Shekou jetty in Shenzhen leave several times daily from the central ferry
terminal on Hong Kong island. China Southern Airlines flies daily from
Shenzhen to Guangzhou (Canton) and Beijing. Among the more comfortable
hotels in Shenzhen is the Shangri-La, tel: (755)-223-0888, fax: (755)-223 -
9878.

FT  09 APR 94 / Travel: The last (or first) stop in western Europe -
Nicholas Woodsworth boards a train for Trieste, where the northern and the
Mediterranean world once fused
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Who travels to Venice these days? Just about everybody, it seems. We were
gung ho, we were thousands strong, and we were in an Italian train heavily
armed with zoom lenses, phrase books, packsacks, guitar cases, travel bags
and video cameras.
We - British, American, German and a dozen other nationalities - were Gulf
allies. We were about to invade the Gulf of Venice. As I jumped off the
train at Mestre, the rail junction 10 minutes across the water from the
Venice station, I felt like a deserter: relieved.
Who, on the other hand, travels to Trieste these days? Just about no-one.
When the Trieste train pulled in at Mestre I found myself in a carriage with
just one other passenger. There were no video cameras on this train, but
gone, too, was that air of anticipation, that excited sociability that
envelops travellers on their way to much-celebrated, much-visited places.
Instead, there was a solitary man, in a plain white shirt, absorbed in a
technical manual on the transportation of liquid oxygen. I began to wonder
if my yearning for little-celebrated, little-visited places in Italy was
sensible after all.
I needed reassurance. I glanced at my map, following the rail line 100 miles
north and east of Venice. It snaked up and over the head of the Adriatic
Sea, then down a narrow corridor of Italian territory at the top of the
former Yugoslav coast. At the end of the corridor, squeezed against the
water and almost entirely surrounded by the new state of Slovenia, sat
Trieste.
I gazed at different coloured chunks on the map. The geography here was
improbable; it seemed to have little to do with the Italian world. Beyond
Slovenia, just 55 miles from Trieste and the Adriatic coast, lay Austria.
Not far to the north-east was Hungary. To the east, only 15 miles from
Trieste through Slovene territory, began Croatia; beyond it, Bosnia.
For western Europeans, Trieste sits at the end of the line. It lies in such
an unlikely corner of Italy that it had to be odd and interesting.
My problem was in recognising Trieste as Italian at all. Outside the railway
station there were road signs for Zagreb, Lubliana and the ferry to Albania.
Trabants and Zastavas mixed with Fiats and Fords. There were Italian voices
in the street, but Slovene and Croat, Hungarian and Czech ones as well.
More disorientating still, as I walked along the waterfront into the city
centre I found I had developed split vision. To my right lay the ships, the
docks, the languid early evening strollers of what was obviously a
Mediterranean port. But to my left, in domed and colonnaded pomp, sat a
perfectly preserved, 19th century neo-classical city - a miniature Prague,
Vienna or Budapest.
What had happened to the winding street, the grand confusion of
architecture, the anarchy of urban planning that makes up most Italian
cities? Here were broad, rectangular street patterns and large ceremonial
squares, bronze statues on plinths and vast stone buildings of uniform
height and window spacing. The whole thing was saved from heavy-handedness
only by pseudo-Greek marble statuary, fluted columns and fussily ornate
friezes on building facades.
I was confused. Here was imperial magnificence, weighty civic decorum -
order. It was most un-Italian. Mittel-Europa on the Adriatic? Only the
strangest of histories could account for it.
But I did not plumb the mysteries of Trieste's past that night. The city's
behaviour after dark is as un-Italian as its architecture. Where were the
crowds, the noise, the animation? Where were the young people? Wander where
I would, the only people I saw on the streets were grey and elderly. Trieste
was not only middle-European, it was a middle-European gerontocracy. By 9pm
the city had locked up and gone to bed. I went to bed, too.
I finally spotted some under-70s the next morning. They had just emerged
from a private English language school. We chatted. I asked them if they
knew of James Joyce. They did, of course - everyone in Trieste knows James
Joyce. He is a city celebrity. For more than a decade at the beginning of
the century Joyce, when he was not sitting writing in cafes, was teaching
English in Trieste classrooms. I wandered in.
I did not meet any avant-garde geniuses, but I did meet Richard Baudains, an
English writer who supports himself in the same time-honoured fashion. We
went out for a typical Trieste lunch, goulash.
The language business is booming these days in the city, Baudains told me,
but it is not a happy story. The local economy is shrinking, the city
population in decline, work scarce and young people acquiring every job
skill they can get before going to look for employment elsewhere.
Magnificent and neo-classical it may be, but Trieste - distant, isolated and
generally ignored - is little more than a wizened appendage of Italy.
It has not always been so. When Joyce lived there Trieste was at the centre
of things, a busy trading port, banking centre and continental crossroads
giving Mediterranean access to one of the greatest European states of all
time, the Austro-Hungarian empire.
If the city has an un-Italian feel, it is because it has only been Italian
for 75 years; until the end of the first world war and imperial collapse it
had been part of the Habsburg possessions for more than 600 years. After the
second world war it was only returned to Italy by the Allies in 1954. Even
today, Trieste's Italian-ness is disputed: after years of economic neglect
by Rome, a third of its citizens vote for some form of autonomy.
Why shouldn't the Triestini carry on being themselves, eating goulash, if
that is what they want, I ruminated over lunch. Not surprisingly, I found
they do a decent strudel, too. They also linger in cafes for hours and, like
the good folk of Vienna, read newspapers and contemplate political life.
Anyone who has watched Italians drink coffee or talk politics - they manage
to turn both into hurried and desperate acts - will appreciate the
difference, and realise that measured, ordered Trieste could never become
fully Italian. The more I walked around it, the more I saw Trieste as a
footnote to history, a city shorn of its function. It is like a stage set
after the cast of a drama has packed up and moved on.
Is it destined to be forgotten for-ever? Westerners may no longer pass
through the city on their way to holidays in Split, Dubrovnik and Greece.
Others have taken their place, though - the thousands of eastern Europeans
who swarm into the city avid not for luxury goods but basics like pots and
pans. What does Trieste look like to them, I wondered?
I hopped on a bus. Two hours later, in the Croatian port of Rijeka, I had
some idea of the answer. It looks pretty good. From Rijeka, Trieste is not
the end of the line but the start of one.
If Trieste is simply neglected, Rijeka is battered. Relief convoys roll
through town on their way south. On leave, weary soldiers in combat fatigues
sit in cafes. The civilians of Rijeka look poor and tired. Stubble here is
not a designer accessory for the trendy. Everyone has it. Even the women.
But the people of Trieste and Rijeka are not so different: they are victims
of a common, not-so-distant history. Before Croatian independence, before
Yugoslav control, before occupation by Italian fascists between the wars,
Rijeka was an imperial port. What Trieste was to the Austrians, Rijeka, her
sister city, was to the Hungarians - a meeting place with the Mediterranean
world.
Look behind the decay of the Rijeka waterfront and you will find remnants of
the same imperial magnificence found across the border, the same
heavy-handed authoritarian architecture, the same elegant, neo-classical
window-dressing.
In the bus on the way back to Trieste we began nervously rehearsing our
lines for the non-Croat-speaking officials waiting to trap us at the Italian
border.
'I am to shopping in Trieste,' we learned from the one English-speaking
Croat on the bus. 'I am to shopping in Trieste,' we all repeated under our
breaths for the next half-hour. I grew philosophical. The wheels of history
had turned before, and would turn again. Trieste was a place where the
northern and the Mediterranean world once fused. Perhaps it is where east
and west will fuse in the future. We are all parts of the historical
process.
Our missions explained, the border passed, we all got off the bus and went
shopping.
Trieste is only a two-hour train ride from Venice. Information can be
obtained from the Italian Tourist Board, No 1 Princes St, London W1R 8AY.
Tel: 071-408-1254. For the more adventurous, a trip to the Istrian peninsula
in Croatia is not as dangerous as it sounds: north-eastern Italians do it
all the time. Istria offers top-class Mediterranean sea-side facilities at
about half the Italian price.

FT  09 APR 94 / Sport: Round-the-world expedition - Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They began the year in north America and moved
to Europe in March.
You can always tell when the skiing season is drifting to a close: the
Palace Hotel at St Moritz closes until June, the nice Italian head waiter at
the Kulm goes home to run his family restaurant in Como, the weather turns
colder and it starts snowing again.
April, as so often happens, has punished us for casting clouts. After
putting away our heavy duty ski suits we promptly paid the price. We
shivered in St Moritz as we tried to recognise the contours of Diavolezza
and Lagalb, and our toes froze in Klosters as we skied through a blizzard.
As we reach Day 100 of our expedition tomorrow we have skied 1,000 runs in
more than 100 resorts and are now chasing our 1,000th mile of skiing and our
second million vertical feet.
Maybe a break on Lake Como would be fun. We could always water-ski.

Arnold Wilson enjoys the charming German resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Garmisch-Partenkirchen is most confusing. What is the height of the
mountain? It seems to vary. And is it in Germany or Austria? The guide book
says both. And why do skiers go up to the slopes by train, but down to them
by cable-car? And another thing - it seems very silly to call a ski resort
Garmisch and Partenkirchen. Which is it? I wish they would make up their
minds.'
These are not the only touches of Alice in Wunder-Land about Garmisch and
its mountain - the Zugspitze - Germany's most famous. For example: when was
it first climbed? And by whom? The answer is probably 1820. But there again,
it might have been in 1846. Or even 1867. It seems that Josef Naus, a
Tyrolean army lieutenant, accompanied by an orderly and a local guide was
first to the summit. And yet a guide book says: 'The hiking times stated in
Naus's diary, have caused doubts as to whether they ever reached the western
summit.'
The diary makes interesting reading:
'26th August. Overnight in the shepherd's hut . . . Pestered by so many
fleas that I had to spend half the night killing them while on watch by the
fire. Finally escaped outside.
'27th August: 4 am. Left the cursed flea hut. Futile attempt to climb the
Zugspitze. Another attempt, which finally succeeded after some narrow
escapes and extraordinary exertion. At 3.30 we left our abode (the flea hut
again) and at 9 that evening, we arrived in Partenkirchen completely
exhausted.
The cost? 'The guide to the Zugspitze: 2 Florins, 12 Crowns.'
The altitude of the peak Naus is supposed to have climbed is not known, even
to this day. Estimates vary from 9,712ft to 9,728ft 6inches. This
uncertainty was made more confusing in 1986 when the summit temporarily
became a Dreitausender (3,000 metres) during an advertising stunt after a
helicopter suspended an artificial cliff over the top of the mountain.
The summit is divided between Bavaria and the Tyrol, with cable cars
ascending from both sides and a customs post near the top. Skiers must take
another cable car down to the main skiing area, known as the Platt, a
treeless shelf dotted with T-bars and a variety of runs. There is a route
down from the summit for specialists. Recreational skiers are discouraged
from trying it.
Having counted the number of German cars in the gondola station car park at
St Gallenkirch, Austria the other day (about 75 per cent) I am surprised
there are any German skiers left in Germany. The ones who stay at home were
a good deal better mannered than the two oafs who trampled all over my - and
my partner's - skis at Ischgl a day or two later.
The attractive twin - and rival - resorts of Garmisch (2289ft) and
Partenkirchen (2352ft) were united in 1935, a year before the Winter
Olympics there, totally against the wishes of both towns' inhabitants. But
now the two names go together like Donner and Blitzen.
The Zugspitze and Wetterstein range, which overlooks Garmisch, is limestone
formed from fossilised sea animals. I mention this because I have been taken
to task by Ken Peter, from Hunstanton, Norfolk for describing the Dolomites
as granite. They too are limestone - 'a quite young, sea-deposited rock'
says Peter, who learned to ski in the Dolomites 'courtesy of the army, in
1946/47.'
He suggests: 'Perhaps you might find time to record the different types of
rock you ski over.'
All I can tell you, is that on some of the lower slopes they are jagged and
make nasty scratches on my skis.
Arnie Wilson's visit to Garmisch-Partenkirchen was arranged by Moswin Tours,

FT  09 APR 94 / Sport: Will today's Grand National mark a false hurrah for
Britain's bookies? - Horse Racing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only rarely does a winner of the Cheltenham Gold Cup, Britain's premier
jumps race, run in the Grand National at Aintree. But The Fellow (above),
this year's Gold Cup winner, does so today.
Both races are steeplechases, which means they entail fences. But whereas
the Gold Cup is run over 3 1/4 miles at level weights and attracts the best
'chasers in training, the Grand National is a controversial 4 1/2 -mile slog
of a handicap (horses carry different weights, according to talent)
notorious for its equine death toll. Alverton, winner of the 1979 Gold Cup,
was killed shortly afterwards in that year's Grand National.
The Fellow, owned by the Marquesa de Moratalla and trained in France, was
quoted yesterday as 7-1 joint second favourite for today's race with Double
Silk, just behind the soft-ground specialist Master Oats (6-1). The Grand
National fences have been made less dangerous in response to protests, but
fingers will be tightly crossed until The Fellow is safely back in France.
Following last year's Grand National fiasco - protests by animal-welfare
activists, two false starts and the race declared void - security at Aintree
has been heftily increased. More than 200 uniformed police, supported by
undercover teams, will be ready to counter demonstrators' efforts to disrupt
the race. And a new type of starting gate has been installed, to help
minimise the risk of horses and jockeys becoming entangled in the
starting-tape, as happened last year.
Nevertheless, anger among protest groups is unassuaged. Dene
Gordon-Stansall, one of the activists' leaders, said at Aintree on Thursday:
'About 250 horses die each year on the racecourse and thousands break down
and are put down.
'We want to make it clear to people that by betting on the Grand National
they are contributing to horses dying. Behind the spectacle, euphoria and
glamour, what people don't see is broken-down horses, the screens and a
vet's bullet put through a horse's head. They don't see them three days
after the race in the stable unable to walk.'
Unmoved by the cruelty angle, Britain's bookmakers were insouciant yesterday
 -predicting a betting turnover on the Grand National alone of between
Pounds 60m and Pounds 75m. Ladbrokes, which claims to be the world's biggest
bookmaker, estimated that the betting industry would handle Pounds 60m-plus
in National bets from more than 15m - mainly once-a-year - punters.
Its 2,000 betting shops will have 15,000 staff on duty, while a dedicated
freephone service is expected to handle Pounds 1m worth of bets. 'Our
revolutionary telephone service reflects the enormous growth in debit card
betting since its launch on Grand National day three years ago,' said the
firm.
Curiously, today's Grand National could mark a false hurrah for Britain's
bookies. This time next year, Britain's national lottery will be up and
running. Although impossible to quantify at this distance, its impact on UK
betting turnover could be distinctly for the worse.
The bookies should be nervous. The Fellow is probably shivering.

FT  09 APR 94 / Sport: Where have all the young men gone? - US Masters / Why
it would be good for golf if someone aged under 30 won at Augusta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK LAWRENSON

<TEXT>
Is it me or are golfers getting older these days? Here, for instance, were
the players favoured to win the US Masters: Greg Norman, Nick Price,
Bernhard Langer, Ben Crenshaw, Fuzzy Zoeller, and Nick Faldo.
Not one is under the age of 35. Jose-Maria Olazabal was described on
American television last week as having had a 'phenomenal career when you
consider all that he has achieved and he's still only 28.'
Heavens. Jack Nicklaus had won seven majors by the age of 28. Never mind
winning seven. Never mind winning one. Olazabal has only been in contention
to win on a couple of occasions.
Johnny Miller has some interesting things to say on the subject. You
remember Miller. He was the man who, 20 years ago, took scoring to another
level. Before Miller, a 66 or a 67 would get you the lead in a tournament.
If it was an easy course, someone would shoot 65. Miller shot 63. Not once
or twice, but on many occasions. Miller even shot 63 at Oakmont, which is
considered by many to be the toughest course on the US Open rota.
'I just don't understand what's going on,' he said. 'I've always believed,
and it was certainly true in my case, that 27-30 were the best years for a
golfer. That's when I shot the bulk of those scores.
'At 28, you stand over a 10ft putt and you know you're going to make it. At
35, you're still feeling pretty good and most of them go in. At 40, you just
breath a huge sigh of relief when it disappears below ground.' That was
then. Now, the only player in the top 12 in the world rankings who is under
the age of 30 is Davis Love, and even he reaches that landmark age next
week. The only players under the age of 25 in the top 50 are Ernie Els from
South Africa and the American, Phil Mickelson. There is not one British
player in that age group in the top 100.
'I think the Europeans must be wondering if anyone is ever going to come
along to replace the Faldos and the Langers and the Seves,' said Miller.
'They are all around the age of 36 and without being disrespectful to the
young guys, you just can't see a player on the horizon who is going to make
the impact on the game that they have made in the last decade.' Tony Jacklin
was 25 when he won the Open, and a year older when he won the US Open. He
was burnt out at 35. So was Miller, and so was Watson.
Raymond Floyd, 23 when he won the US PGA Championship, remains a contender
almost 30 years on. Floyd said: 'I can't give you a direct answer as to why
the players who are in their 20s are no longer winning majors, but l can
tell you why the top professionals are having longer careers these days.
'The overriding factor is the way technology has improved both the golf club
and the golf ball. I'm obviously nowhere near as strong or as agile as I was
when I was 25, but I hit the ball, if anything, further than I did then
because the equipment is now so much better.'
There are other explanations. Diet, for one thing. The pros have joined the
health beat. They eat bananas instead of burgers. They drink Gatorade rather
than Glenfiddich. Said Miller: 'There was certainly a lot more nightlife
when I was on tour. The players are much more family-orientated now, and the
growth of the prize funds has helped in that respect. The players are
earning so much that they can afford to have their wives and children travel
to every tournament.'
Money is also a consideration in another respect. The remarkable growth of
the senior's tour in America has meant that the players have every incentive
to prolong their careers beyond middle age.
All of which explains why many players are now finding that some of their
best years occur when they reach their late 30s. But why are all of the top
nine players in the world aged between 34 and 39?
Why are there currently only two players under the age of 30 who have won
major championships? Why are there only four, indeed, whose ages fall
outside that seemingly magical 34-39 bracket?
Miller says: 'Maybe we're just going through one of those dormant periods
when there are no good young players around or certainly not ones you can
compare to previous generations. But it will turn around again. You will get
one player in his late twenties 20s who will win a couple of majors and then
he will inspire his peers.
'That's what happened with the Europeans. First, Ballesteros won the
Masters, and Langer said to himself: 'Well, if he can do it, so can I' And
then when he won, Faldo started to believe that he could claim a green
jacket. And so on. It will happen again.'
It would be good for golf if it happened at Augusta this weekend.

FT  09 APR 94 / Sport: Lay a little egg for me - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The average wait for a chicken toastie was 1 1/2 hours in the hotels of
Barbados this week. It did not matter what level of establishment either -
the super-luxury Sandy Lane or the down market Sunset Crest beach club.
Every hotel was overbooked and understaffed and dealing with an overwhelming
demand for chicken sandwiches.
Which was only to be expected. The England cricket team are in town for a
Test match and so are about 7,000 of their 'supporters'. Well, they claim to
be supporters, but not many admitted to ever attending a Test in England.
They have descended since the beginning of the month on scheduled flights
and charters, are jamming the corridors and lobbys of the island's 86
registered hotels, and will take up half the ground for the whole Test
match. Locals cannot get tickets.
'I've never known anything like it,' says former England bowler Fred Rumsey,
who has been bringing club teams and supporters tours to Barbados for 20
years. 'You can't get a bed or a ground pass for love nor money', he said,
sweating profusely from the rigours of organising his party of 420.
It is all slightly ironic. England have already lost the series, and are
facing their third recent 5-0 whitewash in the Caribbean. England cannot
play the game, but it can supply a crowd to watch. So who are these people,
and what are they doing in the West Indies?
Going on activity holidays has been a growing trend. Water sports or golf
trips are booming business, so are packages to international cricket
matches, although whether these qualify as active is debatable. The key
attraction is that tickets for Tests are guaranteed - the result of the
match is irrelevant. The main thing is to be there. A range of retired
cricketers, from wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans to bowler Paul Allot, are
brought in to tell cricket tales, or explain David Gower's ommission.
Whereas once the Caribbean was only accessible to the rich and famous, now
anyone can go. There are holidays to suit all pockets; from the Pounds 989
Mr Watts from Wolverhampton pays for his self-catering bedsit and terrace
ticket, up to Pounds 5,000 for a suite at Glitter Bay and a cushioned seat
behind Curtly Ambrose's arm.
There are retired gas fitters and insurance salesmen, lift engineers and
sales reps all lured here by the affordable price, the safe reputation and
Sky TV's animated coverage of the series in the pubs and clubs of middle
England.
On match days, supporters are herded like sheep to the ground and then put
out to graze for the rest of the time. They dress the same, in loud
polyester leisure wear and sneakers or tour-issue T-shirts and white socks
hitched up to mid-calf. They pontificate incessantly. Their presence
accompanying cricket tours around the world has sprouted a generic term -
Wincs - Wallies Incorporated.
You must avoid rum-swilling Wincs at all costs. This is jolly hard for the
players, because they often share the same hotel, and, having endured the
searing pace and heat of the West Indies on the field, are then subjected to
a barrage of opinions in the bar afterwards. Most escape to their rooms
eventually, but it is no understatement to say that playing for England
abroad is more of an ordeal than an honour.
And yet there are parallels between the players and their followers. Both
tend to seek out the creature comforts and will only tip-toe into unfamiliar
territory. This cautious attitude arouses both affection and irritation and
is consistent with an Englishman's general readiness to be second rate. We -
the English - seem to have forgotten how to assert ourselves, even
belittling our own proven heroes.
By contrast the Caribbean people are still crowing about the feats of
Garfield Sobers, even after all these years. Therein lies the absurdity. To
commemorate the 40th year of the West Indies uncovering 'the greatest
cricketer that ever lived' there have been race meetings, banquets, golf
tournaments and a gathering of 70 celebrated adversaries for a parade at the
Bridgetown Oval. Yet thousands of Sobers' loyal subjects cannot get in to
see it.
The West Indies Cricket Board are delighted, of course. As the most
impecunious of all cricketing nations, they regard 10 cents on the price of
a Banks beer as a profit. Now, having managed to pre-sell thousands of
expensive five-day packages to the tour companies for a match that is not
expected to last that long, they need to make space for a few extra noughts
above the line.
It is hard to avoid the suspicion that West Indies cricket is sacrificing
its soul in a bid to make money.
They are only following the lead of every other major sporting body, but
Caribbean cricket grounds will be lesser places without the conch-shell
blowers, the musicians, the roti vendors or the boys perching in trees to
try and see their heroes.
Unfortunately, such is the superior fitness, skill and pride within the West
Indies team, that they are likely to overcome England's rather feeble
efforts, in spite of being surrounded by a throng of plump, peeling
Englishmen.
The message is that the meek may inherit the earth, but chickens do not last
long in Barbados.

FT  09 APR 94 / Food and Drink: More bargains from Australia - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Majestic Wine warehouses have some significant reductions on Australian
wines this month - notably Cape Mentelle Cabernet Merlot 1991 for just
Pounds 6.99, the red wine expression of the man behind Cloudy Bay, from
fruit long-ripened on the south western tip of Australia.
Bibendum wine merchants meanwhile (071-722-5577) has a keenly priced range
from Victoria under the Red Cliffs label. Best buy is the Coonawarra
Cabernet 1991 at Pounds 4.99, although probably even better value for the
sheer quality, subtlety and potential is their Cabernet-based Yeringberg
1990 at Pounds 13.75 a bottle. This historic Yarra Valley winery has never
performed better.
*****
It might be snowing this month in England but why not at least toast the
prospect of warmer days? A good value choice is Bright Brothers Sauvignon
Blanc 1993 made from fully ripe grapes grown on an estate in Portugal's
Ribatejo by Australian Peter Bright. It will be in 170 Sainsbury's stores by
April 11 and, at Pounds 3.39, is a steal.
*****
Scottish Food Proms takes place in Glasgow from April 18-25. It begins with
a gala dinner for 250 but then widens its scope to take in chef talks,
demonstrations and the launch of the Scottish Food Education Project in
which over 40 Scottish schools will be taking part.
Among the Scottish chefs taking place will be David Wilson from the Peat
Inn, Nick Nairn from the Braeval Old Mill and John Webber from Kinnaird
House. For details contact: The Ideas Bank, Glasgow, tel: 041-636 6332; fax:

FT  09 APR 94 / Wine: A tiny reef of grape in a sea of Australian sheep -
Jancis Robinson goes to Coonawarra to see an odd piece of marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a marvellously unlikely scene for such a remote corner of South
Australia. On a specially constructed platform above a sea of vines, two
dozen Australian men, muted by the double indignity of wearing both ties and
make-up, sat at tables with fancy white tablecloths flapping in the breeze
of a Coonawarra sunset.
Some had flown thousands of miles across the outback for the sixth Wynnsday,
an annual triumph of wine marketing. On a Wednesday each March - the
Australian pronunciation of Wednesday being, almost exactly, Wynnsday - the
new vintage of Wynns Coonawarra Estate wines is launched throughout
Australia with simultaneous tastings in each of the six major cities, linked
and broadcast by satellite.
Television cameras between the vines transmitted the views of assorted
pundits on Wynns' 1991 range to the nation - or, at least, to the 4,000
enthusiasts and retailers who had assembled for similar tastings in hotel
ballrooms around the country. 'G'day, Brisbane. What's your question for our
winemaker, Peter Douglas?' was a typical link.
Wynns, as its slogan continues to remind the avid Australian wine-drinking
public, is 'The estate that made the Coonawarra world-famous.' It is not the
oldest, but it was the Wynn family which saved the region from reverting to
sheep farming by showing its extraordinary affinity for Cabernet Sauvignon
grapes in the 1950s and 1960s when the Australian market was still dominated
by things sweet and sticky.
Today, the Wynns themselves make Mountadam, Eden Ridge and David Wynn wines
250 miles north in the Eden Valley, while Wynns Coonawarra Estate is part of
the Southcorp group (which includes packaging and making water heaters among
its other enterprises).
Southcorp Wines Pty, re-named recently, controls about a third of all
Australian wine production including such names as Penfolds, Lindemans,
Seppelt, Tollana, Wynns, Seaview, Leo Buring, Killawarra, Rouge Homme and a
host of other familiar names.
In Coonawarra alone - an extraordinary island of well-drained, fertile terra
rossa which is the remains of an ancient coral reef, less than 10 miles long
and hardly a mile across - Southcorp controls not just Wynns (which is in
the happy position of itself owning a third of the region's vineyards) but,
through its other subsidiaries, also has by far the dominant share of the
country's most prized, virtually unextendable, wine region Coonawarra.
Just down the road (and there really is only one road) from Wynns are the
Lindemans and Rouge Homme wines, made at a quite distinct winery, and
Penfolds' 600 acres of Coonawarra vines (as well as a distribution agreement
with the extensive Katnook estate). The remarkable feature of Southcorp wine
policy is that all these subsidiaries and close neighbours are run in fierce
competition with each other. Differences in vine growing and wine-making
techniques are encouraged.
All Southcorp vineyards in this under-populated area are heavily mechanised,
however (like those of all but a handful of growers such as Petaluma), and
are characterised by widely-spaced rows of rampant vines. This smooths out
annual variations in yields, but satisfies the company's accountants more
than wine critics.
The fertile terra rossa sells for up to ADollars 1,500 (Pounds 721) an acre
(twice as much as land one mile east or west). Houses, therefore continue to
be razed and Lindemans, for example, solves the problem of a small and
disappearing work force by 'minimal' pruning. This leaves the fruit to find
its own way out to the light from a tangle of canes on about a third of each
of its top vineyards at Pyrus, Limestone Ridge and St George.
Each of these vineyards is described, dolefully, as a 'finite resource'  - a
relatively new viticultural concept in Australia. But Southcorp is
continuing a commitment to producing a wide and competing range of
top-quality wines - an unusual trait in a company of this size.
Since the 1960s, Penfolds has been proud of its in-house legend in the form
of Penfolds Grange, a deep, rich red described famously by Hugh Johnson in
his wine atlas as 'Australia's one first growth.'
Since then, wine-makers throughout the group (the ownership and constitution
of which have been in constant evolution) have been worked hard to produce
rivals for Grange, such as the Lindemans' single vineyard wines. Wynns'
nominee was launched with the 1982 vintage as John Riddoch Cabernet
Sauvignon, an intense and rapturously received essence of Coonawarra from
Wynns' oldest vineyards.
It was joined last year by Michael Hermitage 1990 (although, under the terms
of the recent bilateral trade agreement with Europe, it will eventually have
to be renamed Michael Shiraz to bring in the name of the grape variety).
This incredible hulk is already selling at ADollars 80 a bottle. And the
phones were buzzing last Wynnsday with customers begging to increase their
allocations of the Michael Hermitage 1991, released that day at around
ADollars 38 a bottle. Tiny quantities (which should be aged for a good 10
years) should reach Oddbins in the UK by the beginning of June and will sell
for about Pounds 15.
But Wynns' real bargain, and a wine probably better suited to the more
modest dimensions of the average European palate, is the black label Wynns
Coonawarra Estate Cabernet Sauvignon. The handsome 1988 and ripe 1990 are
Pounds 7.99 at Oddbins and Victoria Wine and will be followed by the 1991, a
truly fine, beautifully-balanced wine designed less to impress than express
Coonawarra.
Douglas has wrought miracles since arriving in 1985. Southcorp's
divide-and-rule policy, however, means that he and fellow wine-maker Sue
Hodder must battle to see some of the wine produced at Wynns Coonawarra
Estate selected as an ingredient in, say, Penfolds Grange. Penfolds Bin 707
Cabernet Sauvignon depends particularly heavily on Wynns input.
Only about 40 per cent of the grapes crushed this year at the distinctive,
three-gabled winery illustrated on each label of Wynns Coonawarra Estate
will be bottled under that name. It also vinifies the produce of Southcorp's
substantial, and expanding, vineyard holdings in the rest of this usefully
cool, south-east corner of South Australia - Padthaway, in particular.
On Wynnsday, the winery was processing early-picked Pinot Noir grapes en
route to the Southcorp sparkling wine plant at Great Western over the border
in Victoria.
Truckloads of grapes had also been shipped down from the heavily-irrigated
Riverland, 200 miles north, when rot threatened to damage the crop if it
waited until the local Southcorp winery was ready for it.
This is how big can be beautiful in the wine business.

FT  09 APR 94 / Food and Drink: Pauillac rivals join hands at an English
chateau - Lafite and Mouton-Rothschild have combined to show their full
range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The two adjoining, sometime rival, first-growth Pauillacs - Lafite and
Mouton-Rothschild - have combined to bring examples of all their companies'
wines to the UK. Not through the usual trade channels, but in a shop in the
refurbished Waddesdon Manor near Aylesbury (described in the Weekend FT of
March 26). This is the only place in the world where all can be bought: from
Lafite's Chilean Los Vascos '92 (Pounds 6.20) to its grand vin '82 (Pounds
135), and Mouton's Mouton-Cadet '90 (Pounds 6.50) to the California Opus One
'88 (Pounds 42.70).
Waddesdon, the late 19th century 'French Chateau in England' built for Baron
Ferdinand de Rothscild, was left by his great-nephew James in 1957 to the
National Trust. But the main responsibility for its running has remained
with the Rothschild family. Lord (Jacob) Rothschild has now filled the
original cellars with his personal reserve: 11,000 bottles from Lafite,
supplemented with 3,000 from Mouton. This starts with a magnum of Lafite
1870, followed by 35 vintages, fine, indifferent and poor, up to 1970. The
Moutons begin with a present from Baroness Philipine of half a dozen bottles
from 1867 (the vintage before Lafite passed into Rothschild hands) to 1896.
For the visitor this is museum stuff, an appendage to the tour of the house,
and the wines are binned behind three locked gates though the rest of the
handsome cellars, decorated with photographs of the chateau and the Mouton
labels, are open to inspection.
However, in a newly-created shop on the garden level, wines from more than
30 appellations or brands are for sale. In the last 30 years both estates
have greatly widened their interests. In Bordeaux, Lafite has added
Duchart-Milon, Rieussel and L'Evangile, and then spread to Los Vascos in
Chile and the distinguished Quinta do Carmo in Portugal.
Mouton acquired adjoining Clerc-Milon and then joined Mondavi in California
for Opus One, but most of its expansion has been to increase its Bordeaux
brands, including Medoc, St Emilion and Graves Baron Philippe. All dozen are
on sale at Waddesdon, where Lafite also has a Waddesdon Manor Pauillac '90
(Pounds 10.15)
Clearly no attempt has been considered to by-pass their traditional trade
channels, so Waddesdon is not a place to go for bargains. The sommelier,
Henry Beaumont, describes prices as 'fair', and nowhere else in the UK could
such a selection be found, including all the grands vins of Lafite and
Mouton from 1981 (around Pounds 75) to 1990 (Pounds 80 to Pounds 85)
respectively for these vintages: dearer than at auction per dozen, but not
there for single bottles.
Testings by outside bodies will be encouraged, and the Wine Society of
Stevenage, Herts, will hold the first for its members on May 12. Also the
shop is organising them on two levels. On the second Saturday morning of
each month (the next on May 14) a varied, tutored tasting will be set up at
Pounds 20 a head, and then on Wednesdays June 1, July 29, September 7 and 28
and October 12 de luxe tutored tastings will be held, including lunch and a
tour of the house, at Pounds 45 a head.

FT  09 APR 94 / Cookery: How to demolish the Easter egg mountain - Although
the holiday is over, Philippa Davenport has kept back a cracking treat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   I am still under the influence of Easter eggs
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
not chocolate ones but fresh. In days when Lenten fasting was a serious
business with no eggs consumed (openly, at least) for a full 40 days, cooks
had their work cut out to cope with the accumulated stocks.
The Easter Sunday binge was not enough in itself to demolish the egg
mountain. The giving of eggs to those who did not keep their own poultry
helped of course. Even so most cooks were kept busy cracking into the nest
egg throughout the whole of Easter week and the week after.
One seasonal recipe that appeals to me is a Genoese pie filled with eggs,
herbs, soft cheese and chard. Some modern versions replace the chard with
globe artichokes but the traditional combination is exquisite.
If speed is of the essence a lovely, if more obvious, solution is a souffle.
One of the best is made with spinach, best of all when served with a jug of
anchovy sauce. This makes a rich and ritzy first course or a four-star
supper dish. It also makes a splendid vegetable accompaniment for plainly
cooked fish or gammon.
For those sad souls who do not appreciate anchovies, stay your hand with the
sauce and garnish the souffle instead with flat mushrooms fried, sprinkled
with toasted pinenuts and a little chopped dill.
Mushrooms, incidentally, tend to be outsize and cut-price after a bank
holiday when they have been left to grow on unpicked. Another surplus.
Mushrooms do not stop growing, of course, any more than hens stop laying,
just because of the rules of church or state.
GENOESE EASTER PIE (serves 6)
4lb chard; 6 eggs;  1/2 lb curd cheese;  1/2 lb cream cheese; 2 1/2 oz
freshly grated Parmesan cheese; 2oz butter; 1-2 garlic cloves; 2-3
tablespoons fresh chopped marjoram; 1 packet filo pastry; olive oil,
preferably Ligurian.
Separate the ribs of chard from the green leaves, stripping off membrane and
any stringy bits. Chop the ribs and shred the greenery. Boil the ribs for
five minutes, add the greenery and cook until tender. Drain and squeeze dry.
Slice the garlic and fry it in 2 tablespoons of oil to flavour the oil.
Discard the frazzled garlic and saute the chard for three to four minutes.
Season well with salt, pepper and some of the Parmesan, and cool.
Oil the interior of a 10-inch paella pan, cake tin with springclip sides or
similar metal container. Line it with a sheet of filo painted with oil,
letting the surplus hang over the rim. Add a further nine sheets of oiled
filo, angling each slightly differently.
Put the cooled chard into the tin. Cover it with the marjoram and curd and
cream cheeses beaten together. Make six hollows in the mixture. Slip nuggets
of butter into them, then whole raw eggs. Season with pepper and sprinkle
with the remaining Parmesan.
Cover with another 10 layers of filo, oiled and angled as before. Cut off
the tips of the pastry points that overhang the tin. Then roll the remaining
overhang up and inwards towards the centre of the pie making a rope-like
twisted ridge all round the rim. Lay the trimmings across the centre and
brush all the top of the pie with more olive oil.
Slide the pie on to a pre-heated baking sheet and bake at 375`F (190`C) gas
mark 5 for 45-50 minutes, turning up the heat at the end if necessary for a
rich golden finish. Cool to tepid before serving.
SPINACH SOUFFLE WITH ANCHOVY SAUCE (serves 3-4)
12oz spinach; a small garlic clove, sliced; 1oz butter;  1/2 oz flour; 1/2
oz freshly grated Parmesan cheese; 7 fl oz milk; 3 large eggs (preferably
size 1).
For the sauce: 1 x 50g tin of anchovy fillets; a knob of butter; scant 1/4
pt double cream.
Steam the spinach until tender. Squeeze it dry and chop it finely. Scald the
milk with the garlic to flavour it lightly then strain the milk and discard
the garlic.
Make a white sauce with the butter, flour and hot milk. Draw the pan away
from the flame and beat in the cheese, the spinach, and finally the egg
yolks, one at a time. Season generously.
Whisk the egg whites to firm shiny peaks. Stir a couple of spoonfuls into
the spinach mixture then fold the spinach mixture into the rest of the egg
whites.
Turn the airy amalgam into a souffle dish that has been buttered and dusted
with a little extra grated Parmesan cheese and bake at 375`F-400`F
(190`C-200`C) gas mark 5-6 for 20-25 minutes.
For the sauce, put the anchovies into a small pan with a hazelnut sized
nugget of butter. Warm gently crushing the anchovies with a spoon to speed
their disintegration. Add the cream, bring to the boil and simmer briefly
until slightly reduced and thickened.

FT  09 APR 94 / Gardening: So how does a beginner learn to begin? - Tamara
Hedge-Bonus starts by ignoring the advice of the new radio experts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE-FOX

<TEXT>
The narcissi have never looked better; we can be busy this weekend with
everything which the gales stopped us doing over Easter. Spare a thought,
however, for the new recruits to the real business of life, those for whom
1994 may be the start of a lifetime of gardening until arthritis stops them
in the 2030s. In fact, 2030 is way beyond the time scale of the new
horticultural intake who have been kind enough to share their progress with
me. They sold it short six months ago - one reason why gardening is now
within their reach.
With the passing of April 5, a green glimmer on the horizon has fallen on
the plate glass headquarters of the City stronghold of Goldmine Fax. Like
players on the old Monopoly board, the teams on the 13th and 14th floors
have just passed 'Go' and collected the fruits of their year's derivative
efforts.
Only one colleague has collected more than Tamara Hedge-Bonus. Aged 32, she
has hedged and re-hedged round the clock. She battered the franc in August;
she put Italian bonds back to back with Norman Lamont's least wanted bits of
farewell paper. By the terms of her clients' Special Reserve, she is now
entitled to a personal incentive payment of Pounds 600,000 to meet the
rigours of the new tax year. A man on the 14th floor is entitled to Pounds
820,000 and, in February, it did look as if Tamara was going to beat him.
But the US Treasury caught her off-balance on the very Friday evening when
she had left early to spend quality time with Chris.
Chris and she are not married because Tamara always fights shy of open-ended
contracts. On the company paperwork, he is ranked as her spouse alternative
and there are times, to be honest, when Tamara wonders if other alternatives
might be better value. Cool, pure nerve is the hallmark of the Hedge-Bonus
style in action, inferring fair value from conventional things like maths.
Chris, by contrast, works for World Wildlife and moves at an altogether more
suggestible pace. To her annoyance (and sub-conscious pleasure), she can
boss him mercilessly; her friends know, as she half-knows, that he
represents her conscience.
One more year, Tamara tells herself, and then she will be out of it. Banking
a second bonus will see her through life, with some gentle dealing from
home. Being out of it means being partly in the country, where Tamara and
her generation have talked often of applying their new finances to attaining
the standards of a past age.
Tamara has secured her property already: a dower house with a wing for
future small Hedge-Bonuses and stabling which could accommodate a 'phone,
fax and serious PC. The ground slopes bumpily to a superlative view from a
Cotswolds escarpment, and down further to a chain of neglected lakes
(Chris's present paradise but one, she tells herself privately, which will
still stack up even if he does not).
Tamara is a gardener with a vision. In her past, she looks back to idyllic
years by Surrey's Bluebell Railway before her parents quarrelled, split up,
and she developed that ruthless calculation which has paid off so handsomely
in her present career. In those early days, there were buttercups; the woods
were alive with white anemones; and roses tumbled in clouds from old stone
walls. Tamara learnt so much from her mother before her mother became
embittered: she grew up knowing that red salvia was only for vulgar Italians
and that high-class gardens had atmosphere and form.
How, though, does a beginner know how to begin? High-flying friends on the
14th floor have been telling Tamara for years that she will end up restoring
furniture and listening to Gardeners' Question Time. When the BBC's entire
team decamped to the opposition, Tamara found herself sympathising with a
tactic much discussed in her department. She found herself feeling even more
sympathetic when the new team was presented as the BBC's bid for a younger
audience. Feeling biddable, Tamara set the recorder on last week's midday
episode and used the Easter markets' closure to discover what beginners
should do when they begin.
Hedge-Bonuses are not unadaptable, and she quite understood that the BBC had
chosen to broadcast its programme from a building site in Manchester owned
by a northern housing association. Gardening, her father had always told
her, is gardening wherever you do it, and the same advice applies whoever
you are.
It did cross her mind that this particular community centre was rather too
close for comfort to the Enterprise Zone where the 1990 bonus had been
invested rashly in an over-valued white elephant of an office project.
Nonetheless, she and the Manchester young would have to start somewhere.
She had not expected them to start with quite so many condescending
references to their listeners' enthusiasm, or so many nervous giggles to
show that the questions were appealing to the young. The new panel almost
persuaded her that all you have to do when a sub-contractor leaves you with
rubble in the garden is to ask him to bring in top-soil and break up
whatever is underneath.
She then remembered her formative years as a construction sector analyst and
wondered if Ann on the BBC panel understood why every builder prefers to
take a short cut. She wondered even more when the panel told a young
enthusiast to plant Jerusalem artichokes as a boundary round their allotment
and use quinces as a screen to filter out cats.
Hedge-Bonuses know about hedges: why land these beginners with artichokes
which run everywhere and look absolutely miserable in winter on her uncle's
farm? Why suggest quinces which would not even keep out her mother in
shorts, let alone a cat on the run from the nearby motorway?
The panel had much to say about assembling old drink cartons and cutting out
their bottoms to make cheap seed boxes: Tamara remembered the young man at
Goldmines who grew lillies in the office champagne crates back in the bubbly
summer of 1987. When the panel moved on to trees, she wondered whether it
ever had managed them? How could it recommend birches for 'youngsters to
climb in?' When the young saplings would snap at the touch?
When Ann proposed elder bushes so that the community could make elder
champagne, Tamara wondered if she had ever seen the scores of unwanted
elders which had seeded themselves so annoyingly on the embankment and in
the back gardens along Tamara's morning journey to work on the London Tube.
The more they talked, the more she saw through it. Why did these
enthusiastic northern house-persons have to be told to grow a patch of
brambles, break up their drink cartons, plant elder bushes and berberis and
experiment with a turf roof? Tamara remembered Chris's photographs from
Greenland on his last expedition to Save the Seal. He had photographed the
turf igloos of Eskimo Greenland, maintained as mementos of a past. Were they
really wanted in the Manchester area?
Why did nobody mention roses and lilacs, daffodils, orange blossom and
everything else which gardeners want to know how to grow elsewhere? Why
would the younger generation be attracted by ideas which ignored beauty,
quality and form: an aromatherapy garden, pitcher plants to catch the
occasional wasp, and herb beds with quotations from outdated Herbals,
inscribed on plaques?
When it came to wild life, Tamara lost her remaining faith. The entire panel
seemed to want to patronise the under-40s and make them attract wildlife,
whereas sensible gardeners want to keep it out. The members even expanded on
the belief that 'native trees attract native wild life.' Had they never seen
butterflies on Chinese buddleias, or bullfinches playing merry hell on
Japanese cherries? What are these 'natives,' anyway: is the BBC so
horticulturally incorrect?
At every turn, the willing Hedge-Bonus sensed condescension and mock
'enthusiasm' which was being fobbed off with gimmicky ideas that nobody had
tried in life. The one thing she knows is what her father told her:
beginners are beginners, on Manchester rubbish or among Cotswold ivy, and
neither wants elder bushes or rabbits burrowing into a turf roof.
This weekend, Tamara and her consort will not be listening to programmes
which try to patronise questioners. It will take time, but she has decided
to go for a track record, stick with it, and ignore the new siren voices
mounted on a bandwagon for the sake of the change of image. Admittedly,
Chris rather liked the idea of turfing the roof of the dower house
outbuildings - until she pointed out that he would have to mow it, and that
the last thing they wanted was worms above gutter level.
In search of a mentor, she has turned instead to the senior head of her
department and received the right advice for any new beginner: go out and
buy proven titles by the late Arthur Hellyer, former FT gardening writer,
and count yourself lucky that you can rely on a lifetime which made the
mistakes before you. This week, Chris has found The Amateur Gardener in a
Cheltenham bookshop and he and Tamara will be starting from the beginning
with their radios firmly switched off.

FT  09 APR 94 / As They Say in Europe: Fighting them on the beaches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not often that a tiny political crisis can trigger savage reflections
on one's place in the world, the structure of the state, and the reality of
the recent history of the nation. The affair of the Anglo-Canadian veterans
and the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landings did just that in France.
Not everyone will be familiar with the row which erupted when a couple of
hundred old soldiers were told that their rooms, which had been booked for
two years and financed from their own pockets, were being requisitioned by
the French state. Hotels along the famous beaches were going to be used for
visiting VIPs rather than the men who liberated them in the first place.
There was outrage among the veterans when they learnt that their cherished
plans were to be overturned and they were to be lodged instead with local
families - even, some reports said, on the floor of the local town hall.
The Quai d'Orsay, the foreign ministry, moved rapidly to rectify matters.
The veterans were allowed to keep their rooms and the British tabloids
hailed this as a victory almost as significant as the D-Day landings
themselves. In this, they may not have been entirely wrong, although not in
the way they thought.
French reaction was not the xenophobic reflex many might have expected. Le
Courrier de l'Ouest remarked: 'Fortunately, the Quai has just put the
machine into reverse, thereby avoiding a repetition of that detestable
French habit of surrendering automatically to the demands of the state.'
Many will find that a curious sentiment in view of other recent events which
have seen 'the state' - in the form of the prime minister, Edouard Balladur
 -surrendering to pressure from the streets, whether over the price of fish
or of adolesecent labour. But this only highlights the French tradition of
political consultation: blind acceptance or violent revolt.
There is no middle way, and few legal means of public protest against the
state. This can be be advantageous if you want to build nuclear power
stations, high-speed rail tracks, or vast motorways on private property. But
the great re-think went beyond that. There was recognition that the
commemoration of D-Day had enabled the French to annoy everybody.
The Germans were upset by their exclusion from certain ceremonies and by the
clumsy attempts to retrieve the situation; the Anglo-Saxons by the affair of
the hotel rooms. L'Independant du Midi seemed to think both problems could
have been resolved by making the British and Canadians share rooms with
German veterans. But this paper from the south is far from the front line
and is a bit barmy, anyway.
La Presse de la Manche was involved more intimately. 'Unthinkable, impolite,
inelegant to the point of caricature. The heroes of the festival are the
ones we honour, our liberators. The very least we can do is to offer them
the best place, 50 years after their perilous disembarkation, for they
return among us as friends and benefactors. That can never be understood at
the school of National Administration or Political Science.'
Nor surprisingly, it was Le Monde which covered the widest panorama. In the
deft hands of its leader writers, the affair became a symptom of almost
everything; even Quebec got dragged into it (Quebec is French and Canadian.)
'Conforming to a certain authoritarian statist tradition, which always
surprises the Anglo-Saxons and even the Quebecois, Paris simply requisitoned
hotel rooms . . .'
Le Monde also argued that the Gaullist version of history had to be revised.
The general had convinced the French that they had won the war by their own
means 'with the aid' of their allies. But the paper noted: 'Historical truth
is less heroic. Beyond the Channel and the Atlantic, things are not seen
quite this way. As a Canadian veteran justly remarked in a Quebec accent:
'When we came in 1944, we hadn't reserved two years in advance'.'
So, the episode is something of a milestone. The French, like everybody
else, rarely feel any sense of wrongdoing in their conduct of relations with
peoples of other lands. They can blow up yachts in friendly foreign
harbours, they can poison tranquil islands with nuclear bombs. More than
anybody else, they can confuse their narrow national interests with those of
civilisation and the fate of Europe if not the world.
But in this small affair of the veterans' hotel rooms, there has been a
universal, and engagingly frank, admission that France, in the form of the
state, behaved badly. And it concedes that the Anglo-Saxons were right to be
annoyed.
The French press usually demonstrates a greater sense of le fair play than
its counterpart across the Channel, but rarely in such a self-critical
manner. Perhaps June 6 1994 will constitute a turning point in French
history as dramatic as the event which it commemorates. On the other hand,
maybe it will not.

FT  09 APR 94 / Around the horns in 15 minutes: David Lascelles (and 63
others) give Wagner a dashing work-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a box with a chain saw at one side of the rehearsal room, which
was rather disconcerting. But perhaps the prospect of listening to an
orchestra consisting entirely of French horns playing a Wagner medley might
not be to everyone's taste.
It did not, however, daunt the 64 members of the British Horn Society who
turned up at the Barbican Centre in the City of London on Easter Saturday to
prepare for a rare performance of Fantasia on Themes from the Ring of the
Nibelungen, by Vitali Bujanovski.
As a thoroughly indifferent horn player, I was one of the more apprehensive,
but I had been assured that my modest grade six attainment was sufficient. I
also had the attendant support of my wife, another relative novice.
Bujanovski, who died only last year, was for many years principal horn of
the Leningrad Symphony Orchestra and, like many lovers of the French horn,
he was unable to resist the call of The Ring. Wagner himself is reputed to
have told his wife that he 'wished he could write for nothing but horns.'
Bujanovski took up the challenge and reduced the entire Ring cycle to its
bare essentials: brass. He scored his piece for 32 individual horn parts in
eight separate groups. But the orchestration is so clever that it can be
played by any number of horns in multiples of eight.
This extraordinary work lasts only 15 minutes but it packs in all the
juiciest thematic highlights: the Rhine, Siegfried's heroics, the majesty of
Valhalla, Wotan's fury, etc. It is the sort of thing everyone should hear -
just once.
When we arrived at the Barbican, we were invited to leaf through sample
parts to find the one that suited us best. My wife and I ended up with part
30 which was low, had lots of rests and only one exposed bit, where we
introduced the 'Siegfried Assertive' motif. Since no one has yet actually
got round to publishing the Fantasia, we all had to make do with
hand-written, photo-copied parts.
Our co-players were a varied bunch of all shapes, sizes and ages, most of
them amateur enthusiasts. Many were silver-haired; others were well below
the age of puberty but possessing talent which left you wondering: Why
bother?
More interesting, in a way, were the horns themselves. Few instruments are
quite as exhibitionistic, with their shiny twirls and complicated valve
mechanics. Three owners of Vienna horns had come down specially from
Scotland: their horns had an extra loop near the mouthpiece which invited
eager comment and comparison.
Purveyors of horns, music for the horn, and all the bits and pieces that
horn players need had laid on a little exhibition in the hallway. With much
fingering, tootling and chattering, we made our way round the stands. One of
the problems with the horn is the shortage of good music, and this was a
chance to extend our repertoire (although we have yet to find out whether
our purchase of a Schubert mass arranged for horn duet was a good buy).
The day's schedule involved only a brief rehearsal directly before the
actual performance. We were lucky to have as our conductor Sian Edwards, the
music director of the English National Opera; lucky, because she is a horn
player herself.
All musicians think their instrument is the most difficult of all to play,
but French horn players know it happens to be true in their case. The
instrument is a rebellious creature: it disobeys even the sternest commands.
But Edwards, her shock of red hair ablaze, knew how to coax the best from
our unruly efforts. The ragged early sounds, the disconcerting wrong notes,
the false entries - all were ironed out steadily as we grew familiar with
the piece, and each other.
An hour later, we trooped on to the stage of the Barbican concert hall, a
venue where I had never in my wildest dreams imagined I would find myself.
The lights shone down with blinding brightness and I could barely see the
audience, although one reason might have been that it was not exactly large.
Edwards raised her hands, caught our eyes and off we went. First, she drew
out the sonorous opening bars of the Rhinegold, then increased the pace as
we joined Siegfried in his adventures. The tension rose as we clashed with
the mounting forces of evil: great eruptions of noise as we slew the dragon
and charged on to defy the very gods themselves.
Next, a change of pace as we thrilled to the joys of eternal youth, rode
down the mighty Rhine, and galloped to the sound of Siegfried's horn.
The climax came with two dozen horns trilling and the rest providing a huge
body of supporting sound, with an urgent, punctuating beat from deep below.
Then, with a final thunderous blast, it was all over.
That, at least, was how it seemed from the back row. Whether the audience
felt the same, I do not know. There was plenty of applause, and Edwards came
back for a second bow, waving generously at our happy faces.
And so we dispersed. I only hope we left Wagner beaming, not spinning in his
grave.

FT  09 APR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Must try harder to do the tax
return - Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bright new versions of all the principal home budget computer programs have
blossomed with spring: Intuit's Quicken, Microsoft Money, and Sage
Moneywise.
All are Windows programs, and all represent significant improvements on
earlier versions. Two years ago I would have fainted for joy at the features
offered by any. Now I am exasperated that no-one has got it quite right.
I must begin by declaring an interest: I worked with Intuit through the
winter helping to anglicise parts of the Quicken manual. I expressed my
exasperation to them directly.
I have several years of computer account-keeping behind me now.
I like knowing exactly how much we have in our various accounts. Tax returns
are easier. Reconciling a bank statement is almost fun by computer, and does
reveal mistakes - usually mine, sometimes the bank's. I do not bother much
these days with reports and graphs. I do not even do much budgeting any
more, now that I can turn back so easily to last year's figures.
All three programs meet these needs admirably. All three, but especially
Quicken and Moneywise, have new features, both useful and fun. And all can
calculate and report on VAT, making them suitable for small businesses.
Sage Moneywise is much easier to use than it used to be, but it remains
unashamedly a computerised cashbook. The two American programs, Quicken and
Money, include provision for accrual accounting. I think Quicken is the
better of the two.
Included in the box with Moneywise is a separate program to calculate the
interest you should be paying or receiving on bank accounts.
Amid all this excellence, what do I find to complain about? Just this: these
programs do not provide the help I want with my tax return.
Both Quicken and Money claim to offer help with tax. In Quicken, income and
expense categories can be assigned to particular questions on the standard
tax forms and drawn together in a tax report. Wonderful? No. Because neither
program has included provision for the tax deducted from bank and building
society accounts, or for tax credits received with dividends. You can devise
categories for these items and include them in your accounts - but it will
not do you much good, because you cannot get the information out again in a
useful form.
Quicken was the first domestic accounts program in this country to
incorporate a stockmarket module. Now all three have them. Although even the
best (Quicken) is not a substitute for dedicated portfolio management
software - I like and use this feature.
An investment performance report, offered by Microsoft Money as well,
assesses performance from any date to any other date, taking everything into
account - dividends, profits and losses, dealing costs, and changes in
capital value. The result is expressed as a percentage of the value of the
portfolio at the beginning of the chosen time span. This is one report I use
regularly. Quicken gives the return on our portfolio in 1993 as 16.5 per
cent, not counting tax credits - that sounds all right.
Microsoft Money has been imperfectly anglicised, with the result, among
other oddities, that shares cannot be arranged according to stock market
sector. Sage's portfolio is not fully integrated with the rest of the
program.
My husband and I own most of our share portfolio jointly, but for historical
reasons, we each have some shares in our sole names. Most of the time we
think of the whole lot as 'the shares', without distinction. I need a
program which allows me to divide the shares into different accounts
according to ownership, but view and update them together. In Quicken and
Microsoft Money, but not Sage Moneywise, this is easily done. It is a
valuable feature. It means, for example, that each of your personal equity
plans could be placed in an account of its own, but merged with each other
and the rest of your portfolio when required. So far so good.
At income tax time, proper distinctions must be made. My summers are
darkened by the need to draw up lists for our tax returns of his dividends,
her dividends, their dividends; his shares-in-lieu, her shares-in-lieu,
their shares-in-lieu; and then the gilts and the unit trusts and finally, in
a little list all of their own, my husband's four dividends from Bowater,
including income from savings and investments abroad.
Quicken offers many report formats, all capable of a variety of
modifications, but will not produce a simple list of dividends and tax
credits. Microsoft Money has not even heard of tax credits. Sage Moneywise,
being British, will produce the list. But Sage makes no provision for
shares-in-lieu, and will not let me merge the portfolios.
Does no one besides myself mind? I feel that these otherwise excellent
programs have invited my discontent by promising 'tax reports'. If I use
either Quicken or Money for a year, all the information the tax man wants
will be there, carefully typed in and verified as bank accounts are
reconciled. I want to click my mouse and see the lists roll out of my
printer. Maybe next spring?
These programs require an IBM-compatible computer running MS-DOS version 3.1
or higher and Microsoft Windows.
Money Version 3 costs about Pounds 50, including VAT. Telephone:
0734-270001.
Moneywise Version 2 costs Pounds 49 plus VAT. It requires Windows 3.1 and at
least 2 MB of memory (RAM); 4 MB is recommended. Telephone: 091-2013000.
Quicken 3 for Windows costs Pounds 59.95 including VAT. It requires Windows
3.1 and at least 2 MB of RAM. Telephone: 0800-585058.

FT  09 APR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: A novel way of feathering his own
nest - Clive Fewins meets a man who earns his living by fair means and fowl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was the celebrated tale of American businessman Victor Kiam, who liked
Remington razors so much that he bought the company, that inspired Charles
Alexander to devote the rest of his life to chicken manure.
Alexander is an American who has worked and gardened in the UK for 23 years.
He liked the chicken manure fertiliser he used on his soil so much that when
the opportunity arose, he bought the company that made it.
In the two years since he bought Pelco Fertilizers, he has increased
turnover for its only product - Super-dug - by nearly 6 per cent per annum.
'Not bad in a recession,' he said. Six years ago, at the age of 50,
Alexander decided he was so attached to England and his garden, that he
declined an invitation from his employers to return to a senior post in the
US and took early retirement.
After a spell of financial consultancy Alexander learned that the man who
supplied his favourite garden fertiliser was about to sell the company he
had started and run for 33 years. The result is that since April 1992 he has
been in full-time work again, and it is the beaming faces of Alexander and
his wife, Elaine, that adorn the front page of the 2.4m. leaflets that drop
out of gardening and other magazines at this time of year.
Alexander's business is mail order. There are no vast stockpiles of chicken
manure behind his clean and clinical three-man rented office on the
outskirts of Bath. The only reference to the product that you will see
inside is one of the large green 25kg plastic sacks pinned up on the wall.
The rear of the sack clearly outlines the myriad of uses to which the
unsavoury broilerhouse by-product that forms the basis of his business can
be put. Sprinkled around flowers and bushes to promote growth; raked into
lawns to act as a feed and disperse moss; applied to the compost heap to
accelerate decomposition; or used as a liquid feed when soaked overnight in
a bucket of water in an old nylon stocking. If all this sounds a bit over
the top then Alexander will tell you that he had 21 years experience of
using Super-dug in his garden and on his two allotments before he found
himself selling it.
'Super-dug is many times more effective than ordinary farmyard manure,'
Alexander said. 'As well as being organic and rich in nitrogen phosphorous
and potassium it is relatively odorless, and weed-free. It has a fine
texture, and is light, friable and easy to use. We find it is particularly
popular with gardeners in urban areas because it can be delivered to the
door.'
You can only buy Super-dug by having it delivered. Up-front money is the key
to the business, as it was before Alexander bought the company.
'The man who started the company and sold it to me 33 years later - Peter
Ellis - was a keen businessman and chicken farmer,' Alexander said. 'I had
no reason to want to change the basis of the company. I was looking for a
mail order business to buy - I had always found that area of commerce
fascinating - and I was lucky in finding one with a product that I knew to
be good and that fitted in well with my interests.'
He injected into the business some of the marketing expertise that he
learned at university in Colorado and with Manufacturers Hanover Trust of
New York. Advertising is all-important - as is the ability to control it
tightly and monitor it by computer. This is simply achieved. All the coupons
printed on the Super-dug advertisements are coded according to which of 18
magazines they appear in. When they are returned it is easy to analyse which
is the most effective medium. He deals with the magazines - currently he has
a total promotional budget of Pounds 118,000 - himself.
'When advertising agencies approach me for my business I tell them that if I
did not handle the advertising I would not have a job,' Alexander said.
His facility with a computer also serves him well in his role as transport
manager. He uses 18 hauliers to distribute the sacks of Super-dug - they
come in just the one size - from the three producers from whom he buys the
material to the customers in their homes. Haulage and production is
currently 42 per cent of total turnover.
Alexander's main objective is to use all this promotion to good effect to
repay the money he still owes under the deal by which he bought the company.
He put in one-fifth of the purchase price, borrowed two-fifths from Barclays
Bank and two-fifths from Ellis who has now been repaid. Repayments to
Barclays start in July. Current net profit on a turnover of Pounds 700,000
is Pounds 118,000.
Once repayment is complete Alexander's plan is to look for new products. 'At
present we are a one-product company,' he said. 'I see no danger in that -
we get our raw material from three different sources and I can't ever see
there being a shortage of chicken litter. But it would be nice to add to our
range of products.'
He may launch in the UK a gardening tool that has been used on the other
side of the Atlantic for nearly 30 years.
'It is a worksaver that is tried and proven and can be sold all year round,'
Alexander said. 'We are hoping to introduce it over here this summer. But I
shall say no more just in case it doesn't get off the ground until next
spring.'

FT  09 APR 94 / How to Spend it: Shirts through the mail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I suppose there are some chaps who still saunter down Jermyn Street when in
search of a shirt, who like to spend a little time deliberating between a
Bengal stripe and a fine check. For them Jermyn Street still has lots to
offer but for the rest of us, buying shirts seems to consist of either a
quick sortie to a chain-store or a flick through the pages of a mail-order
catalogue.
New on the mail-order scene is Cavenagh Fine Shirts. Cavenagh used to sell
its shirts by taking its wares round City offices. These days, with the
tightening of security following the bomb-scares, it has become harder to
sell in this way and so Pamela and Duncan Cavenagh, who learned classic
shirting at Dunhill (a pedigree place to imbibe sartorial wisdom), decided
to move into the brochure business.
The catalogue is heavy on what it calls 'classics' - whether this be the
shirt itself or the colour (it is very fond of 'classic' white). In other
words, what it offers is a perfectly good City shirt at good prices. There
are stripes and plains, two-fold poplins, herringbones and Oxfords. All the
'classic' colours are there: white, blue, pink and a range of stripes.
There is a big selection at Pounds 25 (plain-coloured poplins, Bengal
stripes, bankers' stripes, directors stripes, Oxfords, both classic and
button-down, and weekend checks) while horizon blue poplins, bold stripes,
end-on-ends, herringbones, windowpane and graph checks and chambrays are all
Pounds 28. The prices are marginally lower than Marks &amp; Spencer where a
superfine cotton City shirt sells at Pounds 29, though a standard Marks &amp;
Spencer white cotton shirt is Pounds 20. The catalogue also offers casual
shirts, plain leather belts, cotton boxer shirts, pure silk ties and silver
cufflinks. The wing-collared evening dress shirts look particularly good
value at Pounds 38.
There is a Cavenagh shop at 659, Fulham Road, London SW6 5PY but the mail
order brochure can be ordered by ringing 071-610-3004.

FT  09 APR 94 / How to Spend it: The very easy chair - A look at cardboard
furniture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fun for children, for students, for week-end houses or anywhere where
cheapness matters, is the cardboard chair designed by the French architect,
Oliver Leblois. The chairs are sold in flat-packs and are a doddle to
assemble. They are made from triple-layer corrugated cardboard and are said
to be strong enough to withstand weights of up to 21 stone. In other words,
in spite of being made from what is, after all, only paper, they really are
meant for sitting on.
These, you will have gathered, are not chairs for posh drawing-rooms - they
are chairs to have fun with, to be used in nurseries, kitchens, playrooms,
bedsitters. They come in plain cardboard and the enterprising can paint or
decorate them as they will. There are also two sizes - the adults' version
which sells at Pounds 26, the child's one which sells for Pounds 15 and
includes a pack of crayons (with which to decorate the chair) in the kit.
After Noah, of 121, Upper Street, Islington, London N1, (telephone:
071-359-4281) sells them and will soon have more cardboard furniture from
the range - bookshelves, table and even a bed are to follow. As the chairs
are flat-packed they can be ordered by mail for an extra Pounds 5 to cover
postage and packing.

FT  09 APR 94 / How to Spend it: The wealth of the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wealth of Nations is a small mail order company purveying traditional
garments from around the world. Almost every culture had evolved some
classic garments that would have a universal appeal, reasoned Julia
Woodham-Smith, the company's founder and owner. Her tastes run to the
hand-made and the natural so her catalogue focuses on these.
The first catalogue offered wedding shirts from Mexico, creamy cotton smocks
from rural Hungary, work shirts from Ireland. Since then it has expanded.
There are linen shirts from Croatia, cowhide navvies belts, Chinese work
suits and work shirts from Brittany.
Newest of all is the range for children. Some are simply scaled down
versions of the adult designs - the Hungarian shirt, the Csikosok waistcoat,
the Indian gingham shirt and the Camargue shirt. Others have been specially
made - the little shepherd's smock is made from cotton calico from the Styal
water mill in Cheshire. As Woodham-Smith points out, real shepherd's smocks
were designed to keep out the wind and the wet but today, they have been
revived as partywear.
Because of the quality of the materials and the amount of handwork, prices
are not low. The shepherd's smock, for instance, is Pounds 30.
The children's clothes can be bought from The Conran Shop, 81 Fulham Road,
London SW3 as well as by mail. For a brochure write to: Wealth of Nations,
Unit 28, The Talina Centre, Bagleys Lane, London SW6 2BW.

FT  09 APR 94 / How To Spend It: The combat boot goes in - Chunky footwear
is in vogue. Lucia van der Post looks at one purveyor of sensible shoes that
finds itself suddenly chic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once it was just the young who clumped around in Doc Martens while their
elders tended to look on and wonder why they could not trip about in
something a little daintier. These days, however, clumpy shoes are
everywhere. I even found myself scouring London for a pair of heavy lace-up
Ann Demeulemeester shoes (found eventually - at a price - at Jones in Floral
Street in London's Covent Garden); everything else seemed too timid, too
demure to set off a new suit I had bought.
The fashion pages show that the skinniest, most fine-boned of models prefer
combat boots or heavy trainers. Every fashionable foot is wearing the
walking shoe, the army boot or the sturdy lace-up. There may be some among
you who think that dainty lady-like shoes should be worn with floating
chiffons - I urge you to try a sturdier shoe (or even boot) and see how it
gives a fresher, more youthful look, how it adds a touch of wit and
modernity to what could otherwise verge on cutesey sweetness.
An unlikely provider of this look is Hawkins, a traditional footwear company
which bears a Royal Warrant and which provided hard-wearing and comfortable
riding boots to the army during the Boer War.
For years Hawkins has been a solid provider of footwear for riding, for
walking, for the army. Its reputation was founded on function, quality and
practicality.
Fashion, however, has caught up with Hawkins which, to its astonishment
found that its Kinderboot, which it had perceived as a functional low-budget
walking boot, was nearly as fashionable as Doc Martens. Featured in The
Face, Arena and other trend-setting journals it was to be seen tromping up
and down the chicest streets, worn with everything from jeans and cotton
chinos to evening dress and floaty chiffons.
Since it had found itself so unexpectedly in the fashion arena Hawkins
decided that it might as well build on that and developed a fashion
collection of its own which it launches next Thursday.
As fashionable footwear this year coincides so closely with the things that
Hawkins does best - the boot, the lace-up, the brogue - the collection is
well-timed. Prices, though not cheap, do seem good value. They vary between
Pounds 39.99 and Pounds 89.99. Hiking boots can be had for Pounds 52.50, the
famous Kinderboot for about Pounds 55.
The collection is available nationwide at Sacha branches as well as at many
other shoe shops. For a local stockist you could call 0604-32293.

FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Pibs that bear watching - Bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gilts and sterling bonds have been among the worse performers in the first
quarter of this year. But the capital value matters only when you sell your
investment and, with most bonds, you have the comfort of a fixed repayment
date, and value, for which to hold on.
Permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) offer only one, albeit enhanced,
virtue - a fixed income, since there is no repayment date.
Now, First National and the Cheshire Building Society have issued floating
rate Pibs. Since the interest rate is changed every six months and the
issuer never repays the capital, such an investment would appear not to
offer any of the benefits enjoyed by holders of other bonds.
But with concern growing over the direction of interest rates, a bond from
which the income will rise in line with these is attractive, especially if
the capital does not fluctuate greatly. We must, however, put this in
context.
The Cheshire (ranked 22nd-largest society) issue will, every six months,
re-fix the income it pays by adding 2.4 percentage points to the six-monthly
rate paid by Libor - the London Interbank Offered Rate, which is the rate of
interest in the short-term wholesale market. What is more, the Cheshire
promises to do this forever. At present, the six-monthly Libor rate plus 2.4
percentage points equates to an interest rate of a little under 8 per cent.
But it is easy to forget that Pibs are the lowest quality share issued by
the societies and rank among the last creditors in liquidation. With
conventional Pibs, the high fixed yield offers some compensation for this
risk. But the return from floating Pibs should be compared with deposits.
Some deposit accounts from larger societies offer full repayment of capital
and no dealing charges as well as rates close to those of floating Pibs.
Thus, investors must question the merits of these Pibs.
Michael Dyson is a director of BZW Capital Markets. This is a market-maker
and cannot deal direct with private clients. Readers wanting to buy bonds
should see a broker.

FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inchcape's results at the beginning of the week reflected a strong Japanese
yen and were lower than expected. The share price fell back a little and
both Charles MacKay, the chief executive, and Sir David Plastow, the
chairman, bought stock.
Flying Flowers is based in the Channel Islands and deals in fresh blooms.
The company was floated in August of last year and the share price has
blossomed considerably since then. Most of the board held stock when the
company came to market but the purchase by D. Payne of 50,000 shares
represents his entire holding.
Calderburn, which makes office furniture, warned about profits in December
following the impact of deferred orders. At the same time, it announced it
had acquired SBFI, which makes specialist desks. This has proved a
successful deal and the company started the year strongly. We note that the
sale of stock by Fredrich-Wilhelm Dauphin was made on behalf of his wife; he
retains almost 3.5m shares.
Devro International makes sausage skins and came to the market in July 1993.
At that point, the directors undertook not to sell any stock until after the
results were announced last month. When these were announced, three board
members then sold shares. All retain considerable stakes in the company,
though.

FT  09 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: The BES and tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Could you please give some information on the effect of payments under
approved BES on total income for tax purposes.
1. If the relief given for BES payments in Paye coding reduces the tax
liability to the 20 per cent band, is it possible to claim relief on the
unused part of this band (eg, against building society interest taxed at 25
per cent).
2. Do payments under BES reduce total income so that, where appropriate, the
various age reliefs may be claimed?
1: Yes. 2: No. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets IR51 (Business
expansion scheme) and IR121 (Income tax and pensioners). IR51 is obsolete
but might still be available.

Could you tell me if any pamphlet is available explaining discretionary and

Discretionary and other trusts are notoriously complicated beasts and it is
a little difficult to recommend anything other than to consult your legal
advisor. As background reading, however, we would recommend the Equity and
Trusts paperback by Paul Todd, published in the SWOT series of London legal
publishers, Blackstone Press, price Pounds 8.95 (tel. 081-740 1173).

I am about to sign an agreement with a publisher for another book. At my

But my accountant and the Society of Authors doubt the wisdom of this. What
are the income tax, inheritance tax and capital gains tax implications?
Income tax: The royalties will form part of your income assessable under
Case II of Schedule D. Your sons will not be taxable on the money.
IHT: The payments will be potentially-exempt (or possibly exempt) transfers,
depending upon more facts that we have).
CGT: There will be no consequences.

FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: A loss of choice that - Balanced
funds have lost their balance and tilted too much to equity income, says
John Cuthbert. And that is cause for concern to investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN CUTHBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This occasional series considers the risk/return trade-off of unit trusts.
The articles first select funds which do better than chosen benchmarks, then
relate the performance to the riskiness of the fund. This produces a
short-list of funds worth considering as investments.
Methodology: The total returns of funds operating in the same sector are
measured against that of the FT-SE-A All-Share index, the broadest measure
of the stock market. Those that beat it over five years - which is reflected
in a benchmark return of more than 1 in Table 1 - are then given a second
test: are they more or less risky than the norm for their sector?
If the figure under 'risk index' in Table 2 is above 1, they are unusually
risky; below 1, and they are less risky than the average. But then comes the
clincher: does their performance justify their risk profile?
The risk/return column in Table 2 takes the All-Share as the standard ; any
fund with a higher risk/return figure - that is, above 0.27 - is producing
an unusually good performance given its attitude to risk.
Funds with a risk/return figure below 0.27 do not produce a high-enough
return to justify the risks their managers take.
Some time during the 1980s, perhaps because of the equity headiness of those
days, the UK Balanced unit trust sector rid itself quietly of the
characteristic which had been its marker - a 50/50 mix of fixed income and
equity.
By the beginning of 1993, the process of favouring equity over fixed income
had gone so far that UK Balanced funds virtually were indistinguishable from
those of the UK Equity Income sector. Only one established fund, CU PPT
Monthly Income Plus, could claim any semblance of balance.
Is this loss of choice, the loss of fixed income and equity balance,
something we should mourn? I think it is.
Funds which mix fixed income with equities have two benefits over the more
fashionable approach of concentrating on equity income in the hope of
getting capital growth as well. First, fixed-income assets pay higher
yields. Second, funds based on balanced investment carry lower risk.
Those with at least some fixed income exposure are considerably less
volatile than pure equity funds. And, in general, the bigger the exposure to
fixed income, the lower the risk (as Table 1 shows).
Column one (average fixed-income content) of Table 1 shows the average
exposure of a sample of 19 Balanced unit trusts to fixed income assets for
the period from January 1 1989 to September 1 1993. Column two provides a
description of their equity volatility or risk over the same period.
The table shows a clear trend - Axa Equity &amp; Law and Perpetual High Income
aside - from the below-average risk of a high fixed-income element fund like
Prudential High Income to the high-risk, non-existent fixed-income exposure
of N&amp;P, NM and Brown Shipley.
But even the funds with a relatively high fixed-income content have gone
about it in arguably the wrong way. They have tended to concentrate on
preference shares and convertibles rather than bonds. Yet, bonds actually
are a better way of combining high income with low risk.
I could find only one fund (irritatingly, not included in the sample to
which I have just been referring), which has maintained a consistent mixed
exposure to bonds and equities - CU PPT Monthly Income Plus.
This fund has an outstandingly favourable combination of high yield and low
risk. It is the only fund included in my main study (Table 2) with a yield
(7.63 per cent) that exceeds that of the average gilt. Indeed, seven of the
funds in this study fail to beat the desperately low 3.44 per cent yield on
the All Share index.
CU's risk level also is well below average (its risk index figure is 0.66,
or 34 per cent below the sector average), whereas the risk profiles of the
rest of the sector range from average to high.
The sector's avoidance of fixed income in general, and bonds in particular,
would be understandable if the resulting increased exposure to equities had
produced greater capital gain. But as the total return column of Table 2
shows, there are no fewer than 11 funds with performances that fail to beat
the 53.33 per cent total return of CU PPT Monthly Income Plus. A further
seven fail to beat the five-year total return of the FT-SE-A All-Share
index.
The snag with CU is that its total performance record does not outstrip the
All Share index, either, whereas six other balanced funds have. But the
performances of each of these six have been at the expense of income, and
three (Perpetual High Income, Henry Cooke - previously Arkwright - Income
and N&amp;P Higher Income) also have required investors to accept above-average
or high levels of risk (see risk index figures).
With the exception of Perpetual High Income, none of these performances
stands out in a total return and risk-adjusted return comparison with the
Equity Income sector - which is where they should, in fact, reside. Chagrin
at the diminution of investor choice is increased by the realisation that
the switch from a balanced to a growth-biased equity income strategy has
not, in general, produced any real benefits.
The failure of most UK Balanced funds to turn equity opportunity into equity
performance shows up in Table 2. Only six funds with five-year records have
been able to match or better both the total return (74.86) and risk/return
of the All-Share index (0.27)
These two yardsticks provide an exacting test of a fund manager's worth.
Success on both counts is prima facie evidence of managerial ability. And,
while CU PPT Monthly Income Plus fails on the total return count, the fact
that it has the highest risk/return score of all is, nonetheless, a further
commendation for the bond/equity balanced approach.

FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Personal pensions - the facts - What
potential buyers ought to know
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past two months, the Weekend FT has taken a close look at personal
pension plans and the most important features to consider when selecting a
provider.
These are complex products and, with more than 100 plans on offer, it is
all-important to seek professional independent advice to ensure that the
provider you select offers the best value for money.
To make an informed choice, you and your partner should consider the
following points in detail:
The financial strength of the provider.
The charges deducted by the provider from your premiums before investment.
The cost of advice, if not included in the provider's charges.
The investment performance, focusing on consistency of returns over five to
10 years and the stability of the investment team.
Flexibility of the contract; in particular, that there are no penalties for
stopping or reducing premiums.
The two critical factors that affect the success of any investment are the
performance of the fund and the amount deducted in charges before your money
is invested. What consumers should be seeking is good, consistent
performance over the long term combined with low, flexible charges. A plan
that imposes high charges would have to achieve an outstanding performance
to offer good value.
Life office charges are notoriously complicated and it is near-impossible to
work out how much you are paying. To make matters worse, the law says life
offices cannot use their own charges to illustrate what your investment
would be worth in, say, 20 years. Instead, they must use figures provided by
the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro) which
bear little or no resemblance to real charges.
Adding to the confusion, the illustration can use only two annual growth
rates: 6 and 12 per cent. Consumers cannot put any faith in these figures
which would turn them alternatively into paupers or millionaires.
While it is impossible to predict future performance accurately, it is
possible to use the provider's real charges in these illustrations (although
it is necessary first to seek Lautro's permission; otherwise, the exercise
would be illegal).
The two tables show illustrations that assume the commission paid to the
adviser is stripped out, leaving just the life offices' own charges in
place. The results can be compared with the 'no charge' figure at the top of
both tables.
It is important to remember that you still must pay for the advice, whether
in the form of a separate fee or as commission deducted from your premiums.
The exception in our table is Equitable Life; its figures include the cost
of the advice if you buy through its direct sales force.
The Prudential did not provide figures since nil-commission terms are not
available through its direct sales force, which sells 97 per cent of the
company's personal pensions.
The figures in brackets show the three top providers in terms of lowest
charges, while the final figure in each table shows the difference between
the highest and lowest chargers.
By January 1995, life office illustrations will have to show the impact of
real charges; this will help considerably in the selection process. As the
table shows, the difference between the best and worst providers on charges
alone can run to thousands of pounds on a long-term investment.
The providers examined in the tables include some of the best but not the
worst. To identify these, you must refer to comprehensive industry surveys,
such as the FT Personal Pensions 1994 handbook and Money Management's March
1994 survey.
These reveal the providers with sky-high charges and second-rate fund
performance. Most do not deal through independent advisers but sell instead
through company representatives who do not have to point out high
chargesand/or poor fund performance.
For the record, here they are.
Worst performers with profits plans: Britannia Life, Royal Life, Guardian
Assurance, National Provident and Scottish Mutual.
Worst performers unit-linked: Laurentian Life, Scottish Life and Scottish
Mutual.
Highest chargers on regular premium plans: Eurolife, British Life Office,
Providence Capitol, Combined Insurance, Refuge, Royal London, Merchant
Investors, Liberty Life, Acuma, Gartmore.
Highest chargers on single premium plans: Colonial Mutual, Royal London,
Hambro Guardian, Gartmore, GA Life, Windsor Life, Acuma, Cornhill, Pearl,
Century Life.
One final point on how you pay for your advice. The Weekend FT has argued
consistently that investment advice should not be linked to the sale of a
product - yet, most advisers are remunerated only by a commission payment
from the provider when they make a sale.
Unfortunately, the taxation of advice in the UK looks set to perpetuate this
system because it is cheaper to pay for advice through commission rather
than fees.
Under the commission system, the provider deducts the adviser's payment out
of your premiums, which benefit from full tax relief. Moreover, there is no
VAT on the payment of commission by a provider to an adviser on the sale of
an insurance-based personal pension.
But Michael Bryant, marketing director of Rathbone Brothers, a private
client banking and asset management group, says: 'If a pensions specialist
charges for his advice and recommends that a private client takes no action
or that a non-insurance personal pension is more appropriate, then his fee
is not allowable for income tax relief.
'What is more, his fee is subject to VAT at 17.5 per cent which the client
cannot reclaim. This double taxation prejudices the availability of good,
independent fee-based advice on pensions. It encourages the continuance of
the commission-driven system.'

FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Premium bonds rise again - Diary of
a Private Investor / Kevin Goldstein-Jackson did not win Pounds 1m this
week. But he's hoping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday morning, I raced to turn on Channel 4 television's Big Breakfast
Show. Chris Evans, the presenter, was talking to Kermit the frog. Would this
bring me luck?
Newspaper advertisements had said the announcement would be made between 8am
and 8.30. Tension mounted. And, at 8.17, it happened. The first winner of
Pounds 1m on the premium bonds was announced. It was not me.
I knew that the odds on a single Pounds 1 premium bond winning the big prize
were 'only' 3.37 billion to one - but I did hold 8,000, so my chances were
somewhat improved.
This year started well for me, with four Pounds 50 prizes in January and
another of Pounds 50 in February. I was even considering increasing the size
of my holding again.
I had held premium bonds for many years but it was not until 1985, when my
wife and I had reached the then maximum of Pounds 10,000 each, that I
started to keep a record of what we made.
What drew us initially to this National Savings product was the prospect of
tax-free winnings - especially attractive to high-rate taxpayers - and the
knowledge that, unlike most other forms of gambling, the initial stake money
would be returned if needed.
Theoretically, each Pounds 1 bond had a 15,000-1 chance of collecting a
prize in the monthly draw, even if it was only Pounds 50. With average luck,
we thought we would do reasonably well. That was the idea. In practice, what
each of us got from our Pounds 10,000 holding up to 1992 was disheartening
(see table). Last year, she won Pounds 450; I got only Pounds 250.
Returns like these depressed us. We felt it was easier to make money
elsewhere, such as from tax-free gains on shares held via personal equity
plans.
Even a letter from NS last August, pointing out that we could increase our
holding to the new maximum of Pounds 20,000 each, did not impress us -
although it pointed out that 'holdings of Pounds 20,000 can be expected to
win an average of 16 prizes a year.' In November, I reduced my holding to
Pounds 8,000 and my wife to Pounds 7,980.
But things have changed. Uncertainties on the stock market have made it more
difficult to produce excellent returns.
Low interest rates have reduced the attractions of cash on deposit. And tax
can still be levied at rates rising as high as 40 per cent on certain
capital and other gains.
No longer do bonds have to be held for a full three months after purchase
before they are eligible to enter the prize draws; the wait is now just one
calendar month (although, if you buy bonds at the beginning of a month, you
still have to wait for a full, clear calendar month before they enter the
draw. Thus, it is best to buy them towards the end of the month).
The total prize fund equates to 5.2 per cent of the value of all the bonds
held. With average luck, that compares very favourably with interest rates
elsewhere and is especially attractive to higher-rate taxpayers (although
experience shows that 'average luck' is rather like the statistician with
his head in the oven and his feet in the refrigerator: his average body
temperature is warm).
The minimum purchase of bonds is now Pounds 100, which buys 100. While the
previous maximum prize of Pounds 250,000 has been abolished, there are many
other prizes each month including two of Pounds 100,000 each, three of
Pounds 50,000, four of Pounds 25,000, 10 of Pounds 10,000, 25 of Pounds
5,000, and 435 of Pounds 1,000 - plus many of Pounds 500, Pounds 100 and
Pounds 50.
The number of smaller prizes is adjusted each month to take account of how
many bonds are held. The more eligible for the draw, the greater the number
of prizes, although the total paid out will still equate to 5.2 per cent of
the value of all the bonds entered.
This month, for example, there will be 209,047 prizes of Pounds 50. Although
there is now only one draw each month, instead of the weekly draw that used
to be held for the smaller prizes, it can take up to two weeks from its date
for the Pounds 50 cheque to arrive through the letter box.
Still, I am keeping my fingers crossed that I will be one of those winners.
And if next month's Pounds 1m number is also announced on live television, I
shall again be an avid viewer.

FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Mixed news at Forte - The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte, the UK's leading hotels group, announces its full year results on
Thursday. Profits generated on disposals will distort its headline figures,
but underlying profits are expected to rise from Pounds 71m to between
Pounds 85m and Pounds 90m.
Total trading profits are likely to slip from Pounds 200m to Pounds 190m
because of the buy-out of the contract catering business, partly offset by a
lower interest bill.
Further asset write-downs are expected - following the previous year's
Pounds 344m hit - but Forte's balance sheet is now much healthier thanks to
disposals, including the Pounds 177m injection from the flotation of the
Alpha Airports catering and duty free retailing business in February.
Following the dividend cut last year, maintained payments of 7.5p are
expected but are still unlikely to be covered by underlying earnings per
share.
Meanwhile the Savoy Hotel group, which includes the Connaught and Claridge's
as well as the Savoy, is expected to report little better than break even
when it announces its annual figures on Wednesday. That compares with a loss
of Pounds 1.43m in 1992. The dividend on the A shares is expected to be held
at 7p.
Burmah Castrol, the lubricants, chemicals and fuels group, is expected to
report pre-tax profits of about Pounds 186m for 1993 on Monday, up from
Pounds 179.6m a year ago. Trading has been tough in Germany, which accounts
for about 20 per cent of group business, but recession in Europe should have
been counterbalanced by more favourable conditions elsewhere. Following an
enhanced scrip dividend at the interim stage, analysts think the final
dividend could be lifted by more than 10 per cent.
On Tuesday Tesco, the UK's second-largest supermarket group, is expected to
announce a big fall in reported pre-tax profits for the year to February
from Pounds 581m to between Pounds 435m and Pounds 445m.
That reflects the impact of the group's decision - announced in January - to
start depreciating stores, which will take Pounds 36m off reported profits,
and land premiums, which will remove another Pounds 32m. There will also be
a one-off write-down of Pounds 85m on land values. On the same accounting
basis as last year, analysts believe profits would have increased to between
Pounds 590m and Pounds 600m.
Smiths Industries, the medical systems and aerospace components group, is
expected to report increased interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 46.5m (Pounds
40.3m) on Wednesday. The improvement is thought to have been underpinned by
strong sales by the medical division and contributions from recent
acquisitions.
Meanwhile the construction industry results season continues with annual
figures from two of Britain's biggest building material groups.
Blue Circle, the UK's largest cement group, is expected to announce pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 155m for 1993 when it reports on Thursday, compared
with Pounds 93.8m in 1992.
Progress at RMC, the world's largest concrete company, is thought to have
been slower with profits of approaching Pounds 170m in 1993 not much higher
than the Pounds 166.6m earned the previous year. RMC reports on Wednesday.

FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: A GP among the specialists - 11th in
a series on fee-based advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Andrew Swallow is clear about his role as a fee-based independent financial
adviser. He says he acts as his clients' general practitioner, not their
specialist.
If they need a financial service that Swallow believes can be undertaken
better, or more cost-effectively, by someone else, he calls on his
established professional connections among accountants, solicitors and
stockbrokers. Similarly, he and his colleague, Sarah Keens, do not undertake
discretionary investment management.
He says: 'I don't think a small IFA can run a discretionary service because
this requires full-time skills. We can't see how a small organisation can
maintain the skills necessary to provide structural investment and financial
advice and, at the same time, undertake the specialist work necessary to
manage funds on a discretionary basis.'
Swallow is the founder of Andrew Swallow IFA, based in Ipswich, Suffolk, and
established four years ago. A previous winner of Money Management's
independent financial adviser competition, he used to work in the insurance
industry and also spent four years in an IFA partnership.
This broke up because Swallow wanted to work exclusively on a fee basis. He
argues: 'When IFAs charge commission, the only difference between them and
the direct salesman is that they can sell lots of policies while the Allied
Dunbar salesman can sell only one.'
Although Swallow works from a large, modern bungalow close to the
countryside, his clients tend to be concentrated in the Greater London area.
'We get them from recommendations and professional connections,' he says. 'I
was lucky that I was with a Lloyd's brokerage in London for two years.'
Swallow describes his 'average financial planning client' as earning more
than Pounds 75,000 a year and/or having total assets of more than Pounds
500,000. This dominance by the better-off is one that he regrets but feels
is inevitable.
'It is a great distress to me that the people who would benefit most from
independent financial advice cannot afford to pay for it,' he says. 'We will
consider any size of funds on our personal financial planning side, but our
fees make it unlikely that we will undertake investments of less than Pounds
100,000. We all do occasional charity cases - re-arranging modest affairs
without charge - but you can't run a business on these. My view is that IFAs
eventually will deal only with the wealthiest 5 per cent.'
Swallow's fees are time-based and range from Pounds 45 to Pounds 110 an
hour. Clients are always consulted on the treatment of any commissions that
arise. 'We are fully computerised and we itemise the bill for every item,'
he says. 'We are just moving to a new system that times by the second. I
feel that a financial adviser who is treating clients' investments has to be
even more transparent on fees and commissions than an accountant or
solicitor.'
Swallow also points out that: 'Far too much of the work is non-productive
nowadays. That's why fees have to be so ridiculously high. You have to do so
much research, reading and training.'
The Swallow service starts with an assessment of all a client's assets. This
includes a detailed investment policy schedule and an individual balance
sheet and cash flow forecast. The analysis can take three to six months to
complete.
'Once we know the extent of a new client's assets and have agreed these with
them, we can provide the appropriate advice,' explains Swallow.
'Typically, our clients tend to be very busy in their own life, earning a
lot of money, and they want that portion of their affairs sorted out for
them.
'You often find that the most brilliant and successful people are absolutely
clueless in my department. Then again, some are very difficult to deal with
because they are so big and you have to be quite forceful sometimes to bring
them to the table. I sometimes say to people: 'If you would do this, or if
you would reply to correspondence, I could cut my fees in half'.'
Swallow also draws up financial plans for small businesses, and manages
employee benefit arrangements. Roughly one-third of the firm's income comes
from its 29 corporate clients.
'We act predominantly for small PLCs, director-owned companies and
partnerships,' says Swallow. 'We produce our own member booklets. I find it
extraordinary that most IFAs who do corporate benefits wouldn't dream of
doing their own booklets, as they are in the best position for this.'
He places great importance on client contact, arguing that one of the
strengths of a fee-based firm over one based on commission is the ability to
forge close relationships. Private clients receive quarterly bulletins and
an annual review, and Swallow says: 'It is unusual for us to speak to a
client fewer than two or three times each year. A lot of clients contact us
once a month.' He also has monthly contacts with corporate clients.
Swallow adds: 'We try to be pro-active. But, as we are paid by the hour, we
have to be somewhat circumspect to ensure that clients do not feel we are
trying to drum up fees on their account.'

FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Best buys for top-up pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Few employees in company schemes retire on a full pension, yet only one in
10 takes advantage of a tax-efficient method of topping up their benefits -
additional voluntary contributions (AVCs). But those who do pay AVCs may not
be aware of the stark contrast in returns available from different
providers.
A survey* by actuary Bacon &amp; Woodrow shows that if you had invested Pounds
50 a month over 10 years to last December 31 in the most popular type of AVC
fund, the final payout could be anything from Pounds 11,500 to Pounds 15,250
depending on the chosen provider. Over five years, Pounds 50 monthly could
have achieved annual returns as high as 20 per cent or as low as 6.4 per
cent.
An AVC is a company pension arrangement set up by the employer to run in
conjunction with the main scheme and to allow members to boost their
benefits. All employers with standard pension schemes must offer an AVC
facility. Most AVC schemes are run by life offices and building societies.
AVCs are as tax-efficient as the main company scheme. There is full relief
on contributions, tax-free growth of the fund and, in some cases, a tax-free
cash lump sum at retirement (depending on when you started payments). As
with the main scheme, the pension itself is taxed as income.
Company AVCs are normally chosen by the trustees of the main scheme. But
Nigel O'Sullivan, senior investment consultant with Bacon &amp; Woodrow, says:
'Trustees often neglect to review the performance of the AVC scheme. Nor do
they always check to see if there is a financial penalty for scheme members
who stop regular payments due to early retirement.'
In the past, schemes offered AVCs to employees only when they were close to
retiring. Now, though, you can pay however much you want whenever you want
provided you stick to overall Revenue limits - up to 15 per cent of salary
for main scheme and AVC contributions combined (restricted for some higher
earners). But you must belong to a company scheme to take advantage of AVCs
and only employees can contribute, not employers.
Most AVCs operate on a money-purchase basis. This means that although the
main scheme pension might be linked to salary, the AVC scheme invests your
contributions to provide a fund which is used at retirement to buy an
annuity from a life office. This annuity provides a guaranteed income for
life, but its value depends mainly on the investment performance of the
chosen AVC fund.
There are three main investment options under AVCs, although schemes do not
have to offer a choice. Deposit accounts are similar to normal building
society savings accounts. With-profit funds bring some of the risks and
rewards of stock market investment, and unit-linked funds more of both.
Free-standing AVCs (FSAVCs) are similar to company AVCs but the employee has
an individual contract with the provider. One disadvantage, however, is that
the employee must bear the cost of the provider's charges. With company
AVCs, these charges often are borne by the employer. With 100 FSAVC plans on
offer, it is essential to seek independent advice to get the best value for
money.

FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Look before you leap - A look at
guaranteed equity products and their drawbacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's 8 per cent fall in the UK stock market will have rattled some
novice investors. Deposit rates are still miserly but the market is living
up to its alarming reputation. The investor is between a rock and a hard
place.
One tempting answer to the problem is guaranteed equity products. The very
word 'guarantee' has a comforting ring to it, even when it is not clear who
is guaranteeing what or when. And the dangerous 'equity' is defused by its
context. But it is worth looking very hard at these schemes before
succumbing to temptation.
They were an immediate success with savers when launched late in 1992.
Building society interest rates were falling. Full-blooded stock market
investment was worrying. Here was the ideal compromise.
At their simplest, these hybrids offer the investor a fixed percentage of
any rise in the FT-SE index, plus a money-back guarantee provided he keeps
the bonds for the agreed period, usually five years. But critics pointed
out, correctly, that what these bonds actually offered was not the best of
both worlds but the second-best.
If the market did well over the five-year period , the investor failed to
take part fully in its growth. He would have been better off buying an
index-tracking unit trust. If the market did so badly that the FTSE was
lower at the end of five years than at the start, the investor would have
the comfort of his money-back guarantee. But he would have done better by
keeping his money on deposit.
So, the second generation of guaranteed bonds usually locked in part of the
stock market's rise at intervals during the period of investment. If, for
instance, the market rose by 20 per cent, someone investing Pounds 10,000
might be able to lock in a profit of Pounds 1,800.
Then, even if the market fell for the rest of the five years, he would still
walk away with Pounds 11,800 rather than the Pounds 10,000 guaranteed
originally. But, of course, there was a price. He benefited proportionately
less from any rise in the index than someone who had not opted for the
lock-in facility.
The precise mechanics of the different schemes vary, and it is difficult to
make meaningful comparisons between them. Essentially, though, there is
usually a trade-off between the extent and flexibility of the capital
guarantee, and the degree to which the bond benefits from any given rise in
the stock market.
Thus, a scheme which guarantees less than 100 per cent of your capital might
well give you the full benefit of any rise in the market - sometimes more.
That is fine if the market continues to rise. But if it is sluggish, you
could find your capital being nibbled away. The schemes with complete and
flexible capital protection offer you a relatively limited share in stock
market growth.
The discrepancy is understandable. Most of the funds provide your capital
guarantees by putting the majority of your money on deposit and using the
rest to buy FT-SE options or futures, which allow you to benefit from FT-SE
rises. The greater the proportion of your investment needed for the capital
guarantee, the less is available for the FTSE link. So, the less you can
expect to benefit if the market rises.
Over the past year and a bit, most funds have offered you progressively less
bang for your buck: the promised FTSE participation rates have been falling.
Choppy markets have made the options and futures, which normally provide the
equity link, more costly. And falling interest rates mean that more of your
total investment is needed for the deposit which usually provides the
capital guarantee.
An alternative type of scheme hopes to achieve the same objective - equity
growth plus capital protection - through a different route. It links units
in a conventional index-tracking unit trust to a separate capital guarantee.
This type, pioneered by Legal &amp; General, has advantages for the higher-rate
taxpayer, although the capital guarantee is inflexible.
How does the innocent investor decide which - if any - of these schemes to
pick? There are several questions you need to ask.
How inflexible is the scheme? Can you get your money out before the end of
the agreed period? And what are the penalties for doing so.
What exactly is being guaranteed? Some schemes guarantee only your net
investment after knocking off all charges. If it is only a partial
guarantee, what is the most you could lose? Does the guarantee apply only to
investors who stay for the full five year?
What are the tax implications? In schemes structured as life insurance
bonds, tax is paid at basic rate within the fund, but higher-rate taxpayers
will have an additional liability. These schemes subject your gains to
income tax, rather than capital gains, so you cannot take advantage of your
annual capital gains tax allowance (now Pounds 5,800). On unit trust
schemes, you will be liable to CGT.
How easy is it to check the progress of your investment? A tiny minority are
unit trusts and can be found in the normal prices pages. Some will give you
a surrender value if you telephone them. With many, though, it is hard to
know what is happening to your money.
One of the few financial advisers to monitor this market is BESt
Investment*.
Asked for selections for higher-rate taxpayers which combined high potential
returns with good capital protection, it picked the Legal &amp; General
Guaranteed Plan (also available in a Pep), the Hypo F&amp;C Protected Capital
plus 'A' scheme, and the new Govett UK Safeguard fund.
For basic-rate taxpayers, BESt suggested the Save &amp; Prosper guaranteed stock
market bond - soon to be re-issued.

FT  09 APR 94 / Markets: Profit hopes flourish in a cold climate - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pre-Easter flood of company news has suddenly turned into a drought.
This dearth did not help and may have contributed to an unsettled mood in
the City of London, where climatic conditions alternated with bewildering
speed between sunshine and hail.
Market sentiment remains, likewise, poised uneasily between fears of a
further tightening of US interest rates and hopes that the UK recovery is
sufficiently well established to shrug off handicaps such as this week's
steep rise in personal taxation.
Bears have been in the driving seat since the beginning of February, when
the market FTSE 100 peaked at 3520. Dealers were in fearful mood when they
returned to their desks on Tuesday after a wintry Bank Holiday weekend,
knowing that Wall Street had fallen sharply the previous day.
Having marked shares down sharply at the start, traders were wrongfooted
when Wall Street rallied sharply and they were left scrambling for stock.
The Footsie closed last night 34.4 points higher on the week - but still 11
per cent below its February high.
Hoare Govett was one of several stockbrokers to suggest that the pessimism
had been overdone, arguing that recent talk of a 1987-style crash in
equities could not be more ill-founded, both in terms of valuations and,
more importantly, the UK's position in the economic cycle.
The broker said: 'By far the most important difference between now and 1987
is that they represent almost opposite points in the economic cycle. 1987
was the sixth consecutive year of rising GDP and profits. 1994 will be the
second. Inflation in 1987 was 4 per cent, going on 10 per cent, and gilts
were poor value. Inflation is now 2 per cent, going on 4 per cent, and gilts
are reasonable value.'
James Capel, one of the City's largest brokers, suggested analysts -
including its own - had been underestimating the scope for profits and sales
recovery from UK industrial companies over the next two years.
Capel's market strategy team compiled the accompanying chart, which shows
that analysts tend to miss most of the major turning points in the economic
cycle. Comparing analysts' expectations with what actually happened, it
suggests analysts underestimate how much profits will fall in a recession -
but then also understate how far they rebound in a recovery.
The report says: 'An understandable psychological motivation might explain
the tendency of forecasters to underestimate if they have been too
optimistic in the recent past.'
Capel believes there is substantial scope for an earnings surprise in UK
industrial stocks, pointing to recent experience in the US, where corporate
earnings have been on average 3 per cent better than expected over the past
year.
BZW, another large broker, said that in the last few weeks its analysts had
made more upgrades than downgrades to their earnings estimates - the first
time this has happened in nine months.
While the most rapid growth will be seen in 1994-95, Capel reckons it may
well be another three to four years before this cycle peaks. Over the next
five years the UK should be able to sustain average profit growth of 11.5
per cent, taking profits' share of GDP back to levels last seen in the early
1960s.
The bullish forecasts are based partly on the prediction of low growth in
input costs, such as raw materials, utility prices and labour, compared with
manufacturers' prices, together with continued productivity improvements.
Capel accepts that substantial profits recovery is already in the price of
many shares, but says its analysis reinforces the case for a range of
cyclical sectors, such as extractive industries, building and construction,
media and transport.
The week's main corporate development was the announcement by Eurotunnel,
the company which will operate train services through the Channel tunnel,
that it had settled settled a long-running dispute with Transmanche Link
(TML), the Anglo-French the construction consortium.
The bad news for Eurotunnel's shareholders was that it had agreed to pay TML
an additional Pounds 70m-Pounds 85m in a settlement covering the tunnel's
fixed equipment. This brings the total it has paid TML to Pounds 1.14bn,
nearly twice the Pounds 620m original contract price. The good news is that
this is considerably less than the Pounds 1.95bn which the contractors had
sought.
The deal settles the final claim outstanding against Eurotunnel, although it
still has a Pounds 1bn claim against the British and French railways. A
Eurotunnel rights issue, planned for mid-May, is now expected to raise
between Pounds 600m and Pounds 750m.
The agreement was marked by a spat between Eurotunnel, its financial
advisers and Swiss Bank Corporation. This led to a senior SBC executive
being banned from taking part in the forthcoming rights issue after he got
on the wrong side of Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's famously combative
co-chairman.
The SBC executive was supposedly being punished for indicating that the
rights issue might be as large as Pounds 750m. However, the sub-text was
that SBC's aggressive behaviour has offended the City establishment on
several occasions in recent years. It forced BZW to trim the margins on its
enhanced scrip dividend wheeze and challenged the flat-rate 2 per cent fee
for underwriting rights issues.
Eurotunnel's advisers, Morgan Grenfell, Banque Indosuez and SG Warburg
Securities, had been irritated by what they saw as exaggeration of SBC's
role in the rights issue. There was considerable satisfaction that Sir
Alistair had wielded the big stick at this brash newcomer - even if SBC will
still play an important role in the fundraising exercise.

FT  09 APR 94 / Markets: Risk, yes - but be intelligent about it - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the predatory Hanson is sizing up a target, it looks hardest at the
downside. If there is any significant risk that an acquisition will explode
in its face, Hanson walks away. It is an example worth noting. The concept
of risk and reward is crucial to all investment decision-making. Very few
professional investors have a cavalier attitude to risk.
American fund manager Michael Hirsch starts one of his books with the words:
'Investing should be boring. As boring as watching a tortoise race against a
hare . . . B-O-R-I-N-G' He points out that, once you have made a significant
loss, it is virtually impossible to regain your lost ground without taking
on additional risk. So - do not expose yourself to excessive risk in the
first place.
That, of course, raises the question of what constitutes excessive risk.
There are two points to consider. First, does the probable return justify
the apparent risk. Second, what kind of risk / return mix is appropriate for
you.
A couple of articles in this week's Finance &amp; the Family section exemplify
the point. John Cuthbert's analysis of different unit trust sectors (page
VI) operates a double screening process for the trusts. First, he selects
funds which do better than his chosen benchmarks. Then, he relates the
performance of each fund to its risk - is the price of the units more
volatile than those of its peers? Last, he puts the two measures together:
does the performance justify the risk profile?
What you are looking for are funds which produce an unusually good
performance given their conservative attitude to risk. What you want to
avoid are funds with humdrum performance that fail to justify their high
risk exposure.
The guaranteed equity products described on page III also involve a
risk/reward calculation. But what is crucial here is that they are intended
for investors who are so risk-averse that they are reluctant to buy a normal
unit trust.
When we asked a specialist to pick some schemes for us, he avoided those
which put investors' capital at risk, even though they might well produce
higher returns under favourable market conditions. Like Hirsch, he was happy
to settle for tortoises.
But what happens if you cannot tell a tortoise from a mad March hare? The
increasing use of derivatives means that many investment products designed
for relatively unsophisticated investors are exceedingly complicated.
Only financial Luddites want to abolish the derivatives market. Futures and
options give investors a flexibility they should welcome. Yet, it is hard
even for professionals to choose between guaranteed equity schemes. You need
a computer model to calculate how various schemes might have behaved in the
past, let alone how they might behave in the future.
People are, increasingly, expected to make their own financial provisions
rather than rely on the Nanny State or the Nanny Company. But it is getting
ever harder for them to do so intelligently.
*****
Asked why Barclays was bribing people to defect to Barclaycard, a surprised
employee replied: 'To get more customers'. In many ways, it is a heartening
sign. Competition has often seemed sadly lacking in the financial services
'business.' But even now, competition is very patchy.
Mortgages have been sold competitively ever since the clearing banks entered
a market dominated by building societies. Baring's defection from the
personal equity plan market this week underlined how competitive that has
become. Execution-only stockbroking services also compete on price. But all
too many financial services seem virtually untainted by competition.
Take conventional banks. They are deeply uninterested in customers with
current accounts or small deposits. All would love to start putting charges
on current accounts but are hoping someone else will go first. Instead, they
do it the sneaky way: imposing penal charges on overdrafts.
It is that kind of attitude which has opened the way for such rare
innovators as First Direct, the telephone banking service. It has won a
large slice of the market by giving customers what they want.
What is more, its low cost base means it should soon make reasonable
profits. Sharelink has had similar success in execution-only stockbroking.
More worrying is the vast morass of life insurance and pensions. The table
on page III, showing the gulf between the returns on different pension
top-up plans, is a typical example of the enormous variations in performance
in this area. But the subject is so opaque that it is very hard for real
competition to break out.
There are several messages for customers here. First, it is sensible to take
advantage of price competition only if you pay attention to quality when it
is relevant. A cheap Pep is good value only if it performs well. But a
telephone bank that is open 24 hours a day has few obvious drawbacks. Where
competition does not exist, it is crucial to shop around as intelligently as
you can.

FT  09 APR 94 / Markets: Odds change in America's biggest casino - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A casual reading of the headlines last week might have led a reader to
conclude (mistakenly) that Americans no longer had an appetite for risk. The
nation that boasts the world's largest number of small shareholders had, it
appeared, lost faith in gambling. Some stocks fell as much as 30 per cent.
No, this was not the Wall Street casino. Voters in Missouri were casting
their verdict on whether slot machines should be legalised in their state
(they voted against by a narrow margin, hitting the share prices of a number
of casino companies in the process.) But in the bigger gaming hall that is
the stock market, the hunger for risk appeared undimmed.
That Americans have not given up on risk-taking was clear from two events
last Tuesday. First, a survey of public opinion (from a gaming company,
naturally) purported to show that 67 per cent of people around the country
approve of legalised gambling. A quarter of Americans in this survey claimed
to play their local state lottery at least once a week - roughly the same as
the proportion of US households that holds shares in mutual funds, though
this is no doubt a coincidence.
The second event was more telling. The stock market, which had been looking
as panic-stricken as a non-swimmer out of his depth, finally found that
there was a bottom to stand on (at least for the time being). And what is
more, the bottom turned out to be exactly where many analysts had said it
would be all along.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had hit a closing peak of 3,978 on
the last day of January, touched 3,551 on Tuesday morning - almost exactly
10 per cent lower. From there it rebounded, recapturing half of its 84 point
loss of that morning by the end of the day and jumping another 82 points on
Wednesday.
Analysts who had been predicting a 10 per cent 'correction' from the peak
(but had been increasingly devoid of conviction in the face of the market's
slide) suddenly sounded cocky again. Those two words so beloved by
stockbrokers - 'buying opportunity' - were dusted off, tin helmets were
stored away.
So is it back to business as usual? In at least one regard, it appears so.
The financial markets have escaped the baleful effects of a nasty
chain-reaction, at least for now.
It went something like this. The half-percentage point rise in short-term US
interest rates since early February, modest as it seemed, had made it more
expensive to finance holdings of bonds and other securities by borrowing,
prompting some investors to liquidate their holdings.
Some of the biggest bets had been placed in markets which had a tendency to
freeze in moments of turmoil (thinly-traded European bond markets or the
markets emerging market 'Brady' bonds) or which involved esoteric
instruments difficult to value in times of market stress.
So investors who needed cash did the natural thing. They sold US government
bonds, which are traded in the world's most liquid securities market. That
helped drive the price of Treasury bonds down and the yield up. (There
already seemed to be good fundamental reasons to sell bonds: the US economy
was emerging from its winter freeze and showing every sign of advancing
strongly, raising afresh the spectre of rising inflation, the bond market's
biggest bogey.)
Falling bond prices led stocks lower. After all, why would anyone buy shares
when bonds appeared to be getting cheaper? Investment markets are all about
relative value. Until the bond market levelled out (as it did in the middle
of last week) there was little chance that the stock market would stabilise.
This insidious cycle took everyone by surprise, from market analysts to
regulators. No-one had realised how closely the behaviour of mainstream
financial markets was tied to such arcane corners of the financial world and
to the trading behaviour of what had been thought of as 'fringe' players
like hedge funds (in reality, this group of investors is probably being made
a scapegoat for a broader group of banks and institutions which had borrowed
to finance their trades).
So is the chain-reaction over? For the time being, it seems so. The yield on
the benchmark 30-year bond has levelled off at around 7.2 per cent.
Investors in the stock market, predicting a strong first quarter earnings
season over the next fortnight, have begun to regain their faith in share
prices - and there are more bargains around than two months ago.
And the US still seems to love gambling. Three quarters of Americans who
responded to that survey agree: gambling is an acceptable form of
entertainment.

FT  09 APR 94 / Markets: Jitters shake the builders - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of construction and building material companies, like the rest of the
stock market, are suffering an attack of the jitters. Fears about possible
interest rate rises, which have depressed stock markets worldwide, have been
accompanied by concern that previous optimism over the pace and quality of
the housebuilding and construction recovery could have been overdone.
As a result, construction shares have fallen sharply, in spite of a return
to profits by businesses which, only a year ago, were announcing record
losses.
Amec, the large UK construction, engineering and property group, was the
latest to be affected with shares falling 5p to 135p on Thursday despite
unveiling a Pounds 21m pre-tax profit last year following a Pounds 88.2m
loss in 1992.
The turnaround was lower than expected, but what really concerned the market
were remarks, made by chairman Sir Alan Cockshaw, about the continuing poor
state of UK construction - in particular, the low profit margins (some would
say, non-existent) on many domestic jobs.
The problem, as Cockshaw made clear, was that there were too many companies
chasing too little work. The industry was in sore need of rationalisation
but he did not believe this was likely to happen.
Over-capacity was such that margins were likely to remain dull even when
output recovered. In consequence, this year was likely again to be tough;
shareholders would have to wait until 1995 for recovery.
By then, however, the UK industry will be facing public spending cuts on
roads and other infrastructure. These may be offset, only partially, by
increased private investment.
The answer, according to Amec, is to pursue higher margin work overseas or
try to establish long-term relationships with customers to reduce dependence
on conventional competitive bidding where margins are likely to remain thin.
Similar comments have been made by other UK contractors during this results
season, suggesting that competition even for these kinds of projects is
likely to be intense.
Neither is the outlook for housebuilders as unclouded as might once have
appeared. This is one sector of the industry where output is rising sharply.
Margins also have begun to recover as expensive land, bought late in the
1980s, has been used up.
The problem, according to Howard Seymour, construction analyst with
stockbroker Barclays de Zoete Wedd, is that the rise in housebuilders' share
prices over the past 12 months suggests that investors expect profits to
rise faster than might be achieved.
'It is difficult,' says Seymour, 'to see where the earnings are going to
come from to justify the multiples some of these shares stand at - unless we
return to climate of high house price inflation.'
Particular concern has been caused by the way in which land prices have been
chased up as builders seek to replenish depleted stocks. According to David
Wilson, chairman of Wilson Bowden - which announced an 85 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 31.2m last year - prices for quality sites have
risen by an average of 20 per cent nationally, and by up to 50 per cent in
south-east England, during the past 12 months. But Wilson says house prices,
in a low inflation environment, are unlikely to rise enough to justify such
a big increase in land costs.
Building material companies have been more successful in reducing capacity
and costs and, therefore, are more likely to gain from increases in volume.,
They are even managing to increase prices - particularly in industries where
there are only a few players, such as plasterboard and cement.
This situation does not apply to all materials. Hepworth created another
flurry of concern on the stock market when it announced that over-capacity
was still affecting many of its products, inhibiting price recovery.
Mark Stockdale construction analyst with SG Warburg, says: 'Given that stock
market valuations have assumed that earnings recovery would accelerate, any
perceived inability to deliver will be punished.'

International travellers are now free to bring a few more souvenirs into the
UK without worrying about incurring import duty: the tax-free limit for
goods bought outside the EC has been raised to Pounds 136 from Pounds 36.
However, some other concessions have been removed to bring the UK into line
with general EC practice. Travellers will no longer be able to use their
allowance to reduce tax due on a single item costing more than the limit,
and family groups will no longer be able to pool their allowances and apply
them to a single expensive item.

FT  09 APR 94 / Blood brothers: a Zulu tragedy: Patti Waldmeir travels to
rural Natal to meet a family divided by South Africa's deadly political
geography
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a hill in South Africa's Natal province - a place of many, many
hills - which is known as Patheni, or 'the place of goodness.' The poignant
beauty of the name is a cruel joke played on those who live in the two rival
villages separated by its blue-green ridge, including brothers Samuel and
Joseph Njilo, childhood playmates turned mortal enemies by the deadly
geography of Natal.
For it is not so much politics which separates Samuel from Joseph in this
remote area of the Natal midlands: few in either village know much about the
rival parties which have turned Natal into a battleground for the Inkatha
Freedom Party and the African National Congress. It is the hill which
divides them.
Geography determines many political choices in Natal. Those who live in
Inkatha areas will not vote, because Inkatha says they must not; and those
who live in ANC areas will vote because they do not dare to stay away.
Patheni and Ndaleni, the two rival villages which sprawl across the valleys
on either side of Patheni hill, are two such areas. Joseph, younger
'brother' to Samuel (Europeans would say they are cousins) does not seem to
find this strange. How is it, I ask, that they have ended up, 40 years after
their shared childhood, on opposite sides of the political divide? Why did
one brother join the ANC and the other the IFP? 'Because one stays (lives)
at Patheni and the other at Ndaleni,' says Joseph. For him, it is as simple
as that.
In 1990, he says, his own village of Ndaleni held a meeting and decided
unanimously to join the ANC. The decision had to be unanimous, he says;
Ndaleni could not accommodate opposing viewpoints. 'If I didn't join the
ANC, I would have had to move to Patheni,' he says, without the slightest
hint of resentment. 'Nobody would dare stay here who is not ANC,' adds his
wife Catherine, while daughters Promise and Gloria contribute their
explanation of how Ndaleni became an ANC village: 'At the beginning, people
were forced to join the ANC. Now they love it.'
Samuel does not pretend that things are much different in Patheni, a few
arduous kilometres away by foot across the top of Patheni hill: 'Even here,
people say they are IFP when really they are ANC because they've got houses
here and they know it's too expensive to build another house'. Faced with
that overwhelming economic imperative it will be a brave man who votes with
his conscience and not with his neighbours (especially since Inkatha's poll
boycott will mean that mere presence at the voting station will almost
certainly mean a vote for the ANC).
Fighting has left several hundred dead in the two communities in the past
decade. Samuel, a minister of the Ethiopian church and Inkatha leader in
Patheni, recalls that the violence began with non-political faction-fighting
in the early 1980s - and escalated after Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, was
released from prison of in 1990.
Samuel gestures at Nkosi Dhlamini, the hereditary chief of the Patheni area,
who sits silently at the side of a room in Patheni's tribal court building.
It is one of the few modern structures in a village which lacks electricity
and internal plumbing and which could have been transplanted straight from
19th century Zululand. Samuel says the troubles started when the youth of
Patheni ridiculed the chief, ignored his authority and insisted he leave the
KwaZulu homeland (which pays him a salary as chief) to join the ANC-aligned
Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa. Njilo points out the
bracelet of goat's hair worn by Dhlamini as a mark of office: 'They looked
at Dhlamini and laughed and said: 'look at this man]' They are not Zulus any
more. They are rejecting their tradition,' he says angrily. The strict
discipline of Zulu society decrees that youth must obey age and that the
word of the chief and his headmen is law, in all but the most serious
criminal cases.
Samuel says tradition is the crux of the dispute between the ANC and IFP.
'All those Zulus (who support the ANC), they are not proper Zulus, they are
imitation, imitation, they are too weak,' he says, jumping up to demonstrate
the proper walk for a Zulu man wearing the traditional 'beshu', or skin
skirt worn on feast days: 'Raise yourself. Everyone must see: this is a man.
Look at his culture,' he roars, with that combination of machismo and pride
which makes it so easy to offend IFP members, and so hard to placate them.
'Chief Albert Luthuli (a former ANC president, a Nobel peace prize winner
and a Zulu), if he was still living, I don't think there would be IFP in
this country. He was a man,' says Samuel, adding that Mandela, a member of
the Xhosa tribe which he despises for being insufficiently warlike, is being
'used' by the ANC.
After Mandela's release the youth of both villages confronted their chiefs,
putting a burning tyre (the famous 'necklace') around the neck of the
Ndaleni chief, who fled. Many died in the ensuing fighting. Marauding
parties from both villages came over the hill at night to murder opponents.
In the end the young people from Patheni who supported the United Democratic
Front (forerunner to the ANC) fled to Ndaleni, leaving one quarter of
Patheni's houses empty; IFP sympathisers from Ndaleni took refuge in
Patheni. The politically committed in both villages were a minority; but the
apolitical majority threw in their lot with the activists; they could hardly
do otherwise.
Since that time, Samuel and Joseph - who grew up as brothers in the same
household, and experienced the same rites of passage to Zulu manhood - have
not seen one another. When we offered to set up a meeting at a neutral spot,
outside the area, both were suspicious; perhaps they thought that we, or our
Zulu guide, planned to arrange an assassination.
'I am crying to see him. It's my family,' says Samuel of Joseph. 'It's only
our organisation makes us fight each other, for nothing. When my brothers
die other side, I can't even attend the funeral.'
Samuel is far more of a politician than Joseph, who only recently joined the
ANC, and then - he says - only because 'all the residents of this area are
ANC members.' Samuel joined the ANC in 1958, but when the organisation was
banned in 1960, he opted not to join the movement in exile. 'We couldn't
just go all of us into exile,' he says. When Inkatha was launched in 1975 -
it was intended to operate as a kind of internal wing for the banned ANC -
he joined. The two movements parted ways when the Inkatha leader, Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, fell out with the ANC leadership. After some
soul-searching, Samuel stuck with Buthelezi.
As a result, Samuel's house at Folweni, a township near Durban, was burned
and his furniture destroyed by ANC supporters. He explains this as he
apologises for the primitive condition of his house at Patheni, part-ruin
and part traditional thatched hut, with a stand of blood-red dahlias in the
dirt yard outside. As areas near Durban have fallen to the ANC, many IFP
supporters have had to do as Samuel has done, and return to the deep rural
areas which are IFP strongholds.
Now these areas are preparing to boycott April's all-race elections. 'They
(the ANC) must accept what we want. We can't just vote for nothing. We are
not so stupid,' says Samuel, displaying the wounded pride which is perhaps
the greatest hallmarks of Inkatha. He says he does not know what Patheni
will do, but he will not vote; it seems a fair bet that his neighbours will
not dare to defy his lead.
Across the hill at Ndaleni, Catherine Njilo, Joseph's wife, sits at her
kitchen table, peering at us by the light of a flickering candle, as gusts
of wind blow in from the rainy night. She asks: 'Can grannies vote?' We
assure her that they can. Still, she says, it is not wise for all the
members of a family to vote. Her daughters help with an explanation: 'If
there are 10 members of the family then you mustn't all vote because you may
vote for different parties, and then you will quarrel.' Her teenage son
argues that a vote for Mandela is a vote for a new house; since eight adults
and two grandchildren live in this tiny space, without any salary, his
argument may prove persuasive.
Will Joseph vote? Like many Zulus, he will not answer such questions from
whites. If he does, he says, he is not worried that the ANC will fail to
protect Zulu tradition. 'Zululand is for Zulus, and Transkei is for Xhosas.
Even after the elections, Zululand will be for Zulus]' he says,
demonstrating how little he has understood the ANC's policy of
non-racialism, which denies such tribal divisions. His face in the
candlelight, marked by deep tribal scarring, is the face of a man who is
every bit as traditional as his brother Samuel. But fate and geography have
divided them, perhaps forever. The elections may only make matters worse.

FT  09 APR 94 / Long View: Shares under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A first quarter setback for the London stock market is seasonally quite
unusual, and can be blamed on overseas events, notably the upsets in
international bonds. Plainly, though, UK equities were looking expensive at
the end of last year.
I described them here as being 'only for the brave and nimble' although the
flood tide of global liquidity might yet carry them to a dividend yield of 3
per cent. In the event the All-Share Index rose another 5 per cent to a peak
on February 2, and the yield fell to a scant 3.2 per cent. Then, like so
many other securities markets, the London stock market was spooked by the US
Federal Reserve's initial quarter-point increase in dollar short-term
interest rates on February 4.
The international origin of London's setback is evident from the behaviour
of the different indices. The market leaders which comprise the FTSE-100
Index were down 10 per cent in the three months (and by 12 1/2 per cent from
the peak) but the All-Share was off only 7 per cent and the SmallCap Index
was in fact marginally higher.
Even now the average dividend yield on the SmallCap constituents is under 3
per cent, while Footsie stocks yield 3.9 per cent. Overseas holders of blue
chips have been selling, but the mainly domestic holders of second-liners
have not budged.
Much more violent events have been taking place in bonds, where long gilts,
for instance, started the year on a freakishly low yield of 6.37 per cent,
which has subsequently jumped (by about 1 1/2 percentage points at the
worst). In US Treasury bonds, where all the trouble really started, the
benchmark 30-year issue lost about 13 per cent of its capital value in the
first quarter, greatly underperforming US equities (down only about 4 per
cent).
Although some analysts are claiming that this bond market collapse implies a
rise in expectations of inflation, I believe this is a false conclusion. We
have simply witnessed the collapse of a speculative bubble. It appears to
have been very much of a bond market version of the equity market boom and
crash in 1987. That was interpreted in some quarters as heralding a new
Great Depression, but nothing on that scale has happened. Similarly, the
problems of the bond market have little economic consequence in themselves,
except to illustrate the proneness of the modern financial system to
speculative excesses - which appear to be transferring to the commodities
markets.
The bond bubble had the effect of distorting the relationships between bonds
and equities. In the UK this has been further complicated by the presence of
index-linked gilts, so that there is a real long-term interest rate (at
present about 3.4 per cent) in the market as well as a fixed interest rate
(7.7 per cent) and an equity dividend yield (3.7 per cent on the All-Share).
Market strategists attempt to fit these into a kind of matrix to allow for
inflation and dividend growth, plus margins for risk.
By the end of last year the low fixed-interest yield was putting heavy
downward pressure on the index-linked real yield. Meanwhile room was created
for equities to rise despite the poor value they represented on fundamental
grounds of dividends and earnings.
The subsequent jump in the real yield on index-linkers has in effect forced
equity yields up, because risky shares have to yield significantly more than
safe gilts (unless there are exceptional prospects for short-term dividend
growth). True, index-linked gilts only have about 5 per cent of the market
value of equities, so you might say that the tail is improbably wagging the
dog; but the London equity market has always been highly yield-conscious by
international standards.
Meanwhile the equity yield has also been tugged upwards by fixed interest
yields, to maintain a yield ratio of about 2. This was a common ratio during
the 1980s, but as I have written before, it has varied widely over the
longer term (being under 1 until the late 1950s) and is also very different
in other countries.
To justify a ratio of around 2 you need to assume moderately high inflation
as well as decent economic growth. If inflation stays low, as on balance I
believe it will, the ratio will surely have to fall: I would be happier with
a figure of about 1.5 or 1.6. If inflation rises sharply share prices will
fall anyway, as both short and long interest rates jump.
If anything UK economic expansion has been looking too hot for the equity
market's comfort recently; the best hope now is that the tax increases which
have just taken effect will cool this growth. If not, the lack of balance in
the upturn - too much consumer spending, too little investment - will lead
to a typical UK balance of payments crisis.
The economic statistics are of such poor quality that it is impossible to be
confident of what is going on. But. as far as the corporate sector is
concerned, profit and dividend growth almost appears too buoyant, so that in
the water sector, for instance, a political backlash is beginning to
develop. If the economy slows a sterling crisis may be avoided but investors
may feelthat they have become complacent about profits growth over the next
year or two.
Plainly, share prices in the UK offer rather better value now than they did
at the beginning of the year. The prospective yield on the market leaders,
allowing for dividend rises in the rest of the results season, is probably
around 4 per cent.
We are approaching that period of the year, however, when seasonal pressures
are more more regularly negative. We have not seen a full unwinding yet of
the phase of overvaluation that began to develop, along with the bond market
bubble, in the third quarter of last year.
But prepare your buying list anyway. Reasonable value may not now be too far
away, perhaps created by a political scare or two.

FT  09 APR 94 / Surge in sales of new vehicles underpins strength of
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A larger-than-expected surge in sales in virtually all sectors of the new
vehicle market should underpin hopes that the recovery is still on course.
Figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
show that new-car registrations were up by 14.8 per cent in March on a
year-on-year basis. New registrations in the commercial vehicle sector leapt
by 28 per cent.
The scale of the improvement in the commercial vehicle market may silence
some sceptics in the motor industry who have maintained that the strength of
the recovery is being over-stated. They fear a false impression was being
created by marketing techniques to attract reluctant private buyers, and by
some manufacturers encouraging dealers to register many cars for which there
were no final buyers. Commercial vehicle sales are made for purely business
reasons, and are a good market indicator.
Sales of vans, trucks and buses increased last month to 22,648 compared with
17,741 at the same time last year. The increase, the third consecutive month
of rises, brings commercial registrations for the first quarter to 56,602,
12.65 per cent up on the first quarter last year.
Sales of new cars last month rose to 185,201, compared with 161,338 in the
same month last year. They lifted registrations for the first quarter of the
year to 529,436 from 453,261 at the same time last year.
This represents a 16.81 per cent rise for the quarter, and seems to indicate
that the car market slowed in March. However, January was an artificially
good month with its year-on-year rise of 20 per cent after poor sales the
previous January.
Mr Ernie Thompson, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, said: 'These figures clearly indicate that the recovery is being
maintained despite the widespread knowledge of pending tax increases and
changes in company car tax benefit assessment.'
The new tax regime for company cars, based on a percentage of list prices,
came into effect on April 6.
Yesterday's figures suggest the society's forecast of 1.9m new-car sales
this year, compared with 1.78m in 1993, may be pessimistic.
The share of last month's car market taken by imports rose to 57.9 per cent
from 55 per cent in March last year.

FT  09 APR 94 / Brussels' lobbyists go back to school to learn art of charm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dogged by a public relations image that they admit is lamentable, Brussels'
lobbyists will soon have the chance to learn new skills at a charm school of
their own.
The first professional course aimed at providing practical training for
lobbying European institutions is to be opened later this month in Brussels
by the European Institute of Public Affairs and Lobbying, which is devoted
to teaching the tricks of the campaigning trade.
The aims of the 13-week course, the organisers say, is to instil some badly
needed US-style 'professionalism' into Europe's rapidly growing army of
pressure groups - a sector that is now believed to employ about 10,000
people in Brussels alone, after more than doubling in the past four years.
'A lot of people believe that to be a good lobbyist all you need is a good
address book - but it's a lot more than that. It is a professional skill and
job,' says Mr Daniel Gueguen, a course leader and seasoned campaigner for
Europe's sugar industry.
But with the lobbyists' rise provoking alarm in some commission quarters,
the creation of a special course on campaigning is likely to beg new
questions about the lack of regulation of Europe's pressure groups.
Later this month a committee of the European Parliament is due to consider
proposals that Europe's lobbyists should be forced to register and operate
under a formal code of conduct.
The author of the proposal, Mr Alman Metten, a Dutch MEP, insists regulation
is needed to 'prevent the type of abuses' he claims have become more
widespread as the sector has grown.
But the proposal has been criticised by the lobbyists themselves, who argue
that regulation would merely create a new level of bureaucracy in a city
already over-burdened by red tape.
Either way, all sides agree that the army of lobbyists could soon be
reaching US proportions. However, the lobbyists admit that US-style tactics
are unlikely to work in Europe, particularly when faced with the more subtle
political style favoured by France and the southern countries of Europe.
Mr Gilbert Portal, of the petroleum industry lobby, says: 'The European
style is less aggressive than the US. You cannot attack a French MEP in the
same way as you can in Washington.'

FT  09 APR 94 / Zulus defiant at S Africa summit: ANC prepares to tighten
emergency measures in Natal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SKUKUZA, EASTERN TRANSVAAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's political crisis deepened yesterday after a summit between
the country's top leaders failed to agree on ways to stop pre-election
violence.
After almost 12 hours of talks at an eastern Transvaal game reserve, the
country's four most important political leaders - President FW de Klerk, Mr
Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader, Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, the Inkatha Freedom party leader, and Zulu King Goodwill
Zwelithini - admitted they had made little progress in resolving their
differences.
Chief Buthelezi and Mr Mandela openly quarrelled during a press conference
which followed the meeting and King Goodwill made it clear he would advise
the Zulu people to boycott the elections to be held on April 26-28.
The failure of the meeting, one of the most important in four years of peace
talks, could exacerbate violence in the troubled Natal province, where
tension is high after the recent imposition of a state of emergency.
ANC officials said last night they expected to tighten emergency measures in
Natal almost immediately, which could provoke further violence. The four
leaders said they would set up a task force to continue seeking solutions to
the problems which have provoked violence between their supporters. However,
ANC and Inkatha officials said privately this was largely a face-saving
measure and no progress was made at yesterday's talks.
Mr Mandela said repeatedly he had 'no exaggerated expectation' that the task
force could reach a settlement. 'The (Zulu) king's reservations cannot
properly be addressed by a task force but only by a government of national
unity,' which would take power after the election.
In a tough statement Chief Buthelezi said: 'Progress could not be made on
most of the fundamental issues tabled by the king and the Inkatha Freedom
party.' Earlier, King Goodwill had asserted his people's 'claim to
sovereignty and self-determination' for KwaZulu, the self-governing homeland
in Natal. ANC officials had hoped the king would prove more conciliatory
than Chief Buthelezi, seen as the driving force in the demand for an
autonomous KwaZulu.
The ANC had hoped to divide King Goodwill from Chief Buthelezi, his uncle
and chief political adviser, by offering the king a separate peace
guaranteeing his status and income. However the move appeared to have
backfired with the king and Chief Buthelezi emerging from the meeting
equally defiant.
As the king was speaking at the summit, the ANC warned of impending
assassination attempts on its leaders. A statement implicated Inkatha in
what it called 'a comprehensive plan of intimidation and violence'.

FT  09 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Queens Moat Houses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The encouraging message in yesterday's results from Queens Moat Houses is
that the new management has made a good start in getting to grips with the
operational side of the business. The discouraging part is that there is
still such a long way to go. After so many different valuations have been
applied to its hotel portfolio one must take any figure with a pinch of
salt. The latest one puts Queens Moat's better hotels broadly on a level
with industry norms in terms of valuation per room. But the operating return
on the revalued assets is a mere 2 per cent and, at Pounds 18m, operating
profits pale into insignificance compared with an interest bill of Pounds
110m.
Queens Moat has long been candid in admitting that it cannot hope to
generate enough cash to service its existing debt. The question is how much
debt it could reasonably carry after its financial restructuring. There are
still considerable benefits to flow from cost savings and more active
marketing. That will come on top of any cyclical recovery in the hotel
business. So profits, at least in the UK, could grow quite strongly.
But even if Queens Moat managed to push its margin on continuing operations
up to 20 per cent from 7 at present it would still have operating profits of
little more than Pounds 60m. Allowing a tight interest cover ratio of two
times that would be sufficient to service less than a third of the present
Pounds 1.2bn debt. The restructuring still promises to be painful, despite
the improved trading climate.

FT  09 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Utilities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the first of British Gas's businesses to feel the heat of competition
is its high street chain, which is being cut almost in half to 240 shops.
The division aims to become a pure appliance retailer, in direct competition
with other household goods shops. It does not intend to perform services for
other parts of the group.
Whether British Gas can ever make an acceptable return in the fiercely
competitive world of appliance retailing is a moot point. On a fully costed
basis the chain probably loses money at present. Out-of-town competitors may
well offer larger ranges and lower prices. Gas's attitude is also in marked
contrast to other utilities - notably some regional electricity companies
and BT - which are expanding their chains. They argue that intangible
benefits justify running the stores even if they lose money. The water
companies have hardly bothered to be in the high street at all.
Retailing is unlikely to prove a sensible business for utilities. Even
experienced specialists struggle to make money in hardware sales and many
other providers of services are looking away from the high street. Banking
and insurance, for example, are increasingly done by telephone. Direct Line
and First Direct's brands are strengthening as a result. It is particularly
ironic that BT, one of the first companies into the virtual world of
computerised networks, should feel the need for a high street presence.
Smallish losses may mean that shareholders do not object, but flagships on
the high street add little value.

FT  09 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a measure of the growing optimism about the Japanese economy that
political turmoil left financial markets unmoved. The main danger is that
the resignation of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa leaves this year's budget - and the
economic stimulus measures which depend on it - in limbo. But that threat
will only become real if the ruling coalition is unable to agree on the next
prime minister and a general election follows. It seems more likely that a
change of faces at the top will finally end the horse-trading which has
delayed the budget so far.
On that basis the small rise in equities yesterday makes perfect sense.
While industrial output and capital spending are still in the doldrums,
consumer spending is finally gathering momentum in line with a recovery in
the housing market. If economic policy does not suffer serious disruption in
the wake of Mr Hosokawa's resignation, and a rising yen does not undermine
Japanese exporters as it did last year, a modest consumer-led recovery now
looks assured.
True, the impact of politics on the foreign exchange markets is difficult to
judge. Hopes of early progress on trade with the US - which might have been
achieved at next week's multilateral trade conference in Marrakesh - must
have faded. The prospects for a settlement thereafter turn on the next prime
minister. But an international figure such as Mr Tsutomu Hata might be
better placed to secure a deal than his predecessor. If that gave the yen
room to fall, the wider economy would benefit.

FT  09 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Calm in the storm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks as though calm has returned to the equity market. The FT-SE 100 has
proved reluctant to fall much below 3,100 and, despite the alarm that
followed Good Friday's US employment data, it actually managed a 34-point
gain in a shortened Easter week. A boost has come from hints that the
Federal Reserve may be reluctant to push up US interest rates again while
financial markets are nervous. With the gilt/equity yield ratio again well
over two, equities have a comfortable relationship to conventional gilts.
The differential with index-linked gilts remains narrow at a quarter point,
but strong real dividend growth could eventually help on that score.
A certain fragility remains, just the same. Even if the Fed has become more
cautious, it would be foolish to presume that the rate rises will stop at a
mere half point. With long-term rates of over 7 per cent, the Federal Funds
rate could in theory move to 5 per cent without upsetting the bond market
again. The optimists must hope this point sinks in so that by the time rates
do rise again equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic are clearly
focused on a relatively positive earnings story.
The trouble is that scares on interest rates could return at any time. There
will be plenty of opportunity next week when a raft of data on US inflation
and industrial output is due. Moreover the bulk of the selling so far has
come from leveraged speculative investors. Mutual fund investors which
pumped so much liquidity into world markets last year are slower to react to

FT  09 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Sagging Dow mirrors lower
trend in bonds
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US stocks finished with moderate losses as share prices mirrored a downward
drift by bonds, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 19.00 lower at 3,674.26
while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 3.78 at 447.10.
The American SE composite eased 0.55 to 441.21, while the Nasdaq composite
showed a 6.46 decline to 748.71.
The relative calm which prevailed since mid-week carried over into yesterday
morning. The Dow industrials strayed only a few points of their opening
values in thin morning activity, despite weakness in the bond market.
But as the session wore on, the benchmark 30-year government bond steadily
extended its early losses. Sell programs were triggered which dragged the
blue chips to 35 points down within a half hour.
A contributing factor was remarks by two Federal Reserve governors, who
suggested that pressures in the labor market and in production capacity
could soon trigger higher inflation.
Late in the session, the Dow recovered some lost ground, and the midday
volatility proved fleeting.
A trio of cyclical stocks helped limit the damage to the blue chip index. 3M
was Dollars 2 3/8 better at Dollars 102 1/4 , Goodyear added Dollars 1 at
Dollars 41 5/8 and DuPont jumped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 56 1/2 .
On the losing side, Caterpillar slumped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 117 1/8 ,
Alcoa dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 71 1/4 and Philip Morris lost Dollars
1 3/8 to Dollars 49 1/8 .
General Motors, off Dollars 2 3/8 &gt; to Dollars 57 5/8 , led the motor
vehicle makers in retreat. Ford dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 58 3/8 and
Chrysler plunged Dollars 3 to Dollars 50 7/8 , hurt by disclosure of a third
problem in its new Neon model.
Tandy, up Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 34 1/8 , retraced some of its heavy
losses from the previous day, when the electronics retailer said
first-quarter earnings would come in at the low end of estimates.
Canada
Toronto closed mixed in light trading, turning downward in the afternoon as
the Canadian dollar lost ground. The TSE-300 composite index fell 11.66
points, or 0.27 per cent, to close at 4,327.41, but advancing issues
outnumbered declines 429 to 353.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo retreated from earlier highs to end up 4.24 per cent.
The Bovespa index of 54 most-traded stocks ended at 15,374 points, up 625
points on the day. At the Rio de Janeiro exchange prices rose 4.3 per cent
at 62,067 points. Traded volume was of CR242.7bn (Dollars 241.6m). Brokers
said volume dropped during the afternoon session in mostly speculative
trading previous to the index expiration date next week.

FT  09 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Rich German harvest may be garnered
again - A look at the prospects for the Dax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As recent German banks' results have shown, there was hay a-plenty to be
made last year on the back of rising securities markets. Dresdner, for
example, yesterday reported a 122 per cent increase to DM650m in earnings
from own-account trading (now booked as 'financial transactions"). This
followed a 76 per cent rise to DM2bn, reported last week by the mighty
Deutsche Bank. And there is no reason to doubt that Commerzbank will also
roll out comparably hearty numbers when it reports next Friday.
Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, Dresdner chairman, made clear yesterday that his bottom
line was unlikely to benefit to such a dramatic extent in the current year,
although there was still plenty of life in the markets and German stock
exchange indices were expected to rise further.
Frankfurt's leading Dax index has been shifting erratically sideways since
its peak at the turn of the year, carrying with it all the investors'
expectations which drove it up so forcefully during 1993. Underlying this
movement are uncertainties generated outside Germany, largely balanced by
mounting confidence that domestic companies are through the worst. Following
their restructuring investors are now waiting for the benefits to start
showing up.
Just as Dresdner and other banks hope they will be able to rein in
provisions against bad debts this year, industrial companies appear
increasingly confident that the need for restructuring provisions will be
greatly reduced. That is one reason for expecting markedly better corporate
earnings this year.
The rest is uncertain. While external demand for German products and
services is strengthening the domestic economy is still flat overall. But
there are bright spots still attracting investor attention. Current overall
conditions are clear from the federal statistics office's national stock
market index, which rose just 1.4 per cent last month, ending almost
precisely between the high and low points of the year so far. But within
that figure some of the industrial sectors hardest hit by recession and
restructuring costs have put on a good show.
The all-embracing 'transport' index rose more than 16 per cent in the month
to the end of March, with road vehicles up 5.5 per cent. Meanwhile, the
chemicals sector went up almost 6 per cent, basic building materials
increased 9 per cent, and plastics and rubber gained 4.4 per cent.
Within the automotive sector, where most manufacturers have taken ample
advantage of improvements in US demand, BMW remains a strong favourite. It
outperformed its compatriot competitors throughout the slump, and pleased
with its bold recent purchase of Rover from British Aerospace.
Suppliers of many raw materials and basic production goods are reporting
rising orders both from home and foreign customers. Companies supplying
basic building materials are continuing to benefit from a domestic housing
boom, notably in the west, and improved orders.
While German orders figures can be unreliable, there is little doubt that
they do represent the first 'green shoots' of industrial recovery. More
evidence of 'bottom-up' growth emerged this week in reports that the steel
industry increased production 10 per cent in the first quarter. General
investment interest has also been helped by a certain amount of
'window-dressing' by increasingly active investor and public relations
managers, notably those employed by the growing list of companies preparing
to tap the capital markets. Only yesterday Dresdner Bank formally joined the
queue, unveiling a plan to pull in some DM1.2bn through a private placement
of American Depositary Rights in the US. BMW is looking for DM800m and
Porsche DM200m, while Daimler-Benz is expected to provide some details of an
issue to garner up to DM3bn at its annual press conference on Tuesday.
The banks also have a special medium-term interest in strong equity markets
in that they are once again showing interest in off-loading at least some of
their stakes in industrial concerns. Deutsche made a tentative start last
year when its reduced its 28 per cent in Daimler to 25 per cent. Deutsche
and Dresdner were among the worst to suffer when the financial community was
caught cold last year in the near-collapse of the Metallgesellschaft group.
This led to their having to mount - and largely fund - an embarrassing
DM3.4bn rescue operation.
According to most estimates, German banks hold about 10 per cent of all
outstanding shares in German companies. Mr Sarrazin said yesterday that,
counting only companies in which it held 10 per cent or more of the equity,
Dresdner had some DM12.5bn tied up in industrial shareholdings. Deutsche, on
the same basis, has around double that figure.
As the Metallgesellschaft farrago and last year's thumping earnings made by
own-account trading suggest, the banks might well feel better advised to put
the money to use in funding financial transactions - which is what some
might believe the banking business is all about.

FT  09 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Grubb optimistic on Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Marcus Grubb at Salomon Brothers in London remained optimistic on the
outlook for Tokyo, believing that Mr Hosawawa's resignation might clarify
the political situation and accelerate the political fusion process.
He has raised his year-end forecast for the Nikkei index from 20,000 to
24,000, saying that the economy appeared to be bottoming out: he expected
gains in domestic sales, housing investment and consumption during the
fourth quarter and a switch back to equities by local investors as the
outlook improved.

FT  09 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei discounts
Hosokawa resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices initially fell sharply on news that Prime Minister Morhiro
Hosokawa had indicated that he would resign, but later regained ground on
short covering and bargain hunting to close marginally higher, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index ended 44.01 higher at 19,934.99, a week's rise of 3.4
per cent. The index fell to a low of 19,520.90 in the early afternoon
following press reports that Mr Hosokawa would announce his resignation, but
later rebounded.
Mr Hosokawa said that the direct cause for his resignation was not his Y100m
loan from Sagawa Kyubin, a trucking company, or the purchase of Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone shares by his father-in-law, but possible illegal
investments made by his office staff.
Traders said that political instability had already been discounted into
stock prices, and rumours that Mr Hosokawa could resign had been circulating
over the past week.
If the ruling coalition manages to form a new government within a short time
the effect on the economy and financial markets will be small. However,
markets could be hurt if the process of choosing a new prime minister drags
on, said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities.
Volume was 530m shares against 282m. The Topix index of all first section
stocks rose 0.11 to 1,613.30 and the Nikkei 300 rose 2.55 to 296.41. Losers
led winners by 667 to 385, with 111 issues remaining unchanged. In London,
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.41 to 1,325.55.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the benchmark for investor confidence, rose
Y4,000 to Y904,000. However, stocks which had drawn buying by individual
investors recently, lost ground on profit-taking. Sumitomo Coal Mining fell
Y18 to Y966.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost ell 11.32 to 21,965.18 in volume of 17.9m
shares. Aoyama Trading, the men's suits maker, fell Y270 to Y4,860.
Roundup
With the region's decline during the first quarter many investors have
become worried that the current correction has a lot further to go.
According to the IFC, the Asian regional index has fallen back some 20 per
cent in dollar terms over the three months, compared with a slight rise in
the Latin American region.
Morgan Stanley, in a note issued at the end of March, said that it remained
overweight in Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, 'but we consider that the
correction is not over in that region'.
Regarding Hong Kong, Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley, wrote that a 5 per
cent weighting against a benchmark of just 0.5 per cent 'is based on the
long-term restructuring story of China, which we believe is still intact.'
Short-term risks remain, he added, that could well lead the Hang Seng below
the 7,000 level, including failure to renew China's MFN status and further
US interest rate rises.
'If none of these risks materialise, then the index could jump up well above
11,000 ..If some of these materialise, as seems likely, then the index could
move towards 7,000.'
HONG KONG edged higher in quiet conditions, and the prospect of political
uncertainties in Tokyo after Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation raised the
prospect that the colony could be a beneficiary if investors turn their
attention away from Japan to other regional markets.
The Hang Seng index closed up 12.30 at 9,298.22, a 3 per cent advance over
the week. Turnover fell to a meagre HKDollars 2.46bn from HKDollars 2.9bn on
Thursday, with many fund managers on holiday.
SEOUL was higher for the fourth consecutive session in a day of thin trading
after blue chips staged a technical rebound. The composite index rose 9.17
to 872.53, for a 0.6 per cent rise on the week.
Speculation that the government would soon lift an 8 per cent ceiling on
foreign holdings in Posco, the steelmaker, and Kepco, the
electricity-monopoly, boosted blue chips, although the government dismissed
the rumours as groundless.
Both Posco and Kepco, - heavily weighted in the index - went limit up,
gaining Won2,000 and Won1,000 to close at Won52,300 and Won25,200.
TAIWAN closed higher on a strong rebound in the financial sector.
The weighted index added 52.79 to 5,528.47, off an intra-session high of
5,553, and up 4 per cent across the week. Turnover was TDollars 50.5bn.
Late institutional buying in Acer, limit up at TDollars 61.50, boosted
overall sentiment.
AUSTRALIA fell back late in the day on the news from Japan. The All
Ordinaries index shed 5.4 to 2,082.0, down from an early morning high of
2,096.2.
SINGAPORE was firmer, helped by some light foreign demand, and the Straits
Times Industrial index closed 13.71 higher at 2,120.24, for a 2 per cent
rise over the week.
KUALA LUMPUR gave up early gains to close little changed as some nervous
investors liquidated positions in early afternoon trade. The composite index
finished 4.23 lower at 961.95, having seen a day's high of 970.25, and 1.9
per cent higher on the week.
BOMBAY was higher on a revival of buying by Indian financial institutions
and mutual funds which took the BSE 30-share index up 42.72 to 3,878.55.
NEW ZEALAND ended the week on a high note, with the NZSE-40 capital index up
14.79 at 2,131.67, a week's gain of 2.2 per cent.

FT  09 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan ahead as hopes rise for
new coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses featured a selection of stories yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN continued on its upward path as hopes rose for agreement on a new
government and amid continued strong liquidity from Italian funds. The Comit
index rose 10.25 to another 45 month high of 756.63, for a weekly rise of
2.9 per cent.
Fiat, which gained market share and saw car sales rise in March, added
another L198 to L6,235, for a two day rise of 7.7 per cent amid continued
rumours it will sell its stake in Toro, the insurance subsidiary. Toro
slipped L15 to L33,850.
Assitalia, the insurance group, surged L3,729 or 22.3 per cent to L20,417 on
speculation that Ina, the state owned parent company, will buy back shares
ahead of its planned privatisation later in the year
Ferruzzi slid L118 or 5.6 per cent to L1,961, in response to news that the
board will will meet on Monday to decide on the amount for a fresh capital
call. Cir, Mr Carlo de Benedetti's industrial holding company, fell L26 to
L2,509 in response to results and news that the company is also launching a
capital increase.
Premafin, the main industrial holding of the industrialist Mr Salvatore
Ligresti, rose L258 or 12 per cent to L2,400 after creditor banks reached a
debt accord. The group, along with others in construction, has risen sharply
in recent sessions on hopes a right-wing government will help the building
sector.
ZURICH finished ahead but off its best levels of the day amid divided
opinions on the outlook. Some investors worry that the market is still
vulnerable to a set back on Wall Street while others are concentrating on
the prospects for lower domestic interest rates. The SMI index added 12.5 to
2,873, taking the advance over the week to 2.8 per cent.
Banks and some cyclicals continued to propel the market higher. UBS bearers
rose SFr20 to SFr1,258, while Alusuisse bearers added SFr22 to SFr658,
taking their cumulative rise on the week to 6.3 per cent.
Swissair overcame weakness seen earlier in the week after results, putting
on SFr50 or 6.6 per cent to SFr800 on a round of profit-taking.
PARIS dipped slightly in a generally quiet, pre-weekend session. The CAC-40
index lost 4.80 to 2,114.77, showing a week's gain of 1.6 per cent.
Synthelabo, the pharmaceutical group, was one of the star performers,
gaining FFr11.20 or 5.7 per cent to FFr207 in reaction to better than
expected results, and a rash of analysts' buy notes.
In contrast, Cap Gemini Sogeti fell 5 per cent, off FFr9.80 to FFr186.40, in
reaction to Thursday's news that it planned a rights issue.
AMSTERDAM continued to feature Royal Dutch, which rose for the third
consecutive session helped by strong institutional support from the UK. The
shares gained Fl 4.40 to Fl 200.80, bringing its rise on the week to 5.8 per
cent.
Analysts noted that both Shell and Royal Dutch have been helped by short
covering following the bounce in the oil price over the Easter period, while
there were reports yesterday that one broker had issued an upgrade.
The AEX index added 2.67 to 415.59, to register a week's rise of 3 per cent.

FT  09 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Prudential boost
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The life assurance sector included a number of strong performers, notably
Prudential, up 3 at 320p and Legal &amp; General, up 8 at 473p. The latter were
boosted by the recent recommendation from BZW, which rates the stock as its
favourite in a sector offering a generous 35 per cent yield premium to the
market and superior dividend prospects.
Prudential's shares were principally driven by a recommendation from Hoare
Govett who said the stock had suffered too much from investor worries about
tighter regulation, alleged mis-selling of personal pensions and rather
disappointing 1993 new business figures. Hoare said investors should focus
instead on above-average dividend prospects following the cost-reduction
programme, the re-shaping of the group's UK field force and strong growth in
sales via intermediaries. 'The prospective yield of 5.7 per cent is
unwarranted for a company that has grown its dividend since 1980 twice as
fast as that of the average British company,' Hoare concluded.
Shell Transport, which has lagged behind BP in the general upsurge in oil
shares over the past week or so, outpaced the latter as a more positive view
of the stock uncovered a stock shortage among London's marketmakers.
At the close Shell, were 14 higher at 696p, having reached 699p earlier in
the session. UBS, the stockbroker, was said to have upgraded its Shell
forecast and triggered the early demand. SG Warburg was also positive on the
sector.
BP gained 2 to 373p but Burmah Castrol, reporting on Monday, slipped 11 to
815p. Enterprise was the pick of the exploration and production stocks,
advancing 11 more to 439p.
A big bought deal in Spring Ram, the bathrooms and kitchens group, left the
company the heaviest traded stock on the London market with more than 63m
shares changing hands.
Shortly after the market closed it was announced that Lazard Freres Asset
Management had sold 34.2m Spring Ram shares, made up of 29.4m 'old' shares
and the rest in 'new' stock from the rights issue. The 29.4m was sold to BZW
at 55 3/4 p and placed by the investment bank at 56 1/2 p.
Kleinwort Benson was said to have been largely responsible for the good
showing by Whitbread, which outperformed the sector to close 6 higher at
523p. Kleinwort said it expected a substantial re-rating to accompany
Whitbread's results in May. Recent disposals have left Whitbread with the
strongest balance sheet, healthiest free cash flow and best earnings growth
potential of the big brewers, according to the broker.
Board room changes at components company Laird Group, which also reported an
increase in both profits and the dividend sent the shares soaring 19 to
388p. Mr Sandy Morris at NatWest Securities believes it to be 'the best
quality stock in the sector.'
Industrial engineering group Triplex Lloyd tumbled after warning of a Pounds
3m loss for the year to March 1994. The shares were down 18 at worst before
steadying to finish 13 lower at 133p.
Broker recommendations made earlier in the week continued to help GKN and
the shares added another 4 to 580p.
Early weakness in New York imposed pressure on internationally traded stocks
with hard-hit Glaxo slipping 9 to 604p on turnover of 5.2m after some heavy
institutional selling by one US house, Reuters Holdings shedding 22 to 1927p
and Zeneca easing 4 to 729p. SmithKline Beecham lost 5 at 370p in the 'A's
in spite of positive news on its drug pipeline.
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome rebounded from earlier falls as analysts
decided that the full text of the Anglo-French Concorde study on AZT carried
no new damaging information bout the anti-Aids treatment. The company
insisted the full report showed that AZT did delay the onset of AIDS in
symptom free adults. The shares, 11 down at worst closed 2 off at 555p.
Turnover in business services group BET rose to 8m and the shares shed 5 to
120p, after James Capel was reported to have downgraded profit expectations.
Conglomerate Trafalgar House's ordinary shares closed 4 ahead at 104p as
Robert Fleming highlighted the attractions of the convertible stock. Mr
Robert Gibson at the broker said: 'They offer a relatively risk free 6 per
cent yield with only a small premium over the ordinary stock.' The
convertible shares gained 6 1/4 to 132 1/4 p.

FT  09 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Waters sink lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Heavy selling of the utilities sectors picked up yesterday with water stocks
the latest casualties. It followed the big sell-off in the generators and
regional electricity stocks on Thursday when regulatory fears drove the
sector down 2.6 per cent.
Dealers said it was the market's biggest and most influential broking firms
that were behind the slide in share prices. UBS was said to have got the
ball rolling in mid-week, adopting a negative view of the 'recs'. NatWest
Securities said: 'Some of the recs may already be discounting an optimistic
outcome from their regulatory review.'
Water stocks were unsettled yesterday by news that SG Warburg, long-term and
highly influential bull of the sector, had shifted its stance from
over-weight to neutral for the second quarter. Warburg said; 'The
combination of mounting regulatory uncertainty coupled with an uncertain
market context regarding the outlook for inflation, base rates and bond
yields will prevent any sector outperformance over what is certain to be a
difficult period through to the end of July at least. The water industry
regulator, Ofwat, is scheduled to announce new price controls towards the
end of July.
Anglian Water dropped 19 to 498p, Severn Trent 18 to 534p, Thames 17 to 496p
and North West 9 to 513p.
Eastern Electricity tumbled to 643p before ending the session 17 lower at
646p, while Southern closed 8 down at 631p. Talk of hefty US selling lowered
PowerGen 18 to 489p.

FT  09 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Weak close to another erratic trading
session - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those hoping for a significant recovery in the UK market from its pre-Easter
setback were disappointed as the equity trading account closed yesterday.
Unsettled towards the close by a renewed setback in British government
bonds, the FT-SE Index, having abandoned an early gain of 9 points, ended
with a loss of 8.2 at 3,120.8. There was little immediate response, however,
to the pending political developments in Japan.
An increase of around 23 per cent in Seaq volume, although swollen by a
large deal in a single stock, was another negative indicator. Trading volume
rose sharply at the beginning of this week as end of UK tax-year deals were
unwound. But now that the new tax year has opened and investment activity
has returned to normal, higher volume has signalled a weaker market,
underlining investment nervousness.
The Footsie has lost around 8 points over the two-week account in the equity
market which closed last night. But this masks a sharper fall in the week
preceding Easter when the Footsie lost more than one per cent as investors
shied away on nervousness that economic data from the US might reinforce
fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy, perhaps even by raising
the discount rate.
Losses of as much as  3/4 point in long-dated UK government bonds, together
with falls of around  5/32 in the short dates, underlined the continuing
worries over both long-term inflation and the near-term prospects for
domestic interest rates. The losses contrasted with firmness in sterling.
London appeared unimpressed by Wall Street's overnight gains, which were
carried through in early trading in the early part of the New York session.
Market strategists seemed to be recovering their collective nerve after
trimming near term Footsie predictions to around 2,800 in the wake of Mr
Nicholas Knight, the Nomura Research guru who upset the markets over Easter.
At Strauss Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett stuck by predictions that the Footsie
will end the year around 3,250-3,500, commenting that long-term funds could
be buyers at this level.
SG Warburg is now also looking for a year-end Footsie figure of 3,500, but
says that this depends on two significant factors; that inflation remains
benign and that equity dividends are 'left alone' in the November Budget.
Dividends, boosted recently by good news from a number of leading companies,
are now 10 per cent higher in aggregate on the year, according to Hoare
Govett, the UK broking house.
Once again, market indices were helped by strength in the oil sector, where
the blue chip stocks continued to attract good support. But consumer sectors
remained out of favour as uncertainty over the outlook for a consumer-led
recovery in the UK kept investors on the sidelines.
With pharmaceuticals, banks, food manufacturers and many other sectors
lacking support, the Footsie index had no lack of negative features. Market
strategists sounded cautious regarding the near term outlook for the stock
market. Hopes for a significant cut in German interest rates must await next
week's meeting of the Bundesbank policy council. In the meantime, investors
will remain nervous of any sudden action by the US Federal Reserve, despite
the general acceptance of the Fed's policy of tightening credit policies.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The derivatives sector had one of its most quiet days in recent sessions as
the equity account drew to a close.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 finished at 3,121, down 16 on its
previous close and around 5 points below its estimated fair value premium.
Volume at 7,869 was just over half of Thursday's total. The Liffe FT-SE Mid
250 finished at 3,780 on volume of 45 lots.
It was also a dull day in traded options. Turnover was 21,766 contracts of
which 8,330 was in the FT-SE 100. BAT was the busiest stock option at 1,091
lots.

FT  09 APR 94 / Markets Report: Yen stays firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The yen traded steadily on foreign exchanges yesterday after Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, announced his resignation, writes
Philip Gawith.
The Japanese currency was initially sold heavily, falling to a low of
Y105.85 against the dollar. It later recovered to Y104.68, before slipping
back to close at Y105.210, down from Thursday's close of Y104.825.
Analysts were not surprised by the yen's relative stability, saying the
resignation sent an ambiguous signal to the market. Political instability is
normally bad for a currency, but in the case of the yen this deduction
cannot be so easily made.
Elsewhere markets were fairly quiet. 'There was more attention to Moorcroft
Boy than Dollar/Mark,' one dealer told Reuters, referring to a horse running
in today's Grand National, Britain's leading racing event.
Japan is not expected to be without a prime minister for long. With no party
wanting an early election, the odds seem to favour the appointment of Mr
Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister and former finance minister, as a successor.
The change is also not expected to herald any major changes in policy.
In a research note the Industrial Bank of Japan predicted that Japan's
markets will only react adversely if the crisis becomes drawn out or an
election is called.
Two other issues are likely to have a bearing on the yen: the passage of the
budget and the US-Japan trade dispute.
Until the budget is passed - the opposition LDP blocked its passage to put
pressure on Mr Hosokawa - the Y15.25trn fiscal stimulus package can not be
implemented. If the package, seen as necessary to boost the flagging
economy, is not passed, this could exert downward pressure on the Nikkei
index and the yen.
More important will be the resolution of the trade dispute. Mr Carl
Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in New York, said the
priority of the Clinton administration would probably be progress in the
framework trade talks aimed at curbing Japan's trade surplus with the US.
'If there are no great initiatives put on the table quickly to restart the
framework talks, we believe the Clinton people will start talking the dollar
cheaper as soon as next week,' he said.
The dollar was little changed against the D-Mark, closing at Dollars 1.7134
from Dollars 1.7181 on Thursday.
The D-Mark had a mixed day in Europe, trading in fairly narrow ranges in the
absence of new developments. Against the French franc, it closed in London
at FFr3.427 from FFr3.426 on Saturday.
The main movement came again from the lira which continues to prosper on
post-election optimism. It closed at L950.9 from L954 on Thursday.
The recent rally of the peseta ended as it fell back to Pta80.85 from
Pta80.75 against the D-Mark. The escudo, under pressure recently, finished
at Es101.7 from Es101.5.
Sterling maintained its firmer tone, finishing higher against the D-Mark at
DM2.5265 from DM2.5204. It was slightly up against the dollar, at Dollars
1.4745 from Dollars 1.467.
The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 650m shortage in the discount market by
providing a similar injection of liquidity.

FT  09 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Funds
drive up coffee futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London robusta coffee futures were driven to fresh four-year highs this week
as investment fund buyers latched on to growing concerns about nearby
availability. But dealers were well aware that the speculative nature of the
rise meant that the bubble could burst at any moment.
The market peaked on Thursday, when the July delivery position reached
Dollars 1,450 a tonne. By yesterday's close it had eased to Dollars 1,436,
up Dollars 73 on the week.
Buyers were encouraged by rumours that the Ivory Coast might halt coffee and
cocoa exports unless shippers paid a back-dated export tax. And the advance
was underpinned by a report from London broker ED &amp; F. Man warning that
consumer stocks of robusta coffee - the coarser type grown mainly in Africa
 -had become uncomfortably low, reflecting the success of the export
retention scheme producers have been operating since October. At the end of
February these stocks stood at 16.9m bags (60kg each), down 3.3m from a year
earlier, Man estimat-ed.
Apart from driving prices higher across the board, supply worries resulted
in the establishment this week of a sizeable premium, or 'backwardation',
for the prompt May delivery position at the London Commodity Exchange. At
yesterday's close the premium stood at Dollars 21 a tonne over the July
contract, which a week earlier had itself been commanding a Dollars 3
premium.
At the London Metal Exchange the recent shake-out in copper prices continued
until support was found late in the week. The three months position, which
had touched Dollars 1,873 a tonne at one stage, closed yesterday at Dollars
1,889.25, up Dollars 1 on balance. There was disappointment, however, that
news of another sharp drawdown from LME warehouse stocks had not enabled the
contract to regain its foothold above Dollars 1,900.
In contrast the aluminium market seemed to take great comfort yesterday from
a second consecutive stocks cut that took the drawdown over the week to
11,525 tonnes. Talk of possible output reductions by producers in the Urals,
where power cuts are planned, gave further encouragement to buyers and the
three months price gained Dollars 19 on the day to close at Dollars 1,319.50
a tonne. That represented a net gain of Dollars 5 on the week and was
Dollars 30.50 above the low point reached on Thursday morning.
Thursday had also seen the low for lead, which touched a four-month low of
Dollars 435 a tonne in the three months position. But investors then decided
that the markets fundamentals did not justify such a low price and by
yesterday's close it was back at Dollars 452.75 a tonne, down a relatively
modest Dollars 5 on the week.
The oil market was also defying fundamentals this week, according to some
analysts. An investment fund-driven price jump in New York on Monday, was
echoed at London's International Petroleum Exchange on Tuesday when traders
returned after the Easter holiday. North Sea Brent crude prices were quickly
into the heady regions above Dollars 14 a barrel and, to the surprise of
many observers, held most of their gains for the rest of the week.
The only explanation most analysts could offer was that the market was
suffering from a 'guilt syndrome' after over-reacting on the downside to the
failure of the Organisation of Oil Producing Countries to agree on a
reduction in its output ceiling at its recent ministerial meeting.

Suzuki's struggling Spanish subsidiary Santana Motor will present its
viability plan to unions and the Andalusian government on Monday, Reuter
reports from Madrid.
The meeting will centre on Suzuki's proposal to shed two thirds of the
workforce to keep the southern Spanish plant going. The company wants its
workers to agree to the plan, and the regional government to help with a
capital injection.
Workers, 2,000 of whom have been temporarily laid off, have blocked the
factory gates at Linares for nearly two months.
Suzuki says it cannot pay April salaries unless they let out some of the
plant's finished vehicles.

FT  09 APR 94 / International Company News: Dresdner Bank confident on
current-year profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at Dresdner Bank are continuing to increase after a 24 per cent
surge to DM2.04bn (Dollars 1.19bn) in operating earnings last year, Mr
Jurgen Sarrazin, group chairman, said yesterday.
Reporting a double-digit rise in income for the first two months, he
forecast a satisfactory result for the full year after an 'especially
successful' 1993.
Mr Sarrazin also announced plans for a more international distribution of
the group's shares. As expected, he unveiled a project to raise an estimated
DM1.2bn through a private placing of American depositary receipts with US
institutions.
Dresdner was the first German bank to take this route, which did not oblige
it to adopt more transparent US accounting and reporting practices, he said.
The new paper would be priced at around the current share price, he added.
Shareholders would also be asked at the annual meeting on May 20 to approve
a further DM200m authorised capital to be issued as convertible bonds or
options by the bank's foreign subsidiaries.
In common with other domestic banks, Dresdner markedly increased provisions
against bad debts last year: a 47 per cent increase took the total to
DM1.77bn. The bank had been severely affected by the DM3.4bn rescue of
Metallgesellschaft, but all provisions and costs had been included in the
1993 results, Mr Sarrazin said.
Following the rescue Dresdner's stake in the metals, mining and engineering
group had risen to 14 per cent from 12.6 per cent.
Reviewing prospects for the current year, Mr Sarrazin said he expected
developments to be 'calm'. Demand for financing for exports and construction
would rise more strongly, with a more modest increase in calls for
investment loans from corporate customers.
He hoped increased industrial production would expand, increasing plant
utilisation rates and helping restore domestic customers' financial
stability. This would enable the bank to scale down risk-provisioning in the
current year.
Personal business would suffer because falling real incomes would lead to
lower savings and less demand for loans for large purchases. While he did
not expect an absolute decline in this area, growth rates would certainly
shrink.
Mr Sarrazin also expected own-account trading to continue to improve on the
back of rising German stock markets, although he indicated that developments
would be less dramatic than in 1993. Last year's profits from financial
transactions increased 122 per cent to DM650m.
Net commission income rose 29 per cent to DM3.16bn, interest earnings
increased 9.6 per cent to DM6.27bn, and pre-tax profits climbed 17 per cent
to DM1.83bn.
As announced earlier this week, the 1993 dividend was raised DM1.50 to
DM13.50.

cuts plan

Two key planks in a SKr3bn cost-cutting programme were put into place by
Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) yesterday when it announced agreements on
big cuts in pilot numbers and cabin staff.
The airline said up to 300 pilots would lose their jobs, saving about
SKr310m in wages and administration costs.
It hoped numbers would fall through voluntary early retirement, unpaid
leave, and part-time work, so that staff would not have to be dismissed. It
expects to reach its target within three years.
The airline said about 680 cabin jobs would also disappear to achieve
SKr410m in savings. The programme involves reduced crewing levels, fewer
days off, and a wage freeze until next March.
Both measures have been agreed with staff, although final details have still
to be worked out.
In total, SAS is cutting 2,900 jobs, one in seven of its workforce, to slash
costs by SKr3bn by the middle of next year. It aims to return to profit this
year, after four consecutive years in the red. Last year the airline made a
SKr492m (Dollars 62.3m) pre-tax loss.

FT  09 APR 94 / International Company News: De Benedetti to raise L650bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Italian industrialist, yesterday announced plans
to raise more than L650bn (Dollars 396.3m) at his two main Italian holding
companies - Cofide and Cir - through a rights issue and a convertible bond
issue.
In the last 48 hours, Mr De Benedetti has revealed plans which could net
more than Dollars 850m in new funds for French and Italian companies in
which his family has an interest.
In the case of Cofide and Cir, a spokesman said the cash could be used for a
new expansion drive, as the Italian and European economies emerge from
recession.
On Thursday, Olivetti, the Italian computer group in which Cir has a large
stake, announced plans to raise between L500bn and L600bn through a
convertible bond issue, to help finance its share in a new mobile telephones
venture. Cerus, the French holding company, 49 per cent of which is
controlled by Cir, also proposed a rights issue on Thursday, aimed at
raising FFr858m (Dollars 147.2m) to strengthen its balance sheet.
Mr De Benedetti announced yesterday's fund-raising proposals, which have to
be approved by shareholders later this month or in early May, on the back of
results showing that both Cofide and Cir returned to profit in 1993.
Cofide, the ultimate holding company for the De Benedetti family's
interests, including Cir, reported a net profit of L3.2bn, against a loss of
L281bn in 1992. The group is to seek approval to raise up to L154.2bn, with
an issue of 154.2m new shares at nominal value of L1,000 each. Most will be
offered to existing shareholders on the basis of one for every four held,
but 12.2m will be reserved for the exercise of warrants.
Cir, which groups stakes in Olivetti and Cerus, as well as Italian
publishing and industrial companies, recorded net profits of L16bn in 1993,
against a loss of L540bn in 1992.
Cir pointed out that apart from Olivetti, which hopes to break even at
operating level in 1994, all its industrial holdings made a positive
contribution to 1993 results. It added that its debt-to-equity ratio of 4
per cent, compared with 21 per cent at end-1992, made it financially one of
the most solid companies on the market.
The company plans to issue bonds convertible into Cir shares. The final
price has yet to be set, but the eventual issue should raise between L500bn
and L600bn for Cir.
Mr De Benedetti's attempts to raise funds coincide with a post-election
surge in activity on the Italian stock market. Before the Cir and Cofide
announcements, the Milan stock market indices recorded new highs for the
year.

posting deficit

<TEXT>
Lenzing, the world's leading producer of viscose fibre, yesterday reported
higher sales for 1993 but will post a Sch203.1m (Dollars 16.8m) deficit due
to extraordinary losses at its Glanzstoff unit.
Sales for the group, which has production facilities in the US, Indonesia,
Brazil and Austria, rose 9.5 per cent to Sch8.74bn (Dollars 740m) from
Sch7.98bn in 1992. Profits from ordinary business, including tax on income,
was Sch115.4m, but it will post a net deficit because the losses at the
Glanzstoff plant.
The management board is proposing to cut the dividend to Sch5 a share from
Sch16.
The Glanzstoff subsidiary was badly hit by the downturn in the European
motor industry, which caused a sharp decline in orders for viscose tyre
reinforcing materials during the second half of last year. Production will
be closed down later this year, and the site sold or rented. As a result of
the necessary write-offs Glanzstoff posted a net loss of Sch396.9m.
Sales at Lenzing Austria were little changed at Sch3.2bn, though sales
improved at the main subsidiaries. Lenzing's US unit increased its market
share to more than 40 per cent with sales of Sch1.4bn.

FT  09 APR 94 / International Company News: A whiff of austerity at
Tabacalera - Chairman Pedro Perez is going back to basics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As secretary of state for the economy Mr Pedro Perez struggled for five
years to reduce the public deficit, to increase Spain's competitiveness and
to curb tax evasion. Since last October Mr Perez has been conducting a
similar battle as chairman of Tabacalera, the government-controlled
manufacturer and monopoly distributor of tobacco.
Tabacalera's balance sheet is not unlike what Spain's has looked like since
the domestic economy dipped into recession two years ago. Profits at the
tobacco group's parent company tumbled by 46 per cent to Pta10.7bn (Dollars
78.6m) in 1993. Mr Perez is thus again fully involved in cutting costs, in
lifting productivity and combatting tobacco smugglers.
If all goes to plan, Mr Perez expects profits at Tabacalera, of which the
government holds 52 per cent and foreign investors 38 per cent, to recover
by 30 per cent this year. Last month the board approved a 45 per cent
dividend cut in line with the 1993 profit shortfall.
'So far Perez is looking good. He is creating a sense of austerity at
Tabacalera and that is new,' says Mr Joaquin Tamames, senior partner at
Axel, the Madrid investment bank. The dividend cut was welcomed as
'realistic'.
Tabacalera expects to reduce operating costs by 10 per cent this year,
partly by slashing sponsorship expenditure and partly by personnel cuts.
Victims of the austerity programme range from the ocean-going yacht Fortuna
(a Tabacalera brand), which was forced to pull out of the round-the-world
race, to a top symphony orchestra festival in Madrid which has been
cancelled following a ruthless cut to Pta250m from Pta1.2bn in the annual
budget of Tabacalera's arts foundation.
Tabacalera's labour force, which stood at 8,000 when Mr Perez took over at
the group, is likely to be reduced by more than 1,300 in the medium-term. By
the end of March almost 500 had accepted voluntary redundancy terms
negotiated by Mr Perez with the unions last November.
Tabacalera's chairman has still not tackled the issue of scaling down the 13
production plants that the group operates in Spain. But he is anxious to
make use of the new labour regulations that permit companies to enforce
geographical and functional mobility on their employees.
The clampdown on tobacco smuggling, following the introduction of
legislation at the end of last year to allow stronger policing and heavier
fines, should have at least as important an impact on the 1994 margin as
will the cost cuts.
Tabacalera estimates that some 20 per cent of the high quality brand tobacco
 -Winston and Marlboro - acquired in Spain last year was smuggled and that
contraband increased by more than 40 per cent between 1992 and 1993.
Tabacalera's sales fell overall by 7 per cent last year and this was not
because Spaniards, who have the highest per capita cigarette consumption in
the EU, were smoking a lot less.
The contraband legislation appears to have delivered startling results. In
January and February this year Tabacalera's sales were up 7.3 per cent on
the first two months of 1993 and sales of Winston and Marlboro shot up by
22.6 per cent.
'If sales continue to climb, by the summer we will be seeing a clear change
in the trend with the smugglers on the retreat,' says Mr Pedro Arbex, a
tobacco industry analyst at Madrid brokers Benito y Monjardin.
The final plank of Mr Perez's platform in his first year as chairman has a
somewhat deja vu air to it, as it has to do with the 'back to the core
tobacco business' strategy that has been promised off and on since 1991 by
his previous two predecessors. This time the chances are that Mr Perez will
succeed in pushing the policy through.
This is in part because Mr Perez inherits Tabacalera's Pta17.25bn disposal
last July of 50 per cent of its food subsidiary, Royal Brands, to RJR
Nabisco of the US. Should the US group take up its option to buy Royal
Brands outright in March next year, Tabacalera will be forced to concentrate
fully on its tobacco business and will have the cash at hand to do so
productively.
It is also because Mr Perez has completed complex negotiations with
Cubatabaco, the Cuban government's tobacco business, which, by virtue of the
Spanish company's partial financing of tobacco processing in Cuba, will gain
Tabacalera a near monopoly of Cuban cigars in Europe.
Mr Perez, who was almost a chain smoker when he was a politician but now
sticks to Havanas, plans several more 'core tobacco business' initiatives
for the European market before the year is out. He is also preparing joint
ventures aimed at eastern Europe and east Asia, but is keeping his cards
close to his chest.

FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News - The AGM Season: Anxieties, butterflies and
parachute jumping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of Reuters and a veteran of annual meetings,
likens AGMs to jumping from a plane. 'When you have done it and landed, then
it is no problem, but every time might be the last,' the former parachutist
says.
Some might think Sir Christopher has less cause to feel anxious than many
others who face shareholders every year. Yet even he finds AGMs 'slightly
anxious' occasions. 'There is a vaguely confrontational feel about the
thing,' he says.
The butterflies are common, although in some cases they may be described
rather differently. 'I love AGMs, I really love them,' says Mr David James,
the company doctor and chairman of Lep who makes a habit of taking on posts
where the AGMs are inevitably confrontational. 'They are great adrenalin
developers.'
Most chairmen will spend a considerable amount of time preparing for the
meetings. Sir Christopher's schedule calls for a detailed examination of the
report and accounts, all the press announcements made during the year, and a
review of the letters sent in by shareholders. Mr James demands a dress
rehearsal at his companies, which include the board, financial advisers and
lawyers.
Yet no company can prepare for the variety of questions which may be thrown
at the board. At Barclays, one shareholder demanded to know why there had
not been enough Easter eggs to pass out to all the customers waiting in the
queue at his local branch. The eggs ran out just before they got to him.
Such questions often seem to dominate AGMs, leaving many chairmen with the
private belief that the meetings accomplish little. 'Often the questions
that are asked are not the important ones which face the business,' says one
chairman of a struggling company. 'They are about trivia.'
The fact that institutions seem to share this sentiment almost ensures that
in many cases the main issues receive scant attention. 'If they would come
and ask about the really important issues that face a company, that would
create a better balanced meeting,' the chairman says.
There are some companies where shareholders never ask questions, such as at
the shoe company Fii where the formal part of the AGM rarely lasts more than
15 minutes. In fact, shareholders have been known to bring stop-watches to
the meetings to see whether the chairman, Mr Monty Sumray, can beat his
record time of less than two minutes.
Publicly and privately, almost all chairmen will say that AGMs are an
important part of corporate governance.
'Shareholders should have the right to question directors providing they use
the AGM to ask about the company and not for political matters,' says Mr
Andrew Buxton of Barclays. 'It gives them a way of voicing their concerns.'
For many, the most useful part of the meeting is when the business is
concluded, and shareholders seek out the board personally.

afternoon?

<TEXT>
The atmosphere was tense. Shareholders were spoiling for a fight after the
announcement of heavy losses and the board knew it. As the chairman came to
call for questions from the floor, the directors looked down nervously at
their notes.
The well-dressed woman sitting in the front row was called on first, and the
tension became almost tangible. 'Can you tell me Mr Chairman,' demanded a
baritone voice which left no doubts that first impressions can be
misleading. 'Can you tell me why your credit card department will not deal
with my sex shop?'
Such stories are rife in the lore of general meetings. The cast of
characters range from the AGM-goers who turn up with plastic bags into which
they tip trays of sandwiches, to political protestors such as those at
Thursday's Lloyd's Bank meeting. Several of the most energetic demonstrators
were carried out and dumped on the street.
Barclays has occasionally been saved such embarrassment in the past, for
example when a shareholder decided to take matters into her own hands.
Growing increasingly tired of a diatribe against loans to South Africa from
the man sitting in front of her, the woman stood up and beat him over the
head with her handbag. In the end, the dissident was forced to appeal to the
chair for protection.
Then again, there is the faithful shareholder who turns up every year to ask
just one question. At North Sea Assets, the energy industry services
supplier, the chairman greets her by name.
Private shareholders are notorious for making the most unusual criticisms,
which even the most diligent board could not predict, such as the chivalrous
Titaghur investor, who objected to the use of the word 'pee' to define the
currency in which dividends were paid.
Yet not all the surprises come from the floor. Mr Gerald Ratner, the former
head of the jewellery chain now known as Signet, found the experience of
facing angry shareholders so intimidating that he hired security guards for
one AGM who enthusiastically deflected any approaches as he left.
Mr George Walker, former head of the leisure group Brent Walker, also caused
comment when he resigned from the board by unexpectedly joining the
audience.
Then there are the meetings where no one turns up. 'The board loves it,'
says one PR who helps to organise AGMs. 'There are no difficult questions,
which means they can go off for lunch early.'

FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News - The AGM Season: Organisers go for
audio-visual aids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Annual meetings are seldom so dramatic as that held recently by NFC, which
was brought to life by a bust-up between the former chairman of the
transport and logistics group and his successor.
Sir Peter Thompson, who in 1982 led an employee buy-out of the former
National Freight Consortium, accused the board of putting the group's
traditional values at risk - a charge Mr James Watson, the present chairman,
vigorously denied.
The 1,100 shareholders who attended the Wembley meeting had no difficulty in
following the argument. Although Sir Peter spoke from the floor, close-up
images of his face were relayed to huge video screens above the platform -
and shareholders could also watch reaction shots of Mr Watson and the rest
of the board as Sir Peter spoke.
NFC said: 'People in the audience are used to watching the television news,
and if you don't come up to that standard, they feel it is pretty hick.'
This use of the latest audio-visual techniques continued a long-standing NFC
tradition of seeking to make its huge AGMs relevant to employee
shareholders, many of whom have no other contact with the world of
investment.
When in 1988 NFC took the decision to seek a stock market flotation, the
crucial AGM was held in Blackpool and attended by more than 4,000 people.
The company laid on a circus for the employees' children, a discotheque and,
for its pensioners, a tea dance.
NFC shareholders also see on screen a summary of all proposals as they vote.
The only criticism made of this at the last AGM was that the screens should
show the full text of motions.
Cable and Wireless, the international telecommunications group, has for the
last two years paid about Pounds 50,000 for a 45-minute edited version of
its AGM to be broadcast on BBC in the early hours. Details are given in the
group's annual report of timing and codes, allowing shareholders and
employees to set their videos and watch at their leisure. It started doing
this instead of a series of regional road-shows, which could tie up senior
directors for long periods.

FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News - The AGM Season: Where attendance levels
focus on the freebies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Diverting corporate history is not always uppermost in the minds of those
regular attenders of annual meetings. As one seasoned organiser said: 'The
bulk are there for the love of the sound of their own voice, or a free
sandwich.'
The AGM is like a class reunion, particularly for the retired employees who
attend. While there may be colourful speeches and aggressive questioning,
the emphasis remains primarily on presentation and consumption.
In some cases, the actual purpose is lost. One listed company had large
attendances for several years, attracted by a buffet and drinks. But last
year, directors were faced with an almost empty auditorium, after the
registrars decided to check on arrivals and found that genuine shareholders
were a significant minority.
'You can usually gauge the attendance level of an AGM by the size of the
lunch or the gifts', said one cynical PR executive.
However, there are changes afoot. The recession has affected the quality of
free gifts, such as key rings and pens, at the same time as it has hit
corporate confidence. In post-Cadbury Britain, shareholders are therefore
taking the formal portion of the meeting more seriously.
Troubled industrial giants, such as British Aerospace and Trafalgar House,
have attracted crowds out of proportion to their hospitality, reflecting
concern over chequered management performance.
'The question and answer sessions are getting longer, and while AGM's are
getting more stagey, there are fewer shareholders coming along just for the
vol-au-vents and Chablis,' said Mr Stuart Bell, research director at
Pensions and Investment Research Consultants.
Shareholders at the recent Lonrho and BAe AGM's managed to lead a vociferous
and coherent opposition to management policy.
But since the power of small shareholders is limited - proxy votes vastly
outstripped attempted people power at Lonrho and BAe - such drama is
generally only the icing, and attention is more focused on the quality of
the cake.
For these regulars, 60 seconds on the microphone, a glass of wine, and a
gift of a pen or a food pack, must remain sufficient justification for their
annual trip to the corporate pantomime.
Food and drink-related companies therefore remain the traditional
crowd-pullers. Guinness, for example, has created a popular formula of
plenty of good food, followed by a pack of goodies in a black velvet bag.
At last year's Tomkins AGM, the mass of shareholders were less inclined to
question management on its running of the Ranks Hovis McDougall business,
and more focused on Ranks' legendary annual gift packs.
The true test for the cynics will be the Tomkins turn-out in September. The
company decided last year that it should be delivering earnings per share
rather than RHM hand-out's, and it gave out nothing. It is quite possible
that the smaller shareholders will disagree.

FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News - The AGM Season: Power of the shareholder
vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are the meetings that company chairmen love to hate. As the annual
meeting season gets under way FT writers take a serious look at
shareholders' rights and meeting room technology, and a more light-hearted
view of the folklore, the perks and the colour As the season for quoted
companies' annual meetings gets under way there have been renewed calls for
a widening of shareholders' powers to influence the conduct of the meetings.
The shareholders' lobby groups have also found an influential ally in the
form of Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore, the fund management group. He
recently appealed for the resuscitation of the annual meeting to 'restore it
to its rightful place as the nexus of shareholder and management contact'.
Yet shareholders' powers are already considerable and for many managements
that nexus has become distinctly uncomfortable.
Already in the current season disgruntled shareholders have given a rough
ride to the boards of Lonrho and BP.
However, these instances remain the exception and even fewer annual meetings
live up to the ideal of informed discussion between owners and managers.
That is partly because few of the owners fully understand their rights.
These are a complex amalgam of statutory obligations under the Companies
Act, the rules of the Stock Exchange's Yellow Book and the companies' own
Articles of Association.
The latter vary widely though all are based on a model in the Companies Act
which sets the minimum requirements. When considering taking action
shareholders therefore need to consult the latest Articles of the company,
but the accompanying box sets out their basic rights.
A growing number of companies are responding to investor pressure by
extending shareholder rights. Legal &amp; General and Rank have both agreed to
put the question of political donations to the vote at the annual meeting.
And companies trying to reverse the process have found it difficult to swim
against the tide.
Last year Hanson proposed changes to its Articles which would have
eliminated the right of shareholders to nominate a director to the board
unless backers represented at least 10 per cent of the vote. Shareholders
would also have lost the right to propose amendments to resolutions at the
meeting unless they represented 5 per cent of the share capital.
However, Hanson withdrew the proposed changes following shareholder
opposition orchestrated by Pensions Investment Research Consultants, which
advises pension funds on corporate governance.
Mr Stuart Bell, PIRC's research director, argues that the shortcomings of
AGMs are as much the fault of shareholders as of their directors. 'In the
past shareholders didn't bother to consider their rights, though meetings
have been getting slightly better recently.'
Nonetheless, PIRC also believes that shareholders' rights need to be
extended to encourage active participation.
'The rights for shareholders to be involved in agenda setting by proposing
resolutions are much too restrictive,' says Mr Bell. 'The problem at the
moment is that the agenda is set entirely by directors. If it is not
relevant to shareholders the AGM becomes a dull exercise in public relations
by the company.'
PIRC is calling for the reduction in the number of shares required to
propose a resolution to just 100, held for more than a year. It is also
proposing that the costs of circulating shareholder resolutions be borne by
the company, a suggestion strongly backed by the UK Shareholders'
Association.
Mr Donald Butcher, chairman, says: 'For a large company the cost is quoted
at up to Pounds 10,000. If as many as 100 members wish to circulate a
resolution then it is quite reasonable that it should be at the company's
expense.'
Mr Butcher believes that the importance of shareholders' rights to kick up a
fuss at the AGM should not be underestimated, particularly if it is reported
in the press. 'Public obloquy does have an effect,' he declares. But he
argues that legal reforms are required to 'elevate the status' and he is
very encouraged by Mr Myners' recent speech. 'This signalled a change of
view of one very important fund manager.'
However, it is not a view widely shared by other institutions. Mr Paul
Yates, a director of PDFM, says that annual meetings are largely irrelevant
to main shareholders, although the fund manager takes voting seriously, if
only by proxy. 'We see the companies in which we invest on a regular basis
and we don't want anyone else there. It is much more constructive to hold
corporate governance discussions in private than in public.'
He admits that private investors need 'some sort of forum' to question
directors but adds: 'I can't think what you could do to make it a more
useful for institutional investors.'
He dismisses the idea that annual meetings should be used by companies to
announce price sensitive information, which would cause 'a frantic scramble
to the mobile phones'.
The head of investment at one of the UK's largest institutions agrees that
AGMs are, and are likely to remain, little more than 'opportunities for
private shareholders to air their grievances'. He argues that management
problems are best addressed in private and that general meetings should only
be used as a last resort. 'People need to save face when cornered and are
more willing to accept change if it is done in a gentlemanly way out of the
public gaze.
'Annual meetings are just not the right environment either for careful
cross-questioning of a company's strategy or for resolution of corporate
governance issues.'
Even those institutions which favour change do not expect it to happen
quickly. Mr Robert Adamson, who deals with corporate governance questions at
the British Rail pension fund, says: 'Change needs to be supported by the
big funds and most couldn't care less.'

FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: Triplex Lloyd warns of loss - Likely impact
of exceptional charges leaves shares down 13p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Triplex Lloyd fell by 13p to 133p yesterday after the Midlands
industrial components group warned of sizeable losses for the year to March
31.
The company, which has embarked on a wide-ranging restructuring programme,
said pre-tax losses could reach Pounds 3m, compared with profits of Pounds
7.08m last time.
It blamed the likely deficit on exceptional charges totalling Pounds 8m  -
dominated by a Pounds 4.7m provision to cover trading losses and disposal
costs at ED Hinchliffe, the curtain-walling business which was sold in
February to Norcros, the building and consumer products group.
It also made further provisions for asset write-downs, redundancies and
potential costs arising out of legal action on previous disposals.
The announcement surprised analysts, who had been predicting profits of
about Pounds 8m.
Mr John Foley, group managing director, said the profits warning signalled
the company's determination to scale back the engineering division, and
focus on its core automotive and power components businesses.
As part of the restructuring, Mr Norman Price, the board director
responsible for the division, has left the company and new managing
directors have been appointed to most of the nine remaining engineering
subsidiaries.
'We've restructured the division through asset write-downs and management
changes, and we're now out of building products,' Mr Foley added.
The action resulted in a 10 per cent cut in the workforce to 900.
Profits at the power division, meanwhile, have also been dented by
disruption caused by the installation of new plant and machinery.
Mr Foley admitted that income lost on deferred orders - taken together with
the restructuring costs and trading losses - meant the company would not be
able to meet its year-end target of reducing gearing below 40 per cent.
'Borrowing is where expected at Pounds 25m, but because of the action we've
taken gearing remains at 55 per cent,' Mr Foley said.
He predicted gearing would fall as the company generated profits from
expansion of its automotive and power divisions, where a large investment
programme is under way.
That programme has been funded with the proceeds of last year's Pounds 17.3m
rights issue, of which Pounds 11m has been spent so far on new fabrication
facilities and vacuum furnaces.
Those facilities are understood to have sustained a strong underlying
performance in the company's two main divisions, where order books were
described as 'generally healthy'.
Triplex is also expecting to make exceptional profits on property disposals,
which should net Pounds 1m in the 12 months to March 31 and further sizeable
sums later this year.
Encouraged by the group's prospects, Mr Foley said the board expected to
recommend an unchanged final dividend of 4.5p, to maintain the total at 7p.
'We've been bloodied but we're coming through,' he said. 'We're not cutting
the dividend because the underlying business is fine.'

FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: QMH turns in small operating profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A return to operating profits in 1993 and a rise in hotel values were
reported yesterday by Queens Moat Houses, the group which is in talks to
restructure its Pounds 1.22bn debt burden.
Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive, said progress was being made on the
refinancing. He said: 'We won't put in place a structure which might work.
We are determined it will be a structure that will work.'
The accounts for 1993 were prepared on a going concern basis, depending on
the success of a refinancing package.
The package is expected to include a substantial conversion of debt into
equity.
Mr Coppel said he aimed for a deal which would allow existing shareholders
to retain as much of the enlarged equity as possible, but he could not
promise they would recover the value they had had before the collapse a year
ago, because that value was never really there.
Some banks have sold part of their exposure, with the Royal Bank of Scotland
confirming that it had sold a small amount of debt, believed to be less than
Pounds 10m. The buyer is understood to be an American bank which was willing
to abide by 'London Rules' on restructurings.
RBS is believed to have sold at about 60 per cent of face value. Although it
has a continuing exposure to QMH debt, it has resigned from the steering
committee of lenders.
Jones Lang Wootton, the surveyors which prepared the controversial 1992
property valuation of Pounds 861m, revalued the hotels at Pounds 915m. This
included a figure of Pounds 474m for the UK hotels, up 21 per cent, and
Pounds 439m for the continental European hotels, down from Pounds 474m.
Mr Coppel said part of the rise in UK hotel values was due to improved
trading conditions and increasing buying interest in hotels. But, he said,
it also reflected work done by the new management team to improve the
business. UK operating profits rose from Pounds 8m to Pounds 18.5m.
He said that in the second half of last year the management had begun 'to
get the business back on track'. The emphasis had now been put on sales and
marketing, while costs had been cut and financial controls improved.
In the longer term, the continental European hotels are expected to be sold.
In the UK, QMH aims to concentrate on a core chain of hotels which were
valued at Pounds 55,500 a room, up from Pounds 45,500 in the 1992 valuation,
which Mr Coppel said was close to values of comparable chains.
Group turnover fell 1.6 per cent to Pounds 381m. Operating profits were
Pounds 18.4m, compared with a loss of Pounds 700,000. A surplus on
revaluation of Pounds 26m was taken through the profit and loss account,
compared with the Pounds 804m write-down in 1992.
Interest payable was Pounds 110m (Pounds 113m), although QMH only paid its
debenture holders and continental European lenders in full. Part of the
interest due to UK banks was rolled into the principal, and net debt rose
Pounds 58.2m to Pounds 1.22bn.
The pre-tax loss was Pounds 46.4m (Pounds 1.04bn) and the retained loss was
Pounds 59.1m (Pounds 1.08bn). Thanks to the property revaluation, though,
the shareholders' funds improved from a negative Pounds 388.9m to minus
Pounds 377m. Losses per share came out at 6.4p (116.9p).

FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: Regina's warring sides call for help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Things are buzzing at Regina, the USM-quoted royal jelly maker that has
numbered Lady Thatcher, Dame Barbara Cartland, Cliff Richard and Millwall
Football Club among its customers.
Mr Shiraz Malik-Noor, the former chairman and chief executive who was hived
off in a coup last month, has requisitioned an extraordinary meeting on
April 25 to get himself reappointed to the board.
Mr Malik-Noor remains the largest shareholder, with 5.4 per cent of the
company. Croxley Holdings, his family trust, has 18.9 per cent.
Yesterday the current board - comprising Mr Paul Geoghegan, chairman, and Mr
Tony Shakesby, finance director - sent a stinging letter to the company's
shareholders urging them to oppose Mr Malik-Noor's reappointment.
The letter points out to more than 4,000 shareholders that the company has
notched up cumulative losses of more than Pounds 1.4m in the past two
financial years. Mr Malik-Noor's salary, his sister's salary and other
benefits and expenses have reached Pounds 450,000 since he joined the
company in early 1991.
Sales fell by 60 per cent to Pounds 2.05m for the year to end-August 1993,
and have continued to decline in the first half.
Mr Geoghegan said at the company's Finchley head office that he had every
confidence of winning at the EGM, judging from telephone calls.
However, Mr Malik-Noor is expecting the support not only of his family
trust, but of a further 15 per cent held by friends and supporters, giving
him about 40 per cent.
'I don't feel I can fold my tent and just walk away,' he said yesterday. He
pointed out that he and associates had put more than Pounds 1.5m into the
company in the last three years.
Mr Geoghegan blames the falling sales on 'inappropriate marketing
expenditure to support the brand'.

FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: Willis Corroon in Australian purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Willis Corroon, the insurance broker, is to acquire Australia's largest
independent risk management company, Richard Oliver International. The UK
group could ultimately pay Pounds 17m to acquire full control of Richard
Oliver, which it will merge with its local broking subsidiary, Willis
Corroon Holdings.
Willis will initially acquire 40 per cent of ROI's issued share capital for
ADollars 4.5m in cash. Willis may purchase the remaining 60 per cent of the
risk management group under put and call options subject to the approval of
the Australian statutory authorities.
The consideration for this second part of the deal will be calculated on an
earnings-related formula subject to a maximum of ADollars 35m (Pounds 17m)
and a minimum of ADollars 10m (Pounds 4.85m), both figures inclusive of the
initial payment of ADollars 4.5m, with the consideration to be paid in
either cash or shares.

FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals behind Laird rise - 'Very
difficult' German market proves main setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exchange rate movements and settlement of a lawsuit helped Laird Group, the
manufacturer of car components and industrial products, raise profits for
1993.
The group, which makes more than 80 per cent of its profits overseas, lifted
its pre-tax line from Pounds 36.2m to Pounds 38.2m. The latest figure
included a Pounds 2.5m exchange gain and a Pounds 2.8m credit from the
settlement of a lawsuit over intellectual property rights.
Last year's outcome included operating losses of Pounds 700,000 and a Pounds
2.6m disposal loss from discontinued operations.
Mr John Gardiner's role as chairman and chief executive is being split from
October with Mr Ian Arnott, group managing director, taking the latter
position. Mr Arnott said the company had put in a solid performance in spite
of the worst recession in the European automotive industry since the second
world war.
More than 60 per cent of the group's business is derived from the automotive
industry.
Last year French car production was down 15 per cent, while Spanish and
German production was down 20 per cent. Mr Arnott described the German
market, where the group suffered its main setback, as 'very, very
difficult'.
Profits from France were ahead following cost savings and better supplies to
new models, and in Spain were up from a low base.
Total group turnover rose from Pounds 600.7m to Pounds 624.4m, although
Pounds 50m of the latest figure reflected exchange rate movements.
Non-automotive activities, which are being expanded in order to reduce
exposure to the automotive industry, improved profits by 50 per cent and
raised their share of total profits from 22 per cent to 38 per cent.
The industrial products division, which includes automotive components other
than seals in Germany and parts for doors and windows, lifted operating
profits from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 16.2m. In the UK this division's
non-automotive profits rose from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 8.4m.
The services industries division, which includes US printing and plastics
distribution and the Scottish computer components operation, lifted profits
from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 10.1m.
At the year-end net debt and gearing was virtually unchanged at Pounds 22.7m
and 10.5 per cent respectively.
Earnings per share under FRS 3 were up from 18.7p to 21.2p, helped by a fall
in the tax charge from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 13.3m.
A final dividend of 6.5p is proposed, taking the total to 10.7p (10.5p).
COMMENT
Strip out the currency factor and the lawsuit credit and Laird's operating
profits are Pounds 39.5m, down from Pounds 46.3m for 1992. This illustrates
the extent of the European recession for automotives, particularly in
Germany, on which the group is still heavily dependent. However, the
non-automotive side, which has a high US and UK content, is making progress.
The balance sheet remains strong, and new plants are being brought on stream
this year in the UK, the US, Spain and the Czech Republic. Pencilled-in
profits of Pounds 40m for this year put the shares, up 18p at 388p
yesterday, on a prospective multiple of more than 17, which looks fully
valued. However, it is worth remembering that despite extremely tough
markets the dividend is being raised, and the cover has been increased from
1.9 to 2 times.

FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: GRE expands with Pounds 19m US motor
insurance buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guardian Royal Exchange, the composite insurance group, is to increase its
presence in the US motor insurance market through the acquisition of The
National Corporation of Indianapolis.
Guardian, which recently announced an ambitious expansion in the UK direct
motor market, is paying a total of Pounds 19m - made up of an initial Pounds
13m and two further contributions of Pounds 3m. The purchase will be funded
from its existing resources.
National and nine associated agencies introduce and manage the business of
the The National Insurance Association, a so-called 'reciprocal insurance
exchange', similar in some ways to a mutual.
It specialises in non-standard motor insurance so the acquisition will
strengthen Guardian's position in this area of the US market.
Two of the group's existing subsidiaries - Globe American and American
Ambassador, bought in December last year, are both specialists in this
business.
As a result of the acquisition the total number of states in which Guardian
operates in the non-standard market will increase from 10 to 17.
'The synergy between the National group and our existing operations should
bring powerful benefits to many parts of the business,' said Mr Jim
McDonough, international director.
National underwrites non-standard motor business in 13 states. Its gross
premium income in 1993 amounted to Pounds 35m, making an underwriting profit
of Pounds 2.4m and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.6m. It has produced an
underwriting profit in each of the last three years.

FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: Keller shows 29% advance to Pounds 8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Keller Group, the specialist engineering company which is coming to the
market this month in a Pounds 70m flotation, last year lifted profits by 29
per cent.
Strong order books and rising demand in Germany helped the underground
foundations business, acquired from GKN three years ago in a Pounds 26m
management buy-out, contribute to pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.96m (Pounds
6.2m) for the year to December 31.
The outcome was enhanced by an exceptional pre-tax credit of Pounds 919,000
linked to an Iraqi contract, which had earlier been written off because of
the Gulf war.
Overseas subsidiaries, meanwhile, underpinned increased operating profits of
Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 7.3m) and represented the bulk of total turnover of
Pounds 147.8m (Pounds 131.9m).
In the UK, benefits of a significant rationalisation pushed operating
profits up from Pounds 291,000 to Pounds 492,000, but strong competition saw
turnover fall 17 per cent to Pounds 24.1m.
Faced with difficult trading conditions at home, the group said in its
pathfinder prospectus that proceeds from the flotation would be used for
further expansion overseas, where the group makes more than 80 per cent of
its sales.
The dominance of turnover and profits earned outside the UK has also
persuaded the group to adopt foreign income dividends to pay shareholders.
The FID scheme, set out in last November's budget, allows companies to pay
dividends out of foreign income, which they must remit to the UK, and in
effect avoid paying advance corporation tax on the dividend.
Funds raised from the placing and intermediaries offer will also be used to
repay debt, which rose sharply earlier this year with the Dollars 9m (Pounds
6.1m) acquisition of Case International, the Chicago-based foundation
engineer.

FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: Amersham in Japanese and US sequencing
link-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amersham International, the UK health science group, has forged an alliance
with Molecular Dynamics of the US and Hitachi of Japan to co-promote a new
range of automated systems for use in DNA sequencing.
Amersham has also paid Dollars 2.7m (Pounds 1.9m) for warrants to purchase a
stake of up to 10 per cent in Molecular Dynamics over the next three years
at a cost of Dollars 13.2m.
Mr Bill Castell, chief executive, said the partnership built on Amersham's
Dollars 52m acquisition of US Biochemical a year ago. 'US Biochemical is the
market leader in enzyme reagents used in manual sequencing and we wanted to
get into the fast-moving automated sequencing market.'
In the US and Europe, Molecular Dynamics will market Amersham's DNA
sequencing robot and a complementary Hitachi product with Amersham supplying
reagents and technical support. Hitachi will market the products in Japan.
Amersham will also collaborate in the development of reagents for Molecular
Dynamics' other existing and future instruments.
A six-year old company which floated in 1993, Molecular reported
disappointing quarterly figures on Wednesday. But Mr Castell said: 'We feel
it has good long-term prospects though it has a few short-term problems.'
Amersham has the option to buy Molecular shares in the market.
The worldwide market for automated sequencing systems and reagents is valued
at about Dollars 180m and is growing at about 20 per cent a year partly
because of demand generated by the Human Genome project.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Torday &amp; Carlisle, the Newcastle-based engineer, cut its pre-tax loss from
Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 292,000 for 1993.
The loss was struck after an exceptional profit of Pounds 3.02m on the
disposal of Elfab Hughes, which makes pressure relief and safety equipment,
and exceptional costs of Pounds 2.96m (Pounds 5.28m). The loss for 1992
included a provision of Pounds 8.21m against goodwill at Oldham Signs.
Elfab contributed operating profits of Pounds 544,000 for the 11 months
before the sale.
Operating profits from continuing businesses were Pounds 35,000, compared
with a previous loss of Pounds 1.45m.
Turnover from continuing businesses fell from Pounds 34.1m to Pounds 28.8m.
Total group turnover was Pounds 32.7m (Pounds 38.9m).
The exceptional costs include Pounds 963,000 for environmental controls in
the Netherlands.
Borrowings were down from Pounds 7.77m to Pounds 5.2m, giving gearing of 73
per cent (109 per cent).
Earnings were 0.2p against losses of 93p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of United Breweries dropped 2 1/2 p to 5p yesterday after the
lossmaking regional brewer and pub operator said it was in breach of its
banking covenants.
The statement followed completion of a valuation of its public house estate,
which showed a decline of some Pounds 7.2m and resulted in a sizeable
diminution in net tangible assets and the elimination of distributable
reserves.
The USM-traded group said that talks with its bankers, first announced in
February, were continuing.
Directors said proposals for a 'major financial restructuring and
acquisitions essential to improve critical mass,' probably including an
equity fund raising exercise, would be presented to shareholders in
approximately two months.
In a move designed to 'strengthen management resources' Mr Stephen Lambert
has been appointed as financial director.
Mr Michael Roberts and Mr David Ford, the property director, have resigned
from the board, although Mr Roberts will remain in a full-time capacity for
the time being to assist in the restructuring programme.

FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: Hewitt hit by German activities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hewitt Group, the manu-facturer of industrial ceramics and refractories, saw
pre-tax profits drop from Pounds 832,000 to Pounds 8,000 in 1993, primarily
because of problems in its German operations.
The shortfall had been flagged in a profits warning in January, and the
shares rose 1p to 171p yesterday.
Turnover rose to Pounds 11m (Pounds 7.76m), helped by an acquisition, while
the pre-tax result was buoyed by a Pounds 284,000 profit from the sale of
fixed assets and Pounds 166,000 from an associated company.
The German subsidiary, Hewitt Industriekeramik, had second half sales
significantly below projections, and Hewitt Refractories also suffered
because one of its main clients stopped producing storage heaters.
It has, however, recently picked up two long-term contracts, which should
ensure sales growth in the current year.
In April 1993 Hewitt invested Pounds 1.9m in the purchase of 50 per cent of
Sphinx Technical Ceramics, and in the nine months to December that company
achieved operating profits of Pounds 774,000, compared with a loss of Pounds
450,000.
Losses per share emerged at 8.3p (14.8p earnings), but an unchanged final
dividend of 1.75p is proposed, making a total of 3.25p (3p).

FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: Institutions acquire Spring Ram stake sold
by US investor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Lazard Freres Asset Management, the US investment group, has sold its 6.5
per cent stake in Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms group, with De
Zoete &amp; Bevan, the brokers, buying and placing the shares.
The new owners are largely UK institutions. Spring Ram said it was pleased
that the shares had been 'placed with long term institutions who know us
well'.
De Zoete, part of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, bought 34.2m shares, comprising
29.4m old shares and the balance in new shares from January's rights issue,
at a price of 55 3/4 p. The old shares were then placed at 56 1/2 p.
Because of the difference between the old and new shares, the former being
entitled to a 0.1p dividend, De Zoete is understood not to have placed the
new shares to avoid confusion.
However, it is believed to have hedged its position in the remaining new
shares by selling short.
Spring Ram old shares fell 2p to 59p with volume recorded at 63.9m shares,
reflecting both the purchase and placing. The new shares were down 2p at
61p, with volume of 4.93m shares.

FT  09 APR 94 / Almost a law unto themselves: A look at the work of the US
Supreme Court, where a vacancy has arisen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is never easy to get a seat to watch the US Supreme Court at work. Two
Mondays ago, the galleries were packed with the likes of Howard Davies, head
of the Confederation of British Industry, as the world's most celebrated
bench assembled to hear oral arguments on one of the biggest cases on its
calendar this year - which happened, unusually, to involve a foreign
company, Barclays Bank, in its case against California's system of unitary
taxation.
The mood was not entirely one of reverence. It took the marshal's whistle to
silence the veteran court watchers making a book on which justice would be
first to interrupt counsel, who are given precisely 22 1/2 minutes to argue
their cases. The court marched in, the nine Justices taking their seats in
order of seniority on either side of Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
presenting an arc of styles, mannerisms and convictions.
It was the mild-mannered Justice David Souter who scooped the pool,
confounding the heavy odds on the voluble Justice Antonin Scalia, who
invariably spouts Latin and discourses on Alexander Hamilton's Federalist
Papers. The diminutive Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court's newest
member, sat bolt upright on Mr Rehnquist's far left and peppered the lawyers
with questions, interrupting, and thus annoying, some more senior
colleagues, including the other woman justice, the courteous Sandra Day
O'Connor.
At the other end of the row, Justice Clarence Thomas, eighth in precedence
and the only black, sat back and rocked gently, his booming voice never
heard. Unusually silent on this occasion was the oldest member, 85-year-old
Harry Blackmun, but he, perhaps, had something else on his mind.
On Wednesday, the country discovered what that was, as Blackmun, one of two
remaining liberals on the bench, announced he was retiring after 24 years
marked by a crusty independence, mostly in the minority. It was,
comfortably, the biggest US story of the week, as it invariably is when a
justice steps down.
The Supreme Court remains an abiding fascination, both because of what it
is, the third and equal pillar of the US government along with the
presidency and Congress, and because the greatest of its 110 names -
Marshall, Harlan, Frankfurter, Holmes, Brandeis, Warren, Black - are
embedded in US history. Appointed for life, and often serving into their
80s, justices can help shape the nation long beyond the times and political
circumstances of their appointments. William O Douglas was named by FDR in
1939 because he was an expert on financial regulation. But in 36 years on
the court he rarely faced such a case and was free to develop his trenchant
liberalism.
Even when they do retire, some justices remain around the court in offices
provided for them, wielding influence behind the scenes. Chief Justice
Rehnquist, a conservative, is sometimes said to be near apoplectic at the
way Justice William Brennan (1956-90) still insinuates his eloquent liberal
arguments over morning coffee with the likes of Justice Souter, a Bush
appointee.
Many of the court's judgments have had monumental impact. Dred Scott (1857)
legitimised slavery and thus, in the eyes of the South, the civil war;
Plessy (1896) upheld public segregation by race; Brown (1954) undid Plessy,
and made the reputation of Thurgood Marshall, later the court's first black
member; Miranda (1966) established rights for criminal suspects and changed
the way the police went about their business; Roe (1973), associated, if not
entirely accurately, with Justice Blackmun, protected women's right to
abortion.
Given all this, it is hardly surprising that every president slavers at the
opportunity to shape the court. Bill Clinton was unfairly criticised last
year because he took 85 days to name a replacement for the retiring Justice
Byron White. His selection process might have been messy but the mere
prospect of being the first Democratic president since 1967 able to appoint
a justice was enough to militate against haste. In the event, the popular
Ginsburg nomination proved a turning point in Mr Clinton's sagging fortunes
last summer.
Similarly, court nominees, subject to confirmation by the Senate, often
prompt serious opposition, irrespective of the popularity of the president.
Messrs Reagan and Bush each lost a candidate, Mr Nixon lost two in a year,
and Mr Johnson could not elevate Justice Abe Fortas to the Chief's position.
In each instance, ideological objections, plus reservations about legal
competence and other issues, were decisive.
As a rough rule, Republican presidents have tended to name conservative
judges to the court, on the assumption that they will stick to the limited
letter of the constitution and roll back the frontiers of federal power.
Democrats, with fewer recent chances, have naturally preferred the reverse
and also shown more partiality to practising politicians, as witnessed by Mr
Clinton's current interest in Senator George Mitchell from Maine.
The glittering exception was President Eisenhower's appointment of Earl
Warren, the Republican governor of California, to be Chief Justice in 1953.
Mr Warren's subsequent direction of the most activist liberal court this
century, starting with the Brown ruling, prompted Ike to confess it was the
'worst appointment I have ever made'. He later added Justice Brennan, whom
he named just before the 1956 election simply to shore up the Irish Catholic
vote, to his list.
Justices are frequently unpredictable once on the bench. President Nixon
thought Mr Blackmun a safe conservative and was proved wrong, while Justice
White, a Kennedy nominee, moved increasingly to the right. Of the present
court, all Republican appointments except Justice Ginsburg, only Messrs
Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas have consistently lived up to conservative
expectations. They do not constitute a majority, which explains why the
Reagan revolution, including repealing the Roe ruling, ultimately languished
at the highest judicial level.
The court does go through phases of activism followed by consolidation,
often contra-cyclical to the prevailing political mood. The present bench
has the reputation for not breaking much new ground. Perhaps aware of its
own internal fault lines, it has tended to choose cases for judgment mostly
of a dry, technical nature, though many may have wider subsequent
implications, especially in the area of workplace law.
On controversial cases, such as last year's judgment on Pennsylvania's more
restrictive abortion laws, it offered so many opinions that Justice O'Connor
confessed she had no idea what the court had decided in the end. It is also
not as busy as it used to be, taking on about 120 cases this year, 50 or so
less than a generation ago.
Probably its two most important current cases concern the redrawing of
constituency boundaries to improve representation of racial minorities and
the issue of California's system of unitary taxation, opposed by Barclays.
Both have received recent oral hearings prior to definitive written
judgments, usually handed down 3-6 months later.
The public sessions, supplementing mountains of written briefs, are not
necessarily decisive, but more of an opportunity for the justices to strut
their stuff before arguing it out in private. This may be just as well for
Barclays, for the thrust of questioning from the bench was not in its
favour. And the court's word is law.

FT  09 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Beer myth does not hold water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From KIM WARREN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Tony Jackson ('A bitter twist to the bar-room tale', April 6)
perpetuates long-standing myths about UK beer prices, constructing
explanations that do not hold water. The article makes an assertion about
'the inefficiency of the pub network' and then explains this by 'beer prices
in pubs (being) set by big integrated operators which need to cover the
costs of their pubs as well as their breweries'.
Before 1986, UK pubs offered among the cheapest on-sale beer prices in the
developed world. The integrated system was indeed implicated in this. Lost
retail volume hit brewers' retail and production profits, so pubs linked to
up-stream interests would generally, as economists have long known, opt for
a higher-volume/lower retail price balance than would retailers with no
up-stream margin to consider. UK consumers enjoyed widespread provision of
pubs selling low-priced beer. Incidental benefits included low-cost brand
development - hence the wide variety of products on offer, including a
plethora of foreign brands exploiting the low-cost pubs channel via
licensing.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission's 1989 message was clear - brewers
must stop including up-stream profits in retail pub decisions. Shedding
10,000 tied pubs into the free market was the means chosen to enforce this
split. These now un-tied pubs have no choice but to raise prices to earn a
return on their capital value. This is the process that has pushed beer
prices ahead of retail prices index since 1990. The outcome is higher prices
that put off consumers, so volumes fall. Many small pubs cannot find a
price/volume position that works, and close.
The shake-out occurs when prices push against consumer resistance and some
retailers try price promotion to escape the trap. Some may succeed, but
don't mistake this tactical phase for a new golden age of low pub prices.
Meanwhile the wholesale market begins to look like that in many other
countries. With no tied channel, only the biggest brands with the biggest
advertising prosper, so a share war ensues and weaker suppliers exit. Nearly
all developed beer markets are dominated by one or two big suppliers.
On one point Mr Jackson is certainly right. Pubs will close, and they will
be the smaller ones that formerly contributed to tied beer volumes. Shame
no-one bothered to ask consumers how they felt about the losing their
'inefficient' pub.

Sir, I agreed with many of the points made by Sue Fernie and David Metcalf
about human resource management techniques (Recruitment, April 6, UK
edition; April 8, international). But they were unfair to lay most of the
blame on personnel specialists for HRM's failure to deliver its promises.
In my experience senior executives and managers generally have
enthusiastically endorsed HRM as part of a 'mission' to change
organisational culture rather than to improve employee relations or customer
service. Perhaps the situation would not be as bad as they describe if more
attention were paid to the views of staff and their representatives and
customers than to trendy management theories.

FT  09 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: EU voting system could look to US
example
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW G HYDE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ian Davidson's piece on the latest chapter in the ongoing European
constitutional showdown, this time on majority voting after enlargement
('Vengeance of a Union scorned', April 2/3) recalls the need for the EU to
consider establishing a bicameral legislature.
Such a legislature could be modelled on the American system: designed to
balance the power between large and small states. The interests of larger
countries would be reflected in the existing European parliament, where
individual national voting strength would continue to be determined (within
certain parameters) by population size. For smaller states, there would be
another chamber, a senate, allowing all member states equal representation.
Perhaps the Council of Ministers, still composed of ministers from member
state governments, could evolve into this second chamber.
The creation of such an upper chamber, as was envisaged for the American
system, would ensure a measure of state autonomy in a union beginning to
forge a larger unified identity. In the federalist papers written by
America's founding fathers, they said this about the proposed US Senate: the
'equal vote allowed to each state is at once a constitutional recognition of
the portion of sovereignty remaining in the individual states . . . (The
Senate) will derive its powers from the states as political and coequal
societies . . .' Although it is directly elected now, the US Senate was
originally designed to secure the interests of the state governments against
a powerful centre.
The British government, looking ahead to the 1996 intergovernmental
conference, needs to devise a way of promoting a broader European Union,
while at the same time reserving to itself those elements of its own
sovereignty deemed important.

FT  09 APR 94 / Turbulence in the spring air: The prime minister's
resignation is a step backwards for Japanese politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa was joking when he told his companions over dinner a
few days ago that he would like to resign as Japanese prime minister.
He wanted, it was said, to enjoy the cherry blossom in bloom all over Tokyo.
Shortly afterwards, Mr Hosokawa politely denied he had said any such thing.
But he gave the jest a sad ending yesterday by apologising for the
inconvenience he was causing and offering his resignation, the final U-turn
of an increasingly erratic eight-month-old administration.
The gentlemanly Mr Hosokawa's decision was prompted not by indiscretion over
his meal of eels, but by his disinclination to fight the allegations of
financial impropriety made against him by an aggressive opposition Liberal
Democratic party.
His resignation could open a new round of political realignment as parties
jostle for position ahead of a general election which could, in this
unstable climate, come at any moment. It also represents a step backwards
for Japanese politics. It deals a symbolic blow to the campaign - against
old-style money politics and for a more open style of democracy - on which
Mr Hosokawa was elected last summer, bringing an end to 38 years of LDP
rule.
Mr Hosokawa's downfall also marks a resurgence in the LDP's power. The
opposition knows well, from its own painful experience, that being labelled
corrupt is a liability. Now the party has turned that weapon against Mr
Hosokawa.
The LDP lost the election mainly because of its reputation as the master of
financial corruption, through its involvement in some of Japan's best known
scandals, culminating in the recent arrest of a former LDP construction
minister on bribery charges.
Mr Hosokawa has withdrawn, rather than be similarly tainted. 'I must clarify
my responsibility as a reformist leader,' he explained to his bewildered
coalition colleagues yesterday, prompting an astonished 10-minute silence in
the meeting room.
The surprise was understandable. Mr Hosokawa was in a fix, but a relatively
mild one by Japanese political standards. The LDP was blocking the current
year's budget until he disproved allegations that he had wrongly borrowed
Y100m (Pounds 650,000) from a parcel delivery company for a personal
political campaign and tried to cover up a share purchase for tax reasons.
It was a standard tactic, used to bring down an LDP prime minister, Mr
Noboru Takeshita, five years ago.
As a result of the LDP's allegations, and a series of embarrassing policy
U-turns, Mr Hosokawa's popularity had fallen from about 70 per cent last
year, a postwar high for a Japanese prime minister, to less than 50 per cent
last month.
Yet Mr Hosokawa was still far more popular than previous LDP prime ministers
in similar fixes. His cabinet had a firm majority in parliament. It might
have been able to hold out until an election, probably early next year,
under the new electoral system. The change, from multi-seat constituencies
to a mixture of single seats and proportional representation, was agreed as
part of the package of political reforms that has been the Hosokawa
government's biggest achievement. The LDP, by contrast, has weak support,
with only 15 per cent in the latest opinion poll by the Mainichi Shimbun
newspaper.
Had he the stomach for a fight, Mr Hosokawa could have battled on. 'He may
not have been able to bear the situation any more,' says Mr Testsuro
Murofushi, political commentator of the Asahi Shimbun daily paper.
The lesson is that Japanese politics is still no place for idealistic
gentlemen, even after recent changes. The old structure, founded on
seniority, behind-the-scenes influence and cash, has weakened but not
fallen. Mr Hosokawa, the scion of a feudal clan, was ill-prepared for
playing a game run by bruisers with little sympathy for his aristocratic
ways. Until last summer, he had never held a seat in the lower house of
parliament, let alone a ministerial job. He made his reputation as governor
of Kumamoto prefecture.
He was only chosen as prime minister as part of a deal by Mr Ichiro Ozawa,
the government's backroom strategist, to hold together the diverse members
of the seven-party coalition, stretching from Buddhist-backed right to
extreme left.
'Mr Hosokawa was a puppet,' says Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at
Baring Securities in Tokyo - a thought that must have occurred to Mr
Hosokawa several times during his administration. Rebellious coalition
allies forced him to scrap several important initiatives, including a rise
in consumption taxes and a cabinet reshuffle.
Mr Hosokawa appeared relatively untroubled by these political setbacks. But
the allegations against his personal financial honesty were different. The
final blow appears to have been Mr Hosokawa's own discovery that his
problems went deeper than the affairs raised by the LDP. He uncovered a
legal problem relating to investments made on his behalf by an 'old personal
friend'. Who that friend is and how much cash was involved was the second
hottest subject for speculation in Tokyo last night - after the identity of
Mr Hosokawa's successor.
The task the alliance parties face in choosing a new prime minister is
considerable. Mr Hosokawa's position as leader of a small, centre-right
party, the Japan New party, allowed him to play the honest broker between
the coalition's conflicting members.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, is seen as a front runner, because he has
the support of his own Japan Renewal party, the second largest coalition
member, of Komeito, the clean government party, and the implicit acceptance
of the moderate wing of the Social Democratic party, the largest group in
the alliance. He is the only cabinet member with previous ministerial
experience - at the agriculture and finance ministries.
However, Mr Hata is not a certain bet. His patron and joint founder of the
JRP, Mr Ozawa, is a fierce rival of another important coalition figure, Mr
Masayoshi Takemura, head of the New Harbinger party. Mr Ozawa and Mr
Takemura may find it hard to agree.
If, as is possible, coalition leaders fail to agree on a successor to Mr
Hosokawa, they will be forced to call a general election. That would open
the way for the LDP, despite its low showing in the polls, to try to form a
coalition government.
Another possibility is for Mr Ozawa to offer the prime ministership to Mr
Michio Watanabe, a former foreign minister, who leads a pro-reform faction
in the LDP. The Socialists and Mr Takemura would leave the existing
government coalition if the Watanabe faction defected to it. That would
leave two large groupings in Japanese politics - a centre-right coalition in
government and a centre-left group in opposition.
It must be cold comfort for Mr Hosokawa that he can leave the horse trading
to others and watch cherry blossom to his satisfaction. According to last
night's weather forecast, the blooms will fall in the next few days - a
reminder of the fragility of Japanese governments.

FT  09 APR 94 / Skies without limits: A look at the problems facing airlines
in the former Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The large blue and green globe advertising Aeroflot on a Moscow avenue used
to boast of the airline's comfort and speed. More recently, the neon-lit
words have been removed, leaving just the globe and the Aeroflot emblem.
The alteration proved symbolic. Two crashes - one last month of an Airbus
operated by the successor to the Aeroflot of Soviet times (which still uses
its name) and another in January of an aircraft run by a tiny offshoot -
have severely damaged the Russian airline industry's image.
The revelation this week that the pilot in the Aeroflot crash, which killed
all 75 people on board, had been teaching his children how to fly confirmed
western suspicions that safety and discipline have fallen to dangerous
levels. The accident has brought home to the Russian government the need to
restructure the country's civil aviation industry and tighten its
supervision.
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Aeroflot has splintered into
not just 15 airlines - one in each newly independent republic - but also
about 300 regional and town-based mini-carriers. The break-up has
exacerbated the problems of the old Aeroflot: ageing aircraft, dilapidated
airports and poor service.
Most of the new companies are state-owned, small and inefficient. In spite
of the break-up of the old monopoly, few compete on the same routes,
reducing incentives to improve standards. And they have little scope for
cross-subsidising unprofitable domestic routes - some of which provide
virtually the only form of transport in Russia's far north and east.
Some help came in January 1992, when state price controls were lifted,
enabling airlines to price their tickets at more realistic levels.
Nevertheless, the Russian pilots' union reckons that last year only half of
the country's airlines - mostly those that inherited profitable routes -
made money.
'We are a country of extremes. We were thrown from the old state monopoly
system right into a market without any rules,' says Mr Alfred Malinovski,
head of the union. 'We interpreted the concept of a market in the most
radical way by breaking up Aeroflot into 300 companies which turned out to
be unmanageable. You can do that sort of thing with a state-owned laundry
monopoly, but not with civil aviation.'
The regulatory machinery is proving particularly ineffective. The old Soviet
civil aviation ministry was replaced by a Russian air transport department
to supervise airlines within Russia, and an inter-state aviation committee
to agree common standards on issues such as safety among the independent
republics. But both have lacked political clout, staff and money.
Breaches of safety rules are highly visible on flights within the former
Soviet Union. Travelling can be an unnerving experience: some passengers
tell tales of heavy luggage being piled up against safety exits, despite
complaints by western travellers; others say that, after their hand luggage
had been carefully weighed at the check-in counters, young traders were
allowed on to the aircraft at the last minute with outsize parcels.
Passengers on the tragic Aeroflot flight to Hong Kong may have seen little
to distinguish the Airbus they were travelling on from those of western
airlines. But Mr Malinovski says a fall in morale and discipline has
affected Russia's domestic and international pilots.
He suggests setting up an independent, properly funded civil aviation
authority, capable of attracting skilled staff and with the authority to
devise and enforce regulations for the industry.
Yet that would not overcome the problems airlines have in making the
investment necessary to improve standards. Mr Mark Jarvis, Moscow
representative of Fleming's, the UK investment bank with interests in
aircraft leasing and manufacturing in Russia, says: 'None of the baby
Aeroflots has any money left for anything else once they've paid for fuel
and maintenance . . . They cannot even afford a new paint job for Dollars
50,000, or to refurbish interiors, let alone acquire new aircraft.'
In large part, the financing problems stem from Aeroflot's disintegration.
There is a need for consolidation, but political upheavals, disagreements
about the direction of market reforms, and preoccupations with other
pressing matters mean the governments of Russia and most of the former
Soviet republics lack a strategy for the industry.
An example of this is Moscow's indecision over Aeroflot-Russian
International Airlines, the full name of the rump of Aeroflot. The
privatisation ministry wants to break the carrier into more than one company
prior to selling shares to the public. But other officials and the airline's
executives want to preserve a unified national flag-carrier, able to compete
against international rivals.
While Aeroflot's successors languish, a bright spot is the emergence of a
few privately funded competitors. The most prominent is Transaero, which
boasts western-style service, by stewardesses trained by Air France, and
five leased Boeings maintained by Israelis.
Created in 1992 with backing from a private Russian bank, it flies to eight
destinations within the former Soviet Union for a small premium over the
prices asked by Aeroflot's heirs operating the same routes. Mr Leonid
Kligerman, Transaero's public relations manager, says: 'For 70 years,
passengers flying Aeroflot did not even know what service meant. We make it
our business to show them. Having flown with us once, they will always fly
with us.'
Transaero's success is due partly to its ability to 'cherry-pick' profitable
routes - with destinations such as the oil town of Nizhnevartovsk and the
holiday resort of Sochi. It is also possibly aided by the fact that the
mother of Transaero's chairman heads the inter-state aviation committee.
Until the Russian authorities inject some coherence into the state sector,
allowing private entrepreneurship to flourish at its expense may be the only
way to provide Russian passengers with a genuine choice. The risk is that
further lives may be lost before necessary changes are made.

FT  09 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Ballet in classical spirit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JORG SCHIMMELPFENNIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Notwithstanding that I hold Clement Crisp's ballet reviews in very high
esteem, I cannot subscribe to his judgment on David Bintley's Sylvia ('A
sadly misconceived Sylvia', March 31), which, in a way, is in line with his
vigorous attack on last year's Royal Ballet staging of Don Quixote.
Undoubtedly, both productions diverge substantially from their respective
original texts. Remembering their present state of funding, however,
classical ballet companies unwilling to perform Swan Lake for the umpteenth
time sometimes have to be bold and provide fun as well.
A short look at the ballet's history could be helpful. From the score it can
well be considered superior to its sister ballet, Coppelia. Still, it had
always been that popular for one obvious reason: for most of the time it
served as a perfect vehicle for the leading ballerina to excel at her
technical dancing abilities. But, as the story was rather poorly received by
most audiences, the other part of the art of ballet, ie understanding a role
with the body, couldn't be honoured either. Note that its original run
effectively ended when Rita Sangalli, the first Sylvia, withdrew due to
injury. Later on Sir Frederick Ashton reduced his much acclaimed 1952
production to just one act.
It now seems that David Bintley has proved to be the catalyst Sylvia longed
for in more recent times. His choreography leaves ample opportunities for
all roles to be intelligently used. On the two nights I attended Sandra
Madgwick and Miyako Yoshida, as Sylvia, gave stunning performances. Though
their interpretations differed considerably both were in a truly classical
spirit. All the other artists - and without disparaging anyone I would
mention Jessica Clarke and Karen Waldie, both as Diana - were fine. The
corps de ballet was exemplary.
There are certainly other ways to read the text. But on both nights Coven
Garden was all smiles. Good fun, wonderful dancing. Jorg Schimmelpfennig,

FT  09 APR 94 / Lull before the battle resumes: As world economies diverge,
is further turmoil likely on financial markets? John Plender says the dollar
holds the key
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the worst over? After two months of unremitting turbulence in global
markets, a hint of optimism finally emerged this week. The first pointer to
more stable conditions came with Monday's mini-crash on Wall Street, which
managed to right itself in a matter of hours. Since then global equities
have been shaking off the malign influence of bonds; and within the bond
markets Europe is no longer quite so tightly shackled to the US. The
battlefield remains heavily scarred in the aftermath of the US Federal
Reserve's decision to start raising interest rates on February 4th, but the
contours are becoming clearer.
One reason for thinking that this lull is not necessarily the end of the
shakeout is to be found in the accompanying table, which shows what has
happened to bond yields in the group of seven industrialised countries since
the Fed's initial move. The striking feature is that the upward adjustment
in UK gilt yields has been broadly in line with the upward move in US
Treasuries, despite the different stages in their respective economic
cycles.
Continental Europe and Japan, in contrast, are no longer moving precisely in
tandem with the US. Their bond yields have risen on average by around half
the UK-US increase. Yet that is still a step in the wrong direction given
that their real, inflation-adjusted, bond yields are high for economies that
are growing at well below potential as they limp out of recession.
A quirkier aspect of the present pattern of yields is that the markets are
indicating surprisingly stark outcomes for individual countries. Canada, for
example, has seen the biggest yield adjustment in the G7, reflecting worries
about deteriorating debt problems and a weakening political situation. With
real bond yields at 6.8 per cent, the country is either heading for an
appalling upsurge in inflation and a further decline of an already depressed
Canadian dollar, or an astonishing bull market in bonds.
The contrast with Italy - where there are huge political uncertainties after
the election, a budget deficit close to 10 per cent of GDP and a total stock
of public sector debt approaching 120 per cent - is interesting. Inflation
there is running at about 4 per cent, compared with a negligible rate in
Canada. Yet nominal yields have risen broadly in line with the other big
continental European economies - much less than in Canada.
Admittedly Canada's outstanding stock of debt is now running at little short
of 90 per cent of GDP, and the country is much more dependent on external
finance than Italy. That no doubt gives rise to portfolio fatigue. Yet the
markets appear, at first sight, to be indulgent to the Italians in the light
of their historic record with inflation. The same could be said of a
comparison with UK gilts. The much greater upward yield adjustment for
Britain looks equally odd given the greater credibility of UK fiscal policy.
As for equities, the transatlantic pattern has been broadly similar. While
continental bourses were cheering up under their own impetus this week, the
UK market remained more in thrall to Wall Street. Japan, meantime, has been
a special case, with international fund managers being prepared to take a
more bullish view of the post-bubble market than shell-shocked domestic
investors.
It all adds up to a curious picture. If the requirements for a bear market
include rapid economic growth, lax monetary policy and high capacity
utilisation, then only the US comes close to fulfilling those criteria. In
continental Europe precisely the opposite conditions apply. So the broadly
synchronised movement of US and European equities raises as much of a
conundrum as the one-way behaviour of bond markets. How can this apparently
perverse set of events be rationalised?
For extreme pessimists, renewed inflationary pressure provides the answer.
The recalcitrant behaviour of the UK markets, for example, might be
attributed to a return to an all too familiar kind of British economic
cycle: where pay settlements are about to turn up sharply with recovery, the
government will be tempted into pre-electoral loosening of fiscal policy and
the structural weakness of the balance of payments will ultimately cause the
party to end in tears.
Certainly this week's output data suggest that the recovery is more robust
than widely assumed. The gap between index-linked gilts and long-dated gilts
has recently been pointing to underlying inflation of between 4 1/4 -4 1/2
per cent - well above current levels. And the respected Income Data Services
research concern has also warned that the majority of pay rises this year
were ahead of the current inflation rate of 2.4 per cent.
The current account of the balance of payments, meantime, was in deficit
throughout the recession and UBS Global Research has done extensive research
on the new methodology of compiling the figures that leads it to conclude
that the deficit is worse than it looks.
Yet most of the recent news from the micro-economy is still about corporate
downsizing, consumer-led disinflation and structural improvements in
productivity. Retailers remain under pressure, and leading British
investment institutions are complaining bitterly about the poor returns on
shares in utilities where the regulators have succeeded in reducing costs to
the consumer.
In the motor industry, the management of Ford has revealed that its Dagenham
plant - once famous for its appalling labour relations - is now slightly
more competitive than its German operations. The cost of making a Ford
Fiesta at the east London site plunged by 23 per cent between 1989 and 1993.
The number of hours required to build a car fell by 45 per cent over the
same period.
If that is remotely indicative of what has been happening to competitiveness
in the tradeable goods sector, the scare stories about the balance of
payments may be overdone. Some of the deficit in recession was, anyway, the
counterpart of investment by the Japanese in the motor industry and
elsewhere. Given the fiscal tightening that begins to bite this month and
again this time next year, there must, at the very least, be a possibility
that consumption will henceforth be more restrained and that a better
balanced recovery will impose less strain on the current account.
As far as Germany, France and Japan are concerned, an inflationary upsurge
looks even less plausible. All are operating with a wide gap between actual
and potential output - the best guide to short and medium-term inflation
prospects. And the impact of the bond market slide has been to tighten
monetary policy, especially in France and Germany, where long rates have a
disproportionate influence on economic activity.
An alternative rationalisation argues that synchronised market movements
stem from the way that governments and companies compete with each other to
tap a global pool of funds. Investors choose between them on the basis of
yield, adjusted for likely currency movements. The markets tend, in this
world of global capital, to move together unless economic circumstances are
seen to change.
As Brian Reading of Lombard Street Research points out, synchronised markets
have actually been the norm for much of the post-war period. And they posed
no problems because the G7 economies were subject for much of that time to
exactly the same external shocks, such as the successive oil price hikes and
the subsequent oil price collapse. The trouble has happened where the shocks
have been unsynchronised.
Bretton Woods was tested to destruction when the US and the European and
Japanese economies were out of sync. Similarly, the European exchange rate
mechanism was the victim of the shock of German unification, which first
postponed Europe's recession, then intensified it. The point is that, when
external shocks cause bond and equity prices to move against the grain of
domestic economic conditions, the exchange markets have to provide the
adjustment mechanism.
If, as most mainstream forecasters have been predicting, the dollar is set
to rise when short-term capital flows into the US in response to rising
short-term and long-term rates, Europe will suffer higher long-bond rates as
capital deserts their markets, causing economic cycles to run even more out
of phase. Something would then have to give.
One possibility is that governments would respond to tougher monetary
conditions by relaxing fiscal policy. There are already hints of this in
France, where Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, has been retreating
on all fronts since he capitulated to demands for a less painful
restructuring of Air France last autumn. There are fears that, as the next
general election in Britain comes closer, similar temptations will afflict
the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke.
A broader caveat is that the dollar is simply defying the forecasters. It
appears to be driven at present more by long-term than short-term flows, and
has remained weak because US pension funds and mutual funds continue to
diversify their portfolios overseas to the tune of Dollars 200bn-plus at a
time when the current account deficit is running at more than Dollars 200bn.
If the result is that the dollar remains weak, then long rates in Europe
will not have to rise and the markets will be able to decouple. The European
recovery will grow in strength. The snag is that the dollar may yet decide
to follow the commands of mainstream forecasting opinion.
US short-term rates look low, in real terms, for such a robust recovery and
the Fed's Alan Greenspan is committed to returning them to a 'neutral'
level, having held them artificially low in the period when he was seeking
to recapitalise the debt-laden US banking system. If he raises them further,
as the markets expect, money will flow out of mutual funds back into the
banking system. So the capital flow from US mutual funds to the rest of the
world would shrink dramatically.
As long as markets are out of step with conditions in the underlying
economies, the scope for turmoil will remain. And it could be exacerbated by
the political weakness of so many governments in the developed world,
particularly where, as with the US and Japan, it threatens to lead to trade
friction which upsets markets. The dollar probably holds the key. A
prolonged bout of strength for the US currency would pose Europe with a
nasty dilemma. But if it remains weak, the European markets are in for a
buoyant ride.

FT  09 APR 94 / Leading Article: Mr Major's anniversary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is two years since Mr John Major surprised everyone by winning the
general election. The prime minister fought the 1992 campaign as the
underdog. Polls suggested that there might be a hung parliament. The
Conservative campaign was bungled. During its final stages Mr Major was
derided for his recourse to a soapbox at meetings. In the event, he led the
Tories to an unprecedented fourth victory in a row - and the largest popular
vote in history.
The descent since that day of triumph has been precipitate. According to the
latest Gallup poll, no prime minister and no government have fallen so far
and so quickly out of favour since Gallup began taking soundings of British
opinion in the late 1930s. The prime minister's personal rating is the
lowest for any holder of his office since polling began. He is now back on
the hustings, partly to demonstrate that he is still a vote-winner.
In spite of widespread speculation about possible successors, it is not
clear that he should or will be replaced. The balance sheet of his
performance is mixed. When he became chancellor in 1989 and prime minister
the following year, Mr Major regarded the conquest of inflation as his
central economic task. He maintained this position at great political cost,
both before and after his election victory.
The prolonged squeeze has had the desired effect. Retail prices, which rose
by 9.5 per cent in 1990, are now increasing at a quarter of that rate. The
recession, which can be said to have begun to bite with Mr Major's
chancellorship ('if it isn't hurting, it isn't working'), bottomed out two
years ago. The recovery is well under way, some would say steadily, others
too slowly. The index of industrial production, which fell to 94.5 in
January 1992, rose to 100.7 in February, its highest level since a peak of
102.1 in 1990. Although there are still a million more out of work than when
Mr Major became chancellor, unemployment is falling. The prime minister's
anticipation of a period of sustained non-inflationary growth may be
optimistic, but it is not irrational.
Noble cause
There are other achievements to his credit. In December he took a
significant political risk in a noble cause. Together with the prime
minister of Ireland he signed a joint declaration offering Sinn Fein a place
at the negotiating table in return for a permanent renunciation of violence.
More to the point, Irish republicans were offered a united Ireland if they
could persuade a majority of the people of Ulster and, separately, the Irish
republic to vote for it. The declaration has not brought peace, but it has
set the only defensible terms upon which a settlement might be based and,
most importantly, it has done so in tandem with the Irish government.
Even when it comes to Europe it would be wrong to portray the prime
minister's policies as a total disaster. Before the election, Mr Major
completed a difficult negotiation of the Maastricht treaty. Afterwards, he
pushed it through Parliament, braving a no-confidence vote in the final
moment. His tactical errors in staging set-piece dramas over relations with
the European Union involved misjudgment, but at root they were the
consequence of the deep and long-running division among Conservatives,
compounded by the government's slim overall majority (17 and falling) in the
Commons. The day may come when a different Conservative leader proposes
British withdrawal from the EU. That, too, would split the party from top to
bottom.
Humiliating failure
The negatives on this balance sheet are well-known. Deep cuts in interest
rates, which should spur the recovery, were made possible by Mr Major's most
humiliating failure, the ejection of sterling from the exchange rate
mechanism. Control over public spending, particularly in the pre-election
years 1990 and 1991, was lax. Combined with the recession, this profligacy
has produced the horrendous budget deficit that must now be paid for in
increased taxation. The bills started to come in this week.
It is against this background that the familiar chapter of recent Tory
embarrassments must be read. In happier times, back to basics might have
been followed by sex scandals without rocking the government. Populist law
and order proposals might have been amended in the House of Lords without
arousing much comment. The Citizen's Charter might have sunk without trace,
without catcalls as it did so. The cause of Mr Major's present political
weakness is none of these mishaps. His misfortune is that recovery has been
faltering, and late.
The Labour party has little to crow about. Its present popularity in the
polls is only a reflection of the electorate's disenchantment with the
Conservatives. Mr John Smith, whose second anniversary as leader is a couple
of months away, leads a party with fewer acknowledged policies than it had
when Mr Neil Kinnock lost the election in April 1992. Mr Major will always
lack charisma and his last two years have been unfortunate, occasionally
inept. The leader of the opposition's have been worse: a nullity.

FT  09 APR 94 / Man in the News: Rough words, smooth player - Umberto Bossi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Italian politics, battles are usually won without ever being fought.
Politicians posture loudly, muster their weaponry in public but rarely move
to a real confrontation. Instead, behind the smokescreen of belligerent
statements, they measure the strength of their opponents. Then a deal is
struck on the basis of a hypothetical battle.
It is essential to grasp the nature of this phoney warfare to appreciate the
game played out this week by Mr Umberto Bossi, fiery leader of the populist
Lombard League.
Through a mass of contradictory and increasingly belligerent statements, Mr
Bossi has been seeking to extract the maximum price for forming a government
with media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi and the neo-fascist MSI/National
Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini.
The stakes are high. For the past three years, Mr Bossi and the Northern
League have represented the one genuinely new national force in Italian
politics and have played a vital role in breaking the hold of the
traditional parties. But the sudden appearance and extraordinary electoral
success of fellow northerner Mr Berlusconi and his Forza Italia movement has
threatened to eclipse the League and with it the political career of Mr
Bossi.
Mr Bossi's aim has been to ensure the League retains its identity within the
government likely to be formed by Mr Berlusconi and to prevent the media
mogul from dominating the exercise of power. But behind these strategic
aims, there has been considerable bile.
Mr Bossi finds it hard to stomach the success of Mr Berlusconi whom he
regards as a political parvenu. His political career has been a tough,
lonely 15-year struggle to forge a grassroots protest movement based on the
support of small traders, artisans and blue-collar workers in the industrial
heartland of the north around Milan. His target has been constant:
misgovernment by Rome. It was largely a one-man show based on Mr Bossi's
enormous energy, personal magnetism and his ability to formulate a political
credo in clear terms (often delivered in the coarsest of language).
In contrast, Mr Berlusconi has become a national political leader in less
than four months, riding effortlessly on the back of his huge financial and
media resources. Even the two men's styles of dress are different. Mr
Bossi's clothes are wrinkled, the colours clashing, the tie askew and hair
dishevelled. Mr Berlusconi is carefully manicured, a double-breasted suit
meticulously pressed, the colours matching.
Thus it was not so surprising that at the beginning of this week Mr
Berlusconi was being branded by Mr Bossi as a 'threat to democracy'. By
mid-week, Mr Bossi ever-more garrulous, had dubbed the man likely to form
Italy's next government as Berluskaiser - Berlusconi the Kaiser.
To raise the stakes, Mr Bossi succeeded in injecting a new element into the
phoney war. He gave the impression that he was actually serious when he
threatened to keep the League out of Italy's next government. He also began
to talk of teaming the League with the centre and left parties defeated in
last month's general elections.
Tension increased further when Mr Berlusconi cut off negotiations with Mr
Bossi and threatened - if asked by President Oscar Lugi Scalfaro to form
Italy's next government - to chose whom he pleased. Mr Berlusconi, too, gave
the impression his threat was real.
But by the end of the week, it looked pretty much as though all parties had
assessed each other's weaknesses and strengths. The three main parties that
formed the Freedom Alliance (which won 366 of the 630 seats in the chamber
of deputies) look condemned to forge an agreement to govern Italy.
Mr Bossi was even seen shaking hands with Mr Fini. This was remarkable
considering that Mr Bossi had recently dubbed the neo-fascist leader as a
'political nobody', and that during the election campaign he had said:
'Fascism cannot be allowed into the government. This would open the doors to
Nazis in Germany and Le Pen in France.' Until now Mr Bossi has insisted his
electoral alliance was solely with Mr Berlusconi and Forza Italia.
The kind of compromise Mr Bossi is seeking would be based on a clear
commitment by the next government to bring in constitutional reforms that
would make Italy a more federal state. In return, he would accept both Mr
Berlusconi and Mr Fini's desire to introduce a strong directly-elected
president (such as in France) but with a shorter mandate.
But Mr Bossi can only sell this to his League rank and file, he said in a
newspaper interview yesterday, if 'Berlusconi divests himself of all
interests which are incompatible with holding government office'.
Mr Bossi acknowledged this could be an obstacle. 'This autocrat will have
immense power in his hands: the government, parliament, television,
newspapers, publishing, insurance, mutual funds and store chains. This has
to be monitored . . . The League will do this. It will be the guarantor of
democracy.'
Mr Bossi is right to raise these issues, just as he is to question the
presence in a future Berlusconi-led government of the MSI, given its
unreconstructured fascist wing. But the Lombard leader's political
credibility is undermined by the opportunistic way he took advantage of his
alliance with Mr Berlusconi and Forza Italia to fight the elections.
If the League does not join the government, it risks losing supporters to Mr
Berlusconi. Mr Bossi would then become the head of a querulous regional
party, whose power base was limited to Piedmont, Lombardy and the Veneto. If
the League does join the government, it has to keep itself distinct from
Forza Italia and ensure it is strong enough to outlive the Berlusconi
phenomenon.
It is also a fair bet that Mr Bossi himself will not be part of the
government. He wants to keep his powder dry to snipe from the side-lines,
permanently threatening to pull League support away from Mr Berlusconi. The
next few days will determine whether Mr Bossi will become a serious player
on the national scene or be marginalised to run a vituperative regional
party.

FT  09 APR 94 / Water price-rise secrecy urged: Industry watchdog writes to
companies threatening to exclude them from review process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Byatt, the water industry regulator, has threatened to bar water
companies from part of the price review process if they do not sign secrecy
agreements.
If utilities do not agree to keep secret the draft price increases which
they are due to receive from Ofwat at the end of May - known as draft Ks -
they will have to wait until a final decision is reached in July.
This means they would neither receive a draft K - the rate above inflation
by which water companies will be allowed to increase prices - nor be allowed
to make representations to Ofwat for an improved increase.
In a letter sent to the managing directors of the regulated businesses, Mr
Byatt said that after discussions with the Stock Exchange it was not deemed
necessary for companies to divulge the draft Ks to shareholders.
But companies are worried about limiting their flexibility to inform
shareholders as fears increase of a false market in water shares in the
two-month interval.
'Directors will find it difficult to sign away their rights to take the
necessary action if a false market develops in their shares,' said one water
company executive. 'It looks like some compromise will have to be reached.'
Institutions and companies have voiced strong concerns over the difficulty
of keeping the draft proposals secret. Some estimate that substantially more
than 250 people will have the price-sensitive information, with many outside
the control of companies being asked to sign agreements.
For example, Mr Byatt has said that where possible the 10 regional chairmen
of the Ofwat customer service committees would be involved in
representations by water companies.
Ofwat said yesterday there was no chance of a leak from its organisation.
'We have no fears or anxieties about the watertightness of our
organisation,' it said. The companies disagree. 'God knows how many people
at Ofwat will have the information,' said one executive.
Mr Byatt is privately criticised by companies and institutions for deciding
to release the date of the draft increases, unlike the process in the
electricity industry. 'Byatt has made it a formal process and the whole
world knows the provisional Ks are knocking around,' said another executive.
'Professor Littlechild (the electricity regulator) has to go through the
same process, but it is informal.' Electricity companies have not faced a
false market developing, he said.

FT  09 APR 94 / Unionists get clarification of London's declaration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Northern Ireland minister last night used a speech to a pro-unionist group
to provide clarification of part of the Downing Street declaration and to
reassure unionists that London is not indifferent to Ulster's future.
Speaking just hours before this week's 72-hour IRA ceasefire ended, Mr
Michael Ancram said London would 'vigorously and wholeheartedly' support
Northern Ireland's wish to remain in the union for as long as the greater
number of the province's people so wished.
He said the joint declaration's assertion that Britain had 'no selfish
strategic or economic interest' in the province meant only that the
government had no agenda of its own that would cause it to frustrate the
population's wishes.
His remarks to a meeting in Cambridge came as Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein
president, attacked Mr John Major for his 'provocative and belligerent' tone
during the ceasefire.
Mr Adams said Mr Major's preoccupation with the survival of his government
was a 'minus factor' in the peace process. But the significance of the IRA's
gesture 'will not have been missed by the policy makers at Whitehall'.
The Sinn Fein president, who earlier this week in effect discounted the
chances of a ceasefire extension, hinted in Belfast there was a potential
for some further initiative from the IRA at a later date, although he would
not be specific about what that might be.
Mr Ancram told the Friends of the Union there was at present 'no widespread
support' for a joint authority in Northern Ireland. This was 'not something
which . . . I expect to see emerging from any genuine process of dialogue
leading to an agreed solution'.
Meanwhile, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, used a speech in
Toronto to pledge that the government would persevere in its efforts to
forge a lasting settlement.

FT  09 APR 94 / Leadership poll boosts Heseltine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine's credentials for the Conservative leadership were
bolstered yesterday when an opinion poll suggested that he was Mr John
Major's nearest challenger to lead the party. One-third of Tory supporters
think he should lead the party into the next general election.
In findings that could further damage Mr Major's leadership prospects, the
MORI poll put him just four points ahead of Mr Heseltine among Tory
supporters - and well behind him when the views of all voters were taken
into account.
But as Mr Major prepared to celebrate the second anniversary of the Tories'
general election victory, the poll dealt a blow to the leadership
aspirations of other potential challengers.
Yesterday's poll, published in London's Evening Standard newspaper,
indicated that only 12 per cent of Tory supporters thought chancellor Mr
Kenneth Clarke, until recently considered the frontrunner to succeed Mr
Major, would best lead the party into the next general election.
Mr Michael Portillo and Mr Michael Howard, regarded as leading challengers
from the right, polled just 4 per cent and 1 per cent respectively - less
than Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, who polled 7 per cent.
Among the public at large, 32 per cent rated Mr Heseltine the best
prospective leader, against just 19 per cent for Mr Major and 11 per cent
for Mr Clarke.
Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, marked the election anniversary by
publishing a booklet purporting to setting out the government's
achievements.

FT  09 APR 94 / Ceasefire followed by the sound of silence: Michael Cassell
and Tim Coone review the effects of the IRA's gesture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect was tantalising if unrealistic. All the British government had
to do, according to Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, was to talk to
republicans for one hour and the door to peace in Northern Ireland could
open.
This morning, with the IRA's three-day ceasefire over, the door remains
stubbornly shut.
The IRA's decision to call a post-Easter suspension of violence may have
been unconditional and unprecedented - almost certainly arising more from
pressure upon it to stop the killing than on any fundamental change of heart
 -but it never looked good enough.
Given some expectations, especially in Dublin, that the provisionals had
planned a more dramatic, open-ended gesture aimed at ending the political
stalemate, the 72-hour standstill impressed few people outside the
republican movement. Why should anyone be grateful for what amounted to 'a
suspended sentence of death', Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland
secretary, asked yesterday.
If the IRA and Sinn Fein were trying to drive a wedge between London and
Dublin they will have been deeply disappointed by the two governments' show
of unity. If they ever calculated that Mr John Major's own parlous position
might force him into taking risks to win a triumphant peace they were wrong
again.
The Irish government called the respite from murder and intimidation
'pathetically brief' and its senior officials admit privately they expected
something longer. The strength of reaction in Dublin is thought to have come
as a surprise to republicans, who expected a more positive response after
comments from Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, that he would seek to
'build upon' a temporary ceasefire.
Having moved to accommodate Sinn Fein by dropping the broadcasting ban on
the party and by providing, unlike London, extensive 'clarification' of the
Downing Street declaration, Dublin feels let down.
Throughout the ceasefire London continued to play a straight bat, repeatedly
dismissing it as a 'cynical ploy' to extract concessions under threat of
renewed violence. While the government chanted its peace mantra - 'no talks
without a permanent end to violence' - unionists talked of IRA volunteers
heading for the seaside to plan their next atrocities.
Sinn Fein, still battling to extract clarification from London on the joint
declaration but refusing to say what Britain could clarify that had not
already been made clear by Dublin, hailed the IRA action as evidence of a
flexible and open-minded republican movement anxious for peace. Republicans
having taken the initiative, Mr Adams said, it was a case of 'over to you,
Mr Major'.
This week, however, the depth of Sinn Fein's anger at being marginalised in
the political process - the price it is made to pay for its militaristic
connections - became clear. Britain, insisted Mr Martin McGuinness, a
leading Sinn Fein official, must stop treating it as a second-class
political party instead of one speaking for those who were 'no longer
prepared to be oppressed, humiliated, degraded and discriminated against'.
To republicans, their war is an issue of pride and dignity as well as a
matter of national boundaries.
Sinn Fein has arguably been on firmer ground in citing the British
government's previous, lengthy dialogue with republicans. Why, given the
chance of a real breakthrough, is the government refusing to talk now, they
inquire?
Last year Sir Patrick won warm support from MPs for justifying contacts with
republicans as an attempt to save lives. But in the wake of a joint
declaration which enshrines the principles of majority consent, he now says
there can be no truck with active terrorists.
Efforts to bridge the gap between the two sides included unsuccessful calls
for a go-between to relay Sinn Fein's specific concerns to the government.
Hopes that the public rhetoric was concealing secret contacts seem, so far,
unfounded, though suspicions linger that they will eventually be resumed.
The failure to make any headway this week means further ceasefires will be
tough to achieve. The position of those within Sinn Fein, such as Mr Adams,
who helped bring it about could be weakened. The IRA knows that if it
splits, it dies; it does not intend to split.
As the province prepared itself uneasily for evidence that the ceasefire was
over, Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, called
on the IRA to halt its armed struggle and help break down the barriers in
the hearts and minds of the Irish people. The last 72 hours notwithstanding,
it does not yet appear ready to heed the call.

FT  09 APR 94 / Mortgage benefit curbed further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People on income support will not be able to claim for interest payments on
mortgages which they have taken out or increased while receiving benefit,
under rules introduced by the government yesterday.
The rules, which come into effect next month, are intended to prevent any
higher payments of income support to meet the interest on new home loans or
any rise in existing loans.
Mr William Hague, junior social security minister, said yesterday: 'The
regulations represent a timely preventative measure at a time when the
housing market is showing some signs of improvement.'
There are a few exceptions to the new limit: for example, where a loan is
taken out for essential repairs.
The move represents a further curb on the availability of income support to
meet mortgage interest repayments. Ministers have made clear that they want
to cut such benefit.
In August, a ceiling of Pounds 150,000 was imposed on the mortgage amount
for which income support would be available, and this will be lowered to
Pounds 125,000 for new claimants from Monday.
Mortgage lenders have expressed unease about the prospect of more reductions
in availability of income support for interest repayments.
The original crackdown came after ministerial embarrassment over a case in
which mortgage interest payments of almost Pounds 2,000 a week were made to
a former insurance sales executive.

<TEXT>
The longer leading indicator of the UK economy rose in February, the Central
Statistical Office said. The indicator predicts trends 13 months ahead, and
is based on an analysis of five separate economic statistics.
One of the main reasons for the increase was a rise in the slope of the
yield curve, which compares short-term with long-term interest rates.

A leading figure from the Labour party's traditionalist wing last night
urged the party not to be too cautious in debating its future strategy.
Mr David Blunkett, the party chairman and shadow health secretary, said it
was critical that in avoiding Conservative traps on spending commitments,
Labour did not 'fall into the trap of re-running the 1992 (general)
election' when the party's priorities were not in tune with the
electorate's.

<TEXT>
The future of Norton, a nostalgic name in British motor-cycling, looks
increasingly uncertain amid claims from the company's workers that the
manufacturer's Canadian owners have failed to support its relaunch.
Norton employees have called for a meeting to discuss the future of the
company with directors of Norton Motors (1993), the Canadian-backed group
which last year paid Pounds 500,000 for the Midlands plant.
In a letter to Ms Rozanda Skalbania, one of Norton's new directors, they
write: 'Since the takeover in August 1993, and now nearly six months later,
we have not seen anything positive happening.'
In reply, Ms Skalbania said last night: 'The comments in the document are
misinformed and inaccurate.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The investigation into the past business dealings of Mr Edward du Cann, the
former Conservative party chairman, was stepped up yesterday when creditors
appointed two trustees in bankruptcy to look into his financial affairs.
Sir Edward was made bankrupt last March with liabilities estimated at more
than Pounds 1.2m.
A creditors' meeting in Exeter yesterday voted to appoint Mr Christopher
Morris, of accountants Touche Ross, and Mr Christopher Hughes, of Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, as trustees. This allows greater investigation into Mr du Cann's
financial affairs than the appointment of the official receiver.

FT  09 APR 94 / To Concorde: a dominatrix daughter?: Daniel Green on whether
the figures for a second generation of supersonic aircraft would ever add up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concorde's daughter could be a seductive creature. She could combine the
slender graceful lines of her parent with the power to dominate the world of
business travel. With her extra endurance she could reach across the Pacific
Ocean and link Europe with Asia in five hours. Her extra strength could lift
250 people instead of the 100 that cram into her aged ancestor.
So it is not surprising that British Aerospace, together with Aerospatiale
of France and Deutsche Aerospace, proposed on Thursday to bring her closer
to reality. They now want government money and European Union funds to
continue feasibility studies. They are asking for most of the Pounds 60m
they say is needed to step up such studies.
Independent experts and airline chiefs, however, believe that few of the
other numbers add up.
A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the market for Concorde's
daughter is of the order of 100 aircraft - far short of the 500 to 1,000
that the three partners regard as necessary to set up a profitable
production line.
The calculation runs as follows: Concorde's daughter would attract almost
entirely business passengers. At a capacity of 250, that is the equivalent
of roughly 2 1/2 Boeing 747 business-class cabins. Because she would take
less than half as long to do the journey she is twice as productive. You can
double again because, at an optimistic guess, half the current
business-class passengers on a route such as Los Angeles to Tokyo might be
prepared to pay for a premium-priced ticket.
That gives each new Concorde the capacity currently satisfied by 10 Boeing
747s. The 747 is the standard aircraft for long-haul flights and there have
been 1,000 sold since 1970, giving a market of 100 for Concorde's child.
These kinds of calculations convince City analysts that there is no real
chance of the project taking off. Nor do the airlines who would buy her
believe the project should be taken too seriously.
Mr Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, which has been the
world's biggest carrier by sales for several years, dismisses the idea of a
new generation of supersonic passenger aircraft principally because the
project would be too expensive.
Mr Sash Tusa, an analyst with stockbroker UBS, says that the commercial cost
of each of Concorde's daughters would be 'several hundred million dollars'
compared with the price of a subsonic 250-seater of less than Dollars 100m.
Mr Crandall adds that there are too many environmental issues to be
overcome. These include the sonic boom and damage to the ozone layer from an
aircraft that flies much higher than conventional aeroplanes.
Mr Rod Muddle, director of planning at British Airways, says that the market
estimate of 100 aircraft is reasonable but only a radical design
breakthrough would make the aircraft a commercial proposition.
'If it had running costs about 20 per cent higher than a conventional
aircraft then we could offer tickets at a small premium price and enough
passengers would switch,' he said. Running costs per passenger for today's
Concorde are 'several times' those for a Boeing 747, he says.
British Airways and Air France would probably be the first buyers of a new
supersonic passenger aircraft because their Concorde fleets will become too
old to continue flying soon after the year 2005, which is when British
Aerospace says the new aircraft would be ready.
However the real need for BA and other airlines, especially the Asian
operators, is not for glamour but size. Airports are already overcrowded.
Larger aircraft would allow more people to fly without trying to trying to
cram in more aircraft.
'The timing of the new supersonic aircraft project is bad,' says Mr Muddle.
'The investment is going to be tens of billions of pounds. It should be
first spent on a 600-seater aircraft that flies at less than the speed of
sound.'

FT  09 APR 94 / Picture of working Tyne fogged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traditional river industries risk being squeezed off the banks of the Tyne
by housing and leisure developments which could leave some areas 'sterile',
the Tyne Port Users' Association says.
Spurred by the struggle for survival of Swan Hunter, the Tyne's last
shipbuilder, and the area's success in winning Nissan's new UK car terminal,
the association launched a campaign yesterday to reassert the Tyne's
importance.
Mr Douglas Hamilton, chairman, told a seminar in Gateshead that the
association's 50 members employed 8,000 people with a further 10,000 jobs
dependent on the river.
Mr Hamilton, managing director of Tyne and Wear Tugs, called for a long-term
strategy to safeguard riverside industrial sites and prevent them being
'sterilised' by housing and hotels.
Speakers expressed concern that marine industry was being squeezed out.
Their fears are based on the dramatic transformation of the lower reaches of
the Tyne.
Mr Hamilton said he applauded much of the redevelopment spearheaded by the
government-backed Tyne and Wear Development Corporation, but was worried
about loss of berths and industrial frontage near the river mouth.
Mr Alastair Balls, chief executive of the corporation, which has financed
offshore industry, ship repair, fishing and port developments, denied the
criticisms. 'There's not a single site we have taken out of industrial use
where a viable project has been supported by a business,' he said.
South Tyneside Council, which is supporting a proposal to turn the disused
Hawthorn Leslie site at Hebburn, the country's only intact shipyard dating
from the early 20th century, into a hotel and leisure development, said: 'We
have to work with the world as it is, not . . . as we'd like it to be.'
The association's tough new line was warmly welcomed by Mr Paul Winch, an
unemployed naval architect who has spent five years campaigning for a
yachtbuilding yard and maritime craft centre at the Hawthorn Leslie site.
'There's this label which had been put on the river, that it's a lame duck,'
he said. 'But now I'm very heartened.'

FT  09 APR 94 / Lottery pair lead in vetting stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly nine weeks into the great National Lottery stakes two of the bidders
appear to have gone into an early lead - at least as far as the volume of
questions they have received from the Office of National Lottery.
The two are Camelot, a consortium that includes De La Rue and Cadbury
Schweppes, and Lotco, an associated company of the Rank Organisation.
They were already widely considered to be front-ranking applicants before
receiving a greater number of vetting questions than other bidders.
Camelot advertised for staff last month and has already had more than 2,000
applicants for about 200 of the more important jobs. It intends to make
conditional appointments before the winner of the lottery is announced.
Most other candidates being vetted have received only a handful of questions
 -typically a mere three or four. Those who have had only a small number of
queries range from Games For Good Causes, the Ladbroke-MAI consortium; the
Great British Lottery Company, which includes Granada and Carlton
Communications; Richard Branson's UK Lottery Foundation; the Rothschild
Tattersalls Lottery Consortium; and Rainbow, a consortium put together by
Sir Patrick Sheehy, the BAT chairman. The position of The Enterprise
Lottery, a consortium including the Tote and Thorn EMI, is unknown.
Camelot is believed to have received several dozen questions and Rank has
also received a significant number of detailed questions.
The eight consortia are vying for the right to run the UK's first national
lottery in modern times - an operation that could turn into the world's
largest single lottery.
The Office of the National Lottery has reached the half-way stage in the
selection process and hopes to announce the winner by the last week of May.

FT  09 APR 94 / Conservative group proposes welfare opt-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Insurance rebates should be offered to anyone who wishes to opt out
of receiving state welfare payments, the Conservative Way Forward group will
argue in a forthcoming policy paper.
The paper, which claims that the time for welfare reform has arrived, will
set out detailed proposals that the Thatcherite pressure group says offer
the prospects of 'a better way ahead'.
According to the group, the government must be prepared to encourage people
to opt out of the basic state pension and other benefits in a phased way.
The paper's main proposals are:
The state earnings-related pension scheme should be abolished. The group
says contracting out has been 'a great success' but 'those who remain in
Serps threaten to place an intolerable burden on the state when they
retire'.
The state pension age should eventually be raised to 67.
Child benefit should be allowed to 'wither' while income support and family
credit are used to ensure those families most in need continue to receive
help. Individuals with 'substantial' private pension income should not be
entitled to full invalidity benefit.
The group adds: 'In the welfare society of the future, benefits will be paid
out of private insurance contributions for the majority, alongside a state
benefit system which caters for those for whom private insurance is not an
option.'
Alison Smith writes: People on income support will not be able to claim for
interest payments on mortgages which they have taken out or increased while
receiving benefit, under rules introduced by the government yesterday.
The rules, which are due to come into effect at the start of next month, are
intended to prevent any higher payments of income support to meet the
interest on new home loans or any rise in existing loans.
Mr William Hague, junior social security minister, said yesterday: 'The
regulations represent a timely preventative measure at a time when the
housing market is showing some signs of improvement.'
There are a few exceptions to the new limit: for example, where a loan is
taken out for essential repairs.
The move represents a further curb on the availability of income support to
meet mortgage interest repayments. Ministers have made clear that they want
to cut such benefit.
In August, a ceiling of Pounds 150,000 was imposed on the mortgage amount
for which income support would be available, and this will be lowered to
Pounds 125,000 for new claimants from Monday.
Mortgage lenders have expressed unease about the prospect of more reductions
in availability of income support for interest repayments.
The original crackdown came after ministerial embarrassment over a case in
which mortgage interest payments of almost Pounds 2,000 a week were made to
a former insurance sales executive.

FT  09 APR 94 / Prospects brighten for pit leasing deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal yesterday entered the final stages of negotiations to lease
pits it no longer operates with the strong possibility that nine collieries
 -far more than first expected - will be run by the private sector.
The corporation privately believes that there is room in the market for only
about six of the pits. Mr Neil Clarke, its chairman, has warned that some
producers may be 'squeezed from the market' after privatisation.
It said yesterday that it was entering detailed negotiations with a
preferred tenderer at each of its collieries at Calverton in
Nottinghamshire, Silverdale in Staffordshire, and Hatfield in South
Yorkshire.
The corporation said that 'provided no insurmountable difficulties arise' it
wanted to reach agreements as soon as possible with the three companies
involved - RJB Mining at Calverton, Coal Investments at Silverdale, and
Hatfield Coal, a management buy-out team.
The three pits were among the last of 28 which have been offered by British
Coal to the private sector in the past year.
The leasing arrangements are a prelude to privatisation of the rest of the
industry later this year and next when up to 16 'core' pits will be offered
for sale in five packages.
Leases and licences have already been granted at four of the 28.
Negotiations at two other pits are at an advanced stage.
The government made a commitment to give the private sector a chance to
operate pits closed by British Coal after the public outcry over the
run-down of the industry in 1992 and 1993.
Few analysts believe that more than two or three will be viable, especially
as the collieries have no contracts for sales.
However, all the pits will produce less coal than under British Coal's
stewardship. In most cases it will be less than half.
The private-sector operators believe they can make them profitable by
improving mining techniques, working practices and marketing.
The four pits that have already been leased are Clipstone in Nottinghamshire
and Rossington in South Yorkshire, both of which are being operated by RJB,
together with Trentham, in Staffordshire, and Coventry, which are being
operated by Coal Investments.
Coal Investments, led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal marketing
director, is also negotiating for Markham Main in South Yorkshire.
Betws Anthracite, a management buy-out team, is in the final stages of
negotiation for the Betws pit in south Wales.

FT  09 APR 94 / Minister stresses transport shift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any fresh impetus to encourage private-sector investment in Britain's
transport infrastructure will have to come from companies and banks rather
than government, Mr Roger Freeman, the transport minister, said yesterday.
He said proposals would be considered on a project-by-project basis rather
than by reference to a rigid set of rules. The approach would be deal-driven
to allow flexibility, particularly in the early stages of negotiation and
development.
Mr Freeman's comments, made at a conference on Merseyside, may disappoint
construction companies and other potential private investors in
infrastructure projects which had been looking for a stronger lead from
ministers.
The government had encouraged joint financing of projects with companies by
starting its private-sector initiative, he told the conference.
Companies were 'understandably worried' about investing time, effort and
money in uncertain or ill-defined projects because of 'legislative, planning
and public-policy risks' in the early stages, said Mr Freeman, but he
remained convinced these problems could be solved.
To compensate for these risks the government had agreed to make
contributions to the costs of preparing a bid. In the case of the Channel
tunnel rail link this had worked out at Pounds 1.5m per competing
consortium.
Mr Freeman added that government might agree to dispense with competition
for some projects, provided the private sector produced something
innovative. No two projects were the same: the right solution for the west
coast main railway line might not apply to a new Scottish air traffic
control centre or a new road bridge over the Thames, he said.

FT  09 APR 94 / Top advertisers 'would welcome BBC airtime'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two-thirds of top-spending advertisers would like to advertise on BBC
television, with the Nine O'Clock News heading the list of most attractive
programmes, a consultancy says today.
Their ambitions are almost certain to be thwarted: it is expected that the
government will reject the possibility of allowing the BBC to take
advertising when its royal charter comes up for renewal in 1996.
The findings of the survey by Media Audits highlight some dissatisfaction
among advertisers with ITV programmes and their ability to deliver desirable
audiences.
It also underlines fears about the increased concentration of the selling of
advertising airtime, caused by the spate of recent TV company mergers. A
total of 85 per cent of advertisers surveyed said ITV mergers worked against
their interests.
This dissatisfaction comes as figures from the trade magazine, Media Week,
show that ITV airtime prices for May will be at least 18 per cent higher
than they were a year ago - the highest level of 'airtime inflation' for at
least five years.
The list of advertisers' top 10 BBC programmes do not necessarily have the
highest viewing figures - the Nine O'Clock News, for example, does not even
figure in the latest official viewing figures for the top 30 programmes, but
its upmarket audience would be attractive to advertisers.
The standard of ITV programmes, apart from soap operas, was seen by
advertisers to have declined, with 87 per cent of respondents saying that
comedy programmes were worse than a year ago. Sports coverage, news
programmes, children's programmes, documentaries and drama were all seen to
have declined. BBC and Channel 4 programmes, meanwhile, were generally seen
to have improved.
Mr Michael Cluff, Media Audits managing director, said: 'ITV's long-term
interests will be best served by investing in its programming. The perceived
problem is that ITV constantly chases short-term profitability.'
The survey was compiled from 80 responses from the top 300 advertisers,
accounting for about 25 per cent of annual spending on TV advertising. The
most attractive BBC programmes for advertisers included the Nine O'Clock
News; soaps EastEnders and Neighbours; and sport programmes.

FT  09 APR 94 / Political turmoil may slow Mexican recovery: Business
confidence is tumbling and interest rates are rising sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a rapid recovery in Mexico's economy is receding after a
series of blows to business confidence and a sharp rise in domestic interest
rates.
The government has officially forecast growth of 3 per cent this year. But
officials now say that this may be too optimistic. The increase in US
bond-yields, and political turmoil following the peasant uprising in Chiapas
and the murder of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, have pushed
up short-term interest rates to over 14 per cent, and are expected to reduce
private-sector investment.
'The recovery expected for the second quarter could now be postponed to the
third quarter,' said one senior government official 'If this (political
uncertainty) goes on for much longer, the consequences could be worse.'
Most private sector economists have recently cut their estimates for growth.
Mr Ernesto Cervera, of the consultancy GEA, says the economy will grow by
about 2 per cent this year, from an earlier estimate of 2.4 per cent. Mr
Rodolfo De la Torre, of the Centre of Analysis and Economic Investigation
has cut his forecast from 4.1 per cent to 3.5 per cent, and says he may
reduce it further.
The expectation of low growth has contributed to a 25 per cent fall in the
Mexican stock market, from its high of early February, as analysts have cut
estimates for earnings of leading companies. The decline has forced some
companies to put off equity offerings, due to finance investment.
A weak economy could spell trouble for Mexico's governing party, which faces
presidential elections this August. Last year Mexico's economy expanded by
just 0.4 per cent, and in the final two quarters growth was negative.
Opposition to government policies has grown as unemployment has increased,
and business profits have fallen.
The slowdown has caused a shift in government thinking on economic policy in
the recognition that obstacles to growth and inefficiencies in the economy
are greater than once thought. The campaign platform of the governing party
puts much greater stress on industrial policy, legal reform, employment
generation and income redistribution than has the administration of
President Carlos Salinas.
The government expected a significant pick-up in economic growth this year
based on an increase in public spending and expansion in private sector
investment. Last year private investment all but dried up, largely because
of high real interest rates, uncertainty that prevailed over the fate of the
North American Free Trade Agreement, and the unwillingness of many banks to
lend money because of problems with non-performing loans.
But the uncertainty over the North American Free Trade Agreement has been
replaced by concern over the electoral and political process this year. The
uprising in Chiapas followed by the assassination of Mr Colosio has left
some wondering whether Mexico is facing a period of sustained political
upheaval, which could affect the business and economic climate.
Such fears seem to have increased after the government's special
investigator concluded that seven people conspired to kill Mr Colosio,
including an official from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in
charge of security at the rally at which the candidate was killed.
Speculation over who ordered Mr Colosio's death has over-shadowed the
campaign of the PRI's new presidential candidate, Mr Ernesto Zedillo.
The political uncertainty has coincided with higher US bond yields, which
have made Mexican debt instrument less attractive to foreign investors. Both
events have forced up Mexican interest rates. In this week's auction
short-term rates on 28-day paper rose to 14.31 per cent, compared to 8.81
per cent in late February. Inflation is expected to fall under 7 per cent
this year.
Mexico is particularly vulnerable to perceptions of political risk and high
US interest rates because of its need to finance a current account deficit
that last year reached Dollars 23.4bn, and is expected to be still more this
year. The government is formally committed to a stable exchange rate, and
therefore cannot increase trade competitiveness through a one-off
devaluation.
The administration nevertheless argues that once the uncertainty is
resolved, prospects for growth are high. In its annual report, the Central
Bank points to buoyant exports, the steady rise in manufacturing and sound
public finances as reasons for optimism. Such a view may turn out to be
correct. But after waiting more than five years for the fruits of pro-market
economic reforms of President Salinas, many Mexicans are becoming impatient.

The US vice president, Al Gore, will join trade ministers in Marrakesh next
week for the signing of the world's most far-reaching trade deal by the 120
nations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Gore's attendance will give prominence to the Gatt and its successor, the
World Trading Organisation and will stress the US commitment to a workable
multilateral trading system. The vice president played an important role in
getting Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement,
when he debated and prevailed against Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire
who opposed the pact.
Mr Gore's attendance in Marrakesh could help the US recapture its lead in
trade matters following criticism of its aggressive Japanese trade policy
and its push to include labour rights on the WTO agenda.
Although Mr Gore will address the ministers, it will be the US trade
representative, Mr Mickey Kantor, who signs the pact on Friday.

FT  09 APR 94 / Israeli police seek to expel Palestinians

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israeli police were yesterday searching for Palestinians in an effort to
expel from the Jewish state workers from the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip after threats by Arab extremists.
Mr Moshe Shahal, police minister, said his forces were carrying out an
intensive campaign 'in what is called cleansing the area of residents of the
territories who stay in Israel without permits'.
His comments came after an emergency session of the inner security cabinet
met in Tel Aviv to discuss security measures in the run up to independence
day celebrations on Thursday, which Islamic guerrillas have vowed to turn
into a 'day of hell'.
Israel sealed off the territories last Thursday night after two attacks in
24 hours by Islamic extremists left eight Israelis dead. Palestinians are
barred indefinitely from travelling from the territories to Israel proper
and to Arab East Jerusalem.
Mr Uri Dromi, a government spokesman, said the cabinet was taking threats by
the Islamic Hamas movement seriously, particularly its pledge to attack
Israelis on independence days when tens of thousands of Jews are on the
roads.
The cabinet also decided to increase the number of work permits available
for foreign workers, continuing the process under which Israel has been
substituting Palestinian workers for foreigners. Until the latest closure,
up to 70,000 Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza were working in
Israel.
Mr Hussein al-Sheikh, a Palestinian leader in the West Bank, criticised the
Israel clampdown on all Palestinians. 'This is part of a collective
punishment,' he said.
In Hebron, which is still under military control since the February 25
massacre of 29 Palestinians by a Jewish settler, soldiers shot and wounded
at least 25 Arabs during a private peace mission by the Rev Jesse Jackson,
the US civil rights leader.

Russia has begun to invest in, or place orders with, plants in former Soviet
states in order to give work to Russians in those states.
The government fears a flood of Russian immigrants from 'the near abroad' as
plants close because of lack of orders and supplies.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy premier in charge of regional policy, has
forecast 3m may return from central Asia alone over the next few years, to
add to the 350,000 who have already returned in the past three years.
In Estonia, the giant gas monopoly Gazprom has bought - in competition with
three unnamed western companies - a mineral fertiliser plant in Kohtla
Jarva, a town largely inhabited by Russians. The plant was closed last year
because the price of gas - used in large quantities for its product -
reached near world levels.
Interviewed in the daily Izvestiya, the plant's director, Mr Nikolai
Kutashov, said 1,200 jobs would be restored. He said Gazprom would 'not sell
to us for world prices - but that will allow us to stand on our feet again'.
In Kyrgyzstan Russia is about to place orders with military industrial
plants, according to Mr Osmon Ibraimov, a deputy prime minister.
Speaking to the Russian Information Agency, Mr Ibraimov stressed the main
beneficiaries of the investment would be Russian workers in the plant, and
that the decisions were being made primarily to save their jobs.
Russians are usually over-represented in the workforces of the large
industrial concerns in the former Soviet republics where they make up a
significant part of the population. However, efforts to maintain their jobs
are unlikely to make a significant difference to the migration that is
already under way.

FT  09 APR 94 / Bank chiefs oppose resurrection of ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European central bank governors, led by the Bundesbank, yesterday staged a
mini-rebellion against efforts to resurrect the exchange rate mechanism.
At a meeting of European Union finance ministers in Athens, the governors
made clear that member states must cut national budget deficits and lower
inflation to build a sustainable recovery as the pre-requisite for a single
European currency.
France, Germany and the UK lined up behind what appeared to be an emerging
consensus that the road to European monetary union may no longer lie via the
old narrow fluctuation bands for members of the old ERM.
Last August, EU ministers agreed to introduce 15 per cent fluctuation bands
for currencies inside the ERM, ending the earlier system which operated on
2.25 and 6 per cent fluctuation bands.
One participant at yesterday's informal meeting said central bankers had
'cut loose' during an afternoon session devoted to the operation of the
European Monetary Institute, precursor of a future European central bank.
'There is a new realism about the debate on monetary union,' he said.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said member states could no longer
look to the ERM to provide external economic discipline. The new emphasis
had to be on internal efforts, he said.
Mr Henning Christopherson, EU economics commissioner, said it was too early
to predict the end of ERM. But he agreed with Mr Tietmeyer that it was
necessary to have much greater economic convergence before monetary union
was credible.
Ministers expressed concern that the recent rise in US interest rates could
damage Europe's efforts to reduce the cost of borrowing. But hopes of
'decoupling' European rates depended on members states putting their own
economic house in order.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, expressed satisfaction
with the drift of debate on monetary union. He told BBC radio that he was
'in the mainstream' - a contrast with Britain's isolation in the row over
voting rights in the European union.
Ministers agreed separately to draw up a list of ten international road and
rail projects which could be approved at the European summit in Corfu in
June. France, Germany and the UK said these and future trans-European
networks should be funded by the European investment and existing financial
instruments rather than the European Commission raising extra money on the
capital markets.
Mr Christopherson said 'nothing has been ruled out', adding that some
projects, including the proposed Channel Tunnel rail link in the UK, might
not be able to be financed by private capital alone.

FT  09 APR 94 / Economic worries hit Venezuela debt ratings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moody's, the international credit rating agency, has lowered the rating for
Venezuela's long-term foreign currency bearer bonds to Ba2 from Ba1 and the
rating for non-bearer bonds to Ba3 from Ba2. About Dollars 21bn (Pounds
14.3bn) worth of rated debt is affected.
The agency said Venezuela faced a period of difficult policy choices
regarding its weak domestic economy, the deterioration in public sector
finances and rising social pressures. 'The imbalances can only be corrected
gradually, which may hurt the long-term creditworthiness of the country.'
It added that the decline in oil prices since 1992 had accentuated many of
the underlying structural problems of the economy and had highlighted the
weaknesses in the composition of fiscal revenues.
The country is also still experiencing problems in the banking sector
following the failure in January of Banco Latino, the country's second
largest bank.
Six private banks are believed to be dependent on government financial
assistance following heavy withdrawals in the wake of the Latino crisis.

FT  09 APR 94 / Yeltsin spokesman flies G7 kite

<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman, who has been known to announce foreign
policy initiatives that are subsequently dismissed by the government,
yesterday suggested linking Russia's joining Nato's Partnership for Peace
with its admission to the Group of Seven.
Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov said he believed the military co-operation foreseen
by Nato's partnership plan might be difficult without closer economic
co-ordination between Russia and the world's seven richest industrialised
nations.
'How can we talk about such co-operation, abstracting ourselves from
economic co-operation?' he said. 'You know that Russia wants to join G7. Why
shouldn't these two problems be linked? If we are invited to co-operate in
political and military spheres, why shouldn't this be expanded to economic
co-operation?'
The G7 countries, all Nato members except Japan, have invited Kremlin chiefs
to their summits in the last few years, but have stopped short of expanding
G7 to include Russia.
However, Mr Kostikov's demand that Russia be given G7 status appeared more
of an effort to impress domestic opinion than a practical proposal.
Mr Sergei Karaganov, a foreign policy expert and member of the president's
advisory council, expressed surprise at Mr Kostikov's declaration. 'I do not
believe that could be the official position of any relevant ministry or of
the president's administration,' he said.
Only a few weeks ago Mr Kostikov said that Russia might take six or seven
months to sign up for Partnership for Peace, thereby risking embarrassing
isolation as the odd man out after its neighbours had joined. But that
statement has since been dismissed by the Foreign Ministry, which has
suggested that Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, might sign as early
as April 21.
Mr Karaganov said that on that occasion Mr Kostikov had been trying, on his
own initiative, to protect the Kremlin from possible new attacks from the
conservative state Duma, which would use the Nato agreement as an excuse to
denounce the president and the government.
In a similar vein, Mr Kostikov yesterday suggested that the Partnership for
Peace might not be signed by Mr Kozyrev, but by a lower-ranking official.

FT  09 APR 94 / Peace envoys step up Bosnia drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff and AP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American and Russian negotiators yesterday stepped up pressure on Serbs and
Moslems to end two years of war in Bosnia as heavy fighting raged over a
strategic point south of the Gorazde enclave.
Mr Charles Redman, US envoy and one of the architects of last month's
landmark federation agreement between Croats and Moslems, arrived in
Sarajevo to throw his weight behind the peace-making efforts of Gen Sir
Michael Rose, the UN commander.
He stressed that he had come to discuss an overall political settlement, not
just a ceasefire deal. The Moslems have been reluctant to endorse a
ceasefire for fear of consolidating Serb gains.
Mr Redman said after meeting Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic: 'We have
some ideas. We're are talking about them but it will, no doubt, take a few
days to sort these out.'
Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian negotiator, is due in Belgrade tomorrow,
where he is expected to put pressure on the Serbs to agree a deal even at
the cost of some territorial concessions.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which has given more
detailed reports of the bloodshed than the UN military command, said its
representatives in Gorazde could hear 'very loud impacts' from artillery to
the south.
This would suggest a fight for control of the village of Vitkovici, where a
munitions factory is thought to be located. If the Serbs capture it they
will have moved closer to clearing a route between Serbia and eastern
Bosnia, a long-standing ambition.
A Serb commander claimed that his side was close to seizing the whole
enclave, one of three so-called safe areas for Moslems designated by the UN.
'Soon we shall occupy the entire region of Gorazde and thus gain control
over both banks of the Drina (river),' said Gen Vlado Spremo, Bosnian
commander.
Mr Kris Janowski, a UNHCR spokesman, said that as of yesterday morning, 83
people had been killed and 376 wounded in fighting around Gorazde, including
16 deaths in the past 24 hours. A ceasefire proclaimed by the Moslems on
Thursday night appears to have brought no more than a temporary lull in
fighting.
Opposition politicians demanded a no-confidence vote on Croatia's defence
minister following an arms warehouse explosion that sent shrapnel flying up
to three miles away and left five soldiers missing, AP reports.
But members of President Franjo Tudjman's ruling party charged that the move
was unconnected to Thursday's blast and merely another ploy to oust
right-wing Defence Minister Gojko Susak.

FT  09 APR 94 / US frustrated by failed promise of trade reform:
Washington's hopes are being pinned on Ichiro Ozawa and his commitment to
institutional change
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's public 'regret' yesterday at the resignation of Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa as Japanese prime minister could not disguise the
increasing US frustration at the virtual paralysis of his government.
The US trade negotiating strategy with Japan had been predicated on the
belief that Mr Hosokawa was a reformer, keen to take on those Japanese
bureaucrats seen in Washington as the stumbling block to greater access for
US goods and services.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and other officials consistently
maintained that US pressure on Japan was designed to reinforce, not
undermine, a premier whose domestic popularity had been remarkably high by
recent Japanese standards.
Even the most recent ratcheting up of this pressure, with the naming of
Japan as an unfair trader under the terms of the revived Super 301 trade
process, was seen in Washington as a means of giving Mr Hosokawa's
government more time to respond.
Although Japan came up with a plan to give Motorola of the US greater
opportunities in the cellular phone market, other Japanese policies,
including a budget stimulus, have been stalled.
Over time this frustration has more than offset the reasonable personal
rapport between the two leaders, both previously provincial governors. Even
after their abortive summit in February, which failed to resolve outstanding
trade differences, Mr Clinton entertained Mr Hosokawa for a social breakfast
at the White House.
But even as they ate, US officials were investigating political alternatives
in Tokyo. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister and a possible successor to
Mr Hosokawa, has become reasonably well known in Washington, but without
ever transcending the barrier of being just another fungible Japanese
politician whose interests are principally domestic.
Increasingly, hopes have been pinned on Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the former LDP
cabinet member and now the political power, such as it is, in the Hosokawa
cabinet, as a man who could get things done behind the scenes.
Much as Mr Hosokawa's brief memoirs before he became prime minister became
useful reading in Washington, so has Mr Ozawa's recent publication -
Blueprint for Building a New Japan. Washington understands that Mr Ozawa has
political problems of his own in Japan but his commitment to domestic
institutional reform and a strong US relationship is considered an advantage
and it is hoped he remains in a position of influence in the new government.
One senior White House policy-maker was recently asked if he was worried
about Mr Ozawa's scandal-tainted reputation as the 'Richard Nixon of Japan'.
He replied: 'What's wrong with that?'

FT  09 APR 94 / India seeks Dollars 5bn investment in oil exploration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India needs to attract Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.4bn) in domestic and foreign
capital over the next three years for oil and gas exploration if domestic
petroleum production is to maintain its 50 per cent share of the country's
energy market.
Mr Satish Sharma, energy minister, said a sharp increase in exploration was
needed to cope with India's fast-expanding energy demand, which is growing
at 8-10 per cent a year. At present about Dollars 1.4bn is spent each year
on exploration and development.
The scale of the task is such that the government is seeking large foreign
involvement in the oil industry, which until recently had been the sole
preserve of India's two big state-owned oil companies.
The government has opened a new licensing round, in which it hopes that
medium-sized western oil companies will take part. Mr Sharma, who is on a
world tour to promote the round, said he was aware of past accusations that
India was withholding the best acreage for domestic companies. But he said
the latest licensing round included areas in which there were confirmed oil
and gas deposits.
He also acknowledged that there was a perception among the big western oil
companies that India was unlikely to contain the very large fields which
were most highly valued.
He noted, however, that half of India's 26 sedimentary basins remained
unexpl-ored.
The minister added that a significant number of cash-rich private Indian
companies were keen to enter the oil industry with western partners.

FT  09 APR 94 / Intrigues that toppled five prime ministers in five years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan has lost five prime ministers in five years. One resigned over a
stocks-for-favours episode, another fell after having his image tarnished by
a 'geisha scandal', and one lost office for having pushed too hard for the
reform of a corrupt political system, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
For optimistic analysts, the high turnover of leaders is a healthy sign of
the gradual collapse of the 'money politics' perfected by the Liberal
Democratic party in its 38 years of rule, which ended last summer. But
pessimists believe the resignation of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa merely shows that
Japanese politics remains corrupt.
With his relative good looks, designer clothes and suave manner, Mr Hosokawa
personified the new type of politician the Japanese voters apparently wanted
 -a lawmaker untainted by scandal and with the ability to change the corrupt
political system.
But in spite of yesterday's denials that his resignation was tied directly
to his dealings with Sagawa Kyubin, the trucking company involved in recent
bribery scandals, or to his family's stock transactions, Mr Hosokawa finds
himself joining the rogues' gallery of his predecessors.
MR NOBORU TAKESHITA, who once controlled the most powerful faction in the
LDP, is still regarded as a symbol of old style politics, which involved
close ties between politicians and companies favoured with public contracts.
Mr Takeshita was forced to step down in 1989 after opposition parties
blocked the budget bill until he clarified his links to the Recruit
stocks-for-favours scandal.
Even after his resignation, the unearthing of his alleged links to gangsters
and a mysterious affair involving the sale of an ornate but controversial
gold-leaf screen have further hurt his reputation.
MR SOSUKE UNO was brought in as 'Mr Clean' after Mr Takeshita's resignation
in disgrace. However, he managed to stay at the helm for only two months, in
a term of office marred by revelations about his alleged affair with a
geisha.
Mr Uno, seen by most Japanese as a bungling leader and an embarrassment to
his party, was held responsible for a sharp drop in the LDP's popularity. He
has since returned to obscurity. After his departure the party was then
forced to search among its ranks for an MP untouched by scandal.
After Mr Uno's resignation, the Liberal Democratic party was forced to dip
into the younger pool of Diet members. MR TOSHIKI KAIFU was clean - so clean
that he annoyed party elders by refusing to appoint any party member linked
to a scandal to his cabinet.
In spite of his eagerness to impress the Japanese electorate, Mr Kaifu lost
the premiership after the party's faction leaders decided that he was taking
the cause of political reform too seriously in late 1991, when the LDP was
not yet ready to contemplate a serious change to the political system.
After Mr Kaifu, the LDP gave up trying to place politicians untouched by
scandals at the helm. MR KIICHI MIYAZAWA had been implicated in the Recruit
scandal, but was an ideal candidate for the leading factions due to his
previous ministerial experience, his image as an intellectual and
international statesman, and most important, his weak party power base.
But his lack of political power worked against him in the end as he was
unable to persuade party elders to adopt the political reform bill. This
prompted his downfall as he had publicly pledged to clean up politics.

FT  09 APR 94 / Widening crackdown on activists clouds Balladur's visit to
China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China has detained another prominent dissident in a widening crackdown that
is certain to inflame western criticism of Chinese human rights behaviour.
Police on Thursday detained Mr Xu Wenli, one of the leaders of the
'Democracy Wall' movement of the late 1970s, less than 12 months after he
was released from jail after serving a 12-year sentence.
News of Mr Xu's detention will have added to the discomfort of Mr Edouard
Balladur, the visiting French prime minister, who has been under
considerable pressure on the human rights issue.
Mr Balladur was reluctant at a press conference to comment on the latest
crackdown, saying that 'being efficient (on human rights) very often means
being discreet and not saying too much in public'.
In Paris, the opposition Socialist party strongly criticised what it claimed
was his weak approach on human rights.
The French premier arrived in Beijing on Thursday to celebrate the
restoration of working relations with China after friendly ties were resumed
earlier this year.
China's latest foray against its dissident movement follows the detention of
Mr Wei Jingsheng, its best-known political activist. Mr Wei was taken into
custody last week for interrogation in connection with 'new crimes'. These
have not been specified.
Mr Wei and Mr Xu were the most prominent activists engaged in the
pro-democracy agitation of the late 1970s. Their release last year, before
their jail terms expired, was seen as an attempt by China to improve its
human rights record.
But their fresh detention has complicated the impending decision by US
President Bill Clinton on renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trade
status, allowing lower-tariff access to the US market, which depends on
'overall, significant improvement' in human rights behaviour.

FT  09 APR 94 / Defender of business interests tipped as Japan's next
premier: Reform crusader Tsutomu Hata seen as only option for top office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tsutomu Hata, 58, the man tipped last night as frontrunner to be Japan's
next prime minister, can be expected to steer the government slightly to the
right.
As finance minister for the previous Liberal Democratic party government,
for a year to December 1992, he won a reputation for being a solid defender
of business interests. For that reason, the financial markets would greet Mr
Hata's promotion to leadership with enthusiasm.
Mr Hata, currently foreign minister and deputy prime minister, was discreet
about his ambitions last night, saying he would prefer to be a
behind-the-scenes arbitrator in the seven-party coalition than lead it.
However, many coalition members, including the moderate wing of the
Socialist party, believe Mr Hata is the only option.
He could, however, become vulnerable to the suggestions of corruption that
brought down Mr Morihiro Hosokawa. He was once a member of the LDP faction
run by Mr Shin Kanemaru, the party's political godfather, who resigned two
years ago after admitting receiving illegal donations from Sagawa Kyubin,
the same trucking company said to have lent money to Mr Hosokawa.
Mr Hata is now dedicated to turning his back on the old LDP days and the old
style of politics, and is instead a prime mover of the campaign to banish
corruption and promote political reform.
He started his crusade in a spectacular manner, by leading an LDP
parliamentary revolt last June. His followers backed an opposition
no-confidence vote in the former government of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, so
bringing down the LDP.
Mr Hata then left the LDP to form the Japan Renewal party - which sets the
tone for coalition economic policy and is its second-largest member  - with
Mr Ichiro Ozawa, another former Kanemaru faction member, who is now the
government's behind-the-scenes strategist. Both Mr Ozawa and Mr Hata believe
in increasing the power of the offices of prime minister and parliament, to
the detriment of Japan's influential bureaucracy.
They also want the present multiplicity of parties and political groups to
rationalise into two stable alliances of centre right and centre left,
similar to the US model of Republican and Democratic parties.
Mr Hata dubbed himself the 'salaried worker MP' to enhance his image as a
man of the people, though his family had a history of involvement in
politics. The original defection from the LDP was founded on his belief that
Japan would not be genuinely democratic until the political system became
more responsive to popular needs and less influenced by the whims of LDP
factions.
'Reform will help to nurture real political parties, and it will help Japan
to develop a more independent foreign policy and to take diplomatic
initiatives,' he said.
If Japan's coalition leaders do decide to put Mr Hata in the driving seat,
he has the edge over Mr John Major, the British premier, in one respect. Mr
Hata started his career as a bus conductor, a job for which Mr Major was
once rejected.

FT  09 APR 94 / Japanese scorn N-arms claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government yesterday gave an uncharacteristically strong
response to North Korean claims that Japan was set to develop nuclear
weapons.
It said statements from Pyongyang that possible North Korean development of
nuclear weapons was meant to restrain Tokyo from developing such weapons
were 'nothing but malicious propaganda'.
A North Korean news agency had claimed the recent start-up of Monju, a
nuclear facility in western Japan, indicated that Tokyo was preparing to
develop nuclear weapons.
'It is out of the question for Japan to develop nuclear weapons. Japan's
firm support of the indefinite extension of the non-proliferation treaty, of
which it is a member as a non-nuclear weapon state, is another clear
indication that Japan has no intention of developing nuclear weapons,' the
Foreign Ministry said.
'North Korea, which has not yet accepted the International Atomic Energy
Agency's full inspections, is not in a position to criticise Japan's nuclear
policy. North Korea should know that this sort of propaganda does not
justify its own behaviour.'
The belated statement from the ministry, issued two days after the North
Korean claims were made, reflects the difficulty the authorities in Tokyo
have had in responding to increased tensions on the Korean peninsula.
The ministry's rebuke is in contrast to the generally muted response from
Tokyo. Concern that a critical Japanese tone could aggravate the tensions
has led the authorities to make generally low-key public statements on the
issue.
However, Japan wants to make clear that it has no intention of developing
nuclear weapons. The government is likely to be anxious not to give North
Korea an excuse to play on historical Korean fears of Japanese aggression
and thus to justify its development of nuclear weapons as a defensive
measure.

The Japanese public, like a kabuki audience moved by a familiar plot, found
their disappointment at Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation yesterday
tempered by a sense of the inevitable.
'It is regrettable,' said one man in Kumamoto, Mr Hosokawa's home
prefecture. 'But it can't be helped since, for a prime minister, integrity
is crucial.'
To a public that had become accustomed to the whims of their leader, the
sudden change of mind by Mr Hosokawa, who had spent a good part of the week
denying he would resign, appeared perfectly in character.
Mr Hosokawa's approach to government, criticised by his enemies as
lightweight and irresponsible, still had its fans. Many citizens could not
hide their regret; they had hoped he would change not just the substance of
Japanese politics but its style as well.
'It is very disappointing,' said Mr Eiji Hirabayashi, a businessman in
Tokyo. 'His policies were good, his image was good and, compared with his
predecessors, he was relatively clean.'
There was also sympathy for the man whose public rating, even in the midst
of scandal, remained high. But that popularity could not help Mr Hosokawa
overcome his inability to run the country. 'As a person he is good, but I
would have preferred a more effective leader,' Mr Hirabayashi said.
Business leaders were more scathing. Many vented their frustration and
criticism not at Mr Hosokawa alone but at the entire government.
'It is imperative that the government gets its act together to prevent any
further delay in the critical areas of deregulation and economic stimulus,'
Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, said.
'We can only (insist) that the Japanese government quickly composes itself
and starts acting to address responsibly the needs of the country and the
international community during this crucial period.'
Many people nevertheless give Mr Hosokawa credit for starting to address
those very needs. Tainted though he was by the shadow of scandal, the
youthful prime minister photographed walking with US President Bill Clinton
during last year's Apec conference in Seattle is likely to be remembered as
the man who initiated much-needed change in Japan.

Financial markets are supposed to hate uncertainty, but Japanese investors
reacted calmly to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation yesterday.
The Tokyo stock market closed 0.2 per cent higher at 19,890.98 and the yen
ended down Y0.68 against the dollar at Y104.95.
As the initial shock receded, many investors seemed to come to the
conclusion, at least for now, that Mr Hosokawa's departure signals the
likely revival of budget talks which have been blocked by the opposition
Liberal Democratic party.
The reasoning in the financial community is that since the opposition had
increasingly focused on the corruption allegations against Mr Hosokawa,
weakening his ability to make decisions on tax reform and trade issues, the
resignation is good news for the economy.
However, it is highly likely that choosing a successor will not be a smooth
process. If there is prolonged backroom haggling over who becomes prime
minister or a political realignment hampers the budget debate, the delay in
putting into effect public investment and government spending plans could
hurt economic prospects.
'It's important that the budget is passed during the next couple of weeks,
and it all depends on how soon the next government can be formed,' says Mr
Dick Beason, senior economist at brokers James Capel in Tokyo.
Mr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute, says
recovery of the economy and in financial markets may be hamperedunless the
new prime minister can take political command of both the coalition and
bureaucrats.
Moreover, the resignation of Mr Hosokawa could affect recovery hopes by
jeopardising prospects of a quick resumption of trade talks with the US.
The recent strength of the yen following the breakdown of the US-Japan trade
talks is hurting Japan's export-dependent manufacturers and threatening
chances for economic recovery expected later in the year.
Talks between the US and Japan broke off in February when the two sides
failed at a summit meeting to agree on measures to open Japan's markets to
imports and reduce its trade surplus.
The Japanese government had been hoping that a meeting between Mr Tsutomu
Hata, the foreign minister, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative,
next week would go a long way in thawing the chill that has come between the
two countries in their dispute over trade.
But with the government now in turmoil, a high-level meeting next week in
Marrakesh, in the shadow of the Gatt members' meeting to sign a global trade
agreement, could pose problems. Political direction is seen to be crucial in
breaking the current stalemate.
In particular, political instability will damage government efforts to put
together a deregulation package by June to present to the Group of Seven
meeting in July as its proposal for reducing the country's huge trade
surplus.
'The situation surrounding Japan-US ties requires urgent action,' Mr Hiroshi
Kumagai, trade minister, said. 'There is not much time left before June.'
Officials were, however, less concerned about the impact of the political
drama on the Gatt meeting itself. 'Policy is not expected to change
regarding Gatt,' said an official at the Foreign Ministry.

FT  09 APR 94 / Wall Street prices weaken on US monetary policy tensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fragile peace prevailing on Wall Street since midweek was pushed to
breaking point yesterday afternoon as underlying tensions over the direction
of US monetary policy resurfaced in the financial markets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 19 points down at 3,674.26 after
falling sharply earlier in the day in the wake of a decline in bond prices.
The Dow finished 38 points up on the week.
The erosion in bond prices appeared to come in response to comments by two
Federal Reserve officials.
In separate statements, they said constraints in the labour market and in
production capacity were developing in the economy and could lead to higher
inflation.
The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond closed at 7.25 per cent,
against 7.21 on Thursday, after touching 7.30 per cent during the session.
Recent gains had enabled the Dow to recapture about half its recent fall of
about 200 points. Its 82-point jump on Tuesday and a sharp upturn in bond
prices came amid relief that a sell-off after the Easter holiday was less
severe than expected.
Many observers had feared a free-fall in domestic and overseas markets as
soon as investors had the opportunity to react to a spurt in US employment
figures announced on Good Friday when most exchanges were shut.
Elsewhere, Milan was the most lively continental European bourse this week,
as heavy buying by domestic funds took prices up by another 2.9 per cent on
top of the previous week's near 10 per cent surge.
Investors ignored the right wing's war of words and pinned their hopes on a
more free market economy.
In London, the FT-SE 100 index fell 8.2 to close at 3,120.8.

FT  09 APR 94 / Belgium poised to send troops to Rwanda
</HEADLINE>

Belgium placed parachute battalions on alert yesterday as several western
countries prepared to evacuate their citizens from Rwanda, where two days of
heavy fighting have claimed the lives of UN peacekeepers, aid workers and
hundreds of civilians.
The moves came as rival factions in the capital, Kigali, were reported by
the UN Security Council last night to have agreed a ceasefire and on the
appointment of an interim government.
A statement from the council said an acting president and prime minister and
five ministers had been named.
The situation outside Kigali was relatively calm, the council said, while
within the city itself 'the security situation has continued to improve,
although. . . it is still far from good'.
Earlier in the day, after emergency cabinet meetings, the Belgian government
promised unspecified measures to guarantee the safety of its 1,500 citizens
in the former east African colony.
The defence ministry in Brussels said that about 800 troops were ready to
help evacuate foreign nationals.
The US - which is also making plans to remove its 255 nationals from the
strife-torn capital, where fighting flared near the American embassy - said
talks on evacuation were under way with other governments who had citizens
in Rwanda.
French military officials said Paris was considering using troops stationed
in the Central African Republic to rescue its 600 nationals, while Canada is
to remove 200 citizens.
Ten Belgian soldiers were killed in Rwanda on Thursday. They were among 400
serving with a 2,500-strong UN force which is policing a peace accord agreed
last August.
Kigali collapsed into anarchy following the death on Wednesday night of
President Juvenal Habyarimana in an air crash. Rwandan diplomats claim the
president's aircraft was shot down by the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, but
the group has denied involvement.
UN military observers have not been allowed to inspect the wreckage of the
aircraft at Kigali airport. Burundi's leader, Mr Cyprien Ntaryamira, was
also killed in the crash.
News of the alleged assassination unleashed long-standing rivalries between
the late president's Hutu tribe and the minority Tutsi group. Nuns, priests,
aid workers and government ministers, along with the UN peacekeepers, have
been killed. Red Cross workers in Kigali reported 'hundreds and hundreds of
dead and thousands of injured', a spokesman said.
The Tutsi-led RPF was reported to have been fighting the presidential guard
in Kigali earlier yesterday. Several thousand RPF troops were said to be
marching to the capital from their strongholds in the north.
Medecins Sans Frontieres, the medical charity, said Hutus were arming
themselves in the refugee camps along the Burundi border.
Some 4,000 refugees have poured into neighbouring Tanzania, the first of
what eventually could be up to 150,000 refugees, the New York-based
International Rescue Committee said yesterday.

FT  09 APR 94 / Japanese reforms under threat as Hosokawa quits: Fragile
coalition hit by further allegations of financial impropriety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of Japan's coalition government will try again today to find a
successor to Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, whose resignation yesterday as prime
minister threatens the country's planned political and economic reforms.
He quit after allegations of financial impropriety, made by the opposition
Liberal Democratic party. The allegations had fatally damaged his image as
an anti-corruption campaigner, on which he was elected eight months ago.
Mr Hosokawa lamented that he was leaving at a 'critical' time for the
country, which faces difficult decisions on economic policy and its trade
relationship with the US.
'The situation surrounding Japan-US ties requires urgent action,' warned Mr
Hiroshi Kumagai, minister for international trade and industry.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister and joint founder of the conservative
Japan Renewal party, emerged last night as a possible candidate, but there
may be several more days of haggling before the seven-party coalition can
reach agreement.
The resignation sets back attempts to introduce a more open style of
democracy and could further frustrate the US as it seeks better access for
imports.
The Nikkei 225 index fell 370 points as reports began to circulate that Mr
Hosokawa's resignation was imminent, but it rebounded to finish 44.01 higher
on the day at 19,934.99.
The yen was sold heavily, falling to a low of Y105.85 against the dollar,
but recovered to close in London at Y105.21, slightly below Thursday's close
of Y104.82.
Mr Hosokawa's resignation signals another round of realignment among Japan's
shifting political groups and represents a tactical kill for the LDP, which
has been seeking revenge for its election defeat last summer after 38 years
in power.
Mr Hosokawa was Japan's fifth prime minister in the past five years and the
third during that time to resign because of a personal scandal.
The LDP had boycotted the current year's budget for the past month, putting
pressure on the prime minister to disprove suspicions of wrongly accepting
an undeclared Y100m (Pounds 658,000) loan to fund a political campaign, and
covering up a share purchase for tax reasons.
Mr Hosokawa denied the allegations but decided to resign late on Thursday
night after discovering another, separate problem, over investments made on
his behalf since 1981. He disclosed no further details.
A grim-faced Mr Hosokawa yesterday took 'moral responsibility' for the
budget blockage and regretted having to resign at a time when Japan was in a
'critical situation'. Only two days ago, Mr Hosokawa called a midnight press
conference to deny two independent MPs' suggestions that he had joked with
them about quitting.
Mr Hata, the only member of the cabinet with ministerial experience,
maintained last night he would rather operate behind the scenes than be
prime minister.
Mr Hata has the support of the conservative wing of the coalition, including
his own JRP plus Komeito, the Buddhist-backed Clean Government party, and
the assent of the moderate wing of the SDP.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, SDP chairman, said his party would co-operate with a
coalition consensus on a new prime minister. Mr Michio Watanabe, an LDP
faction leader and former foreign minister, was seen as a possible
alternative candidate.

FT  09 APR 94 / MoD bill for women's dismissals could soar to Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence faces a possible compensation bill of more than
Pounds 100m after a Glasgow court yesterday made a record award of nearly
Pounds 300,000 to a woman army officer who was forced to quit because she
was pregnant.
About 1,800 other complaints are still outstanding from former servicewomen
who were dismissed for the same reason, including one single claim for
Pounds 549,000. Three other awards of more than Pounds 100,000 each have
already been made.
Even if the average in future claims is half that amount and no fresh claims
are lodged, the total bill will be 10 times the Pounds 9m paid out so far.
Yesterday's judgment found that Mrs Helen Homewood, 44, was entitled to
recompense for the ending of what promised to be an outstanding career. She
held the rank of major when she left the army in 1982.
Mrs Homewood, who now has two children aged 11 and nine, rose to the rank of
colonel in the part-time Territorial Army, which she joined in 1986. The
court found that this was evidence of her 'drive, ambition, and love of the
forces'.
She was awarded Pounds 299,851 as the price of her lost career and told she
may receive more once tax and pension rights are taken into account. The
defence ministry said it was considering whether to appeal against the
award.
Spending by the armed forces is already under strong political pressure, and
intensive preparation is going on at the ministry for a white paper which
will lay out fresh ideas on paring expenditure. Among the areas of possible
cuts are the medical services of the army, which employ a high proportion of
women.
The ministry exposed itself to a torrent of litigation after acknowledging
in 1990 that pregnant women, who had been discharged over the previous 12
years, were entitled to compensation.
It estimates that about 5,500 women fall into this category, and it has
already settled about 1,900 claims for a total of Pounds 9m. The average
value of awards has soared since last summer when the European Court of
Justice removed an Pounds 11,000 limit on compensation for sex
discrimination at work. The ministry's best hope is that the courts will
take a different view of the remaining claims, most of which refer to
servicewomen with little prospect of reaching high rank.
While acknowledging that its practices are unacceptable under European law,
the ministry has contested claims by the litigants that their dismissal came
as a surprise. It maintains that all women entering the services were
required to sign a document accepting that pregnancy would lead to
dismissal.
The ministry's concerns go beyond the cases outstanding. The value of awards
may tempt into court as many as 2,000 servicewomen, who are entitled to
claim, but have not yet done so.

FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Laidlaw earnings tumble to
Dollars 17m in second quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Laidlaw, the Ontario-based waste and passenger services group, blamed the
Los Angeles earthquake, harsh winter weather and regulatory problems at its
flagship hazardous waste dump for a 40 per cent drop in earnings in its
second quarter.
Net income fell to USDollars 17m, or 6 cents a share, in the three months to
February 28, from Dollars 28.1m, or 10 cents, a year earlier. Revenues
climbed to Dollars 520.4m from Dollars 469m.
Laidlaw's results no longer include any contribution from its 24 per cent
stake in ADT, the international security and vehicle auction group.
The Canadian company began distancing itself from ADT last January through
an issue of debentures which it can redeem with its ADT shares.
Income from Attwoods, the UK-based waste management company in which Laidlaw
has a 35 per cent stake, fell to less than Dollars 1m from Dollars 4.3m, due
to a previously-announced special charge.
Mr Jim Bullock, chief executive, expressed disappointment with the results,
but predicted an improvement for the rest of the year, due to the
strengthening US economy and to a flurry of acquisitions of US ambulance
operators. The move into ambulance services is expected to contribute
Dollars 125m to fiscal 1994 revenues.
Disruptions to school-bus services caused by the California earthquake and
the severe winter are estimated to have sliced Dollars 12m off quarterly
revenues.
Passenger service margins narrowed to 7.5 per cent from 13.2 per cent a year
ago. But about half the operating income lost to bad weather and the
earthquake is expected to be recovered later in the year.
Operating income from solid-waste services grew to Dollars 17.9m from
Dollars 13.4m, while margins improved to 10.2 per cent from 7.6 per cent.
Hazardous waste earnings dipped, however, to Dollars 8.8m from Dollars 11m,
with margins narrowing to 7 per cent from 9.6 per cent.
The fall was due mainly to the continuing absence of any contribution from
the big hazardous waste landfill at Pinewood, South Carolina. Earnings for
the first half were Dollars 55m, or 20 cents a share, down from Dollars 77m,
or 28 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.07bn, up from Dollars 981.9m.

Industrial production in India rose 6.7 per cent in December compared with
the same month a year earlier, according to figures published yesterday
which offered fresh evidence that industry is seeing a steady recovery after
two years of stagnation, writes Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi.
The increase compares with a rise of just 2.4 per cent for the nine months
to the end of December, said the government's central statistical
organisation. The largest increase was registered by makers of machinery,
which had previously suffered the steepest declines in output.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A national rail strike is looming in Ireland in a dispute over modernisation
and working practices. The country's main rail union yesterday recommended
that its members take strike action to protest against the plan.
Irish Rail, the state-run rail company, is currently losing more than
IPounds 70m (Pounds 68m) a year. Its management wants to introduce radical
changes in outmoded working practices, introduce modern and more powerful
locomotives and rolling stock, one-man train operations, and new ticketing
and signalling systems.
It is estimated that IPounds 800m needs to be spent on the Irish rail
network to bring it up to modern EU standards. IPounds 275m is earmarked to
be invested up to the end of the decade with the assistance of EU structural
funds.
Some three years of negotiations between management and unions have failed
to produce an agreement, however, and the proposals finally put to the
company's 5,000 staff were rejected by the majority of them last month.
Last week, the company decided to push ahead with its plans and began
suspending staff who refused to participate in training programmes for the
introduction of new technology.
Mr Tony Tobin, the senior negotiator for SIPTU, the main trade union
involved in the dispute, blamed the management. 'We believe there is still
ground to be made by sitting round the table, but management have not used
all the labour relations machinery available.'
A management spokesman acknowledged this was the case, but said: 'The last
agreement took 18 months of talks. We have now sat through 14 Labour court
conciliations and the proposals have been rejected by the unions. If we
don't kick-start this programme, things will just drift and we could lose
some of the European funds.'
Staff were being balloted on a strike yesterday and the results are expected
early next week. If approved, a stoppage would follow seven days later.
Irish Rail carries 25m passengers a year and 3.3m tons of freight. In
addition to disruptions for passengers, the principal cargoes that will be
delayed by a strike are beer, cement, chemicals, mineral ores and
concentrates and peat, around 85 per cent of which is import-export
business.

The Netherlands' first insider-trading trial ended yesterday with
millionaire industrialist Mr Joep van den Nieuwenhuyzen cleared of all
charges over the sale of shares in HCS Technology in 1991. The judgment was
a blow to the Justice Ministry which made the case a key test of the
five-year-old insider-dealing law. Mr Van den Nieuwenhuyzen, majority owner
of the Begemann industrial group, was accused with two associates, Mr Leon
Melchior and Mr Eric Albada Jelgersma, of selling shares to drive down HCS's
share price. The prosecution alleged they would then have been able to
participate more cheaply in a share placing they knew HCS planned to make.
But the court said that insider trading had not been proved because it was
not obvious which way the HCS shares would move.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Paints and the Environment (9): Radical shift in
attitude - Product development / So where is the paint industry going? From
what its leaders say, there has been a fundamental change in attitude, with
not only new products developed or on the way, but also fresh approaches to
management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paint product development is dominated by the desire to use fewer volatile
organic compounds (VOC) in solvents. More water is one answer. Other
coatings have higher proportions of solids - pigment and resin - than
before. Meanwhile, some companies are specialising in powder coatings, which
have no solvent at all.
In all companies there has been a shift away from pure research. Beckers,
the Swedish paintmaker, now calls its laboratories the product development
department, typifying a growing concentration on working up what the
industry now has, rather than looking for something new.
'Purer' work is going on - but at bodies such as the Paint Research
Association, where it is jointly funded, or at some universities, where
projects are sponsored. In companies' own labs, work is focused and driven
by the needs and problems of industrial customers.
These relationships with the users of industrial paints are deepening and
changing paints companies' approach to management. There has always been
symbiosis, particularly in the automotive industry, where paintmakers have
given car manufacturers guaranteeable anti-corrosion technology.
The car business now exemplifies the latest management developments. Numbers
of competitors for OEM - painting cars during manufacture - have been
reducing steadily for 10 years.
But even while four or five remained, competitive supply still had much to
do with the price of paint.
Now, both carmakers and paintmakers have realised that having fewer paint
companies supplying the OEM market - worth about Pounds 650m a year in
Europe alone - is the way to lower overall costs. As Dr Marvin Hartman, one
of PPG's leading chemists, puts it: 'There is a lot more cost in painting
than the cost of the paint. It's the whole process of getting it on to the
car.'
Dr Manfred Hopp, chief executive of BASF Lacke &amp; Farben, says: 'Only 10 to
20 per cent of a paint shop's cost is the cost of paint. The process is much
more costly.
'We hope to get away from stupid negotiations on raw material prices. It is
the total cost per painted car that matters, including the process cost.'
There is some self-interest in this because paint has historically been
priced by the litre. High technology modern coatings do a better job with
less paint, but persuading purchasing managers they should therefore pay
more per litre is another matter. Changing the pricing structure offers
better prospects.
The automotive industry is making this possible by moving away from
competitive supply at individual plant level. Carmakers may retain several
paint suppliers overall, but will give a franchise to only one per plant.
PPG and BASF have now emerged as the two front runners in the market, but
each is adopting a different approach. PPG thinks carmakers should outsource
the whole painting process, with PPG managing and staffing the paint shop.
BASF is openly hostile.
'There is enormous price pressure and everyone is trying to bring in
savings,' Dr Hopp says. 'We are very good at making paint, but not
necessarily at other things. We believe that by bringing together experts in
car manufacturing, paint supply and application equipment manufacturing - as
well as those in car design or design of car plants  - we can work as team
to optimise the whole process.'
Mr Austin O'Malley, who has been responsible for building PPG's OEM presence
in Europe, disagrees.
'The body of knowledge about painting cars is now resident in the paint
industry,' he says. 'We have the experience, knowledge and resources - and
the critical mass. You need to be able to provide eight people per shift to
replace the car company's own engineers. We are now big enough to offer
this. Most of our competitors are not.'
The answer to the question of which approach is better - or if neither is -
will be decided over the next 10 years at individual factories of Ford and
General Motors as they plump for one supplier at each - and the management
system to go with it. It will be a new type of competition to that of simply
undercutting to supply cheaper paint.
Meanwhile, technology is driving the development of powder paints, which
contain no solvent at all and are therefore ultra-friendly to the
environment.
The raw material is made by milling together pigment and resin finely enough
for the resultant powder to be sprayed onto heated metal objects. An
electrostatic field ensures they deposit evenly; the heat sets off
polymerisation and a coloured film forms over the surface, 'painting' it.
Oversprayed powder is collected and recycled.
The process works well on items like aluminium extrusions for window frames,
under-the-bonnet car components or office light fittings, but films are
thick and achieving a hard gloss is difficult.
The powder market was very fragmented, but is now concentrating worldwide,
with a few companies - notably Courtaulds Coatings of the UK, Herberts of
Germany and Ferro of the US - trying to solve the problems.
Laporte, which now owns Evode Powder Coatings in the UK, is developing
powder application methods for plastics - and aims to threaten wet paint in
this segment.
Courtaulds believes thinner films - the key to challenging wet industrial
paints - will be achieved through engineering as much as chemistry, by
milling to the fine particle standards of the cosmetics industry.
Formulation - resin design and deciding the ratio of pigment - will become
more critical, and cannot be done by anyone.
Partnership with industry is also important here. Euramax, the aluminium
coil coater, is experimenting with powder, though using single sheets of
metal, rather than a continuous strip at present.
Mr Roger Walters, the chief executive, says powder offers multi-coloured and
embossed finishes - impossible with wet paint, which provides a uniform
coating.
Meanwhile, director Mr John Bernie says the Paint Research Association is
looking at more distant technologies.
For example, a biomimetics programme is studying how crabs and barnacles
develop natural coatings from waterborne compounds in the sea, which then
will not dissolve in water afterwards.
The implications for waterborne paints, which are at present more suited to
indoor than outdoor use, are obvious.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Paints and the Environment (10): Triumph tinged
with irony - Rising prices for the paint ingredient, titanium dioxide / This
year is on course to be one of triumph for manufacturers of titanium dioxide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN

<DATELINE>
   A series of price rises in titanium dioxide
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a vital ingredient in paint, plastic and paper manufacture - is pushing the
average price around the world towards Dollars 2,000 a tonne.
But the triumph is tinged with irony: so deep were the price cuts during the
early 1990s, that even at Dollars 2,000, the price is barely what it was
four or five years ago.
For the first time since the start of the decade, titanium dioxide producers
have managed to make price rises stick. Most recently, US producers, led by
Hanson subsidiary SCM, last month raised prices by three cents a pound, or
from about Dollars 1,920 to Pounds 1,990 a tonne.
This rise followed a price hike by European producers last year. They
attempted to raise prices by up to 20 per cent and succeedded in
implementing 10 to 15 percentage points of that. They are beginning to push
the rest through now, according to Mr Jim Fischer, president of New Jersey
titanium dioxide consultancy consultancy, International Business Management
Associates.
The European price rise was so much higher than that in the US partly
because they were a response to falls over the previous 12 months that were
some of the sharpest in recent history. The partial collapse of the European
exchange rate mechanism in late 1992 and 1993 'ratcheted down' titanium
dioxide prices in Europe, says Mr Alan Pedder, chief executive of ICI
subsidiary, Tioxide.
As currencies of countries which have titanium dioxide manufacturing plants
fell - they included sterling and the escudo - titanium dioxide prices
across Europe tended to fall to match the new lower prices. According to Mr
Fischer, prices fell by 25 per cent in Europe during 1993 before October's
rises.
In the Asia Pacific region, the trends have been similar although prices are
historically below the levels in the western hemisphere, thanks to a
combination of low labour costs and, in some cases, very modern plant.
Prices recovered from about Dollars 1,600 a tonne to Pounds 1,800 and still
rising.
The causes of this turnaround in world prices for titanium dioxide are only
partly economic recovery: changes in capacity and patterns of demand have
meant that some plants are approaching maximum output much more quickly than
they would have done five years ago.
Total world capacity is 3.7m tonnes a year, if the published capacities of
the world's titanium dioxide plants are added up. According to Mr Fischer,
this over-states real capacity by almost 300,000 tonnes a year because many
manufacturers have allowed some plant to fall into disrepair during the last
few years of chronic low world price.
Even then, world consumption is less than 3m tonnes a year, implying over
capacity of 400,000 tonnes a year. But some plants are already operating at
very close to capacity because of the high demand for one kind of titanium
dioxide, that produced by one of the chloride process of manufacture.
Titanium dioxide, made by the chloride process, is in greater demand that
that made by the alternative sulphate process because of its technical
characteristics such as durability and glossiness in paints.
Research by Mr Fischer suggests that the average chloride method plant is
operating at 93 per cent capacity which the average sulphate plant is
operating at about 73 per cent. This helps explain why US price rises have
been led by SCM and in Asia by Du Pont, which are highly dependent on the
chloride method.
In the past, the arguments over which of the two methods is better have
centred on the apparent ecological unfriendliness of the sulphate method. Mr
Pedder argues that environmental laws mean that any sulphate plants still
operating are as clean as their chloride rivals.
He defends the sulphate process, perhaps not surprisingly because Tioxide
has more sulphate capacity than chloride. He says that sulphate-produced
titanium dioxide is more suitable for dyeing fibres and that in any case 70
per cent of consumption has a choice of using the material from either
source.
In the end, it may simply be price that decides if manufacturers continue
their trend towards relying on the chloride process.
Mr Fischer says that the sulphate process is an inherently higher cost
method of production. This is bad news for most European manufacturers which
still use it to a great extent.
Although there are some high efficiency sulphate plants, such as Tioxide's
in France and Spain, and Rhone Poulenc's at Le Havre in France, most of the
impetus of the European price rises in Europe, says Mr Fischer, were
'cost-driven.'
The US and Asian producers, especially SCM and Du Pont, on the other hand,
have been able to raise price simply because they could.
'They were market-driven rises,' he says.
In the short term the effect looks the same to the consumers of titanium
dioxide. But the 70 per cent of titanium dioxide customers that are free to
use the output from either process may yet have the last word.
Eventually, price bargaining and discounting will once again take the centre
of the titanium dioxide stage, and then the growing profit margins of the
chloride producers could severely damage the health of the higher cost
sulphate plants.

 -even more than the safety of their children (it may be charitably assumed
that if people believe a product is safe for animals, that includes
offspring.)
The sales growth of such water-based fence coatings was nearly 12 per cent
in Britain last year. Other exterior woodcare products are flourishing:
Roncraft says its water-based woodstain increased sales by 45 per cent in
1993. This has countered static or declining sales in other sectors of the
market, although Roncraft, the market leader in interior varnish, is
encouraged this year by the strengthening of the housing market.
Overall, the consumer market - mostly through do-it-yourself stores - is
estimated to have expanded last year by 4.5 per cent to Pounds 111m. In
addition, there is the trade market of around Pounds 50m and an industrial
market of about half that - 'woodcare products are assumed to be a bit of a
backwater in the surface coatings industry - but that couldn't be further
from the truth,' says Mr Jim Byrne, Cuprinol's marketing director. 'It is a
quarter the size of the paints industry - and growing. It is a dynamic,
thrusting industry, in contrast to the surface coatings industry which is
very staid.'
He admits woodcare has had a prosaic image compared with paint. It is one
the industry leaders seek to counter with television advertising campaigns,
capitalising on the broadening appeal of natural wood within the home and
its increasing exterior use for window frames. The market itself ranges from
products which prevent decay to decorative finishes. Cuprinol, which is
based in Frome, Somerset, and was acquired by Williams Holdings in 1988, and
Roncraft, owned by the US company L &amp; F Products, each have about a quarter
of the consumer woodcare market. With smaller shares of the retail market
are Sikkens, Sadolin and Dulux (ICI), although these three have larger
shares of the trade market.
Innovation is being stimulated by the trend away from solvent-based products
to water-based products with low-odour formulations. The driving force for
this is the consumer: water-based products are quick-drying and brushes can
be washed out. They also cost more and, in most cases, the performance has
yet to equal solvent-based products - they do not penetrate as deeply and
are not as durable. The water-based formulations are more complex but the
consumer is prepared to pay a premium to have the convenience.
In contrast, Mr Byrne says, the professional trade still has 'considerable
resistance' to water-based products as it is more concerned with performance
and price. In the retail market, where consumers make only occasional
purchases, it is the convenience, rather than environmental factors, which
is at the forefront of their buying decisions. Mr Ged Shields, marketing
director of Roncraft, says: 'Our research shows consumers are much more
concerned with the home environment, rather than the wider environment.'
Mr Shields says it is generally agreed that water-based products are in fact
more environmentally friendly, although the equation is complicated.
Solvent-based products, using mainly white spirit, evaporate into the
atmosphere where they mix with vehicle emissions to cause smog.
On the other hand, water-based products, being less durable, will need to be
used more frequently, which has implications for energy and packaging use.
Then there are the chemicals which are washed out of the brushes and into
the drains. Health and safety legislation affecting UK woodcare products was
virtually non-existent only a decade ago, but now, says Mr Byrne, 'we are
one of the most heavily regulated industries within the do-it-yourself
sector.'
The main legislation on the use of pesticides is the Food and Environmental
Protection Act 1985. A product which makes any claim as a preservative has
to be registered with the Health and Safety Executive; in 1990, it banned
the use in consumer products of lindane, pentachlorophenol and tributyltin
oxide. Cuprinol, the preservative market leader, had already replaced these
with acypetacs-zinc and permethrin. More reforms are coming with European
directives on formulations, labelling and containers.
Mr Byrne points out that while manufacturers have to ensure their products
will not harm, for example, bats in belfries or bees in hives, consumers
want to know a preservative is effective, especially because the combination
of the damp UK climate and low-quality softwood encourages decay - 'a claim
of potency is a good marketing claim,' he says. 'We have to make the product
as effective as possible while as safe as it can be - there is a trade-off
there.'

management - The seven ages of paint production / Fortunately for the
coatings industry, management skills have been well applied in the past
couple of decades

<TEXT>
Most of today's coatings technologies were conceived by the 1960s, before
environmentalism was even a twinkle in Californian eyes. Plastics were being
powdered and fused to metal. Laboratories were finding out the mechanisms by
which some liquids could be solidified with ultraviolet light. Life in the
coatings industry flowed on tranquilly, with all the excitement of watching
paint dry.
Then marketing burst in on the scene. By the mid-1960s, the DIY industry was
blossoming, and one of the largest single drivers was the multi-million
marketing spend of large paint companies - with Hadrian, Valspar and
Magicote setting the pace for Dulux and Crown to match.
Industrial paints remained aloof from these antics, considering a half-crown
slipped into the lid of each tin for the paint shop foreman to be a more
appropriate purchasing inducement. Indeed, so successful was this approach
that some foremen were known to pour fresh paint down the drain to keep up
the supply of half crowns]
The industry's complacency was rudely shaken by the oil crisis in 1973.
Solvents quadrupled in price. Paint companies scurried to reduce solvent
usage. Around this time, industrial coatings users were trying to raise
productivity in paint shops. Previously, the painting process had been the
Cinderella department of many factories, but the combination of rising oil
prices and rising paint shop productivity gave a real impetus to new
industrial technologies.
By contrast, decorative producers' concern about solvent costs was not
enough to force radical technical change, but by the mid-1970s it was
dawning on producers that California's quest for cleaner air was more than
just an aberration among people who had spent too much time in the sun.
Stricter environmental regulations were set to become a fact of life for the
paintmaker.
Gradually, coatings companies caught up with the spirit of the times, and
this became the age of divorce. Twenty years previously, paints were more or
less similar products across the decorative/industrial spectrum. But by the
1980s the strategic drivers of industrial and decorative paints businesses
had become completely different. Decorative paints, both for trade and DIY
use, became driven by the needs and demands of their distribution channels.
With limited product differentiation, brands which had weathered 50 summers
were easily peeled from the shelves of the DIY sheds if they failed to live
up to their distributors' expectations.
Industrial markets were differently driven. Users of coatings were
globalising, and industrial coatings managers had to become international
managers. Backing the winning hand of new technologies became critical for
each market, so technical competence was crucial. Environmental issues
became fundamental drivers of industrial coatings strategy, while remaining
marginal issues for decorative businesses.
As management processes and philosophy diverged, the divorce between
industrial from decorative businesses was the only answer, even if both
parties sometimes chose to continue living under the same corporate roof.
Businesses with less than critical mass in both decorative and industrial
areas got rid of the weaker partner, or they were acquired by a stronger
company who did it for them. Environmental pressures were now affecting the
shape of the industry.
The number of companies supplying the retail market dropped as a result of
the decorative shake-out, but the stronger industrial coatings companies
still clung on to most of their historical markets.
For example, since most industrial coatings companies supplied coatings for
metal, and since powder coatings were taking a steadily increasing share of
that sector, the companies which had supplied liquid coatings nearly all
invested in powder.
At one stage there were more than 18 UK companies making powder coatings,
most with a far smaller share than the harsh economic realities of the
business would allow. A third was all that was needed for both efficiency of
scale and competition. This is the number of significant powder coatings
producers the UK now has.
As these rationalisations have peaked, the past few years have marked the
age of portfolio restructuring. Decorative businesses have been
regionalising whilst industrial businesses have sought to focus and
globalise.
With the exception of some speciality finishes, particularly wood finishes,
truly international retail brands are still thin on the ground. 'Own-label'
manufacturers such as Kalon are regionalising in Europe to exploit their
transferable operational skills and build the economies of scale which are
vital to them.
Environmental pressures on decorative architectural coatings are growing but
are still an insignificant driver of strategy compared with distribution
channels or manufacturing economies of scale.
The do-it-yourself paint consumer continues to buy on the basis of price,
colour and finish from any brand, or own-label brand, perceived to have a
good reputation. Environmental considerations are well down the list of
purchasing determinants.
Industrial users now, by contrast, are increasingly constrained by
environmental regulations: coatings and coating procedures with lower
environmental impact have become crucial in every sector. Since no
industrial coatings company can now keep up the pace in all their historical
markets whilst trying to globalise and master all the technologies required,
portfolio changes have recently been as frequent as car boot sales. They
have radically affected nearly all industrial coatings suppliers as they
seek to build competitive positions.
Today's important question is: 'What is the seventh age, and what will
happen in the next decade?'
Portfolio restructuring will continue, but at a slower pace in some sectors
at least because the number of competitive coatings suppliers is approaching
the minimum that the market will tolerate to retain competitive supplies.
Aerospace manufacturers now really only have a choice of two coatings
suppliers while automotive manufacturers have a choice of four or five. This
will be the time to digest what companies may have rather hurriedly
swallowed during the past few years. It will be the age of management.
Fortunately, management is something the coatings industry has become rather
good at over the past couple of decades. Coatings businesses which are
subsidiaries of heavy chemical majors, rightly supply more than their fair
share of managers, culture and ideas to their institutionalised parents.
Managers with a coatings background, even those with quite a modest area of
responsibility, have had to develop good strategic understanding, high
customer care skills, long term customer-supplier relationships, high
quality products efficiently produced - all the ingredients of successful
modern business. Often they interface with state-of-the-art customers in
their daily work and some of the best industrial strategy and practice rubs
off in the process.
Environmental pressures may have pointed the direction for the industry.
That it has arrived safely is because its management has grown with the
challenges and thrived on strong and fruitful links with its customers. This
should be a formula for success, in any age.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Switzerland (8): Still reluctant to join -
Relations with the European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In trying to nudge Switzerland closer to formal European integration the
Swiss government is having as much success as Sisyphus in the Greek myth.
Yet, like him, it is condemned to keep trying.
Situated in the heart of western Europe and intimately bound to it by
history, culture and strong economic ties, Switzerland cannot divorce its
destiny from that of its powerful neighbours. The only question is whether
it can influence the outcome more effectively inside European political and
economic structures or outside them.
While the economic arguments seem to point firmly in the direction of
increased integration, the political hurdles are formidable for a fiercely
independent nation built on three constitutional pillars of permanent
neutrality, direct democracy and local autonomy.
In 1992, after much hesitation, the Swiss coalition government finally took
the plunge and deposited Switzerland's membership application with Brussels.
The following December, Swiss voters narrowly refused to join the European
Economic Area (EEA), which since January has allowed goods, services,
capital and labour to circulate freely between the EU and five fellow
members of the European Free Trade Association (Efta).
Switzerland's EU membership application was put on ice, and Berne spent much
of 1993 in a damage-limitation exercise. In Brussels it lobbied for
bilateral negotiations in areas of vital interest to Switzerland such as
transport and participation in EU research programmes.
At home it launched an economic revitalisation programme to make Swiss laws
and practices more Eurocompatible and to boost competition in domestic
markets. Attempts were made to heal the rift between French-speaking Swiss,
who voted overwhelmingly for the EEA, and German speakers, who firmly
rejected it.
When last November Swiss voters approved introduction of a Eurocompatible
value-added tax, this was rashly seen by some as proof of a pro-European
shift in public opinion. Then came February's unexpected referendum decision
to ban transit freight from Swiss roads within 10 years. Though billed as a
vote to save the Alps from annihilation by lorry traffic, the move has
infuriated Switzerland's neighbours.
As a result of the vote, relationships with Brussels have gone from cool to
frigid. Switzerland has once again been branded an untrustworthy negotiating
partner.
The start of bilateral negotiations on transport, scheduled for April, may
be delayed. European transport ministers, some of whom have muttered darkly
of retaliation, are in no mood to give the Swiss an easy ride.
Swissair, the national carrier, which is seeking access to EU open skies,
could become an early casualty. Brussels will also be demanding a relaxation
of existing Swiss lorry curbs in return for better access to the EU road
haulage market for Swiss operators.
More generally, the EU is determined to prevent Switzerland securing full
EEA benefits too cheaply.
Agreement to Switzerland's bilateral negotiating agenda has been made
contingent on parallel negotiations on an EU slate that includes the highly
sensitive issue of Swiss immigration restrictions and import curbs on EU
agricultural produce.
Supporters of EU entry, with an eye to concessions won by Austria and the
three Nordic applicants for EU membership, argue that Switzerland would
secure a better balance of benefits inside the Union, including a say,
albeit limited, in formulating EU rules and policies.
Pro-Europeans, who include most of Switzerland's political, business and
financial establishment, also point to economic studies suggesting that
joining the EU could add half a percentage point to annual economic growth.
Staying out will inhibit exports, intensify the long-term trend to shifting
production abroad - sometimes just across the border in France or Germany -
and insulate protected inefficient domestic markets, they argue.
Swiss Eurosceptics dismiss the pessimism, claiming that Switzerland has
already reaped big benefits by staying out of the EEA. They believe the No
vote, by underscoring Switzerland's economic and financial independence, was
a contributory factor behind the huge influx of foreign funds last year.
As a result, the Swiss stock market was one of Europe's best performers in
1993 and the strong Swiss franc allowed interest rates to fall steadily,
helping the Swiss economy to pull slowly out of recession. Inflation is low
and the balance of payments is in record surplus.
Despite these arguments, the government's white paper on foreign policy in
the 1990s, published last December, insists that full EU membership must
remain a long-term goal. Mr Flavio Cotti, Switzerland's foreign minister,
has said he hopes the country could be a member by the year 2000.
Berne says there will be no attempt to negotiate membership of either the
EEA or the EU until after the next federal elections in October 1995. By
then Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden may be inside a 16-member EU,
leaving just Iceland and Liechtenstein as the only outsiders in the EEA.
In that event, Switzerland can be expected to head straight for Brussels.
Whether it arrives is another matter.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Switzerland (9): Ban it and bore on - John Braun
reports on plans for new Alpine tunnels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BRAUN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The inscrutable Swiss startled their neighbours again last month by voting
for a total ban on transit lorry traffic through the Alps to take effect in
2004.
Initial reactions abroad varied from disbelief to anger that the Swiss were
apparently putting up more fences to keep out the neighbours.
Since then, Swiss leaders have been at pains to emphasise that isolation is
not their goal. They want very much to be good neighbours, but they also
want their neighbours to be considerate of Swiss concerns.
One of the main concerns these days is trying to curb the pollution caused
in the narrow Alpine valleys by transiting German, Italian and other
European lorries.
Switzerland's proposed solution to this problem is not just to ban these
lorries. Rather it is proposing a bold expansion of the national rail system
and a rejigging of transit charges to encourage all shippers to choose the
rails rather than the road for moving their goods through the Alps.
At the heart of this plan is the AlpTransit Project or NEAT (Neue
Alpen-Transversale) approved by Swiss voters in a referendum in September,
1992.
It calls for the construction of two new high speed north-south rail lines
through the country connecting Basle and Milan. Officially, the cost of the
project is set at SFr14bn, but few deny that it will be much greater,
perhaps double that amount, which would make it about three times as
expensive as the Channel Tunnel project.
The main elements of AlpTransit would be two new so-called base rail tunnels
through the Alps, with base reflecting the idea of keeping the tunnels at
low altitude so that trains can pass through them at speeds up to 200km per
hour.
One line would be drilled under the Gotthard pass, the most highly travelled
transit route today. The other would go through the Lotschberg south of Bern
and continue on the existing rail tunnel under the Simplon pass.
Planners say it should be possible to knock two hours off the journey time
between Basle and Milan, making the railway a much more competitive form of
transit even without the lorry ban.
AlpTransit will be a huge civil engineering operation. The project will,
among other things, involve drilling one of the world's longest twin-tunnel,
single-track developments - the 57km Gotthard base tunnel - comparable in
length with Eurotunnel.
Tunnelling will take place at depths of more than 2km under the higher
mountains, incurring such difficult technical problems as extremely high
rock pressures and stresses - with attendant high working temperatures.
Test borings began last year, but serious exploration work is only due to
start this year following selection of contractors from an international
tender process that began last autumn.
In addition to the Gotthard and Lotschberg tunnels, the project includes
substantial upgrading to the Simplon tunnel rail line and improvements to
the Rhone valley rail line to connect with the French high speed rail
network at Geneva.
Connections from eastern Switzerland will also be upgraded. A new line is
planned for the Lake of Zurich area (Waedenswil/Au and Thalwil). This will
run in a tunnel under the Hirzel and Zimmerberg to Zug.
The management of the projects is in the hands of the two leading Swiss
railway companies, Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) on the Gotthard line, and
the Berne-Lotschberg-Simplon Railway (BLS) on the Lotschberg-Simplon line.
Early this month they formally requested federal government approval of
their route proposals, together with some variants that would add cost but
reduce disturbance in sensitive areas.
In the time honoured Swiss way, a long process of consultation will now
commence, so that the final decisions on routes are only likely to be taken
around the end of 1995. Then tenders will be issued for the main design and
construction contracts. The actual work is expected to begin in 1996 with
completion scheduled for 2007.
Although the Swiss have undertaken to open bidding to foreign companies,
there is little doubt that Swiss companies will dominate both the project
management and the work itself.
In part, this is protectionism but it also reflects the immense Swiss
experience in drilling tunnels through the hard rock of the Alps, dating
back to the 1870s when the first rail tunnel was pierced through the
Gotthard.
However, the sheer scale of the project means that the Swiss engineering and
construction industry alone will have nothing like enough equipment or
manpower to carry out the work. They will need to take on a lot of foreign
sub-contractors.
It is generally agreed that Italian and French companies are best placed to
win contracts as they have long experience of working in Switzerland and
with Swiss companies. British and other foreign companies that have less
experience of working in the country are being advised that the most
promising way of approaching the project is to join consortia led by Swiss
companies.
Unfortunately, even if the AlpTransit project is completed on time, it will
not come on stream until after the lorry ban is in force. Swiss officials
say there is plenty of capacity at the moment, and minor improvements being
made in the existing Lotschberg and Gotthard tunnels should ensure that no
bottlenecks develop.
But that may underestimate how quickly and extensively Switzerland and
Europe as a whole embrace the concept of environmentally friendly rail
transport in the next decade.
On the same day that the Swiss voted for a transit lorry ban, they also
voted to impose taxes on all lorries based on the distance they travel. If
the government exploits the opportunity provided by this measure, the
railway could soon become the more economical means of transport as well as
the more environmentally friendly one.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Switzerland (7): Times are tough - Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BRAUN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Times are tough in Switzerland's important tourism business.
Bed-nights, a key index of the industry, have been on a downward trend for
four years. And that followed a decade of near stagnation.
Last year, for example, the number of bed-nights sold fell three per cent to
33.2m, and there is no sign of an upturn. The Swiss National Tourist
Organisation (SNTO), the national promotion body, expects another two per
cent decline this year.
This is bad news for the country's third largest industry after machinery
and chemicals, and for the roughly 350,000 people who make their living from
it. Hotel closures have become a relatively frequent and distressing
phenomenon and unemployment in the sector is rising rapidly.
The reasons for the decline are now fairly well rehearsed. Recently, the
recession in western Europe, not least in Switzerland itself, has been a key
factor. Last year, the fall in domestic visitors to Swiss hostelries at 3.9
per cent was greater than the decline in foreign visitors.
The devaluation of some European currencies against the Swiss franc was
obviously another factor. The number of bed-nights taken up by Italians
tumbled by nearly a quarter last year.
But industry leaders agree that more than short term cyclical factors are at
work. Even the weather plays a significant role. Warmer and shorter winters
have hurt those areas that offer winter sport holidays.
The association of ski lift operators reported recently that their season
shrank from 120 days in 1970 to 110 days in 1991.
More important, Switzerland has clearly lost ground in the past decade to
Austria which offers tourists the same sort of 'products'. A recent survey
among Germans, for example, revealed that Austria was clearly preferred to
Switzerland as a holiday destination.
There is much debate about why this is so, but a lot of it is put down to
intangible factors - such as the tendency of Swiss hotels to hire more
immigrants, thus undermining the Swiss ambience.
The SNTO itself has come in for a lot of criticism for becoming lethargic
and bureaucratic in the face of an emerging crisis. Last year, the federal
government, which underwrites most of the SNTO's costs, finally took radical
action to shake it up.
It hired Nicolas Hayek, best known as the head of the Swatch-making watch
group SMH, to examine the SNTO and produce recommendations to make it more
effective.
In October, Hayek produced his report, recommending substantial cuts in SNTO
overheads, with the savings together with larger contributions from members
to be redirected to a more professional and more focused promotional effort.
He accepted that Switzerland had to stick with its aim to provide
exclusivity and quality mainly to the professional and leisure classes. For
one thing, it has the experience and facilities that appeal to these people.
For another, the Swiss franc is likely to remain strong, preventing the
country from competing with others on price alone.
But he said the country's image abroad had become rather dowdy. Like the
Swiss watch industry a decade ago, it needed to be polished and made more
joyful.
Mr Walter Leu, SNTO director general, says the SNTO staff has already been
cut by a fifth and a new president is expected to be appointed shortly.
Foreign outposts have been shuffled to reflect changing market potential.
The San Francisco office has been folded into the one in Los Angeles, Buenos
Aires and Sydney offices have been closed, and new ones have been opened in
Berlin and Hong Kong.
Mr Leu says he is now working on getting the organisation's 500 members to
provide more funds. At the moment, the organisation operates with annual
revenue of SFr36.7m of which the Government provides SFr32.6m. He would like
to see members' contributions rising to about SFr15m and ultimately even
more.
'It is our ambition not to depend heavily on government,' he says, pointing
out that it is the members who ultimately benefit from the organisation's
efforts.
Industry leaders across the country have welcomed what they consider to be
the long overdue shakeup at the SNTO. But being Swiss, they will probably
want to see some results before digging into their pockets to increase their
support to it.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Paints and the Environment (6): The 'refinish'
market at a crossroads - Environmental issues are the driving force behind
vehicle refinishing paint technology / Producers of coatings for repairing
the paintwork of cars and other vehicles were once slow to adopt new
technology, but they are now making up for it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For nearly 50 years from the mid-1930s, the UK crash repair market was
dominated by cellulose paints. Nitro cellulose had been used to make
explosives during the First World War. The development of cellulose spray
paints on motor vehicle production lines helped mop up spare capacity.
These spray paints deskilled traditional oil-based brush painting, were easy
and forgiving to apply - and by the mid-1930s were widely available. They
dried rapidly by solvent evaporation but because there was a high ratio of
solvent to pigment, they needed a considerable number of coats to achieve an
adequate paint film thickness.
Other countries, however, developed their own refinish paint technology. In
the US, acrylic lacquers were developed in the 1950s; in Germany,
restrictions on the production of nitro cellulose led to alkyd-based
technology, the forerunner of today's refinish coatings. The latter's
disadvantage was that the paint took too long to dry. Overcoming this
spurred the development of 'two-pack' paints in Germany. These used a
chemical hardener mixed in with the paint, prior to use. The paint cured
through a combination of chemical reaction and solvent evaporation, aided by
gentle heating, making them suitable for use on both production lines and
body shops.
Also, because two-pack paints contained a higher proportion of pigment to
solvent, fewer coats were needed to achieve the required paint film depth.
In addition, unlike cellulose, rubbing down between coats was not required
and a very high gloss finish was obtainable straight from the spraygun.
Moreover, by adjusting the base material and hardener formulations, a
variety of characteristics could be built in, such as resistance to extremes
of temperature, colour integrity, solvent resistance, flexibility and
smoothness of finish.
Correctly applied, these paints were capable of fully matching, if not
exceeding, the quality and durability of production line finishes. The
drawbacks were that they needed the dust-free environment of a spraybooth
and that they generally contained isocyanates, a respiratory sensitiser
damaging to lungs, which made it necessary for painters to wear breathing
apparatus. The new paints were also less forgiving to apply, requiring
better quality spray-guns and better trained painters.
The changeover from cellulose to two-pack paints was therefore slow in some
national markets, but by the end of the 1980s, cellulose paints were
becoming marginalised in bodyshops, largely through pressure from vehicle
manufacturers who were insisting upon the use of approved two-pack paint
systems if their anti-corrosion warranties were to remain in place after
accident repairs.
Until the mid-1980s there was very little awareness, or interest, in the
environmental or health and safety implications of refinish paint
applications, and consequently very little by way of legislation.
The impact of green issues in politics has changed this. Environmental
legislation is now the most significant force driving refinish paint
technology with paint manufacturers' research and development aimed
primarily at meeting ever more stringent legislation without compromising
paint quality, durability or application efficiency.
Initial UK legislation affecting vehicle refinishing was the Control of
Substances Hazardous to Health regulations (COSHH) in 1988, followed more
recently by the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations - the
MHSWR.
Both have put considerable pressure on vehicle manufacturers and refinishers
to improve health and safety standards. These, together with the
Environmental Protection Act - the EPA - which became law in 1990, have
provided the UK with some of the most exacting anti-pollution legislation in
the world.
The purpose of the EPA is to reduce and eventually eliminate the use of VOCs
 -volatile organic compounds used as solvents - in coatings. VOCs react
under sunlight with nitrous oxides to create low level ozone  -
photochemical air pollution which damages vegetation and can also cause
breathing difficulties.
VOC emissions as paint cures can be controlled either by increasing the
ratio of solids to solvent or by replacing some, or all, of the solvent with
a harmless pigment carrier such as water.
Another approach is to improve spraybooth filtration systems to prevent VOCs
being released into the atmosphere, as well as improving paint application
systems so that more paint ends up on the vehicle rather than on the
spraybooth floor.
Paint companies are obliged by law now to provide products which meet the
staged reduction of VOCs required by the EPA. At present, the law applies
only to bodyshops buying more than two tonnes of VOCs annually, which have
to have authorisation from their local authority to operate.
The limit has proved too high to affect any but the largest bodyshops - and
the control has been limited further by the Department of the Environment
allowing bodyshops to offset solvent products returned for recycling against
purchases when calculating the registration threshold.
Those bodyshops having to meet the two tonne requirements of the EPA feel
that they are at a competitive disadvantage and there is a strong
groundswell of resentment that the main pollution culprits are smaller,
ill-equipped bodyshops not covered by the Act.
The EPA is, however, an enablement act which means that the DoE can reduce
the present two tonne limit at any time. The industry is expecting reduction
by the end of the year, possibly to one tonne, although the majority of
industry observers are in favour of a much lower limit, a quarter of a tonne
in some cases or even zero in others. In any event, the main elements of the
VOC reduction objectives of the EPA have yet to implemented. These have
already resulted in dramatic developments both in product technology and
applications equipment.
All the leading paint companies have introduced 'high solids' paint which
will meet the first stage regulations coming into force in 1995, and certain
companies such as ICI Autocolor, Glasurit, the BASF refinish business, and
DuPont have already introduced water-based refinish paints in the UK
designed to meet the more stringent requirements which will come into effect
in 1998.
Water-based paints are already widely used on vehicle production lines but
can be more sensitive to temperature and humidity variations than their
conventional solvent-based counterparts. There are probably only a few
hundred UK bodyshops now using water-based refinish paints and many others
see few, if any, commercial advantages in changing to water-based yet.
ICI and Glasurit argue, however, that bodyshops using water-based systems
now will be able to build up their experience of new technology well in
advance of legislative requirements.
Other paint companies take an opposing view, arguing that waterborne paints
are more expensive, dry more slowly and are only available in limited
colours. Some say future product developments may well enable the strict
1998 VOC levels to be met without a switch to water anyway.
Paint manufacturers also have to watch what is happening in the car
factories. There has been a dramatic increase in the use of 'pearlescent'
paints and other special effects finishes such as tinted 'clearcoats,'
already available in Japan. All of these developments will create big
problems for the refinisher in extended repair times and the special skills
required to duplicate the original finish.
Part of the same problem is the whole question of colour matching. Vehicle
manufacturers are introducing more than 1,000 new colours a year - and it
can take about eight man-hours in the laboratory to produce a refinish paint
formulation to match an original factory colour.
Colour-matching systems are one of the refinish paintmaker's biggest
financial commitments. The use of new materials on vehicles such as plastics
and aluminium also affects colour matching, applications techniques and
product technology. It is clear that in the coming years the environment
will continue to be the single most important factor influencing new product
development in refinish paints.
In the past, different markets have had different refinish paint systems.
The sophistication of current systems, and the level of research funding
needed, means that we are moving rapidly towards global refinish paint
technology, with fewer companies having the resources or commitment to
continue to develop in this area.
Moreover, continued reductions in paint solvent levels and improved
applications techniques will inevitably result in the continued decline in
the volume of refinish paint sales, though product costs will rise.
There are six multinational companies producing paint for the UK market:
Akzo, BASF (Glasurit and RM), DuPont, Hoechst (Herberts Standox and Spies
Hecker), ICI and PPG.
Industry observers ask if there is enough room for all these leading
suppliers - or will changing strategies result in some of them increasing
their market share by acquisition and in others selling off their refinish
paint divisions?

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Switzerland (6): Wiring up the car industry - Max
Koch founded his company, Komax, on a bright idea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When he was a young electrical engineering student in Zurich, Max Koch had
the idea of making speed control units for cars. It was 1975, the time of
oil crisis and motorway speed limits. Demand for his product took off.
Koch, now 44, set up a company to make the units. Because they needed lots
of wires, he designed and built a special wire processing machine. Today,
his company - Komax, a word play on his name - is the world's largest
supplier of such machines, selling to the world's biggest car manufacturers
and suppliers.
Komax initially supplied machines to cut and strip flat cables for the home
electronics industry. Customers included big Japanese names such as Hitachi
and Sanyo.
In 1981 it moved into the motor business, which now accounts for more than
half of sales. As well as machines for cutting, slitting, crimping and
notching cables, Komax also makes wire processing centres to produce whole
cable harnesses for vehicles.
Some 70 per cent of Komax's production is in Switzerland - the company is
based in Dierikon near Lucerne - with 20 per cent in the US. The rest is in
low-cost Portugal, where a new plant supplies the local operations of
companies including General Motors and Siemens.
With the rapid growth of electronics in cars, Koch sees new opportunities.
The increasing popularity of anti-skid brake systems (ABS) and airbags, for
example, means more sensors to control these and thus more wires.
At present, Komax has around 50 per cent of the market for wire processing
machines in Europe and nearly a third worldwide. In the US, business grew by
almost 40 per cent last year, although recession has slowed performance in
Japan and Germany.
Like other Swiss companies with profitable niches in world markets, Komax
spends heavily on research and development: between 10 and 12 per cent of
its SFr75m turnover.
With recession in Europe, where business declined by 10 per cent last year,
Komax decided to modernise its product line in readiness for the next
upturn. Its new range of wire processing equipment is fully automatic, with
colour graphics, built-in quality control systems and simplified controls.
Koch is more optimistic about prospects for 1994, after a 5 per cent decline
in sales last year. He expects resumed growth of around 10 per cent in
Europe. 'Companies can stop buying for one or two years, but not for long'.
Nearly 15 per cent of Komax's business is in Asia, with more to come. More
machines will be developed for specific markets. 'In the past, we tended to
sell European machines to the US and Asia.'
Koch himself felt confident enough about the company's strength to bow out
of the day-to-day running of the company in order to concentrate on strategy
and innovation. He is now chairman, with a new chief executive brought in
from outside.
'When I was 35, I decided to be out of the operating side when I was 40. I
did it at 39.'

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Switzerland (4): 1993 - 'annus mirabilis' / Ian
Rodger looks at the banking business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss banks which are active in international asset management and
securities and currency trading still bask in the spectacular success they
enjoyed last year.
Most admit, however, that they benefited from a remarkable conjunction of
positive forces. Interest rates fell throughout the year, driving bond
prices higher and encouraging investors to shift more funds from fixed
income instruments into equity markets, which also boomed. The all share
Swiss Performance Index advanced no less than 40 per cent during the year
and volume was active on the Swiss stock exchanges throughout the year.
Introduction of a withholding tax in Germany and continuing political
turmoil in Italy encouraged more and more foreigners to store their savings
in safe, stable Switzerland.
Swiss banks are normally reluctant to reveal the size of the funds they
manage, but several reported that the amount rose by a third or more. Baer
Holding, the parent of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich and one of the few to
divulge fund figures, said its funds under management jumped 36 per cent to
SFr45bn.
Meanwhile, continuing international currency instability enabled the banks
to make handsome profits on their trading and financial engineering
services.
The only banking business that did not do well last year was lending. Net
interest income of all the big banks scarcely grew at all, and bad loan
provisions were hoisted to record levels - to some extent, it is widely
suspected, to hide profits from other activities. Given the continuing
recession in Switzerland and elsewhere, the opportunities for balance sheet
growth were few.
For the big banks, this slump was more than compensated by winnings
elsewhere. For the smaller cantonal and regional banks, which rely almost
totally on lending, it was a different story.
The trend to rapid consolidation in these sectors, which has been under way
for the past three years, continued at a brisk pace. The number of regional
banks, for example, has tumbled from 185 in 1991 to only 138 at the end of
last year.
Among the most significant events was the merger of the two cantonal banks
in Geneva, the Caisse d'Epargne de la Republique et Canton de Geneve and la
Banque hypothecaire du canton de Geneve, into the Banque cantonale de
Geneve.
This long and carefully planned merger of two still sound banks passed off
with scarcely a ripple. The same cannot be said for the collapse of a large
regional bank in Lausanne, La Banque Vaudoise de Credit, the bad loan
provisions of which exhausted its capital late last year.
The bank thrashed about noisily for a few weeks, looking for rescuers. This
caused a run on its deposits which had to be covered with emergency support
from the Federal Banking Commission. Eventually, after several rejections,
it was taken over by the state-backed Banque cantonale Vaudoise in December.
The regional banks association has since launched a scheme to try to prevent
further erosion within its ranks. It proposes creating a central
organisation which would carry out many transactions and back office
functions for the individual banks, thereby making them more cost
competitive with larger banks.
Regional bank officials admit it is already rather late in the day for such
a scheme. The combined assets of the 138 remaining members of the
association is only SFr70bn, a mere third of the SFr207bn on the books of
Swiss Bank Corporation, the smallest of the big three banks.
Swiss bankers have also been preoccupied in recent months with a blizzard of
legislation and new regulations affecting them, in part a reflection of the
federal government's desire to harmonise its practices with those of the
European Union.
Revisions to the banking law to bring it into harmony with EU practice are
in the final stages. The main debate has been over conditions under which
the Swiss banking authorities should co-operate with their foreign
counterparts. Oddly, one house of parliament wanted to minimise
co-operation, fearing that it would undermine bank secrecy, but leading
bankers convinced them that co-operation was in everyone's interest, and a
balanced version in line with Bank of International Settlements' guidelines
has finally won the day.
Bankers have also been trying hard to convince Berne that it would not be a
good idea to impose the new value added tax, due to come into effect next
year, on fees for managing foreigners' money. They fear that the resulting
increase in fees will persuade many clients to move their accounts
elsewhere.
The federal finance ministry, grappling with huge budget deficits, is
reluctant to give way on any source of revenue, but the banks - and the
country's struggling tourist industry - argue that it would be unfair to
exempt the export of products from VAT but not the export of services. A
decision is expected in May, but no one is predicting which way it will go.
A proposed federal stock exchange law and related regulations dealing with
takeover bids is meeting resistance at various levels. The stock exchange
law is needed to transfer regulatory power from the cantonal level to the
federal level once the national electronic stock exchange begins to operate
next year. But bankers have been upset about the drift of the proposed
legislation towards strict detailed government regulation at the expense of
self-regulation.
A strong divergence of opinion among banks and quoted companies on takeover
bid rules could delay implementation of the bill. Some feel that any
takeover rules must be accompanied by Euro-compatible monopolies
legislation.
There have been suggestions that the takeover provisions be detached from
the stock exchange law, so that the latter can pass more quickly. The fate
of a bill to bring Swiss law on investment funds into line with EU practice
is also in difficulty, even though the country has watched tens of billions
of francs decamp to Luxembourg in the past few years, where the legal
framework is more favourable.
Bankers place little hope on having stamp duty, a big irritant, removed from
investment funds and they are resigned to the exclusion of Sicavs (unit
trusts) from the legislation. The government claims the necessary legal
framework for Sicavs requires more changes to the companies law as well, and
that would be too time-consuming.
All this legislation comes at a time when business appears to be getting
more difficult for many Swiss banks, especially those that specialise in
portfolio management and dealing, than it has been for the last couple of
years. No one has been surprised by the slide in the stock market in recent
weeks. After three years of big increases, it was difficult to expect the
upward trend to continue, but the bond market slump has been more upsetting.
The whisper in Swiss banking circles is that damage repair will be necessary
over the next few months if clients' portfolios are to produce respectable
returns in 1994. To judge by the recent sharply downward trend of bank share
prices, investors suspect that the banks may have difficulty making their
own profits look respectable, too. The encore to the annus mirabilis could
be disappointing.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Switzerland (5): Market dictates a fast pace -
Andrew Fisher visits Esec, the semiconductors company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales are rising so fast at Esec - a maker of specialised equipment for the
semiconductor industry - that the small Swiss company has to be agile to
keep up with growth in demand, especially from Asia.
'Every two years, there's a new generation of machines,' says Mr Hans-Ulrich
Muller, chief operating officer. In between, there are numerous
modifications. 'We would like to have a slower pace,' adds Mr Peter Kilgus,
chief financial officer, 'but the market will not allow this.'
Esec (European Semiconductor Equipment Centre) is based in Cham in the
canton of Zug. It has no domestic market and sells most of its die bonding
and wire bonding equipment - used to move and connect chips - to
manufacturers in south-east Asia and South Korea.
Revenues last year shot up by 43 per cent to about SFr90m. It expects this
to more than double by 1996.
Formed 25 years ago, the private company is the leading world supplier of
this type of equipment; it is adding its Autoline assembly system to link
the stages of the bonding process in computerised manufacturing cells.
Esec has to spend heavily to maintain the lead in its chosen market niche.
About 20 per cent of its revenues go on research and development, which
occupies some 40 per cent of its workforce of 260. R&amp;D is carried out in
Switzerland.
Esec's customers are the big names in the chip and computer industries. They
include Intel, Microsoft, IBM, AT&amp;T, Motorola, Hewlett-Packard and National
Semiconductor of the US, as well as Hyundai and Samsung in Korea. Much of
the equipment sold to the US groups is used for their production in Asian
countries such as Malaysia, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand
and China.
It is from Asia that the main impetus for growth now comes. Last year, sales
in south-east Asia totalled 62 per cent of the total (a jump from 48 per
cent the previous year); this excludes Korea, which accounted for a further
4 per cent.
Sales to Europe - where customers include Siemens and SGS-Thomson - dropped
to 19 per cent of the total from 27 per cent, with those in the US
accounting for 15 per cent (25 per cent). 'Asia is still booming and we
expect quite a substantial increase in business there,' adds Mr Kilgus.
Its success in Asia does not, however, extend to the Japanese market. Nearly
half of the world's semiconductor industry is in Japan, notes Mr Kilgus.
'But it's very tough for foreign companies to get in, especially in our
sector.'
Esec's main product is the die bonder, for which it claims to be the biggest
world producer with 35 per cent of the world market. It has 6 per cent In
the newer wire bonding sector, but plans to reach 25 per cent (and top
market position) in two years.
Esec has no intention of moving from Switzerland. 'Salaries are high but
there is good education and motivation,' says Mr Muller. Esec recruits
people from Swiss technical universities and trains them itself.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Paints and the Environment (5): Moving into
sharper focus - Markets and suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Imperial Chemical Industries pulled out of IDAC, a Pounds 50m joint
venture in Germany with Du Pont, the US chemicals giant, in January, it was
one of three events finally defining the structure of the world's paint
industry, after 12 years of turmoil.
IDAC was set up in 1988 to attack the Pounds 650m European market for
painting cars on the assembly line - automotive OEM, or original equipment
manufacture. The venture failed to reach the 20 per cent market share ICI
needed to justify staying in the market.
Another of the three events had already deprived ICI of its seven-year-old
title as the world's biggest paintmaker: in November, Akzo of the
Netherlands took over the coatings business of Nobel of Sweden, astutely
merging two portfolios of products that had little overlap between them.
Akzo, however, is not obsessed by 'sizism,' as the third event showed: it
sold its European automotive OEM business to PPG, the market's US-owned
world market leader. Automotive OEM is now dominated in Europe by PPG, and
the German paintmakers BASF and Herberts.
ICI and Akzo Nobel are both strong in another branch of automotive paints -
vehicle refinish, or VR, where ever-higher technology coatings are used for
repairing damaged vehicles. Mr Louis McCulloch, senior partner of James
Consulting, an independent specialist on the paint industry, says their exit
from OEM was like slaughtering a sacred cow.
The two main pillars of the paint industry are the entirely separate markets
of decorative and automotive paints. The former is a low technology, high
volume cash generator; the latter is a high technology industrial market,
where partnership and symbiotic technical services are essential between
paintmakers, vehicle manufacturers and the suppliers of painting equipment.
Like Mr McCulloch, ICI's former OEM partner Du Pont, and OEM competitors
like PPG, BASF and Herberts, all believe the OEM and VR markets are
interdependent, if only to get car manufacturers to recommend specific
companies' VR products as part of their anti-corrosion guarantees.
Mr Herman Scopes, chief executive of ICI Paints, disagrees: 'Of the 10 top
VR companies in the world, four - ICI, Akzo, Sherwin Williams and Rock Paint
 -do not have any OEM. The link is more perceived than real,' he says.
His doubters say Sherwin Williams and Rock are each rooted in their large,
respective home markets of the US and Japan - and were the exceptions
proving the rule.
ICI and Akzo retort that the markets are entirely different. There is only a
tiny number of car manufacturers worldwide, but thousands of body shops.
Distribution, service, logistics and the ability to handle tens of thousands
of small transactions efficiently are what count, as Sherwin Williams has
proved in the US.
Companies like Akzo and ICI are used to transplanting marketing skills in
decorative paints around the world and are well up to this, apart from being
good enough chemists to match thousands of colours and guarantee their work,
whatever coatings technology was originally involved.
The debate symbolises the latest stage of evolution in paint markets. Even
15 years ago they were still largely national, with thousands of companies.
International spread was mostly based on the history of European
colonialism.
In the 1980s, ambitious suppliers of industrial coatings realised they had
to follow their customers as markets regionalised under political forces
like European union, or globalised under cost and efficiency pressures, as
in car manufacture or repainting ships.
Boats, trains, planes, cars and cans were all affected. A rush for territory
and presence began, led by BASF of Germany and ICI of Britain. Others, such
PPG of the US, which had developed the most corrosion-resistant
electro-coated system yet for car bodies, started buying their licensees
abroad.
If you could not dominate territory, you occupied specific product niches.
Courtaulds, which leads the world marine coatings market, set a trend by
occupying its niche on a global scale, followed by PPG in automotive OEM.
Theirs has proved the best policy because they did not suffer corporate
indigestion as they grew by acquisition. Moreover, their research was
focused on markets likely to yield early returns because they could
introduce new products or technology without a fight.
By contrast, ICI developed Aquabase, a good waterborne paint for automotive
OEM, but could not dislodge entrenched European competitors, even though
they were struggling to catch up with 'me-too' products. Du Pont, which has
a strong OEM and VR base in the US, will carry on alone.
Companies are refocusing on what they do best and where they can be in the
top three in a world or regional market. They have to: industrial buyers are
reducing numbers of suppliers - in the case of Ford, to one per factory.
So ICI has also sold its aerospace coatings business to Courtaulds, now a
leading transportation coatings specialist. In the US, Akzo sold its
aerospace business to Dexter, but took over the latter's coil coating
interests, while the two formed a joint venture in aerospace in Europe.
ICI's focus is now on its Dulux brand of decorative paints, VR, and can
coatings, where it is the US leader and strong in Europe against BASF.
Similarly, the Swedish-owned Beckers has strengthened in European coil
coatings, but sold its powder coatings business to Herberts : each was
separately strong in three or four countries but neither had enough volume;
Herberts is now strong in powder in eight European countries and will become
an increasingly important regional player.
By the same token, other companies abandoned low-margin decorative coatings,
where mass marketing is needed for sales volume and reasonable profits.
Hoechst set the trend here, selling Berger to Crown in the UK in the 1980s.
Similarly, Tikkurila of Finland sold Macpherson  - Woolworth's paintmaker -
to Akzo to concentrate on Kemira, its industrial coatings business.
If economies of scale offer the best prospects in these decorative markets,
big companies are best placed to achieve them. ICI is a strong marketeer of
premium brands to consumers and trade painters. Akzo absorbed a series of
medium-sized companies in the 1980s, then took over Casco Nobel, which - in
the UK - had already absorbed Crown, which had already absorbed Berger.
Other successful decorative paint companies like Johnstones passed into
French ownership, with Total now an international player. Petrofina, the
Belgian oil giant, is also in the big league through Sigma Coatings.
Independents can survive, but they have to be very good, such as Kalon,
which makes 'own-label' paints for DIY retailers. Its forte is good
logistics to ensure just-in-time distribution.
Small can still be beautiful, but your niche must be so unworthy of a
giant's attention, you will not be stamped on or swallowed. An example is
Carr's in Birmingham, or Weilburger, the UK subsidiary of the medium-sized
Grebe group of Germany.
The latter's strengths are in teltronics - matt-black, fingermark-proof
coatings for TV and video recorder cases - painting plastics and high
performance coatings for household durables.
And the role of the environment in all this? Not only does compliance with
green laws cost money, but also research and development time - and there is
little direct return.
Companies can only afford to spend resources on markets where they have
enough sales volume or margin to carry their 'dead' investment in the
environment. Every company's focus is likely to tighten further yet.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Switzerland (2): Domestic orders have fallen off -
Andrew Fisher reviews the state of manufacturing industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a country of less than 7m people, Switzerland has some of the most
internationally-oriented companies in the world.
Many of them sell more abroad than at home and some - notably in the textile
machinery sector - even produce more outside than inside their own country.
In the mechanical and electrical engineering industry, exports account for
nearly 70 per cent of total turnover.
Yet there is a worrying aspect to this success in foreign markets. It is not
that companies' performance is so closely tied to growth elsewhere, notably
in Germany. That is the overall competitive and economic environment in
which companies are used to operating.
What concerns the industry is that domestic orders have fallen so sharply in
the past few years. Last year, according to the Swiss association of
machinery manufacturers (VSM), new domestic orders fell by almost 10 per
cent after a near 17 per cent collapse in 1992. Foreign orders rose by 3 per
cent, producing an overall decline for 1993 of 1.2 per cent.
Although domestic business picked up strongly in the fourth quarter, that
was only because of some large orders from the army and Swiss railways. With
a quarter of its home market having disappeared since 1991, Mr Thomas
Gasser, the VSM's president, is arguing strongly for a political decision to
prevent capital investment being postponed until the introduction of
value-added tax in 1995.
The VSM estimates that at least 10 per cent or some SFr1bn of investment
which would benefit VSM companies could be delayed. The reason is that VAT
will not be levied on such investments, unlike the previous indirect tax
system. Whatever the outcome of this issue, the VSM does at least see the
chance of an overall improvement in its members' business this year. 'I'm
moderately optimistic about 1994,' says VSM's director Mr Martin Erb. 'I
expect more orders from abroad and I hope domestic orders will stabilise.'
Much, of course, depends on what happens in Germany, by far the biggest
customer. The European Union accounted last year for just under 60 per cent
of the industry's exports, which were down slightly to the region overall.
Mr Gasser is not over-optimistic about the immediate prospects for the
German economy and thus for the rest of Europe.
Helping to counter this trend near to home has been an explosive growth in
Asian markets. Leading these last year was China where exports by the Swiss
machinery and electrical sector rose by 59 per cent. China thus overtook
Japan as the industry's largest customer in Asia.
Altogether, exports to Asia rose by more than 9 per cent, with steep rises
also recorded in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. Yet such successes could
not wholly compensate for the problems elsewhere. The turnover of VSM
companies last year fell by 6.6 per cent to SFr24.1bn.
Mr Gasser, also deputy chief executive of ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the
Swiss-Swedish engineering concern, has no doubts about the innovative
abilities of Swiss companies as they strive to reverse this trend. 'We're as
good as anybody else,' he says. 'Large countries have all been
decentralising. This will spur innovation.'
Also, he stresses that Switzerland's traditional attributes of quality,
efficiency and peace on the labour front will continue to stand industry in
good stead. 'From the competitive point of view, I feel fairly strongly that
there's nothing wrong with industry.'
Where he does see a problem is in the structural rigidities which have
developed in the Swiss economy. The Swiss are used to living well and
cartels and monopolies have been allowed to prosper.
Mr Gasser does not think there is enough urgency, either in the government
or among the population, in pursuing this issue. 'We're too happy with
ourselves,' he says. Cartel groupings and local curbs on public purchasing
in other areas - both of which the government is now trying to combat under
its 'revitalisation' programme - affect industry's costs, he points out.
Because of Switzerland's high productivity and longer working hours, unit
labour costs are actually lower than in neighbouring Germany - a big
competitor as well as customer. However, this advantage will not necessarily
last. 'Next year, unit labour costs in Germany are likely to stagnate, as in
Switzerland this year,' says Mr Alois Bischofberger, economic research head
at Credit Suisse. 'The competitive advantage against Germany is likely to
disappear.'
Like other economists, he is not dismayed by the strength of the Swiss franc
against the D-Mark and other currencies. 'Experience shows that currencies
are not the most important factor,' says Mr Hans Kaufmann, head of Swiss
research at Bank Julius Baer. 'More important is the recovery in other
economies.'
As yet, the signs from world markets are mixed. Mr Fritz Fahrni, chief
executive of the Sulzer engineering group, sees slight indications of a
recovery in North America but does not expect much growth in Europe. 'I'm
afraid there is no boom around the corner.'
Sulzer is one company which has been rationalising its production and
management to stay competitive. Like ABB, it has been encouraging older
managers to retire and striving to bring on new products - as in its
fast-growing medical technology division which accounts for 36 per cent of
R&amp;D - as rapidly as possible.
However, this streamlining trend in industry has further to go. 'Not all
plants have been rationalised,' notes Mr Kaufmann. Some of the smaller ones
failed by under-estimating the amount of re-organisation and investment
(both in money and effort) needed in new computer systems and software.
'If you want to compete with the Far East, you have to be very modern these
days,' he adds. As the export figures show, many companies have taken
advantage of the prospects in Asian markets. But there is a social cost to
this process of steady improvement: job losses.
The VSM says 10,000 jobs have been lost in the industry in each of the past
three years. While this is not dramatic in an industry employing some
340,000 people, it is certainly an unwelcome change for a country where
unemployment used to be virtually unknown.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Switzerland (3): Pundits are wary - The economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slowly, cautiously and without flamboyance - rather like the Swiss
themselves - the economy is recovering from a recession which has pushed
unemployment up to levels not seen since the second world war.
Switzerland's recession has lasted for around three years and only in the
last quarter of 1993 did the economy start to move back into growth.
Although a Swiss recession may be unrecognisable as such to anyone from
Britain, the US, or currently even Germany it has caused considerable
strains in a small country so dependent on foreign markets and investors for
its prosperity.
Even now, economists are wary of promising too much for 1994. 'We've
probably passed the trough of the economic cycle, but we are still in the
very early stages of recovery,' says Mr Alois Bischofberger, head of
economic research at Credit Suisse. 'Most people haven't realised this
incipient recovery (is taking place) yet, as the labour market is relatively
weak.'
It is likely to stay weak for a while. At just over 5 per cent, or nearly
200,000 people, the jobless level will continue to be a dampener on the
economy, holding back private consumption, which is expected to show little
growth this year.
Mr Georg Rich, chief economist at the Swiss National Bank, says a stronger
economic improvement than currently expected would be necessary to bring
down unemployment significantly. 'I don't see a turnround (in the jobless
figure) this year, but if the revival accelerates next year, then it will
decline further.'
The general expectation seems to be for real economic growth of between 1
and 1.5 per cent in 1994 after a dip in 1993 - hardly enough to put much of
a dent in the jobless total. But the high unemployment level also reflects
the fact that fewer foreign workers are returning home, now that immigration
rules have been relaxed.
Also, improved benefits have encouraged more people to register as jobless.
More women are tending to join the unemployment statistics when they lose
work rather than drop out of the labour market.
In addition, as part of the worldwide industrial restructuring process, many
companies - especially the larger ones - have shed labour to become more
efficient and competitive.
It will not be until 1995 that both jobs and capital investment start to
benefit to any real degree from economic growth. Next year's economic growth
rate is likely to exceed 2 per cent, with exports up by around 4 per cent
(against less than 3 per cent this year and a marginal decline in 1993) and
capital investment rising by some 3.5 per cent after 2 per cent this year
and a 4 per cent drop last year.
Exports held up relatively well in the latest recession; in 1992, they
gained more than 3 per cent. This is partly because Switzerland went into
the recession earlier than some countries and partly because of sharp growth
in demand from countries in south America and Asia, though these account for
a relatively small part of total sales abroad.
This year's export growth will, despite the strength of the Swiss franc,
benefit from recovery in the US, continued buoyancy in south-east Asia and
an improved economic situation in Europe, notably in neighbouring Germany.
But with industry operating at little more than 80 per cent capacity,
compared with more than 90 per cent in the late 1980s, there is still plenty
of slack to be taken up before the employment situation benefits.
Productivity growth is now between 1.5 and 1.8 per cent a year, says Mr
Bernd Schips of the economic research centre at the Federal Institute of
Technology in Zurich. 'So we need overall growth of more than 2 per cent,
otherwise unemployment will stay high this year and next.'
To understand the significance of a 5 per cent jobless rate - Mr Schips
calls this 'unbelievably high' by Swiss standards - it is necessary to
remember that unemployment was unknown in the 1960s and did not exceed 1 per
cent until the mid-1980s. In its report on the Swiss economy last year, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said
unemployment was one of the problems that could undermine some of the
country's long-enjoyed advantages.
It also highlighted the need for a structural shake-up in the economy. The
government has already embarked on a 'revitalisation' programme, spurred by
the need to act after the Swiss people turned down membership of the
European Economic Area (EEA). The programme covers competition policy, the
liberalisation of immigration rules, education and research, and trade, both
international and internal.
Cartels need to be eliminated. 'Cartels are widespread in the economy,' Mr
Bischofberger says. 'The domestic economy is one of the most cartelised in
Europe.' Stronger action on this would help bring down prices, one obvious
example being in the car business where importers have a monopoly.
Another area which needs to be tackled effectively is local protectionism in
procurement policies. 'In some cantons,' Mr Bischofberger points out,
'administrations and schools are not allowed to buy products and services
outside the canton or even their municipality.' The idea is to benefit local
producers, but the effect is to keep prices high.
If Switzerland's revitalisation process is successful, its traditional
strengths deriving from a skilled workforce, harmonious industrial
relations, first-rate infrastructure and corporate innovation will be
enhanced. With inflation falling towards 1 per cent - even though the move
in 1995 to a value-added tax (VAT) system will give it a one-off boost -
economic stability is being newly consolidated.
That still leaves the problem of the budget deficit. At nearly SFr14bn, it
totals some 4 per cent of gross domestic product. The ending of recession
will help reduce this, but the government also has to act. Mr Rich cites the
case of a young economist who would probably earn at least SFr5,000 a year
more if he joined the federal government than if he went to a bank paying
market rates.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Paints and the Environment (2): A question of
balance - The decorative market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since 55 per cent of all paint sold goes on walls, ceilings, doors, window
frames, skirting boards and masonry, they are bound to have a significant
impact on the environment.
This - the decorative market - is itself divided into two large segments -
do-it-yourself paints people buy increasingly from retail sheds; and trade
paint sold from specialised centres to professional decorators.
Sales are large. ICI puts the European DIY market at about 730m litres a
year. Britain leads with 156m litres - inevitably, when businesses such as
B&amp;Q, Texas Homecare, and Do-It-All have developed the concept of the retail
shed more intensively than anywhere else. Germany follows with 151m litres,
then Italy with 150m litres and France with 89m litres.
The relative size of the trade and DIY segments is illustrated by Akzo
Nobel's figures for decorative sales overall, which make France the biggest
market with nearly 570m litres in both segments combined. Germany comes
second with more than 440m, followed by Britain with more than 400m and
Italy with 375m.
The split matters because different solutions to environmental concerns are
being demanded and applied in each market segment. The effects in the
marketplace are now becoming marked in Germany, Europe's largest
environmentally-conscious national market.
Environmentally friendly paints have made significant impact in German
consumer DIY markets, but their impact has been poor among professional
decorators, according to Mr Chris Joyce, technical manager for ICI's
decorative products in Europe.
'These types of product were launched in Germany 10 years ago and they now
have between 25 and 30 per cent of the national retail market. But they
haven't got anywhere in the German trade market because of price and
difficulties in guaranteeing quality of work,' he says.
The problem is that the more environmentally friendly decorative paints
become, the higher their price, while performance declines. The right
balance has yet to be struck - and professional decorators are refusing to
adopt products that demand return visits to put work right, or which do not
last long enough to satisfy their customers.
Since few decorative paints are toxic - and these cannot be bought in DIY
markets - the main area of environmental concern is emission of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) used as solvent.
'We cannot control how millions of people use decorative paint,' Mr Joyce
says. 'All the paint we sell evaporates. Although the VOC emission from
decorative paints is only two per cent of total emissions, we sell a lot of
decorative paints, so none of us can sit back complacently and do nothing.'
The problem is less acute for paints used on walls and ceilings than for the
gloss paints needed on woodwork. The former now nearly all use water as
their principal solvent. Germany already insists that wall paints for
internal use should contain no VOC solvents, while ICI has already
eliminated them from its DIY products.
Professional decorators, however, prefer a little VOC in the formulation to
help the paint spread smoothly and dry to an even finish. Indeed, VOC
solvents are essential in gloss paints if they are to have the properties of
shine and durability people expect.
Traditionally, VOC solvents accounted for 70 per cent of a gloss paint's
formulation. Reducing requires more pigment in the paint, or a mix of water
and VOCs as solvent, or a combination of both. Getting it down to 35 per
cent will qualify for eco-labelling when standards are finally introduced.
This, however, will not do. Mr Joyce points out that in Austria, the maximum
permitted VOC solvent level will be 10 per cent from next year. This
compares with 30 per cent the industry thinks reasonable to aim for by 2000
 -'the danger is an imposed solution. We need to be pro-active as an
industry. Europe should also try to move forward together,' he says.
One idea is a ratchet system, with general agreement to reduce in discrete
steps at two-year intervals. This would phase the pain, especially since the
new coatings may push up prices by 50 per cent.
This phased approach may also be necessary to carry public opinion. Mr Chris
Harris, general manager of ICI's UK and Ireland decorative business, says:
'Every time you offer alternatives, there is a trade off between performance
and price. People are very concerned about the environment until they have
to pay. Only the most ardent greens are prepared to pay more or sacrifice
quality for the environment.'
He also says there is another argument about paint and the environment which
needs to be vigorously advanced.
'Paint protects surfaces and maintains the life of buildings, which in turn
is a contribution to sustaining resources. Paint is about protection from
decay. What is the point of paint that is so environmentally friendly it
costs more, does not perform well and needs repainting every two years
instead of four?' he asks.
There is evidence that a balance is beginning to assert itself with some
local authorities - all of them big buyers of decorative paints - rethinking
previous decisions to 'go waterborne' as ensuing maintenance times have
shortened.
The conservationary benefits of paint are also becoming more visible all
over Britain. Concrete tower blocks of council housing - which had become
hideously disfigured by acid rain, stains, corrosion of reinformcement bars,
mould and decay - have in recent years been transformed by new masonry
paints designed to protect concrete after repair.
Good colour schemes has also broken up the stark outlines of tower blocks
and made them sit more happily in the visual environment. If these coatings
had been waterbased, they would have been washed off in this winter's
torrential rains.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Paints and the Environment (4): Process has
environmental benefits - Coil coating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One type of industrialised wet painting has been growing steadily for about
the last 15 years, in spite of the emission of copious quantities of
volatile organic compounds during the process, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey.
The process is called coil coating. Its environmental advantage is that it
enables manufacturers to get rid of their paint shops altogether. The metal
they want to bash or bend comes ready-painted with coatings so tough they
remain undamaged during production.
Coil coated steel or aluminium is now formed into hundreds of products, from
profiled cladding for buildings to consumer durables like refrigerators and
washing machines, to teltronic products like video recorders and sound
systems, to non-stick cookware or components for cars.
The process is largely automatic. A roll of steel or aluminium - called a
coil - is unrolled and passed flat through pre-treatment tanks to clean and
degrease it before being sprayed automatically with wet, solvent-borne
paint.
The coated strip then moves through a heated tunnel, where VOC solvents are
driven and the mixture of resins and pigments polymerise into some of the
toughest paints ever designed by chemists.
VOC emissions are not a problem because they are collected and incinerated.
The resultant heat is then recycled back into the production process to help
with the stoving, thus saving energy.
With all the potential for pollution in one place - including run-off of
pre-treatment chemicals - it is contained and dealt with efficiently.
Coil coated products barged into the market initially because of labour
cost-savings from eliminating individual paint shops in the 1980-82
recession.
The cost to the remaining small shops of environmental compliance is now
likely to provide another boost.
Mr Roger Walters, chief executive of Euramax and chairman of the UK Coil
Coaters' Association says that 'for virtually the whole of the 1980s, our
industry was growing at 10 per cent a year.
'Since 65 per cent of the market is in the construction sector, there has
been a slowdown in the recession, but things are still healthy.'
Mr Peter Burling, who runs British Steel's thriving coil business is
president of the European Coil Coaters, says 'our products are perceived to
be good for the environment.
'As legislation becomes tougher, in-house painting will become more costly.
We expect to take more market share from traditional industrial paints.'
Beckers, the Swedish-owned paintmaker, claims about 25 per cent of European
coil markets.
Mr John Lyon, managing director of Beckers' UK business, who has overall
responsibility for coil, says 'environmental compliance is an opportunity.
Coil takes all the problems away from the manufacturer of coated articles.
'It also involves a marriage of coater, pre-treatment specialist and paint
supplier in which quality and consistency are more important than price.
This makes it a good business to be in.'

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Paints and the Environment (3): Increasing
sensitivity - Disposal of waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Wastewagon started rolling round Leeds in 1992, it set in train a
new approach to dealing with waste paint. It toured designated districts
collecting paint cans people had finished with - and any paint still in
them, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey.
The Wastewagon - a Ford Iveco van with a tail-lift - was sponsored by ICI.
Backing also came from B&amp;Q, the DIY retail shed group; UK 2000, the
clean-up-Britain charity; and Leeds city council. Monetary costs were only
Pounds 4,500, but the more valuable help came in kind - people and
resources.
The experiment was a test of whether it was sensible to try and
systematically collect waste paint and do something worthwhile with it.
Success was confirmed last week when Leeds officially opened a permanent
'paint exchange' system.
Ealing, a London borough, brought in consultants from the Leeds experiment
and started a similar scheme last autumn.
The Wastewagon, however, is no more. This proved a costly and inefficient
method of collecting waste. It was better to provide collection points where
people could dispose of it themselves.
What the experiment proved was that there is now a substantial amount of
re-usable paint in most people's waste. Ms Isobel Howe, research consultant
to Swap - Save Waste and Prosper, a not-for-profit agency which did the
experiment, says this amounted to 20 per cent of collected waste and came to
about 750 litres.
But who would want to re-use it? Charities, says Ms Howe - 'more than enough
recipients were attracted to use all the collected paint, with demand far
exceeding supply. It was quite clear a permanent scheme would have no
problem finding plenty of takers, given the right links to social services
departments and the voluntary sector.'
Most people have waste paint in their homes. Used cans with paint still in
them are left in cellars, box rooms, cupboards or garages. When they are
thrown out, it is usually with the household rubbish - sometimes after paint
that is still liquid has been poured down the drain.
Leeds has now set up 'paint banks' at three municipal waste dumping centres.
Each has three skips - one for empty tin cans, one for empty plastic
containers and one for containers with paint still in them. Empty tins cans
go for recycling, as do those of the plastic variety which are suitable.
Containers with small quantities of paint that has solidified are classed as
empties. They are shredded prior to recycling and the waste paint can be
collected as it fragments.
The skip for liquid, possibly re-usable paint, has racks to keep containers
upright when the skip is moved. Sorting is at a community training base by a
workforce undergoing youth training, in effect giving them a proper project
to learn on. What cannot be re-used goes for recovery and recycling - or
safe disposal if it so old it contains now-banned toxic ingredients like
lead.
A stocklist system will ensure incoming containers are logged by volume,
manufacturer, colour, age and re-usability. This could come into its own if
other local authorities follow the Leeds and Ealing leads, with a database
of second-hand paint available for charities and community projects. Waste
is likely to become an increasingly important issue if such schemes
proliferate and public consciousness is raised.
This could also rebound on paint manufacturers. Little attention was paid to
waste disposal in the past. Indeed, on the basis of 'the polluter pays,' who
is responsible for waste decorative paint? Is not the customer, the person
disposing of unwanted paint or empty containers, the polluter?
But with the ownership of decorative paint production now concentrating into
fewer large groups - all of them more vulnerable to public opinion than an
industry in fragmented ownership - sensitivity is increasing.
'Waste paint is not so much a hazard as a nuisance,' says Mr Chris Joyce,
ICI's technical manager for decorative products in Europe. 'We need to get
together with everyone concerned and find the right approach.'
The industry is setting up a group to run further pilot projects on the
Leeds lines to encourage more public paint banks and systems to manage them.
Education is also part of the process, says Mr Joyce, starting with not
over-buying in the place through better calculation of how much paint might
be needed for a job.
Companies wanting to improve their waste management could start with a
simple DIY training manual published by Athena Training International of
Bootle, under licence from ICI Paints. Its aim is to change people's
attitudes to waste - from producing less of it, to managing and disposing of
it better.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Switzerland (1): Increasingly awkward position -
Despite a resilient economy and a tranquil political scene, the Swiss remain
uncertain about their future in a more integrated Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By any measure, Switzerland is doing pretty well these days.
It has a strong currency, a resilient economy, a restored status as a
banking centre and a relatively tranquil social and political life. It even
has some fresh outside endorsements.
The Economist newspaper recently pronounced Switzerland the world's most
desirable country in which to live, on the basis of a synthesis of economic,
social, cultural and political statistics. And a survey last month by
International Survey Research found that Swiss workers were the most
satisfied in Europe.
This represents quite a change from the late 1980s when a series of unseemly
scandals in business and government and uncertainty about European
integration were undermining Swiss confidence.
But beneath the surface doubts and problems persist. Having decided in a
referendum 15 months ago to keep their distance from the European Union, the
Swiss remain bemused by the integration process going on around them.
They also sense that the strategic assumptions on which they have anchored
their policy of armed neutrality for nearly 200 years no longer hold, but
they are not sure how they should fit into the post-cold war world.
And they are startled by an increasingly raucous tone in their internal
political debates, reflected in a sharp polarisation of voting patterns in
recent local elections and the tragic inability of all levels of government
to agree on a policy for dealing with the country's outsized community of
hard drug addicts and dealers.
For the moment, though, most Swiss are probably just relieved that things
are going as well as they are.
In late 1992, as the debate swelled over whether or not the country should
join the European Economic Area (EEA), political and business leaders warned
of dire consequences - an exodus of industry and a slumping economy - if the
EEA was rejected.
In the event, the people voted by a small majority to stay out of the
expanded free trade area which unites the EU and the countries of the
European Free Trade Association (Efta). Yet so far no significant negative
consequences can be directly attributed to this decision.
On the contrary, there is widespread agreement, even among European
integration advocates, that the decision has bolstered Switzerland's
previously flagging status as a financial safe haven.
New investment funds have poured into the country in the past year at a rate
not seen since the early 1970s when the central bank ultimately had to
impose negative interest rates to staunch it. While it is true that external
events - a new withholding tax in Germany and political turmoil in Italy -
provoked these flows, it is also true that much less of it would have come
to Switzerland if the country had joined the EEA.
The inflow - which in fact began a few months before the EEA vote - enabled
the Swiss National Bank to begin lowering interest rates well before other
European central banks, and that in turn helped reduce inflation and lay the
base for the economic recovery which seems to be getting under way this
year.
Whether the EEA decision has had any structural impact on Swiss industry
remains unclear. Corporate investment has been at a low level anyway, and
the rise of unemployment to record levels in the past year is attributable
mainly to higher female participation rates and the tendency of guest
workers not to return to their countries when they lose their jobs.
Nevertheless, there remains an uneasy sense that some day a price will have
to be paid for the arrogant decision to remain aloof from the European club
 -a sense that was heightened last month when, in another referendum, a
majority voted to ban all transit lorry traffic from the Alps from 2004.
Swiss authorities may say that this latest decision was motivated entirely
by environmental considerations and is in the mainstream of progressive
European transportation policy, but neighbouring countries have been
offended by this unilateral move and have already threatened retaliation.
Planned negotiations later this year between Switzerland and the EU on other
air and road transport issues will not be made any easier, and Swissair, the
national airline, could find itself unwelcome at some EU airports.
The federal government finds itself in an increasingly awkward position on
European matters. It is caught between its conviction that integration is
essential and inevitable for the country's future welfare and security, and
the mood of the Swiss population, which shows no sign of having shifted
since the EEA vote.
This discomfort was reflected in a foreign policy statement in December
which restated the goal of Swiss integration into the European Union, but
eschewed setting any timetable for it, for fear of stirring up the
Europhobes.
The otherwise bland statement did contain one remarkable chapter - devoted
to the issue of neutrality. It effectively laid the basis for jettisoning
this sacred foundation of Swiss foreign policy, arguing that neutrality was
never an end in itself, but merely a means of preserving Swiss independence.
The paper suggested that today, when 70 per cent of imports come from EU
countries, Swiss independence is threatened more by not having a say in EU
policymaking than by any hostile military power.
So far, the Swiss have shown little inclination for full debate on strategic
policy, but that could change soon. In June they are to vote in a referendum
on providing blue helmet troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations,
which should refocus attention on strategic issues and the future role of
the Swiss military.
The country still has one of the largest armies in Europe, with 600,000 men
capable of being mobilised within a few hours. The government decided, three
years ago, that such a large force was no longer necessary following the
collapse of the Soviet empire. From next year, force levels are to be
reduced by a third, with whole regiments disappearing. So far, this
restructuring has not been accompanied with the howls of protest that
greeted similar cutbacks in some other countries, but it could have a big
long term social impact. The militia army has long been one of the few
unifying forces of Swiss society - the 'Place de la Concorde' where men from
all social strata and linguistic groups get to know each other in testing
circumstances.
Some people fear that the country is already showing signs of losing its
delicate cohesion, and that social and political debates are becoming too
strident. This has been especially apparent in the Zurich region in recent
months, as public anxiety over rising drug crime has mounted.
The marginal right wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) seized on this anxiety in
recent elections in the country's largest city, campaigning aggressively
against the liberal approach of those it sneeringly called 'die Linken und
Netten' (the Lefties and the Do-gooders) to the drug problem.
The people responded, voting in 19 SVP representatives to the 125 seat city
council on March 6, compared with only seven in 1990.
It was hardly a coincidence that the federal government, which has dithered
over drug policy for years, leapt into action the following week, passing
tough new measures to curtail the rights of asylum seekers. Many drug
dealers in Zurich are former Yugoslavs who have exploited the asylum law to
avoid extradition.
Civil rights activists were appalled, and opinion leaders in distant
French-speaking cantons grumbled about further proof that the nation was
being forced to subordinate its priorities to those of Zurich.
It all seems a bit un-Swiss, but it would be wrong to forecast any serious
deterioration of the still exceptionally high quality of life in the
country. The Swiss are too tough and practical to let that happen.

A slow day in the derivatives markets picked up towards the close when
London turned nervous as Wall Street started the new session on the downward
tack, writes Terry Byland. The June contract on the Footsie had an erratic
day, opening at a modest discount to fair value, which is now estimated at
between 3 and seven points.
Early deals saw the June contract fall away fairly sharply to a low for the
session of 3,106 as investors backed away from the latest data on the
domestic economy. But buyers then appeared and at 3,154, the contract
provided a good lead for equities, showing a premium of around 12 points to
cash. later, when Wall Street unsettled UK markets, the contract faded to a
close of 3,137, still an 8 point premium. trading volume, taking in business
after the official close, reached just over 14,000 contracts.
Business in traded options jumped to 42,227 contracts from 29,165 on the
previous day. The FT-SE contract took pride of place with 18,242 contracts
against 14,071. The Euro FT-SE contract was also active, trading 6,269
contracts. Individual contracts were headed by Hanson at 1,987 and other
blue chips to attract interest included BAT Industries (1,932).

FT  08 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Forte hit

<TEXT>
Hotels group Forte gave up 8 to 239p, in heavy trading of 7.9m, making it
the day's sharpest loser among FT-SE 100 constituents, after Hoare Govett
reiterated its negative stance just one week before the group's results.
The broker denied reports in the market that it had downgraded profit
expectations and said it was maintaining its current estimate of Pounds 88m.
The range of predictions is Pounds 86m to Pounds 126m. But Hoare Govett
yesterday joined other broking firms which have highlighted the possible
negative impact of the new FRS5 accounting standard which deals with off
balance sheet debt.
Bargain hunters helped Rank Organisation shrug off recent weakness and the
shares closed 12 ahead at 398p, on volume of 2.1m.
Shares in British Gas slipped on talk of a switch carried out by one leading
UK investment bank and continuing concern over the regulator's decision on
the rate of return from the company's pipelines. News that the privatised
company is to halve the number of its shops and cut 1,700 staff had already
been anticipated. The stock, which has underperformed since the start of the
year, slid 6 1/2 to 295 1/2 p with 13m traded.
News and financial information group Reuters Holdings moved forward 22 to
1949p in spite of a weak US market. Dealers said a big institutional sell
order of between 2m and 3m shares, equivalent to around Pounds 50m, had been
completed in early trading. The was also also some buying ahead of a
Europe-wide presentation to analysts in Geneva on April 25.
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome, which had held up throughout the day, fell 8
to 557p shortly before the close. News leaked into the market that the full
text of the Anglo-French Concord study which undermined prospects for AZT,
the anti-AIDS treatment, would be published today. AZT is Wellcome's second
biggest selling pro-duct.
News of an increase in passenger traffic for March boosted British Airways.
The shares moved 7 ahead to 422p.
The 10 per cent improvement in profits at Highland Distillers to Pounds
23.4m left the shares trailing 12 to 403p.
Among stores, Boots improved 7 to 526p, following recommendation from Smith
New Court as the market awaited news on the sale of the group's
pharmaceutical division.
Brewing group Bass closed 3 ahead at 532p, after it refused to comment on
recent speculation that it was about to bid for Dutch brewer Grolsch.
Building group Blue Cirle fell 12 to 325p on dilution concerns after the
company decided to call in its capital bond.
Shares in engineering group James Wilkes closed 17 ahead at 177p, following
an announcement of an agreed bid from 29.5 per cent stake holder
conglomerate Suter.
British Steel put on 4 1/4 to 146p, with James Capel reported to have been
the buyers. Turnover closed at 9.2m.
News that British Aerospace was to join forces with Dasa of Germany and
French group Aerospatiale in a research programme to investigate the
viability of a successor to Concorde left the market unimpressed. The shares
closed 3 lighter at 477p, in thin trading.
Mr Chris Avery at Paribas said: 'The results are too far in the future to
worry us now. The industry is more likely to develop a 600 seat jet rather
than son of Concorde.'

Regional electricity companies suffered as selling by one securities house
and disappointing news from one company highlighted their outperformance of
the broader market.
Scottish Hydro-Electric said its hydro output had dropped by 26 per cent on
1992-1993. Analysts said problems were specific to the company and depressed
hydro output resulting from low rainfall in Scotland had been expected.
However it combined with a reiterated sell note from UBS to focus attention
on the sector. The sector has outperformed the FT All-Share on most
timescales yet concern remains ahead of a distribution review expected in
July.
Scottish Hydro slipped 6 to 376p and Scottish Power fell 14 to 401p helping
to lead the sector down. PowerGen hit a low for the year before closing 12
off at 507p Eastern Electricity fell 22 to 663p, and Norweb 27 to 664p.

FT  08 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong rebound by BP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A firmer oil price combined with an upbeat annual meeting helped British
Petroleum shares to recover from recent uncertainty and to end the day as
the top performer in the FT-SE 100 Index.
The price of one-month Brent crude, which slumped to Dollars 13.15 just
after the recent OPEC meeting decided that output levels would be
maintained, had recovered to Dollars 14.75 by the close of dealing in London
yesterday. Dealers in the US said Metallgesellschaft, the German oil and
metals company which was very badly hit after buying into oil futures just
before the market tumbled, had finally liquidated its long position.
Meanwhile Lord Ashburton, BP's chairman, told the agm the company's
financial health and balance sheet had improved greatly over the past year
and it was beating its targets on debt, profit and investment in spite of
oil price weakness. Credit Lyonnais Laing shifted its recommendation from
'underweight' to overweight' arguing that the shares would hit 500p over the
next 12 months and Lehman Brothers raised forecasts for several US oil
stocks. BP bounced 14 to 371p on turnover of 11m shares Other leading oil
groups took heart from the statement. Shell Transport gained 11 to 682p
while Enterprise recovered 10 to 428p.

FT  08 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early share gains wiped out in
nervous trade - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shadow of the US securities markets fell across London yesterday
afternoon, when share gains achieved in the first half of the session were
speedily eliminated. UK stocks came back sharply as Wall Street opened lower
and bond markets showed nervousness while awaiting reports of a speech by Mr
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, to bankers in
California.
Trading volume in equities was disappointing in a market now back to genuine
investment activity after completion of tax year-end activity. However, many
investment managers continued to concentrate on preparing reports for their
trustees on fund performances over the first quarter of the year.
The market opened slowly behind a stable trading day in New York and
remained close to overnight levels following news of higher increases than
expected in both industrial production and manufacturing output. However,
initial firmness in UK government bonds helped the Footsie to move ahead by
12 points to 3,143.5.
This early confidence vanished as soon as the New York markets opened. With
the Dow Average down 14 points and US Federal bonds also lower in early
trade, the gain on the Footsie was quickly replaced by a modest fall.
Selling was light but buyers withdrew.
At the close, the FT-SE Index was 2.5 off at 3,129, with the FT-SE Mid 250
Index down 13.9 at 3,764.2. Total Seaq volume of 715.1m shares was down by
nearly one quarter from the previous session. But on Wednesday, the first
day of the new tax year in the UK, share volume was inflated by heavy
tax-related trading. Stock Exchange statistics showed that Wednesday's
equity business was worth Pounds 2bn in retail, or customer, worth; this
puts the session among the most active, in terms of underlying customer
business, of the past 12 months.
Traders expressed disappointment with London's reaction to Wall Street,
which was sharper than seen in other European markets. The session appeared
to indicate that London is finding difficulty in de-coupling itself from
worries about the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve.
The rise of 0.8 per cent in domestic manufacturing output and of 0.6 per
cent in manufacturing output last month, although taken quietly in equities,
further challenged confidence in prospects for an early cut in domestic base
rates and left UK stocks to react to easier trends in UK bonds later in the
session.
With the Bundesbank policy council not due to meet until next week, markets
have little choice but to focus on the US Federal Reserve. Hence last
evening's nervousness ahead of Mr Greenspan's speech in San Francisco.
The final dip in the FT-SE Index was greater than appeared because the Index
took in strong performances from the blue chip oil stocks as well as several
other big names, including ICI and Reuters. The oil sector benefited from a
welcome rally in crude oil prices and a very positive annual meeting of
shareholders in British Petroleum.
But utility stocks fell heavily as the market continued to look for strong
dividend growth in the manufacturing sectors. Interest-related sectors also
found themselves left on the shelf yesterday, reflecting doubts on base rate
hopes and easier trends in some consumer stocks reflected disappointment
with the progress of high street spending.

FT  08 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow edges forward after weak
start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks posted moderate gains yesterday after reversing course alongside a
steadily improving bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.53 better at 3,693.94, while
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.83 higher at 450.88. In
the secondary markets, the American SE composite edged 0.78 ahead to 441.76,
while the Nasdaq composite added 4.45 to 752.71 amid continued
bargain-hunting after a big sell-off early in the week.
Stocks opened on a weak note, as profit-takers moved in following Tuesday's
82-point jump in the Dow industrials and a smaller rise on Wednesday. The
bellwether blue-chip index showed a 20-point decline at the start of trading
but managed to return half way to its opening level by early afternoon.
Early on, there was little to influence sentiment. The bond market was
holding steady in spite of speculation over monetary policy triggered by the
Federal Reserve chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, who was speaking to businessmen
in San Francisco. He said he thought the country's economic pessimism was
unjustified.
Late in the day, bond prices improved steadily, unburdening equity investors
concerned over the sharp rise in interest rates in recent weeks. Share
prices pushed into positive ground and finished mostly higher. On the NYSE,
advancing issues outnumbered declines, 1,355 to 754.
In the previous session, Caterpillar was responsible for almost all of Dow's
modest gain. Yesterday, it gave back Dollars 1 7/8 to 118 1/4 , while Allied
Signal and International Paper also fell sharply. But their losses were more
than offset by DuPont, General Motors, Philip Morris and JP Morgan, which
rallied in the afternoon.
The session was also punctuated by conflicting signs of the economy, neither
of which were viewed as particularly significant. The Labour Department
reported that initial claims for state unemployment benefit had risen
slightly last week, suggesting a slowing of the economy.
Conversely, the leading US store groups indicated that consumers had
returned in droves to the shopping malls last month after February's deep
freeze. The figures suggested that the economy as a whole may not have lost
much steam in the first quarter.
Strong sales data helped lift several of the big retailers. The Gap was near
the top of the NYSE's most active list after posting a 16 per cent increase
in business for stores opened at least a year. The stock jumped Dollars 2
1/8 to Dollars 48 7/8 on the news.
On the Nasdaq, Sun Microsystems gained Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 25 3/8 .
Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock after the computer maker posted strong
quarterly earnings.
Canada
Toronto prices rallied in late afternoon to close solidly higher in light
trading.
The TSE-300 composite index rose 25.81 points, or 0.6 per cent, to close at
4,339.07, its high for the day. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 442 to
305. Volume was 62.28m shares, down from yesterday's 69.59m and trading
value fell to CDollars 700.9m from CDollars 755.1m.
The market opened slightly higher, but quickly slipped into negative
territory before returning to neutral ground for most of the session.
However, strong gains were made in the final hour of trading, buoyed by
strength in Canadian bonds and the Canadian dollar.
Mexico
Equities nudged 0.57 per cent higher with the market caught in a see-saw
session between positive and negative factors that cancelled each other out.
The Mexican market's key IPC index closed up 12.81 points at 2,273.33.
Traders said bargain hunter buyers dragged the market upwards. But keeping a
lid on the session's overall movements were lingering political
uncertainties.

South African shares resumed their search for market moving factors as mixed
signals clouded direction in thin trade, according to dealers. Reuter
reports from Johannesburg.
Lack of real direction from world equities was depressing sentiment, which
was also under pressure from political fears in advance of the multi-racial
elections from April 26, they said.
The overall index finished nine points lower at 4,858, the gold index shed
five to 1,912 and the industrial index fell 17 to 5,617. Shares edged higher
in early trade as they reacted belatedly to recent gains on Wall Street and
a firmer London market.
Golds made early gains on the back of commercial rand weakness and ended
largely unchanged as bullion fell.
Anglos added 50 cents to R196.50, De Beers rose R1.25 to R102.75 and
Richemont collected 75 cents to R43.

FT  08 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses gain ground on
relative strength theory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff

<TEXT>
Arguments that bourses have a life independent of Wall Street grew in
strength yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
ZURICH was higher for the third straight day, as financials continued to
enjoy their new-found favour, and the SMI index added 30.7 to 2,860.9.
Mr Hans Kaufmann at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich, highlighted comments earlier
this week by Mr Markus Lusser, the Swiss National Bank president, that
long-term Swiss rates should go back down to January's 4 per cent levels,
and that the weak D-Mark, damaging to some Swiss exporters, was a temporary
phenomenon.
Mr Kaufmann added that, while foreign demand was still limited, he believed
that much of the recent switching of portfolios out of the Swiss market was
now complete and that overseas investors were coming to the conclusion that
the outlook was better than they had earlier thought.
Among the financials, UBS rose SFr43, or 3.6 per cent, to SFr1,238.
Winterthur finished SFr5 ahead at SFr705, after a high of SFr720, in
response to its forecast of significantly higher 1993 net profit.
Sulzer registered shares rose SFr45 or 4.4 per cent to SFr1,060 after
better-than-expected results. Swissair, omitting a dividend for 1993, was
marked SFr20 lower to SFr750.
Hero, whose results disappointed the market earlier in the week, fell SFr25
to SFr650 after a German importer withdrew baby food made by a Spanish
subsidiary.
MILAN's rally continued apace as foreign and domestic funds remained buyers,
and the Comit index rose 13.86, or 1.9 per cent, to a 45-month high of
746.38.
SG Warburg noted that, if margins were normalised, the market p/e ratio
would be only 10 times, and commented that the currency also looked
undervalued. It added that the bond market, by trading at almost 3 per cent
above Bund yields, was pricing in a lot of bad political news; that
irreversible reforms had taken place which meant that the 'bad old world'
would not return, whatever the political outcome; and that political worries
were almost always exaggerated.
Fiat rose L250 or 4.3 per cent to L6,037, on renewed rumours that it planned
asset sales, with Toro the favoured candidate. The insurance subsidiary rose
L1,116 or 3.4 per cent to L33,865.
Pirelli rose L77, or 2.7 per cent, to L2,939 amid hopes for a link with
Stet, which is to be privatised later in the year.
Benetton slid L440 to L27,916 on news it was calling an extraordinary
shareholders meeting to obtain approval to place 19m ordinary new shares on
foreign markets.
FRANKFURT broke through 2,200 on the Dax index, peaked at 2,218.17 in the
post-bourse and receded after Wall Street came in lower. The Ibis-indicated
ended at 2,204.46 after rising 10.21 to 2,201.41 on the session, and
turnover rose from DM9.1bn to DM10.3bn.
Allianz, the insurer, extended its relative recovery with a rise of DM38 to
DM2,703. Carmakers were subdued after Daimler's dividend cut and rights
issue news, which left the shares down DM4 to DM868.50 on the session, and
receding later to DM862.
Retailers saw cartel office permission for a Kaufhof/Horten merger, and the
shares rose DM9 to DM239 and DM10 to DM510 respectively - in defiance of the
old adage that, in a takeover bid, only one set of shareholders can win.
PARIS saw the CAC 40 index at a session high of 2,146, before slipping
during the afternoon to close off 8.65 at 2,119.57.
There was news of two further rights issues, one from Cerus, the holding
company, which came during trading and the other from Cap Gemini Sogeti, the
computer services group, after the close.
Cerus, the holding company, fell FFr7.80 to FFr129.00 on a FFr858m rights
issue at FFr100 a share to cut its debt, estimated at FFr852m at the end of
1993. Cap Gemini, up FFr6.20 at FFr196.20, said after hours that it planned
to raise FFr424m through a rights issue at FFr140 a share.
Credit Foncier de France, the banking group, climbed FFr37 to FFr1,211 after
a better than expected 25 per cent increase in 1993 net profit. On the
downside, CarnaudMetalbox lost FFr8.80 to FFr180.50 with its 1993 profits 14
per cent lower.
Oil stocks remained buoyant, Elf Aquitaine gaining another FFr3.10 to
FFr397.50 and Total FFr6.00 to FFr322.50.
MADRID lost early gains after New York opened, and the general index closed
just 0.35 higher at 322.51 in turnover of Pta30bn. Subjects of recent, and
not-so-recent equity placings were active. FCC, the construction stock,
threatened its 1994 low with a fall of Pta200 to Pta15,320 and Acerinox, the
metals company, registered a new high of Pta13,980, up Pta630 on a large buy
order, and on positive forecasts for the company.
AMSTERDAM showed little enthusiasm, with the AEX index closing the session
up just 0.18 at 412.99.
Among the actives Grolsch, the brewer, picked up Fl 1.50 to Fl 51.00 in
spite of firmly denying takeover rumours.
ATHENS fell 1.1 per cent on government plans for a 15 per cent tax on
dividends from mutual and investment funds, the general index closing 11.24
lower at 989.53.

Share prices moved within a narrow range on small-lot arbitrage trading
before closing higher on late foreign buying, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index rose 194.24, or 1 per cent, to 19,890.98, having
fluctuated between 19,587.72 and 19,946.09. In the afternoon, buying by
overseas investors of basic material stocks such as textiles and chemicals
issues lifted the index. Arbitrage buying ahead of Friday's options
settlement also supported shares.
Traders said individual investors dabbled in small-capital stocks on the
second section and over-the-counter market. The second section rose 9.74 to
2,244.99 on heavy volume of 20m shares, while the OTC market gained 9.15 to
1,828.86.
Volume was 260m shares against 340m. The Topix index of all first section
stocks rose 12.78 to 1,613.19 while the Nikkei 300 gained 2.55 to 295.54.
Gainers led losers by 664 to 356, with 153 issues remaining unchanged. In
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.32 to 1,318.58.
Textile shares were higher on active buying by foreign investors. Toray
Industries rose Y5 to Y700 and Mitsubishi Rayon gained Y20 to Y394.
Mitsui Matsushima, a coal distributor, rose Y25 to Y670 on short term buying
by individuals and brokers. Sumitomo Coal Mining, the day's most active
issue, rose Y81 to Y984.
Hopes of a recovery in consumer confidence supported some retailers. Daimar
gained Y59 to Y879 and Mitsukoshi rose Y17 to Y1,010.
Motor manufacturers were also firmer on signs of a rebound in US car sales.
Toyota Motor rose Y10 to Y2,000 and Honda Motor advanced Y30 to Y1,690.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone initially declined on continued profit-taking
but closed unchanged at Y900,000 on later support.
Fuji Photo Film fell Y40 to Y2,090 on selling by overseas investors. The
company is expected to face increasing competition from private label photo
film companies which are controlled by retailers.
Secom, the security systems maker lost Y280 to Y6,620 on rumours that its
water purifiers were contaminated.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 12.71 to 21,976.50 in volume of 13.9m shares.
Textile stocks, regarded as lagging the index, gained ground, with Daiwabo
up Y17 to Y370.
Roundup
The region saw mixed trading.
HONG KONG reversed early losses to finish higher, supported by a late round
of bargain hunting, although turnover was light with many investors
unwilling to commit fresh funds.
The Hang Seng index closed 51.61 higher at 9,285.92, having been 52 points
lower at midsession. Turnover was a scant HKDollars 2.9bn compared with
Dollars 4.75bn on Wednesday.
The late bargain-hunting centred on blue chip property and banking shares.
Henderson Land rose HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 43.50, Cheung Kong added 50
cents to HKDollars 40.25 and SHK Properties ended 50 cents higher at
HKDollars 54. Hang Seng Bank gained HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 51.50. while
parent HSBC Holdings edged up 50 cents to HKDollars 89.
KUALA LUMPUR shares were broadly lower in thin trading although gains by
Tenaga Nasional and Telekom Malaysia, pushed the composite index 1.67 higher
to 966.18.
Tenaga firmed 50 cents to MDollars 14.40 while Telekom rose 20 cents to
MDollars 18.60. Together, they represent almost 40 per cent of the index.
SEOUL ended flat as late profit-taking wiped out early gains but volume
improved slightly. The composite index rose 0.32 to 863.36.
Construction companies, which rose in the morning shortly after the
government's announcement that it would increase the limit on support loans
extended to domestic contractors working on overseas construction projects,
succumbed to subsequent profit taking.
SINGAPORE closed lower after Wall Street's weak overnight gain failed to
spur local buying. The Straits Times Industrials index closed 9.04 lower at
2,106.53.
AUSTRALIA edged higher during the afternoon to close firmer in a day of
consolidation. The All Ordinaries index slipped to 2077.8 in the morning
before working its way up to 2087.4, a rise of 3.3 points.
Woodside Petroleum continued to be firm, having added 15 cents on Wednesday
the shares gained a further 12 cents to ADollars 4.31.
Elsewhere, Brambles Industries added 32 cents to ADollars 13.82.
BANGKOK saw a technical rebound which took the SET index up 22.79 or 1.9 per
cent to 1,224.74 in increased turnover of Bt4.2bn. Finance and banking
sectors led the market higher with the only the food sector losing ground.
First Asia Securities topped the active list, shedding Bt12 to Bt196 after
40m newly-issued shares were listed. New listing Nithipat gained Bt7 to
Bt137 and Bangkok Bank was up Bt4 at Bt159.
MANILA lost ground following a 3 per cent slide in the shares of heavily
weighted Philippine Long Distance Telephone which closed at 1,655 pesos.
The composite index shed 48.63 to 2,680.34 in turnover of 504.32m pesos.
KARACHI moved sharply higher on heavy buying by local investors in the
energy, synthetics and textile sectors.
The KSE 100-share index gained 38.12 or 1.6 per cent to 2,471.02.

FT  08 APR 94 / Markets Report: Talks push lira higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian lira rose sharply yesterday in response to increasing evidence
of co-operation between the partners of the Freedom Alliance, victorious in
last week's election, writes Philip Gawith.
The Italian currency was bolstered by the meeting of Mr Umberto Bossi, head
of the Northern League, and Mr Gianfranco Fini, the third main partner in
the alliance.
Contact was also re-established between the league and Mr Silvio Berlusconi,
leader of the alliance. Earlier this week markets had been unsettled by
comments from Mr Bossi saying that Mr Berlusconi was unfit to head the next
government. This led to a break-off in talks between the two parties.
Helped by the improved political sentiment, the lira broke through L960
against the D-Mark. Traders said the breach of this important technical
level triggered covering of short lira positions. This accelerated the
lira's advance with the currency finishing in London nearly 11 lira firmer
at L954 from L965 at Wednesday's close.
Elsewhere the dollar ended the day strongly, driven up by rumours of a
possible tightening of monetary policy, and technically-driven buying.
After slipping during the morning to a low of DM1.7085 against the D-Mark,
the US currency rallied in the afternoon to finish in London at DM1.7181
from DM1.7151 on Thursday.
Sterling, meanwhile, showed little response to encouraging output data
showing industrial production rose by 0.8 per cent in February. The pound
finished in London at DM2.5204 from DM2.5173. It was virtually unchanged
against the dollar, at Dollars 1.467 from Dollars 1.4678 on Wednesday.
The gyrations of the lira were the focus of attention with traders
describing it as a 'wild day'. The D-Mark started the day a bit firmer,
helped by reports of a smaller than anticipated rise in unemployment in
March - 20,000 compared to a 25,000 forecast - and French industrial
production falling by 0.2 per cent in January, against expectations of a 0.2
per cent increase.
When reports of the Bossi/Fini meeting emerged, however, the lira started to
climb, putting pressure on the D-Mark.
Elsewhere in Europe, the D-Mark's performance was mixed. Against the French
franc it was stronger, closing at FFr3.426 from FFr3.420. The peseta,
however, continued its recent rebound to close at Pta80.75 against the
D-Mark from Pta80.89.
The Portuguese escudo finished slightly weaker at Es101.5 from Es101.3.
Earlier it had risen to a seven-week high at Es100.95 per D-Mark.
The Bank of Portugal maintained its recent policy of high short-term rates,
injecting one-day funds at 14 per cent, keeping the emergency overnight
lending rate at 13 per cent, and also providing five-day funds at 13 per
cent.
Overnight rates jumped up to 80 per cent from a close of 30-40 per cent on
Thursday. Dealers said investors were buying overnight funds to take
speculative positions against the escudo.
German call money rates eased below 6 per cent after the Bundesbank
allocated DM7bn of securities repurchase funds in a seven-day tender set at
5.73 per cent, the prevailing repo rate. The added liquidity helped call
money fall to 5.75/5.90 per cent from 5.85/6.05 per cent on Wednesday.
Since January, the Bundesbank has had only limited options for adding extra
liquidity to the market due to the effective abolition of section 17 funds.
Previously, public authority funds held at the Bundesbank under section 17
of the Bundesbank Act had been transfered to the money market to relieve
short-term liquidity shortages. It was the first time since these changes
that the Bundesbank had set a short-term tender.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said the repo was a
'money market management operation, rather than any important policy
signal.' He said a lowering of the discount rate this month was unlikely
given the trade-weighted weakness of the D-Mark following the recent upsurge
in the dollar.
There was little activity in the futures market with the June three month
euromark contract finishing one basis point weaker at 94.53.
In France, meanwhile, the central bank left its intervention rate unchanged
at 5.90 per cent at a securities repurchase tender held to inject funds into
the money market today.
In the UK discount market the Bank of England provided late assistance of
Pounds 45m after earlier putting Pounds 623m liquidity into the market. The
shortage was forecast at Pounds 850m.
The recent rally in interest rate futures petered out with the June short
sterling contract finishing the day unchanged at 94.50.
The rally in the dollar ahead of the speech by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman
of the Fed, proved misplaced when he confined his comments to consumer
confidence.
The June eurodollar contract was unchanged yesterday at 95.54, implying
short term interest rates of 4.46 per cent in June compared to 3.87 per cent
 -4 per cent now.

<TEXT>
The Maple Resources Corporation of Texas has signed a contract with
PeruPetro, the Peruvian state oil company, to develop the Aguaytia natural
gas field in the eastern jungle. It is the first operations contract signed
under Peru's new hydrocarbon law, passed last August, and will involve Maple
in an estimated investment of between USDollars 120m and USDollars 150m.
In the first phase, Maple Resources will develop two nearby oil fields that
now produce about 800 barrels of crude a day.
Maple is also expected to take over running the Pucallpa refinery.
Development of the gas fields will follow. Aguaytia has an estimated
300,000m cubic feet of recoverable gas. Construction of a processing plant,
gas pipelines and local storage facilities for liquefied petroleum gas will
be required.
In a third stage, Aguaytia's gas will be used to generate electrical energy
for the Pucallpa region from a 140MW plant.

FT  08 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: China aims to revive gold
mining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Beijing Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China plans to spend Yn1.66bn (USDollars 190m) this year in an effort to
revive its struggling gold mines, which have been starved of new investment
because of the low state purchase price.
'The money will help improve working conditions of the gold mines and
upgrade technology,' said Mr Jiao Zhi, head of China's Gold Bureau.
He was speaking after a national gold conference in Beijing, at which
broadening reforms of the gold-mining sector, including providing new
regulations to attract foreign investment, were discussed.
China's Gold Bureau, under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industries, has
presented a draft law to State Council, China's cabinet, aimed at
facilitating foreign involvement.
The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, which has a monopoly
of gold purchasing saw a 32 per cent decline in its gold acquisitions last
year in spite of a 7.5 per cent increase in production nationally.
A low official purchase price drove many hard-pressed mine managers who
faced the prospect of being unable to pay workers and sustain production to
sell on the black market.
State purchases of gold rose in latter part of 1993 following an increase in
the official purchase price to a figure that represented a discount of about
10 per cent to the international price.
Venezuela has between Dollars 100bn and Dollars 140bn worth of gold reserves
in the southern state of Guyana, according to Mr Francisco Layrisse, a
cabinet minister and president of the state-owned Corporacion Venezolano de
Guayana.
'We have regions where we have 16 ounces per tonne, while South Africa is
today extracting between two and three ounces,' he told the daily Economia
Hoy.

FT  08 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU banana deal rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Six Latin American banana exporting countries have rejected a recent deal
between four other producers and the European Union, which ended a
long-running dispute over access to the European market.
At a meeting in Ecuador, commerce and foreign ministers of Ecuador,
Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Mexico and the Dominican Republic rejected last
week's agreement with the European Commission to increase the Latin American
quota to 2.1m tonnes this year from 2m tonnes.
The commission had agreed with Costa Rica, Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela
to increase access after they made a complaint to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. Guatemala was also a signatory to the complaint, which
was upheld by a Gatt panel. But it accounts for only 1.5 per cent of EU
imports and the Commission decided to proceed in spite of its opposition.

FT  08 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: London coffee futures surge to
fresh highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee prices reached a new high point yesterday as July futures on the
London Commodity Exchange soared Dollars 33 a tonne to close at Dollars
1,440 a tonne. Even some London traders were surprised at the strength of
the market, which has seen prices rise by nearly Dollars 100 a tonne in the
past week.
Fund buying continued to push up the price yesterday, but trade and roaster
buyers were also active in the market. Rumours that the Ivory Coast was
about to halt coffee and cocoa exports unless shippers paid a back-dated
export tax also helped to fuel the market.
A report on levels of coffee stocks by ED &amp; F. Man, the London trading
house, helped to underpin prices. The report concluded that stocks of
robusta coffee held by consumers had dropped to uncomfortably low levels.
The broker estimated that stocks of green coffee in consumers' hands had
fallen to 16.9m bags at the end of February, 3.3m bags below from the level
a year earlier.
The fall in stocks underlines the success of the producers' retention scheme
whereby exporters withhold up to 20 per cent of supplies from the export
market. This was set up in October last year with the aim of eroding the
consumer stocks that were hanging over the market.
But crop problems in producing countries have probably done more to fuel
fears of coffee shortages. In Indonesia heavy rains have delayed shipments
and boosted prices, but the overall size of the crop is not expected to be
affected and production is forecast to be up slightly on last year at 7m
bags.
However, the Ivory Coast crop is believed to be much lower than last year at
between 2m and 2.5m bags, compared with 3m bags.
Soaring prices in the coffee market have attracted speculative interest,
which traders believe could switch quickly to another market once prices
begin to fall, exacerbating any downturn. 'At some point the bubble will
burst and it could become quite ugly,' one trader commented.

FT  08 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cuba plans sales to China as
harvest hopes fade

Cuba is to sell an unspecified quantity of sugar to China this year, amid
indications that the yield from the shortened 1994 harvest will be less than
the government had previously expected.
The sale is part of a wider trade agreement between the two countries, under
which Cuba will purchase Chinese food and medicine, according to Prensa
Latina, the official Cuban news agency.
Diplomats in Havana, the island's capital, said this week that the Cuban
government was now estimating sugar production this year at 'no more than 5m
tonnes', following last year's 4.2m tonnes.
They said government officials had spoken at the start of the harvest of a
likely yield of 1m tonnes more than last year.
The current harvest has been shortened by the government, which wants it
concluded at the end of April to allow more time for planting additional
acreage for future harvests, as part of efforts to rehabilitate the
industry.
Zambia's industry is to receive technical and industrial assistance from
Cuba, under an agreement in principle between both countries. Cuba will help
Zambia with sugar production and the development of a range of bi-products,
according to Zambia's foreign minister who visited Cuba last week.

Market Report

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM prices rose to session highs in after hours 'kerb' trading at the
London Metal Exchange, erasing earlier losses and positioning themselves for
a further rally, dealers said.
Overnight investment fund selling left the market looking vulnerable at
Dollars 1,290 a tonne for three months delivery. But 'there was good support
at the lows,' said one trader, 'and this close (Dollars 1,300.50 a tonne,
down Dollars 11.25) takes us back into the Dollars 1,300-Dollars 1,320 band
again, with a good chance of taking out those highs.'
COPPER also recovered from its morning lows, but the three months price
still closed Dollars 17 down at Dollars 1,876 a tonne, the lowest for five
weeks.
LEAD prices rallied smartly from four-month lows, with the market's
fundamentals not really justifying sharp declines, while selling below
Dollars 450 lacked follow-through.

FT  08 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar-beet to displace grain in
Portugal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal is to make an important shift away from cereals to beet sugar
cultivation following government approval for an Es15bn (Dollars 87.7m)
Italian-managed beet sugar refinery that will supply more than 20 per cent
of the country's sugar consumption.
The project involves replacing wheat and maize cultivation in central and
southern Portugal with 10,000 hectares of sugar-beet to supply the refinery
with 600,000 tonnes a year, enough to produce about 60,000 tonnes of sugar.
Portugal at present has only 500ha of experimental beet sugar crops.
'Beet sugar has already proved more profitable than cereals for Portugal and
the difference will be even greater when our European Union subsidiaries for
cereals are withdrawn in 2001,' said Mr Diamantino Diogo, director of
Fenacam, an investor in the refinery.
Portugal consumes 310,000 tonnes of sugar a year, produced by two refineries
from imported sugar-cane. The country will now fulfil a 60,000-tonne beet
sugar production quota awarded when it joined the EU in 1986. Talks are
under way in Brussels on whether this beet sugar quota will be added to or
subtracted from Portugal's cane sugar production quota.
Societa Fondiaria Industriale Romagnola (SFIR), an Italian sugar company,
owns 60 per cent of Dai-Sociedade de Investimento Agro-Industrial, the
company investing in the new refinery. RAR of Portugal and Tate and Lyle of
the UK, the two existing refinery companies in Portugal, each owns 5 per
cent. Fenacam and the Portuguese state holding company IPE own 15 per cent
each.
The EU and the Portuguese government will together provide Es9.8bn in grants
for the project in Coruche, central Portugal. SFIR will invest Es3.6bn and
manage the plant. The refinery, due to begin production in June, 1995, will
employ 224 people directly and create another 1,500 jobs for farm workers
and truck drivers.

FT  08 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia seen pricing itself out
of western aluminium market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminium production costs in the Commonwealth of Independent States moved
above those in the western world last month, according to the Anthony Bird
Associates consultancy organisation.
It predicts: 'In time, the Russians will price themselves out of western
markets as a result of this cost explosion'.
CIS costs reached just over 50 cents a pound in March compared with an
average in the west of 49.7 cents a pound, Bird estimates in its latest
annual review of the aluminium industry.
In 1990 CIS costs were only 3 per cent of the western world average, by
mid-1993 were still only 60 per cent of the levels ruling in the west, 'but
hyperinflation in the CIS has proceeded at a faster rate than the rouble has
been falling,' says Bird.
It suggests that, ironically, short-term pressure on the Russian producers
has been reduced by the agreement recently reached by some of the major
aluminium-producing countries to cut production. This has pushed up prices
just in time to help the Russian industry.
Nevertheless, Bird says that by 1995 the cost problem will be starting to
restrain CIS supply to a greater extent than is foreseen in the
international agreement - under the terms of which the Russians have
undertaken to reduce output by an annual 500,000 tonnes. 'We expect further
falls in net exports from the former socialist countries in 1996 and 1997.'
Bird forecasts that, assuming exchange rates remain stable, the London Metal
Exchange three-month price for aluminium will average 57.5 cents a pound
this year and rise steadily to an average of 96.5 cents (in March, 1994,
money) in the year 2004. This is because it predicts shortages of smelting
capacity but says producers will want to see long-term prices well above 70
cents a pound before they will be willing to invest.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of East Kent (6): Crouching on the starting blocks -
David Lawson examines the potential for the region's business parks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Satellite pictures of south-east England reveal a strange phenomenon. Two
tendrils snake out of the pulsating blob of metropolitan London like some
amoeba stretching to link with another life-form. A few years ago, nodules
sprouted along these glinting lines but appear to have stopped growing
recently.
The analogy is not far from reality. As Britain moved towards economic unity
with the rest of Europe over the last decade, the M2 and M20 motorways
ploughed physical connections east and south through a region traditionally
left to farmers.
Developers were not far behind the earth movers, darting left and right to
stake out huge claims. In an area short on large towns, business parks were
considered the only outlet for future growth.
More than half a dozen now cluster around the southern strip from Ashford to
Dover, and another handful cling to the northern fringes of east Kent. But
the future has taken longer to arrive than anyone guessed. Impressive
gateways often lead off new access roads on to cleared fields; new
buildings, however, are few and far between.
Two schools of thought try to explain why these giants lie sleeping. One
inevitably involves the tunnel - 'we are all crouched on the starting blocks
waiting for it to happen,' says Steven Harris of agents Conrad Ritblat, who
is overseeing the 100-acre Orbital Park, one of five big schemes clustered
around Ashford.
'I have inquiries for more than 1m sq ft of space and expect to get half of
this scheme away as soon as they see trains going through.'
Not everyone has held back. BP Travel took five acres as a national
distribution centre for brochures imported from the Continent. Similar
regional break-bulk organisations are expected to pay around Pounds 300,000
an acre or 6.50 a sq ft for buildings in future.
'Around 30 per cent of all goods coming through the tunnel will end up in
the south-east,' he says. And if they fill this site, Eurotunnel
Developments also has the 200-acre Waterbrook Park across the road.
Others emphasise more wide-ranging reasons for the surge - and subsequent
slowdown, in building - 'we have suffered the same way as every other region
from the recession,' says Charles Stevens of Cluttons, which revealed the
weakness of tenant demand in recent property market study - 'delays to the
tunnel opening are merely a coincidence.'
That strikes a chord with David Easson, who is in a unique position to
assess the region. He helped build Stockley Park, the first and most famous
UK development of this kind, in the economic cauldron west of London. He now
sits just outside east Kent, running the 650-acre King's Hill development
for Rouse Kent near Maidstone.
'Kent suffered from poor roads and a general feeling among companies and
councils that the Garden of Kent should be left unploughed,' he says. Now it
is benefiting from easier access.
That is why Rouse wants to create almost 3m sq ft of business and leisure
space, plus up to 1,500 homes on the former airfield at West Malling. But it
is geared very much to taking London's office overflow paying up to 15 as ft
or 350,000 an acre. Most of East Kent's parks will be distribution centres,
which would probably have sprung up even without the tunnel, spawned by fast
roads and closer European ties.
The effects of recession show up more clearly along the northern coast. Mark
Cunningham of Cormorant, for instance, admits he would never have expected
things to take as long developing the potential 1m sq ft at Abbey Farm
Business Park, near Faversham, when it was planned during the boom - despite
the attractive location off the M2. But he has been handed a crucial
advantage through the new assisted area status, which should provide grants
for an access bridge as well as incentives for tenants.
The Wiggins Group has even more reason to celebrate, as its Kent
International park near Ramsgate is getting an extra benefit from Objective
Two status granted by the European Union - 'that will provide money to link
the site to the fast Thanet Way, giving dual-carriage or motorway links
right through to the M25,' says Geoff Lansbury, the managing director.
With labour costs 10 per cent lower than south Kent and land prices around
Pounds 100,000 an acre, he expects to grow faster than some of the newer
parks.
As they look to the tunnel, so he is concentrating on the neighbouring
airport and the build-up of an air-freight distribution centre.
So the tunnel is not the sole factor driving this region. It already has a
pedigree, growing faster than the rest of the UK in the 1980s, and is
expected to bounce back even higher as the economy recovers, because it now
has better infrastructure and the Single European Market in its favour. It
actually starts from a better base than areas more popular with developers
during the boom because there is no massive overhang of empty space,
according to a study by Nicola Morrison, Russell Chaplin and Jon Potter at
the Cambridge University Department of Land Economy.
This points out that East Kent - particularly Ashford and Folkestone - could
benefit from planning restrictions and lack of town-centre office sites
elsewhere in the county. And parking requirement seem likely to push that
activity onto the parks.
Overall demand will be far below that in the 1980s, however, whereas the
need for factories will be much higher right through the decade, says the
study.
Manufacturing premises (between 10,000 and 15,000 sq ft) are already in
short supply, particularly in Tunbridge Wells and Ashford.
Distribution seems set to hold the centre stage, however, and despite
hundreds of acres set aside for development, only a year's supply of
warehousing is immediately available.
'The potential for development is considerable, particularly once the
Channel Tunnel is integrated into the infrastructure,' says the study.
Ashford emerges once more as an important node because of its strategic
position. It is showing shortages of premises over 25,000 sq ft, even though
the region's total supply exceeds demand.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of East Kent (8): Stimulus for development - Channel
Tunnel's impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clustered around Ashford - long picked out as one of the chief growth
centres in the UK - are vast sites near the M20 motorway waiting for a tidal
wave of new buildings. And waiting, and waiting . . .
'Businesses in this country have a habit of refusing to act until major
infrastructure projects are finished,' says Jon Barrett, Kent County Council
director of inward investment.
'We saw that with the Dartford Bridge, which did not attract jobs until it
was opened. And that was an obvious project compared with the Channel
Tunnel, which is just a hole in the ground.'
In other words, the impact of the largest private sector infrastructure
project ever attempted in the UK will not be seen until it opens. But plenty
of informed guesswork has happened during seven years of gestation and
construction, writes David Lawson.
Forecasts suggested that employment from construction work on the tunnel
would have little lasting impact on the local economy, and any employment
generated would be dwarfed by other structural decline, producing a net loss
of 10,000 jobs. This hard news gave impetus to setting up the East Kent
Initiative and led to the successful campaign for assisted area status.
Jon Barrett might be expected to wilt under the weight of gloom, but two
factors keep him remarkably sanguine. The first is not the tunnel itself but
the terminal due to open at Ashford in 1996. The rail link - already put
back by more than a decade - could so easily have slipped through the region
with hardly a trace left around the edges - 'but the station means trains
will stop here on the way to and from Brussels and Paris,' he says. 'That
will stimulate surrounding development.'
Secondly, he cites new companies already moving into the area - 'mainly
small businesses wanting to take advantage of the European connection,' he
says. 'They will grow much faster than indigenous industry. 'Across the
county as a whole, 250 jobs were created by new businesses in the year to
last March. Those same companies now employ 320 people.'
The danger, however, is that this growth will draw investment away from East
Kent, already facing a shortfall of 40,000 jobs because of structural
decline of industries like mining, fishing and now the ferries. But the six
district councils have combined to fight back through the East Kent
Initiative.
A regional boost comes from qualification for the European InterReg
programme, which will give East Kent yet more access to grants for joint
promotion with the Nord-Pas de Calais. This has already led to inquiries for
space, so East Kent should get more of these fast-growing companies, helping
build further momentum - 'it shows the success of local authorities working
together for a common aim - even when some are in a different country,' says
Mr Barrett.
The obvious hope is that some of those concerns will come from overseas  -
'one factor rarely mentioned about the tunnel is the psychological fact that
it ties us physically to mainland Europe,' he says.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of East Kent (9): Foundation for confidence -
Improved road/rail links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Transport improvements are the single most important reason why investors
have taken a new interest in Kent, according to a poll by the property
consultants, Cluttons. That fact might appear self-evident when so much
money has gone into creation of the Channel Tunnel, yet it is not this
massive development which has raised the area's reputation. New roads are
the foundation on which business confidence is being built, writes David
Lawson.
While new roads are unlikely to make companies suddenly decide to move into
regions like east Kent, better access is undoubtedly welcome.
In some eyes, it could not have been much worse.
Much has changed in the last few years - but much had to change, according
to the 1991 review by PA Cambridge Economic Consultants. The tunnel is
expected to increase traffic loads for several reasons. Firstly, the fast
rail link will not be built until the next century, so waggons will continue
to thunder through the region. In fact the tunnel will increase this load as
hauliers switch from other channel ports to both Dover and the tunnel as
fare cuts increase their competitiveness.
Money for roads has poured into the region since the tunnel was announced -
Kent has topped the national spending list for three years in a row. Much
has been reserved for areas outside east Kent, such as the Pounds 160m
Medway towns relief road. But resources are also going towards the important
Thanet Way, which will carry the advantages of the M2 eastwards to Ramsgate.
Not quite a motorway, but Pounds 140m on a continuous dual carriageway comes
close.
Further improvements are in the pipeline for a bypass on the A28 at Sturry
and upgrading of the A2. European Union grants will also go into new roads
in Thanet.
None of this implies special treatment, according to the Department of
Transport, which insisted to PA Cambridge Economic Consultants that east
Kent had to stand in the same queue as all 108 local authorities in England.
The tide of money flowing in this direction appears to tell a different
story, however.
Jon Barrett, Kent's director of inward investment, must feel hopeful that
such largesse will extend to further bottlenecks. He picks out remaining
problems with north-south access along the A28. Local links off main routes
also need strengthening if smaller towns are to benefit rather than see
waggons - and eventually trains - racing through from London to the tunnel,
leaving nothing but cracked ceilings and a dose of pollution.
A stop rather than an faster route could have the biggest local impact,
however. The Ashford International Terminal is likely to be the biggest
single factor in transforming the area apart from the tunnel, although the
network of access roads to the undersea link will be a useful bonus for
Folkestone and Dover.
The very success of the region will also bring new problems. Canterbury is
already working out an intensive traffic management scheme to ease
congestion. Towns like Ashford will face the same problem as economic
development blossoms.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of East Kent (7): Pain amid the gain - The ferries
fight back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sightseers used to swarm out on sunny summer weekends to see giant
mechanical diggers start hacking a giant hole into the chalk Downs behind
Folkestone. For some, however, it was a view into another kind of pit,
writes David Lawson.
Ferry traffic dominated the small port's economy, and what future was there
if passengers disappeared into a hole in the ground before they even reached
the coast?
'There was a general air of gloom in 1986 when the tunnel got the go-ahead,'
admits Ian Todd, information director for P&amp;O European Ferries. 'We knew
that in theory it could take all our custom.'
The choice was simple: sit back and hope the project would fizzle into
bankruptcy, or fight to keep a large chunk of the market.
Attack was chosen as the best form of defence. A quick, hard strike through
price cuts could cripple Eurotunnel in the early years when it was
constrained by heavy debts. But this could not be guaranteed - and carried
hidden dangers. The tunnel would be an even more formidable competitor once
relieved of its debts by bankruptcy, according to Roger Vickerman, professor
of regional and transport economics at the University of Kent.
So the industry opted for a campaign of cost-cutting and investment. It also
brought in a new ally when Sealink, the other big operator, was taken over
by Stenna of Sweden in 1991. Folkestone was an early casualty in the
crossfire. Just as the tunnel terminal emerged on the edge of the town, most
of the ferries deserted - 'it was just too small for the new generation of
super-ferries,' says Brian Rees of Stenna. Around 700 jobs and the spin-off
from more than 1m passengers a year, disappeared. But Dover, which had
seethed over the prospect of losing pre-eminence to its smaller neighbour
because of the tunnel terminal, won a large consolation prize. P&amp;O has
invested more than Pounds 400m in new ships and training while Stenna
Sealink spent Pounds 250m on four new ferries into the port.
Despite 200 redundancies, P&amp;O still employs around 1,000 people there and
another 3,000 on the ferries - 'last year we carried 8m passengers and more
than 250,000 lorries on the Calais route,' says Mr Todd. 'This was our
fourth consecutive record year.'
Stenna Sealink carried 6m passengers, a 10 per cent rise on 1992, and
312,000 lorries (6 per cent up) and plans 25 sailings a day in 1994 compared
with 20 last year. Both carriers also run freight-only services - P&amp;O to
Zeebrugge and Stenna to Dunkerque.
There has been some pain. P&amp;O closed its Boulogne service while a
partnership with Ostend Lines ended last year. But Dover's loss was
Ramsgate's gain as Sally, the third largest ferry operator, picked up this
loose end. It should double the 2m passengers carried from Ramsgate to
Dunkerque and Ostend in 1993. P&amp;O may also bring further relief to the area
by picking up the Olau service from Sheerness to Vissingen, under threat
because of a labour dispute.
But these outlets from north Kent are not involved in the same battle for
cross-channel transport. Ramsgate is a leisurely four hours from the
Continent rather than the tunnel's sprint. Dover, however, falls between
these extremes, with a 75-minute trip. The ferry operators have tried to
nibble away at the time difference - 'we can now offer a 20-minute check-in,
with cars having to stop only once to get the ticket,' says Mr Todd. After
that, computers read windscreen stickers automatically.
Price levels have also been simplified. Stenna Sealink substituted a single
fare for the confusing variety of rates set according to time of day. Mr
Rees adds that prices are between 60 and 90 less than the proposed tunnel
charges. But this is not a big battle zone. The two companies are
concentrating more on quality than bargain rates to defend their hold on the
market - the main reason for buying super-ferries. 'All our ships now have
silver-service restaurants, video lounges and baby rooms,' says Mr Todd.
Ferries made the first retaliation, timing improvements to begin last
summer, when the tunnel was scheduled to open. That has introduced
passengers to services they cannot get while speeding underground. While
day-trippers may opt for a shorter journey, others will prefer a comfortable
break.
Analysts accept that this distinction will help the ferries survive, even
with a fully-functioning tunnel. Cross-channel traffic is forecast to soar
from almost 65m passengers in 1990 to 113m in the next decade and 150m by
the year 2003. Freight traffic is growing even faster. The one question is
whether there is room for two operators. A merger seems possible, which
means some further pain amid the gain that east Kent will see from the
tunnel.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of East Kent (5): Progress is being made - Thanet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bright new signs at the London end of the M2 and M20 motorways into Kent
signal the way to Ramsgate. It is a small indication, but an important one,
of the determination of Thanet to put itself much more prominently on the
map. It has certainly needed to, for Thanet is among the most run-down parts
of the south-east and is in desperate need of funds to improve its
infrastructure in order to attract more inward investment, writes Richard
Evans.
'The problem is that too many people don't know where Thanet is. We have had
to set about putting that right,' says a local authority official. The
increased prominence being given to Ramsgate is one success achieved.
Previously, Dover was by far the most prominently advertised channel
destination on the routes out of London, followed by Folkestone, and with
Ramsgate scarcely getting a look in, despite its flourishing cross-channel
ferry and jetfoil services.
It was all part of a pattern, with the Isle of Thanet as it is officially
known, separated from the rest of Kent by the river Stour. The divide is now
more psychological than physical but the area, which includes the resorts of
Margate, Broadstairs and Birchington as well as the port of Ramsgate, is
still seen as somewhat isolated and peripheral.
All this could be about to change with the successful application by Thanet
for development funds, both UK and European Union sourced. Thanet is now the
only assisted area with full development area status in the south-east, an
indication both of the effective battle fought on its behalf and of the
severity of the economic problems it faces.
The area has suffered steady economic decline over the last two decades and
has a unemployment rate of 16.8 per cent, the sixth highest in the UK and
comparable with the worst blackspots in the industrial north. The weak
economy is due to the decline in tourism and manufacturing, poor
communications and its remoteness from the rest of the country. There is
therefore an urgent need to diversify and enhance Thanet's economy on a
broad front. The problems remain substantial but progress is being made and
the potential is there.
Mr Ian Gill, former chief executive of Thanet district council and recently
appointed chief executive of the East Kent Initiative, says: 'The big
achievement has been to gain recognition for the problems of Thanet. We must
now build on this success by helping existing businesses and by unlocking
funds to create the right basis for inward investment.'
Development area status means that Thanet will have access not only to
substantial UK government funds but also to European regional development
funds available for both infrastructure and training projects.
Infrastructure projects are already under way or programmed in order to end
the area's relative isolation. These include upgrading to dual carriageway
for its entire length the Thanet Way, the tortuous link with the M2,
improving access to Ramsgate port, and improving the road from Thanet to
Ashford with its projected channel rail link passenger station.
Great importance is placed on developing the Kent International Business
Park adjacent to the joint civil and military airport at Manston in the
centre of Thanet.
Thanet's biggest difficulty has been that even if inward investors show
interest, there are too few sites available for immediate occupancy. But the
potential at Manston is considerable, and top priority is being given to
improving the infrastructure with UK and EU funds so that more businesses
can be attracted.
Thanet hopes to get Pounds 12m in European regional funds for the site and
Pounds 20m from other sources so that work can be completed quickly. The
Manston site would then provide low cost development land, immediate access
to the airport with its long runway and new Pounds 2m terminal building, and
easy access to the port of Ramsgate three miles away.
Mr David Ralls, ex-Army officer and helicopter pilot and Thanet's new chief
executive, is optimistic - 'Manston's location so close to Europe and the
easy availability of air and sea transport should make it an unbeatable
combination.'

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of East Kent (4): Poised for take-off - Ashford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Civic leaders and the business community of Ashford have faced decades of
frustration. The town, well-placed in the centre of East Kent to take full
advantage of improved communications and the opening of the Channel tunnel,
has been earmarked as a growth centre for years, but take-off has been
disappointingly slow, writes Richard Evans.
The vision is there and much of the infrastructure has been put in place,
but fresh difficulties keep on emerging to delay the full realisation of the
ambitious plans.
Ashford, an historic market town, began to diversify in the 1950s when it
agreed to take some of London's overspill population, and growth was steady
if unspectacular.
It was earmarked more specifically as a growth centre in Kent County
Council's structure plan, being ideally situated to take advantage of
growing trade links with Europe. The intention was that it should become a
focus for inward investment that would benefit the whole of East Kent. The
town's potential as a centre for strong economic growth was further boosted
by the channel tunnel project and the decision to build an international
passenger station in the town as part of the fast rail link from the tunnel
at Folkeston to London. It is here that problems continue to dog development
plans.
When Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced the approved route
for the rail link in January, there remained two areas of uncertainty. One
was near Gravesend in north Kent and the other was around Ashford. The
battle is still being fought and its outcome is regarded as crucial to the
full development of Ashford as a growth centre.
There are three possible routes under discussion, central and southern ones
that would go through the new station, and a more northerly one that would
bypass it.
The northerly route parallel to the M20 motorway would, in the view of the
town's civic leaders, be a big economic blow as it would mean a smaller
number of diverted trains would call at the station. Most would travel
straight to and from London.
Mr Ernie Mexter, chief executive of Ashford Borough Council, expresses a
common view: 'We strongly favour a line going through the new station as it
would bring greatly increased prosperity to the whole of East Kent. The
northern option would mean we'd have all the environmental drawbacks of the
rail link - and none of the economic benefits.'
Preliminary work has already started on building the station and completion
by a consortium led by John Laing is expected by the end of next year. The
Pounds 50m project involved the redevelopment of the BR Network South East
site and the construction of new platforms and an international terminal
building with parking for 2,000 cars.
If the main line goes through the station rather than a spur, the service to
be known as Eurostar, will run between 10 and 15 trains a day with Brussels
just two hours away and Paris slightly more. Overnight trains will also run
to Amsterdam, Cologne, Frankfurt and Dortmund. Ashford would be the only
passenger stop between London and the continent.
An important infrastructure element is Ashford's southern orbital road which
provides access to two business parks including the 100-acre Orbital
development. The adjacent 114-acre Waterbrook site, owned by Eurotunnel
Developments, has outline planning permission for the relocation of
Ashford's cattle market, and for hotel and leisure uses as well as office,
industrial and warehouse developments, a truck stop and customs clearance
facilities.
The truck stop will be the only area on the M20 corridor identified for
trans-shipment, warehousing and wholesale distribution. On the town's
northern outskirts is the Eureka science and business park, a 135-acre site
owned by Trinity College, Cambridge and aimed primarily at international
companies requiring prestigious landscaped sites for research and
development.
A question mark hangs over the development as the controversial northern
route for the rail link would cut across a corner of the park and prevent
the construction there of leisure facilities planned by the local authority.
A final decision on the route is expected within weeks and if it goes as the
council hopes, everything will then be in place for the long-awaited surge
in growth that will enable the town to fulfil its role as the catalyst for
jobs throughout the East Kent area - 'we are poised for take-off and we have
a good reputation for getting things done,' says Mr Mexter.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of East Kent (3): Striking the right balance -
Education and training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decline in traditional industries and the need to attract inward
investment has led to the introduction of a range of training provisions for
industry and management throughout East Kent, writes Richard Evans.
The need is particularly acute because dependence on industries and services
like coal mining, tourism and cross channel ferries has led to a dearth of
up to date skills in some areas.
But although these needs are recognised, a difficult balance is having to be
struck on how best to divide the limited budget between improving skills and
putting maximum resources towards improving the infrastructure in order to
attract more jobs.
Mr Ken Welsh, inward investment manager at the East Kent Initiative,
appreciates the dilemma more than most - 'we see the top priority as getting
more business parks completed so that companies can move in straight away,
while at the same time giving any help we can to improve local skills. But
it is no use going overboard on training without attracting the jobs.'
The decision last year to grant Dover, Shepway (Folkestone) and Swale
(Sheerness and Sittingbourne) intermediate area status and Thanet (Margate,
Broadstairs and Ramsgate) full development area status should make more
money available for skills training, both from UK and European Union
sources.
In addition, increasing use is being made of the facilities available at
Kent University, based at Canterbury, and other higher education colleges,
and a range of management training programmes being introduced by the
recently launched Kent Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Unemployment across East Kent averages 10.7 per cent, but this includes
travel to work areas of relative prosperity like Ashford and Canterbury.
There are areas with chronic unemployment problems like Thanet (16.8 per
cent and among the worst blackspots in the country), and Sheerness and
Sittingbourne with 14.7 per cent, though the level is much higher in parts
of the Isle of Sheppey.
Folkestone's level is 13.4 per cent and Dover's 10.9 per cent, but both
these are expected to deteriorate as the channel tunnel comes into operation
and the ferry companies rationalise to compete.
Kent Training and Enterprise Council, a non-profit making partnership
between business and local and central government to stimulate growth and to
expand the pool of available skills, has launched two initiatives.
The training for work and the training credits programmes target for special
action school leavers and the long-term unemployed, offering skills training
and job placements.
Training for work provides people out of a job for more than six months with
vocational training and work placements, and individually tailored packages
are provided. Training credits allow 16 and 17 year olds leaving school to
claim up to 6,000 worth of vocational training.
In a partnership between Kent Tec and Dover district council, engineering
and technical training is available which give grants of up to 50 per cent
of costs for workers in local manufacturing companies employing fewer than
350 people. Small companies are given priority.
Kent Training Centre, also in Dover, was set up by Kent county council over
five years ago to provide construction industry training. The range of
courses covers bricklaying, plastering and carpentry, and there are many
short courses in a range of construction skills. The centre is adapting to
the changing needs of industry as qualifications move towards the training
of all-rounders rather than single craft specialists.
An imaginative scheme is being launched by Swale borough council at
Sheerness where the site of a former old sailors' rest home is being
converted into a 41-bed training hostel for young people at a cost of 1.3m.
They will be trained either on site or elsewhere locally and use the hostel
as a base. The scheme, based on a French idea for training hostels, should
be launched by the end of the year.
An area with equally intractable though very different problems is Romney
Marsh in Shepway, where the decline in agriculture, poor communications, a
low skill base, low wages and high unemployment are compounded by poor
access. The Kent outreach project, funded by the county council, Kent Tec
and the rural development commission, has sought to develop training and
education opportunities, particularly for young people. Courses have
included computing, languages and catering.
At a more advanced level, South Kent College with sites at Dover, Folkestone
and Ashford offers a wide range of vocational training opportunities
including business and management studies, engineering and construction,
information technology and languages.
Kent University has developed into an important research and teaching
centre; it is an acknowledged centre of excellence in biotechnology, fibre
optics, medical electronics and computer networks, providing research and
statistical services for industry and commerce, international organisations
and local and central government.
As the largest employer in Canterbury, the university adds some Pounds 100m
and 3,360 jobs to the economy of East Kent.
One of the most interesting developments at Canterbury has been the
establishment in 1992 of Chaucer College within the university campus. It is
an independent college owned by the Japanese Shumei educational foundation,
which provides Japanese nationals with an education in western culture,
history and politics.
The Kent Chamber of Commerce, launched last autumn in an attempt to
co-ordinate the efforts of a dozen small local organisations, has already
becoming the third largest chamber in the UK with 3,000 businesses in
membership, 17 staff and a growing range of training courses, many
specifically tailored for local needs.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of East Kent (2): More inward investment sought -
East Kent Initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first key objective of the East Kent Initiative has been achieved with
the granting of assisted area status last year and the government's
acknowledgement of the region's problems, but this does not guarantee
recovery. Much more work needs to be done and the Initiative is now
concentrating on attracting inward investment.
'The important point is that people now know where we are. We are getting
many more inquiries and we must convert these into jobs,' says Mr Martin
Hemingway, general manager of the EKI since its launch at the end of 1991.
However, Mr Hemingway, returning to Eurotunnel after his two-year
secondment, stresses that the government grants, while welcome, do nothing
to change the underlying problems.
'The structural difficulties remain - there is insufficient strength in
manufacturing and the major employment areas like the cross-channel ferries,
Customs services and mining are in decline or employ fewer people. It is
these long-term problems that we have to combat.'
The EKI, a partnership of Whitehall, local government and the private
sector, was established to counter these long-term employment problems,
exacerbated by the introduction of the single European market and the
construction of the channel tunnel. A study in the late 1980s showed there
could be a shortfall of 40,000 jobs by the year 2000 if no action was taken.
The idea was that one powerful umbrella organisation would be more effective
at hammering home the need for action and support than individual
organisations and local authorities fighting the same battles but
separately.
Core funding comes from four main private sector sponsors, British Telecom,
Dover Harbour Board, Eurotunnel and P &amp; O European Ferries, whose
contributions are matched by the Department of Employment.
Other contributors are Kent county council, Kent training and enterprise
council, and the six local authorities in East Kent, Ashford, Canterbury,
Dover, Shepway, Swale and Thanet. Chairman of the EKI is Sir Alastair
Morton, chairman of Eurotunnel.
Some of the member organisations have provided personnel, and funding for
individual projects has been secured from a variety of private and public
sources including the European social fund. The newly-appointed general
manager is Mr Ian Gill, former chief executive of Thanet district council,
the only local authority in East Kent to have secured full development area
status.
The role of the EKI has been to stimulate and regenerate the rundown local
economy, partly by self-help and partly by persuading Whitehall that the job
could not be done without outside aid.
The success in achieving assisted area status came from persuading ministers
and senior civil servants that some areas in the historically prosperous
south-east deserved help as much as economic blackspots in the midlands and
north.
Assisted area status is not seen as a panacea but as help that will tip the
balance in favour of a faster recovery and a more secure future. The main
objectives now are to encourage the completion of key development sites to
enable new jobs to be created, and to ensure that further improvements are
made to East Kent's transport infrastructure.
The EKI has been organised into five action groups - inward investment and
promotion; infrastructure and site development; skills development and
training; business development and trading links; and tourism. Each has its
own co-ordinator and a small core staff at the Dover headquarters.
Many improvements have already been made to the region's infrastructure,
including completion of the M20 motorway to Folkestone and Dover, but more
needs to be done.
Thanet, the district with the highest unemployment levels that covers
Margate, Ramsgate and Broadstairs, is still too isolated, but access will be
easier when dual carriageway improvements to the Thanet Way are completed
and new Networker rolling stock is introduced on the notorious north Kent
commuter railway.
The most intransigent employment problems in Swale are centred on the Isle
of Sheppey, which despite the potential for growth at the deep water port of
Sheerness, has a depressed local economy and is handicapped by having only
one crossing to and from the mainland, a swing bridge that disrupts traffic
for five minutes in every hour.
The other big problem facing the EKI in its battle to attract inward
investors is the lack of available premises. Half a dozen potentially
excellent business parks have been earmarked for development, including Kent
International adjacent to the airport at Manston in Thanet, White Cliffs at
Dover, Cheriton Parc near Folkestone and Eurolink at Sittingbourne, but they
need substantial infrastructure improvements including better access.
This work is seen as a top priority by Mr Ken Welsh, EKI's inward investment
manager - 'we have got to get our business parks opened up as fast as
possible, otherwise there is a danger that potential jobs will go
elsewhere.'
Talks are taking place with English Partnerships, the government development
agency, to get work on the parks started soon. The only town in the area
with business parks ready for easy occupancy is Ashford, designated by the
county council as an area for growth, but take-off here awaits a decision on
routing the channel high speed rail link through or around Ashford and its
international passenger station.
Mr Welsh and his colleagues are targeting six sectors of industry and
services that would be suitable for East Kent and the available workforce -
food processing, construction materials, medical products, paper and
packaging, high technology including ceramics, and business services.
'What we badly need is a flagship project of high quality where we can show
what we can do to the company's satisfaction. This would act as a catalyst
for others,' he says.
One of the area's problems has been the dearth of large companies because of
the lack of a manufacturing base. Around 93 per cent of businesses employ
less than 20 people, and apart from specialist employers like the ferry
companies, among the few success stories have been Pfizer, the US-owned
healthcare company which employs 2,500, including 1,200 research staff at
Sandwich; Portex, the medical products company, based at Hythe and
Folkestone; Knauf, the building materials producer, near Sittingbourne; and
Sericol, the industrial inks specialist, outside Broadstairs.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of East Kent (1): A move in the right direction -
Opportunities have been created to make East Kent one of the most promising
business locations in the UK. Bold plans are now under way to attract
further investment and jobs, as Richard Evans reports here
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
It has taken a long time for East Kent to get across the message that its
economic needs are more akin to those of deprived industrial areas in the
midlands and north of England than to the rest of the traditionally affluent
south-east - but a good start has been made.
The granting last summer of assisted area status for most of the coastal
strip of North and East Kent was a considerable achievement which should
help to attract investment and jobs. It marked a recognition by the
government that the area has specific problems that need urgent attention.
The problems stem from many complex factors - a decline in traditional jobs
such as agriculture, engineering and coal mining, changes in the pattern of
tourism in the coastal resorts, the impact of the single European market on
ports like Dover, and the rationalisation of cross channel ferry services to
compete with the channel tunnel.
A study in the late 1980s on the likely impact of the tunnel showed that
these structural and cyclical changes could leave the area short of 40,000
jobs by the turn of the century.
Local authorities and the private sector therefore decided jointly to launch
the East Kent Initiative to lobby for aid, and the campaign for assisted
area status has now been won. Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of the EKI and
of Eurotunnel, summed up local feelings: 'We have cracked the conventional
Whitehall and Tory Party wisdom that there is no depression or misery in
good, solid Tory south east England . . . the area has a stagnant economy, a
low skill base and poor infrastructure and was on a descending spiral.'
The task now is to make full use of assisted area status, he said - 'this
gives East Kent huge advantages in relocating companies. Now we have to
exploit that asset and tell business everywhere - in the UK, on the
continent and further afield - of the benefits we have to offer.'
Four travel-to-work areas, Dover and Deal, Shepway, Swale and Thanet secured
assisted area status, three as intermediate areas and Thanet as a
development area where higher levels of grant are available, including
access to categories of European aid.
The need to overcome the image problem East Kent faced from being part of
the south-east is evident from a drive around the Isle of Sheppey, through
the stranded former pit villages, and along the down-at-heel coastal
resorts, many of them with more social security bed-and-breakfast occupants
than holidaymakers. It can be a depressing experience on the sunniest of
days.
Thanet, one of the hardest hit, has an unemployment rate of 16.8 per cent,
making it the sixth worst blackspot in the country. The problems have been
caused by the decline in tourism as its traditional London visitors chose
the sunshine of the costas instead, and by tighter manning of the Ramsgate
ferries to meet competition from the tunnel.
Unemployment in Dover and Deal and in Folkestone has also been affected by
cutbacks in ferry manpower and by the loss of over 5,000 jobs among local
customs agents following the introduction of the single European market.
Dover, as the biggest cross channel operator, expects more job losses when
the tunnel opens. Swale, which includes the Isle of Sheppey and
Sittingbourne, has unemployment of over 14 per cent, but there are much
worse pockets in Sheerness.
The deep water port has a flourishing car and fresh fruit importing trade,
but new jobs are needed desperately. The Olau ferry line has recently
announced the curtailment of its Sheerness to Vlissingen, Holland, service
which is expected to lead directly and indirectly to the loss of several
hundred jobs.
Having achieved government help, the next move by the local authorities,
Kent Training and Enterprise Council, and private companies under the EKI
umbrella, is to capitalise on it.
The strategy is two-fold - to seek more infrastructure improvements and to
make sure there are suitable sites prepared for potential inward investors.
A number of infrastructure projects have already been made to improve access
to the more peripheral areas. The M20 motorway has been completed to
Folkestone and Dover and the tortuous Thanet Way linking Ramsgate and
Margate with the M2 is becoming dual carriageway.
The next crucial improvements are better rail services and stock on the
notorious north Kent line, and better access from the M2 to the Isle of
Sheppey and Sheerness.
A new crossing is not due to be started until 1997, even though the only
access at present is via a swing bridge which stops traffic for five minutes
in every hour.
The full impact of the channel tunnel on the local economy remains unclear.
Recent estimates suggest it could take 35 to 40 per cent of passenger
traffic and up to 20 per cent of the freight market when it is fully
operational.
It will obviously continue to affect the ferries, but they remain bullish
about their future provided they can retain competitiveness.
For the rest of the East Kent economy, much will depend on the imminent
decision on where to route the Ashford section of the high speed rail link
from the tunnel to London. There are three options, two of which would go
through the town and the Pounds 80m international passenger station now
being built, while the third would loop to the north, leaving only a spur
line into the town.
Local authorities and the East Kent business community argue it is essential
that the line should go through Ashford so that the town can fulfil its role
as a centre of expansion for the whole area.
Without the full use of the station they fear that parts of the area would
remain too peripheral and that the potential benefits of the tunnel would be
lost.
Ashford is the only part of East Kent that has fully fledged development
sites and business parks ready for early occupancy, and this is seen as a
top priority for the rest of the area.
A number of promising sites have been designated, including White Cliffs at
Dover, Kent International at Manston in Thanet and Cheriton Parc at
Folkestone but more infrastructure and access work needs to be done before
they become fully operational.
Mr Ken Welsh, seconded from Dover district council as the EKI's inward
investment manager, says: 'The keys to the future are inward investment and
marketing. We have many natural advantages as the closest part of the UK to
the continent and as a pleasant environment, and now we have the grants, but
we have to get our flagship business parks opened up so that we can welcome
new jobs.'
Mr Martin Hemingway, just returned to Eurotunnel after running EKI since its
launch in late 1991, sums up the general feeling: 'We have got to the point
where opportunities have been created to make East Kent one of the most
exciting business locations in the UK. The next stage is to take advantage
of those opportunities.'

US Treasury bonds staged a late technical upturn yesterday in light trading
after holding steady early in the session amid conflicting signals on the
economy.
Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 better at
88 7/16 , with the yield slipping to 7.198 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was  3/32 better at 99 19/32 to yield 5.326 per cent.
In general, the market enjoyed a peaceful session. Comments by the chairman
of the Federal Reserve, just before the afternoon session began, triggered a
brief flurry of selling which quickly evaporated. Mr Alan Greenspan,
addressing bankers in San Francisco, said he thought the country's sense of
economic pessimism was misguided. He stressed that the long-term outlook was
highly favourable.
Early on, the weekly reading on the state of labour market - which showed a
rise of 6,000 in initial claims for state unemployment benefit  - provided a
slight lift, as it suggested that the economy was not growing at an
excessive rate.
But the favourable news was soon balanced out by March sales data from the
leading US retailers. The figures showed shoppers returned as soon as
February's deep freeze ended, a worrying development for bond investors, who
fear the increased demand will lead to higher prices.
The middle segment of the yield curve benefited the most from a firming
trend in the mortgage-backed and municipal bonds.
French government bonds ended the day lower, weighed down by the lacklustre
response to the Bank of France's FFr19.8bn auction of OATs and the weaker
franc.
'Auctions are not desperately easy at the moment so the Bank of France did
as well as one could have expected in these difficult times,' said Mr Kit
Juckes, economist at SG Warburg Securities.
He added that the uncertain political situation in France could force a
widening of the yield differential between 10-year French and German
government bonds. The differential now stands at about 20 basis points, he
said. A further widening would lessen the appeal of French bonds to
international investors.
Dealers said the muted demand at yesterday's auction was reflected in the
higher yields, noting that the average accepted yield on the 5.5 per cent
OATs due 2004 rose by six basis points to 6.47 per cent. The yield on the 6
per cent OAT due 2025 rose to 7.05 per cent from 6.91 per cent. They added
that the bid-to-cover ratios were much lower than at the previous auction.
One dealer noted that the June contract of the notional 10-year French
government bond future on the Matif had held up relatively well during the
auction but had weakened on the back of lower US treasuries.
The contract traded between a high of 123.62 and a low of 123.40 during the
day. In the late afternoon, it traded around 123.54, marginally higher on
the day.
Italian government bonds rose more than one point yesterday afternoon on
news that Italy's federalist Northern League had resumed contact with Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, who had broken off talks with his electoral allies on
Tuesday.
The June contract of the Italian government bond future on Liffe went as
high as 113.48 on the news, well up on the day's low of 112.43. In the late
afternoon, the contract traded around 113.40, up 1.11 point on the day.
UK gilts recovered from an intraday low which followed the release of
stronger-than-expected UK industrial output data for February.
Some dealers said the data appeared to lower the chances of an early rate
cut.
Apart from the data, there were no other fresh influences on the market and
gilts traded in a narrow one-point range. The June contract of the long gilt
future on Liffe traded between 108 21/32 and 107 5/8 during the day. In the
late afternoon the contract was quoted at 108 3/32 , down  3/32 on the day.
German bunds were trapped in a narrow range yesterday as the market waited
for Mr Greenspan to make his speech. There had been worries that he would
raise the discount rate in order to underpin the recent rise in the Fed
funds rate.
The June contract of the bund future on Liffe was sandwiched between 97.30
and 97.00 during the day and traded at 97.15 in the late afternoon, up 0.10
point from Wednesday's close.

FT  08 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Prague to raise Dollars 250m
in first offering since 1920s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The City of Prague is preparing to launch its first bond offering since the
1920s to help finance the modernisation of its underground transport system,
built during Communist rule.
Prague, the only east European borrower apart from the Czech Republic to
have obtained an investment-grade rating (it is rated triple-B with a
positive outlook by Standard &amp; Poor's), intends to raise Dollars 250m in the
international bond market next week.
Nomura, the Japanese securities house, is arranging the issue of five-year
Eurobonds which are expected to be priced to yield around 120 basis points
over US treasuries.
Mr Jan Koukal, the mayor of Prague, said the city wanted to provide a cheap
and efficient service for its 1.2m inhabitants to motivate them to use
public transport. 'We have many problems with technology because we were
forced to use Russian metro trains,' he said at a presentation to investors
in London.
More than one-third of Prague's expenditure of Kcs16.9bn (Dollars 577m) in
1993 was spent on public transport, the largest single area of the city's
expenditure. Mr Koukal said it was likely that the city would have to
continue to heavily subsidise the system.
But he added that this drain on resources should be offset by Prague's
strong local economy, its growing revenue base, its good control over
expenditures and its significant property holdings.
Moody's yesterday placed the Baa3 long-term foreign currency debt rating of
the Czech Republic under review for a possible upgrade. About Dollars 835m
of debt is affected. The review is motivated by the favourable macroeconomic
trends in the Czech Republic, and the country's progress to a market
economy.
Moody's said the shifts in the economy in recent years had not generated
significant imbalances, noting that the fiscal budget and current account of
the balance of payments had a slight surplus in 1993. It added that although
the economy declined by 1.5 per cent last year and inflation reached 20 per
cent, these trends reflected the ongoing structural change.

The State Bank of Vietnam might allow Vietnamese commercial banks to issue
bonds to foreign investors later this year, a senior official said
yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Bangkok.
Nguyen Cong Hai, director of the bank's foreign department, said the plan
was being studied as a way to attract much-needed capital from offshore
lenders.
'We are doing research on the type of mobilisation possible by issuing bonds
by commercial banks in Vietnam,' Mr Hai said. 'This year we might allow some
big commercial banks in Vietnam to issue bonds for that purpose.'
The state bank has said it is close to launching a trial tranche of 91-day
Treasury bills aimed at retail investors in Vietnam.

FT  08 APR 94 / International Bonds: Finland's Dollars 1.5bn FRN claimed to
be too aggressively priced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Republic of Finland's newly-launched Dollars 1.5bn floating rate issue
broke syndicate yesterday morning and was the main focus of attention in the
international bond market, with rival syndicates claiming the deal had been
mispriced and poorly received by the market.
Floating-rate notes have been very much the flavour of the first quarter of
1994, providing borrowers with a more cost-effective means of raising funds
at a time of considerable bond markets uncertainty .
But some syndicate officials claim there is now too much floating-rate paper
'sloshing around'. Borrowers launched the equivalent of Dollars 34.1bn in
FRNs in the first quarter, predominantly in dollars, according to figures
compiled by Euromoney, and syndicates say a considerable proportion of the
paper is still unplaced.
Goldman Sachs, lead manager for the Finland Dollars 1.5bn deal, said it had
bought back over Dollars 400m of bonds from other syndicates after the deal
broke yesterday morning.
The bonds have a coupon of three-month Libid, and at the issue price of
99.68 yield five basis points below three-month Libor. Goldman Sachs said
the bonds had been bought back at 99.58 or above, trading within fees. But
other syndicates, which claimed the deal was too aggressively priced, said
the bonds traded outside fees initially before recovering.
'The pricing was wrong and the deal was launched into an overloaded market -
Goldman is just buying league table position,' said one specialist.
New issues launched yesterday came in an assortment of currencies, with a
large convertible bond issue from Thermo Electron and a couple of
Eurosterling deals, from Tate &amp; Lyle International Finance and Northern Rock
Building Society.
Thermo Electron, the US technology company, launched a Dollars 300m
convertible bond issue, increasing the size by Dollars 100m. The seven-year
bonds have a 5 per cent coupon and a conversion premium of 14.9 per cent.
Lehman Brothers, the book-runner, said about half the issue was sold in the
US, and the rest in Europe, with strong demand out of Switzerland, the UK
and France.
Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar and sweeteners group, launched a Pounds 100m,
five-year deal with an 8 per cent coupon. The bonds were priced to yield 80
basis points over the five-year gilt: while Tate &amp; Lyle does not have a
formal credit rating, one of the joint lead managers said the yield spread
reflected the company's 'perceived rating of around the A1 or Aa3 area' as
well as taking into account the 'volatile market conditions'. The paper is
expected to be sold mainly to domestic institutions.
Northern Rock Building Society raised Pounds 100m in the sterling sector
with a four-year FRN. Sterling specialists said the deal went well, and the
price edged up from 99.81 at launch to 99.82 by late afternoon.

Four of the largest state-owned Chinese companies selected for listing
outside China are aiming for the New York Stock Exchange.
Two power supply companies and two regional airlines, expected to raise
between Dollars 250m and Dollars 500m each, have signed up with US
investment banks, according to industry executives.
In January the Chinese government published a list of 22 large and
medium-sized state companies which it had approved for a foreign listing.
Most were, and still are, expected to list their shares on the Hong Kong
stock exchange.
Chinese corporate regulators are understood to have sanctioned the US
listings. They are, however, waiting to see how these progress before
allowing companies to list on other foreign exchanges.
So far 13 of the companies are believed to have issued mandates to merchant
banks, with seven going to US investment banks. UK and Japanese houses have
captured only one each, while the Bank of China's merchant bank in Hong Kong
has received two lead mandates.
The US listings are expected to be among the first of the 22 to come to the
market, towards the end of this year, with the power companies at the head
of the list.
Lehman Brothers has secured the mandate for Huaneng International, a power
generation and supply company incorporated in Beijing, while Credit Suisse
First Boston will bring Shandong Huaneng Electricity, a Beijing incorporated
operator of seven power companies, to the New York market.
Goldman Sachs has won the mandate for China Southern Airlines and Morgan
Stanley the mandate for China Eastern Airways.
Some bankers query the value of a foreign listing for mainland Chinese
companies, claiming that the natural market for these stocks is Hong Kong.

FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Keeping the customer satisfied -
Citibank of the US is breaking into Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sight of someone withdrawing money from a 'hole-in-the-wall' cash
machine at three o'clock in the morning in downtown Tokyo illustrates a
revolution in retail banking.
In most countries the sight might be commonplace, but in Japan there are
only 60 machines available 24 hours a day.
All 60 belong to Citibank, and the US bank's experience in Japanese retail
banking provides a telling example of how foreign companies can succeed in
the Japan.
In five years, the number of Citibank's retail customers in Japan has risen
from 30,000 to 200,000. Its retail operations in Japan, where it has been
the only foreign group to set up a branch network, should move into profit
next year, according to Mr Masamoto Yashiro, an executive vice-president.
Citibank had six branches in the early 1980s, but decided in 1988 to expand
rapidly. 'Japan represents an opportunity, even for foreign banks. If you
can succeed, the market is so large - the country is the world's
second-largest economy - that you can really flourish,' says Mr Yashiro.
Citibank believed it saw a gap in the market. Mr Yashiro explains: 'Contrary
to the conventional view, Japanese services are historically of low quality.
This is a producer society. Consumers are not well catered for. Banking
customers have been viewed as a source of cheap funds and their needs have
not been met.'
The barriers faced by Citibank when it entered retail banking were not, for
the most part, generated by Japan's bureaucracy. 'The ministry of finance
seems not to object to foreign banks,' says Mr Yashiro. 'By Japanese
standards - and I emphasise by Japanese standards - we've been treated well.
But it's a society that believes in stability rather than opportunity.
Invariably, if you ask for permission to do something new, you're told it's
not a good idea.' The bank is still unable to offer investment advice.
One of the biggest non-bureaucratic difficulties has been setting up a
branch network. The 11 leading commercial banks - known as city banks - have
huge branch networks; if Citibank was to even start competing, it had to
find good sites at reasonable prices, an almost impossible task during the
bubble economy of the late 1980s.
'Even though real estate prices are down, you often still have to provide up
to seven years' rent in advance - and you don't receive any interest on it.'
The bank now has 21 branches, mostly in Tokyo.
Another problem has been gaining access to the automatic teller machine
networks owned by the other banks. Mr Yashiro says: 'We can't really compete
by providing plain vanilla services. We have to be a niche player. We offer
the basic services, and then provide added value. This includes rapid
international fund transfers, multi-currency accounts - our customers can
hold accounts in 11 different currencies - and automatic bill paying.'
One of Citibank's main points of differentiation is its 24-hour cash-point
machines. The company has 40 on-site ATMs, with about 20 off-site. But that
is paltry compared with the Bancs network, owned by the city banks, which
has 27,000 machines around the country.
'We were not allowed to belong to Bancs because we were foreign,' says Mr
Yashiro. 'We are only affiliate members, which means we have to pay a
slightly higher customer fee. I openly say this is discrimination - not by
the government, but by the banks.
'On the other hand, it's a lot better than it might have been. When we first
approached them, we were asked to pay for half the development costs of the
entire system.' Citibank started negotiations six months ago with the
first-tier regional banks for access to their system, but its customers are
still unable to use them.
In spite of the problems and occasional long waits by customers for some
services, Citibank's added-value formula appears to be working. Turnover
rose 35 per cent last year, and most foreign bankers in Japan hold accounts
with Citibank, a fact which pleases Mr Yashiro.
However, profitability still eludes Citibank's Japanese retail banking
operations, despite a cost-reduction programme. Staffing levels have been
kept flat over the last two years, even though new branches are being
opened.
In spite of Citibank's relative success, Mr Yashiro expects few others to
follow. 'The main obstacle for foreign banks remains the cost of setting up
the infrastructure,' he concludes.

supply agreement

<TEXT>
Three Japanese truck makers have agreed to supply each other with trucks, a
significant step in the restructuring of Japan's automobile industry.
Nissan, Nissan Diesel and Isuzu will provide each other with products on an
original equipment manufacturing (OEM) basis beginning next summer, the
companies said.
Under the agreement, Nissan will supply Isuzu with 6,000 vans and 3,000
one-tonne trucks annually, which Isuzu will market under its own brands.
Isuzu, in its first deal to supply a competitor with trucks on an OEM basis,
will supply Nissan and Nissan Diesel with 14,000 units of its two-to
three-tonne truck, which the Nissan companies will sell under different
brands.
The deal aims to reduce development costs in order to meet rising
competition in the Japanese truck market, Isuzu said. The truck makers are
particularly concerned that tougher vehicle exhaust rules will add
substantially to development costs.
Sharing development costs has become an important theme for many Japanese
carmakers. Competition in the domestic truck market is expected to remain
intense as demand is not likely to rise significantly in the near future.
All three companies have come under severe pressure in Japan's slumping
automobile market. In the year to March 31, Isuzu saw total vehicle sales
fall nearly 20 per cent, Nissan Diesel 13 per cent and Nissan 10 per cent.

A new investment fund backed by US institutions plans to invest up to
Dollars 1bn over the next three years in China's automotive components
industry to take advantage of a boom in the vehicle sector.
The Asian Strategic Investments Corporation (Asimco), through its China
Automotive Components Group, plans an initial Dollars 160m investment in
joint ventures with about a dozen local manufacturers.
Mr Jack Perkowski, chairman of Asimco, said the company would bring
'experienced management and technology, as well as capital' to the
components sector. Its aim is to become the largest components company in
China.
Shareholders in Asimco include Pacific Alliance Group, a Hong Kong and
China-based merchant bank, and Dean Witter Capital Corporation and TCW
Capital Investment Corporation, both of the US.
Among Asimco's local partners will be the China National Automobile Industry
Association (CNAIC), Norinco, China's largest integrated motor vehicle
company, and the municipal government of Changchun, China's main vehicle
manufacturing centre.
Mr Perkowski said his organisation would take majority stakes in joint
ventures and develop these into the dominant players in their respective
segments of the market.
China's automotive components sector is highly fragmented with some 4,000
manufacturers, many of them tiny operations. The CNAIC estimates that
Dollars 20bn is required for the components industry to keep pace with
developments in vehicle manufacturing. China's spare parts market is the
fourth largest in the world, according to some estimates.
The Chinese authorities will soon unveil a new car industry strategy which
is expected to freeze the number of vehicle manufacturers, but it is likely
that encouragement will be given to the components sector.

<TEXT>
Voest-Alpine Technologie (VA Tech), Austria's largest engineering group, has
lifted profits on slightly reduced turnover for 1993, and announced
conditions for its privatisation next month.
Domestic and international investors will be offered 7.65m shares, or 51 per
cent of VA Tech share capital, through a five-day flotation on the Vienna
stock exchange starting on May 16. The share price will be announced on May
13, and the government expects to raise at least Sch5bn (Dollars 414.6m)
from the sale.
According to an original valuation the sale was expected to raise
Sch5bn-Sch6bn, but this was before last year's results were known, and
developments since then should firm up the price, Mr Othmar Puhringer, VA
Tech chairman, said.
Group profits rose 6 per cent to Sch974m. Turnover fell to Sch22.5bn from
Sch23.6bn in 1992, reflecting accounting changes.
VA Tech was formed last November as part of a reorganisation of most of
Austria's state-owned industries after heavy losses at Austria Metall, the
aluminium manufacturer.
OIAG, state holding company for the nationalised industries, will keep 24
per cent directly in VA Tech, and 25 per cent indirectly through its VA
Stahl steel unit.

<TEXT>
Sun Microsystems, the US computer workstation manufacturer, has taken the
unusual step of releasing its earnings and sales figures for the third
fiscal quarter before issuing a full financial report.
The move follows a sharp drop in Sun's share price earlier in the week after
the company warned that third-quarter revenues would be below analyst's
expectations.
Sun shares rose Dollars 3 1/4 to close at Dollars 25 3/8 in New York
yesterday.
Sun's net income for the third quarter, ended March, was Dollars 57.5m, or
60 cents a share, compared with Dollars 51.7m, or 47 cents, in the same
period last year. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 1.19bn, up 5 per
cent from Dollars 1.14bn in last year's third quarter.
Before last week's announcement, when the company said US sales growth had
been held back by anticipation of new workstation products, analysts had
been predicting earnings of around 64 cents a share. After the warning,
projected earnings dropped sharply to around 52 cents a share.
However, in a statement issued after the market closed on Wednesday, Sun
said sales of its low-end desktop workstations had been most severely
affected by the product transition problem.
But with sales of higher performance workstations and servers representing a
larger than usual proportion of Sun's sales in the third quarter, gross
profit margins increased to 42.8 per cent of revenues, the highest level in
the last six quarters, the company said.
The increase in gross margins runs against industry trends, but is expected
to be temporary as sales of Sun's new low-cost workstations take off. The
new products, introduced last week, will 'shatter the workstation price
model', Sun claims.
Sun introduced mid-range and high performance workstations and slashed the
price of its low-end model to less than Dollars 3,000.

Goldman Sachs, the US private investment bank, has appointed Mr Hideo
Ishihara, a former deputy president of the Industrial Bank of Japan and
president of IBJ Leasing, as the chairman of Goldman Sachs Japan, the Tokyo
arm of the US investment house.
Mr Ishihara, who will join the company as a general partner, the equivalent
of a board member of a listed company, said that the appointment reflected
Goldman's wish to expand business with Japanese companies.
The move comes as other leading US houses are scaling down their Tokyo
operations and focusing on other parts of south-east Asia.
Mr Ishihara, 63, is known for his connections in international finance. He
became deputy president of IBJ in 1990.

FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: AirTouch aims for the overseas
market - Pactel's wireless arm is well placed to operate as a separate unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US telecoms operators are hastily reassessing their prospects as the old
certainties of the industry fade amid regulatory and technological upheaval.
The seven regional Bell companies face the most urgent challenge, with their
local monopolies set to be abolished and their cellular mobile networks
about to meet a fresh wave of competition from new licensees.
Arguably the most innovative reaction is that of Pacific Telesis, the San
Francisco-based Bell company. Two years ago Pactel said it was going to
spin-off its wireless business into an entirely separate company. That
spin-off takes effect this week with the launch of AirTouch Communications
as an independent company, comprising Pactel's cellular, paging and
international operations.
Pactel's 'wireline' activities - 15m line connections and associated
businesses in California and Nevada - remain with Pacific Bell. They account
for the bulk of the former group's turnover: in 1992 PacBell generated
Dollars 8.7bn of Pactel's Dollars 9.9bn revenues, with domestic cellular,
paging and international activities contributing Dollars 873m between them.
But the wireless business is set to grow fast, and the spin-off marks a
significant departure from the course adopted by the other Bell operators.
Mr Sam Ginn, AirTouch chairman - who moves sideways from the same post in
Pactel - says regulation and valuation were the key considerations in the
spin-off. Pactel believed it was undervalued because its cellular assets
were 'buried' by PacBell, and it was concerned about access to capital for
the cellular business, given valuation and dividend requirements.
So far, Pactel/AirTouch has defied the sceptics. In an initial public
offering last December AirTouch raised Dollars 1.5bn with ease, and Pactel's
share price has risen by more than 35 per cent since the announcement of the
spin-off.
That compares starkly with the fate of Bell Atlantic, whose share price fell
nearly 20 per cent in the four months between the announcement and the
collapse of its much-vaunted Dollars 21.4bn merger with Tele-Communications,
the largest US cable television service company.
Why, then, are no other Bell companies following suit? 'There is a great
deal of inertia out there,' claims Mr Ginn. 'The others are reluctant to go
through the trauma of the state regulatory process to reform themselves; and
they are hooked by the term 'convergence' into thinking it would be a
mistake to separate their wireless activities from the rest.'
The move last year by AT&amp;T, the US telecoms giant, to buy McCaw, the leading
domestic wireless operator, convinced many Baby Bells the future lay in
integrating, not separating their activities. 'We'd be insane to fragment
ourselves just as AT&amp;T is trying to resurrect old Ma Bell,' said one
regional Bell chief executive earlier this year.
A few months on, the definition of sanity is more problematic. Hard on the
heels of the Bell Atlantic escapade, Southwestern Bell - the Texas-based
Bell operator - this week called off its planned Dollars 1.6bn investment in
Cox Enterprises, a leading cable group. A meltdown of the Bell system
appears ever less likely.
As for convergence between cellular and 'wireline', the Federal
Communications Commission, which regulates the telecoms industry from
Washington, is unlikely to allow full integration between wireline and
wireless activities for fear of cross-subsidies.
Divesting its cellular business leaves PacBell free to bid in its own right
for California franchises for personal communications services, the new
cellular networks soon to be auctioned by the FCC. AirTouch will bid
elsewhere, aiming to put together a consortium providing nationwide
coverage.
The overseas market is the focus of AirTouch's strategy. Although it is only
one of the large Bell cellular operators within the US, overseas it is the
largest. It inherits several lucrative international franchises - notably a
26 per cent stake in Mannesmann Mobilfunk, which operates the second
cellular network in Germany with 570,000 subscribers, and a 10 per cent
stake in the consortium which recently won the licence for Italy's second
cellular network.
Across Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, the cellular mobile market is
liberalising faster than the wireline market, where the vested interests of
long-established national telecoms monopolies are far more powerful.
US cellular operators are strongly placed, particularly those such as
AirTouch and BellSouth with successful records in partnerships with local
companies.
Allowing for its share of consortia, AirTouch begins life with 1.1m US
subscribers and 155,000 abroad. 'My hope is that by the year 2000 our assets
would be larger outside the US than inside,' says Mr Ginn. That means an
aggressive overseas strategy.
'In our early ventures we were motivated largely by political risk - we
concentrated on politically stable countries, mostly western industrial
countries. My current thinking is that we are now in a position to take more
risk - moving into lesser developed countries.'
So in addition to western Europe, Mr Ginn will be looking for franchises in
the Asia-Pacific region's rapidly expanding economies.
The strategy is similar to that of Vodafone, the UK's largest operator and
also a dedicated wireless operator, whose overseas forays in 'safe'
countries have led it to less stable areas, notably South Africa.
Will the AirTouch spin-off generate a dynamism of its own? 'In personal
terms, it's been a wrench, like the 1984 divestiture (of AT&amp;T, which led to
the creation of the Baby Bells),' muses Mr Ginn. 'Twelve months after that
revolution, it seemed like ancient history.'

Dow Jones, the media group which publishes the Wall Street Journal,
yesterday reported a 30 per cent rise in first quarter net income, helped by
sharply improved operating earnings at all of its three divisions.
The group reported net income of Dollars 40.17m, or 40 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 30.95m, or 31 cents, in the same period of last year.
Revenues rose 7.7 per cent to Dollars 499.2m from Dollars 463.4m.
The figures included a Dollars 3m one-time after-tax charge from the
adoption of a new accounting standard relating to employees' post-employment
benefits. Excluding this, net income was up 39.5 per cent, the company
reported.
Consolidated operating income was 35.8 per cent higher than in the same
period of last year, at Dollars 88.75m.
The information services segment, which includes the Dow Jones/Telerate and
business information services operations, saw operating income rise 39.7 per
cent to Dollars 48.14m on revenues 10 per cent higher at Dollars 230m.
Business publications had operating income of Dollars 41.5m, up 30.5 per
cent, on revenues 7.2 per cent higher at Dollars 213.5m. The Wall Street
Journal's advertising lineage rose 1.7 per cent, but on a per issue basis
was even with a year earlier.
Ottaway Newspapers, the group's community newspaper subsidiary, reported a
17.8 per cent rise in operating income to Dollars 4.43m, on revenues 1.3 per
cent higher at Dollars 55.78m. Advertising lineage fell 1.1 per cent.
The company's shares closed Dollars 1 1/4 higher on the New York Stock
Exchange, at Dollars 39 1/8.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Benetton, the Italian clothing group, is to seek shareholder approval for a
bond issue and a placing of 19m new shares on foreign markets.
The group yesterday called an extraordinary meeting of shareholders for May
25 and 26 to vote on the share and bond issue, causing a drop in Benetton's
share price on a day in which the Milan stock market rose.
Benetton will also ask shareholders if some or all of the new shares can be
issued in the form of convertible bonds on foreign markets. The aim is to
increase the geographical spread of the group's shareholders.
In February, Benetton raised L265bn (Dollars 162m) by selling 10m new shares
in an issue aimed particularly at increasing the number of US shareholders
in the group. Shareholders gave authorisation to issue 30m new shares three
years ago.
The group said yesterday that the separate issue of bonds with warrants
attached could raise up to L150bn on the Italian market, but it did not
state how much would be raised by the share issue.

<TEXT>
Baltica, Denmark's largest combined accident and life assurance group, moved
back into the black in 1993 with group net profit of DKr25m (Dollars 3.7m),
compared with a 1992 loss of DKr445m. For the second consecutive year, no
dividend was proposed.
Group premium income slipped to DKr8.33bn from DKr8.51bn, but general
insurance premium income rose for the first time since 1989 to DKr3.38bn
from DKr3.36bn.
Assets increased to DKr112bn from DKr101.5bn, but equity capital was reduced
to DKr5.67bn from DKr7.81bn at the end of 1992.
Losses on financial guarantee business cost Baltica DKr220m last year. It
also lost DKr95m on a US subsidiary, but said the general insurance business
had developed satisfactorily.
The group forecast an improvement in 1994 as a result of continued cost
reductions and increases in premium rates.
Baltica Insurance is up for sale after the collapse last year of its former
parent company, Baltica Holding, which has changed its name to Gefion, but
yesterday's report made no mention of the sell-off.

<TEXT>
Tata, India's largest industrial grouping, is considering buying control of
a Dollars 240m fertiliser chemical plant in Florida in what would be the
biggest overseas acquisition by an Indian company.
Tata Chemicals, a Tata company producing soda ash, caustic soda and other
chemicals, is examining plans to pay Dollars 122.4m for a 51 per cent stake
in the plant owned by Occidental Chemical Corporation, an arm of Occidental,
the energy group. Occidental would retain the remaining 49 per cent.
The Florida plant produces phosphoric acid, the main ingredient for
phosphatic fertilisers, which it makes from phosphate rock. India, which is
short of phosphates, imports phosphoric acid. Its needs are expected to grow
rapidly, so Tata believes it makes sense to invest overseas to secure a
captive supply of phosphoric acid.
The planned acquisition was strongly promoted by Mr Darbari Seth, the
74-year-old former chairman of Tata Chemical, who left suddenly last month,
saying he was retiring.
The scheme will require government approval because capital account
transactions are tightly controlled by foreign exchange laws.

<TEXT>
General Electric, the US conglomerate, said its earnings for the first
quarter of the year were 'at the high end of analysts' estimates', which
ranged from Dollars 1.45 to Dollars 1.50 a share.
The announcement marked an attempt by the industrial giant to scotch rumours
that its financial services businesses, which have been one of the main
engines of profits growth in recent periods, had suffered from rising US
interest rates.
In particular, market speculation centred on possible losses at Kidder
Peabody, the group's Wall Street brokerage house. In a statement, GE said
that first-quarter earnings at both Kidder and GE Capital Services, its
financial services unit, would be 'excellent'. Dennis Dammerman, the group's
senior vice president in charge of finance, also said that GE continues to
expect record earnings for 1994 as a whole.
Kidder has had a patchy record in recent years and has been consistently
less profitable than its main competitors, leading to frequent speculation
that GE was looking to sell the business.
Last year operating profits jumped to Dollars 439m from Dollars 300m.

Swissair, Switzerland's shareholder-owned national airline, announced that
its net group profit fell 48 per cent in 1993, to SFr59m (Dollars 40.9m)
from SFr113m in 1992, AP-DJ reports from Zurich.
It also said it would pass its dividend on the 1993 results.
As previously reported, the company posted a first-half 1993 group net loss
of SFr65m. Swissair indicated a month ago that full-year 1993 group results
would be positive.
At the airline level, 1993 net profit fell 68 per cent to SFr6.7m from
SFr20.8m in 1992.
The company blamed fare erosion and said it would ask shareholders to agree
to omit a dividend. Last year, the airline paid a dividend of SFr10 a share,
down from SFr20 the year before.
Group operating profit rose slightly last year to SFr216m from SFr214m in
1992.

Portugal has chosen one Brazilian and three French companies as the foreign
investors allotted shareholdings, totalling 7.5 per cent, in the
privatisation of Banco Portugues do Atlantico (BPA), the country's largest
retail bank.
Caisse National de Prevoyance and Mutuelles du Mans, the French insurance
companies, will take stakes of 3 per cent and 1 per cent respectively. The
Brazilian Banco Economico will buy 2.5 per cent and French bank Credit
Commercial de France 1 per cent.
The sale of the shareholdings will raise Es15.4bn (Dollars 89m) for the
Portuguese state. Credit Commercial de France had been contracted to advise
the Portuguese government and negotiate the sale of stakes in BPA to foreign
investors.
Foreign shareholders are limited to holding 3 per cent of BPA individually
and 7.5 per cent collectively. The sale of stakes to foreign companies is
the third phase of BPA's privatisation and will bring the total capital in
private hands to 75 per cent.
The state is expected further to reduce its shareholding in BPA later this
year by not exercising subscription rights in a planned capital increase to
Es110bn from Es100bn. The bank is now controlled by a group of Portuguese
investors who own 27 per cent.
Mutuelles du Mans owns 37.5 per cent of BPA Seguros, an insurer in the BPA
group. Credit Commercial and Banco Economico have co-operation agreements
with the bank.

Bertelsmann, the world's second largest media group, yesterday said earnings
for the six months ending December 31 were 'well above budget'.
In addition, it expected full-year results to be better than the 1993 record
figures, despite losing an estimated DM160m through the collapse last week
of the Vox private television channel.
Total foreign sales rose 6.2 per cent to DM9.3bn (Dollars 5.43bn) while
earnings rose by 'an even higher percentage', the company said. It did not
give further details.
The family-owned company said sales were expected to grow 6 per cent to more
than DM18bn for the full year, maintaining Bertelsmann's position as the
second largest media group in the world, behind Time Warner of the US.
While Bertelsmann admitted the recession had not left it 'totally
untouched', it said it would ride out the collapse of Vox, which folded just
14 months after its launch when two shareholders, Suddeutsche Verlag and
WestLB, pulled out.
Sales at Bertelsmann Buch, the newly created division which handles book
clubs in German speaking countries and the international publishing arm,
jumped 6 per cent to DM3.2bn.
The company's best performing division, Bertelsmann Music Group, which
includes the Arista Record company, reported sales up by 10 per cent to
DM2.7bn.
Turnover at Gruner+Jahr, the second largest division, which embraces
newspapers and magazines and is more focused on the German market, rose 2
per cent to DM1.9bn.
The industry group, which takes in printing plants and paper production,
reported turnover up 1.5 per cent to DM1.6bn while the film and television
division reported turnover up 23 per cent at DM500m.

Baltica, Denmark's largest combined accident and life assurance group, moved
back into the black in 1993 with group net profit of DKr25m (Dollars 3.7m),
compared with a 1992 loss of DKr445m. For the second consecutive year, no
dividend was proposed.
Group premium income slipped to DKr8.33bn from DKr8.51bn, but general
insurance premium income rose for the first time sine 1989 to DKr3.38bn from
DKr3.36bn.
Assets increased to DKr112bn from DKr101.5bn, but equity capital was reduced
to DKr5.67bn from DKr7.81bn at the end of 1992.
Losses on financial guarantee business cost Baltica DKr220m last year. It
also lost DKr95m on a US subsidiary, but said the general insurance business
had developed satisfactorily.
The group forecast an improvement in 1994 as a result of continued cost
reductions and increases in premium rates.
Baltica Insurance is up for sale after the collapse last year of its former
parent company, Baltica Holding, which has changed its name to Gefion, but
yesterday's report made no mention of the sell-off.

<TEXT>
The battle to control Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) following the
Spanish banking group's financial restructuring is becoming increasingly
acrimonious, with complaints from potential bidders that they have been
given inadequate information.
Up to five other leading Spanish banks are in a position to bid for the
controlling stake in Banesto after buying documentation on the sale from the
Deposit Guarantee Fund, the body which temporarily holds 73 per cent as a
result of a capital increase approved last month.
Three - Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Banco Santander and the semi-state Argentaria
 -are considered firm candidates. Banco Central Hispano, created by a merger
three years ago, has indicated it is not contemplating taking a controlling
stake but might be interested in parts of the Banesto empire.
The fifth bank, Banco Popular, which is still undecided whether to bid, has
stated publicly that it has 'a long list of unanswered questions' to put to
Salomon Brothers, the US bank which is advising the Bank of Spain and the
Deposit Guarantee Fund on the sale.
Other banks have complained privately about the paucity of information in
the documents, for which each bank has paid Pta100m (Dollars 715,000).
Complaints refer to details about questionable loans, which are said to
occupy only two pages in the eight-volume dossier, activities of subsidiary
companies and foreign currency positions.
Argentaria said that with the information available, it was 'impossible to
make an adequate valuation' in order to put forward a bid.

FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Finnish steel group's global
share offering aims to attract FM800m

<TEXT>
Rautaruukki, the Finnish steel group, yesterday announced plans to raise
around FM800m (Dollars 144m) through a global share offering which will
strengthen its balance sheet and reduce state ownership.
The issue is one of the largest in Finland's programme to widen ownership of
state-owned companies, and will cut the state's holding in the group to 70
per cent from 81 per cent.
Proceeds will be used to reduce debt and will increase Rautaruukki's equity
to assets ratio to about 30 per cent from 22.8 per cent at the end of 1993.
The group is offering 16m shares in two tranches. Around 65 per cent of the
issue will be directed at Finnish and international institutions, and the
remainder at the US market. Pricing will not be fixed until the end of this
month, but will be based on market value of the shares, which was FM52
yesterday.
The new offer follows the group's success last year in raising FM320m
through a share issue which cut state ownership to 81 per cent from 87 per
cent. It has been timed to take advantage of the company's improving
financial performance and an upturn in Scandinavian demand.
Rautaruukki is one of Europe's few profitable steelmakers after returning to
the black with a FM144m surplus after financial items last year. It has
benefited from the low value of the Finnish markka, increased efficiency and
higher steel prices.
A further improvement in earnings has been forecast for this year, with
turnover set to rise to FM8bn from FM7bn.
The group, Scandinavia's second biggest steel producer after Sweden's SSAB,
concentrates on flat steel products.
Parliamentary authorisation allows the state to reduce its stake in
Rautaruukki to 50.1 per cent, suggesting further share issues will be made.
CS First Boston is lead manager of the global offering and sole manager of
the US tranche. Prospectus, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki and Merrill Lynch
International are co-lead managers of the international tranche.

FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Decision on Corange board battle
delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decision over the future composition of the Corange board has been put off
until May 20 after Mr Curt Engelhorn, the company's biggest shareholder, was
unable to attend a special general meeting in Bermuda.
Corange, the Bermuda-based pharmaceutical group, is the parent company of
Boehringer Mannheim, one of Germany's largest healthcare companies.
The board is attempting to eject Mr Engelhorn, who speaks for 42 per cent of
the shares, as chairman of the supervisory board of Mannheim.
Corange's board yesterday issued a statement calling on Mr Engelhorn to give
his full support to its chief executive, Mr Max Link.
But Mr Engelhorn, who has called on Mr Link to resign, was yesterday backed
by Mr Franz Kuehner, head of the German Workers' Council and a member of
Mannheim's supervisory board.
Mr Kuehner denounced the statement from the Corange board and warned that
employees could no longer work for the new chief executive.
He also turned down the opportunity of taking part in any mediation with Mr
Link, although he said he was prepared to speak with Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the
temporary chairman of Corange and former president of the Bundesbank.

FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Cerus announces FFr858m rights
to reduce debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Cerus, the French holding company controlled by Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the
Italian industrialist, yesterday announced plans to raise FFr858m (Dollars
146m) through a rights issue aimed at reducing debts and reinforcing its
financial structure.
The company said that one new share would be offered at FFr100 for every
three shares already held. Cerus shares fell sharply, losing FFr7.80 to
close at FFr129.
The announcement of the share issue comes the day after the group revealed
sharply reduced losses of FFr251m for 1993, compared with FFr1.55bn the
previous year. Mr Michel Cicurel, deputy chairman, said yesterday that the
results for the current year should be around break even.
The company also announced a reduction in net debts, from FFr1.45bn at the
end of 1992 to FFr108m at the end of last year. 'A holding company should
not be indebted,' Mr Cicurel said yesterday, adding that the proceeds of the
rights issue would be used solely to strengthen its balance sheet.
Cerus, which is 49 per cent controlled by Mr Benedetti's CIR, is now
concentrating on its industrial participations, including its 29 per cent
holding in Valeo, the automobile components group. Mr Cicurel said yesterday
that Cerus planned to sell Dumenil Leble, its loss-making banking operation,
by the end of the year.
According to Cerus, several companies have expressed interest in buying the
private banking activities of Dumenil. A spokesman for the company said,
however, that these activities would probably be retained until a sale had
been arranged for the bank's portfolio of property loans.
According to Cerus, CIR will subscribe to the rights issue in proportion to
its current shareholding. The issue will be underwritten by Banque Nationale
de Paris and Banque Indosuez. The issue of 8.58m new shares should reduce
net assets per share from FFr145.70 to FFr134.30.

FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Olivetti plans L500bn bond issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Olivetti, the Italian information technology group, could raise as much as
L500bn (Dollars 302m) with a convertible bond issue, announced yesterday, to
finance the new mobile telephone venture in which it is one of the largest
shareholders.
Olivetti also revealed yesterday that it had cut net losses to L465bn in
1993, compared with L650bn the previous year, and increased sales for the
first time since 1990. Net debt was cut to L798bn from L960bn.
The group said it would ask shareholders at a special meeting on May 11 and
12 to approve the issue of up to 250m shares as part of a convertible bond
issue to institutional investors. The price of the issue has yet to be
fixed, but at current market values should raise more than L450bn.
Last year the company, headed by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, pushed through a
L902bn rights issue to fund expansion into the information technology and
telecommunications sectors, provoking a sharp drop in the share price.
The computer group, based at Ivrea near Turin, is still celebrating its
success last week in winning the licence for Italy's GSM mobile
telecommunications network, at the head of the Omnitel-Pronto Italia
consortium. Omnitel will have to invest some L3,000bn to build up the
network, of which Olivetti will provide 35 per cent, in line with its stake
in the consortium. Analysts believe the group may have to raise further
loans to cover the investment.
Olivetti revealed that in 1993 it failed to break even at the operating
level as it had hoped to do. It was hit by the 1991 devaluation of the
Italian lira, which increased the cost of components for computer hardware
and office equipment. The company said it hoped to break even in 1994.
In 1993, Olivetti reduced its operating losses slightly from L229bn to
L206bn, on sales of L8,613bn compared to L8,025bn. The group said sales had
continued to increase in the first quarter of 1994, raising hopes that the
computer and information technology market may be starting to pull out of
the international recession which has plagued Olivetti and its competitors
during the 1990s.
Olivetti also hopes to complete its wide-ranging restructuring programme in
the first half of this year. Since 1989 the group's workforce has been cut
from 57,000 to 35,000, and last year's redundancy package cost the company
L255bn in extraordinary charges.
The computer group believes it is now emerging from its recent difficulties,
which culminated in last year's admission by Mr De Benedetti that Olivetti
was forced to pay bribes to the Italian Posts Ministry to avoid being cut
out of lucrative contracts. Rome magistrates insisted on Mr De Benedetti's
arrest in November, although he was later released and no further action has
been taken.
