<TEXT>
Mr Frank Wells, a leading member of the Walt Disney management team which
has transformed the faltering fortunes of the US entertainment group over
the past decade, was killed on Sunday in a helicopter accident in eastern
Nevada, writes Richard Waters in New York.
Mr Wells, 62, president and chief operating officer of the group, was
brought in alongside Mr Michael Eisner, the company's chairman and chief
executive, in 1984. The two men have been credited with leading a revival of
the group, turning it into one of the strongest US entertainment companies.
A lawyer, Mr Wells joined the Warner Brothers film studios in 1969 and was
vice-chairman there before moving to Disney 10 years ago.
He took a back-seat role to the younger Mr Eisner. However, Mr Wells was
credited as one of the most weighty of the new management team, exerting
considerable influence over the renaissance of the company.
Despite its EuroDisney trauma, the company has expanded its film, television
and theme park activities in the past decade, raising its annual revenues
from Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) to Dollars 8.5bn.
Mr Eisner yesterday paid tribute to Mr Wells's 'wisdom, charm, zest for
experience and challenge, (and) his naked and awesome intelligence.'
Analysts said that Disney had one of the strongest executive groups of any
company in its industry, and that the death did not leave the group's
management seriously weakened.

FT  05 APR 94 / US plans tight curb on salmon fishing
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US fishery regulators will meet today in California to discuss a proposal
for an almost complete ban on Pacific salmon fishing this year.
The measure represents a drastic attempt to stem the decline in stocks of
Pacific salmon species such as coho, chinook and sockeye, which once
provided an apparently inexhaustible resource to the native American tribes
of the Pacific north-west.
The Pacific Fishery Management Council, a federal regulatory body, has
already imposed severe restrictions on commercial and sport fishing for
salmon but, at its meeting today near San Francisco, it will consider a
complete ban on ocean fishing in 1994, allowing only limited fishing inland.
But fishery experts say even these cuts in fishing would do little to save
the region's salmon stocks, many of which have been driven close to
extinction by logging, farming and construction damage to the streams in
which they spawn, as well as by the north-west's many dams, often without
fish ladders to enable the salmon to climb upstream.
Only the Snake River sockeye has been officially listed as an endangered
species, while the same river's chinook is listed as threatened.
But, according to a recent report compiled by the Wilderness Society, wild
salmon stocks in the Pacific north-west have fallen to 20 per cent of their
historical levels, and only pink salmon, among the region's ten major
species, are not in decline.
The Wilderness Society said coho, chum, sockeye and spring- and summer-run
chinook salmon, as well as summer-run steelhead and sea-run cutthroat trout,
are in danger across a wide area.
Autumn chinook and winter steelhead are in slightly better condition, but
are still threatened in much of California, southern Oregon and the Columbia
Basin.

FT  05 APR 94 / EU and US try to remove trade hurdles: A race against time
to open up public purchases to competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union and US officials are meeting this week to try to agree
concessions central to fleshing out last year's accord in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to liberalise the world's public procurement
markets.
If they succeed, they will give a big boost to plans to open up to
international competition contracts worth more than Dollars 300bn a year.
But if they fail to resolve differences over market access, fresh trade
tensions could erupt even before the agreement takes effect at the start of
1996.
The EU and the US have already joined other industrialised powers in
agreeing to bring public procurement of goods and services more firmly
within Gatt and have made offers to open their markets further. Though the
offers cannot be withdrawn, the two have yet to agree to extend the full
benefits to each other. This week's talks, in Brussels, aim at securing
improvements covering procurement by utilities and buyers below central
government level.
Such improvements would, in principle, also be offered to other signatories
of the Gatt procurement code. But time is running short. Though public
procurement is not formally part of the Uruguay Round, the US insists a deal
with the EU must be reached by April 15 to be approved under the 'fast
track' voting procedure, under which Congress votes on trade pacts without
amendment.
But though US-EU negotiations to date have made some progress, hurdles
remain. Both sides believe last-minute horse-trading will be needed by Mr
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, European trade
commissioner, at this month's Gatt ministerial meeting in Marrakesh,
Morocco. If no agreement is reached there, Brussels fears the EU could
become an early target for unilateral US trade sanctions under its recently
revived Super 301 provision for retaliation against unfair trade practices.
Washington denies it is threatening such action.
The Clinton administration is pressing the EU to end rules which favour
European suppliers in tenders for telecommunications and power generation
equipment. The rules give European companies a 3 per cent price preference
and allow bids with less than 50 per cent EU content to be ignored.
The US believes its suppliers are particularly competitive in these
industries and says EU markets are more closed than its own. It claims
European manufacturers have 13 per cent of the US public telephone exchange
market, while US suppliers have only 1.5 per cent of Europe's market.
But Brussels insists it will drop the preferential policy only if the US
first does more to liberalise public procurement by individual states.
Washington last week went some way towards this goal by increasing from 24
to 36 the number of states which, it says, are prepared to drop rules which
exclude non-US - and, in some cases, all out-of-state - companies from
bidding for public contracts.
However, the EU wants more. As well as demanding that still further states
be added to the list, it is stepping up pressure on the Clinton
administration to phase out restrictions on state procurement imposed by the
Buy American provisions of US law.
The provisions, a relic of 1930s protectionism, exclude foreign suppliers
from contracts for federally funded state public works programmes, such as
highway and mass transit projects. However, the US has so far shied away
from committing itself in a congressional election year to repeal
legislation which guarantees orders for domestic industries.
Its growing defensiveness has encouraged Brussels to believe it has gained
the initiative in negotiations. 'The US cannot reasonably criticise us over
preferential rules while so much of their market remains closed to foreign
suppliers,' an EU official said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prospects for US manufacturing industry remained rosy in March, according to
a monthly survey of purchasing managers, published yesterday.
The National Association of Purchasing Managers' index rose to 56.7 per cent
in March, compared with 56.6 per cent in February. The index has now
remained above 50 per cent since last summer.
Helping to ease inflation fears in the bond market yesterday, the NAPM's
prices index, which is not included in its overall index, dropped to 64.2
from 67.0 in February.
But the association's assessment of new orders rose last month, while output
rebounded strongly after a weather-related decline in February.
The production index reached 64.0 per cent, the highest level in more than
six years.
'This continuing strong growth of orders, coupled with exceptionally low
inventory levels, should sustain solid economic growth for the immediate
future,' said Mr Robert Bretz, director of corporate purchasing at Pitney
Bowes and head of the NAPM's business survey committee.
Financial market economists also said the index pointed to continuing
growth.
'The March NAPM performance gives some sign that the sharp surge in
manufacturing activity since last summer, spurred on by strength in the
automotive sector, is starting to plateau - but plateau at a very solid
level of expansion,' said Mr Joseph Liro, an economist at SG Warburg in New
York.

FT  05 APR 94 / Bank branch opens as Palestinian self-rule nears
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of Jordan yesterday became the first commercial bank to begin
operations in the Israeli-occupied territories since the signing of the
peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
The bank opened a branch in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
Mr Tawfik Fakhouri, chairman of the bank, said in Amman that the branch
would have a staff of 42 and 'offer all normal banking services, including
interest-bearing deposits, loans and letters of credit to the Palestinians'.
It will deal in both the Jordanian dinar and Israeli shekel, along with
other currencies. Further branches are planned soon in Hebron, Jericho,
Jenin, Bethlehem, Qalkilya and Gaza.
The green light for Jordanian banks to reopen branches in the occupied
territories, which were closed after the 1967 war, was given in a memorandum
signed by Jordan and Israel last December. A further agreement by Jordan and
the PLO was finalised earlier this year and gave the Central Bank of Jordan
the job of supervising and monitoring the new branches.
The Jordanian-Palestinian deal stipulates that banks in the occupied
territories operate solely under Jordanian law, but banks must also comply
with the Israeli monetary authorities which issue the licence. 'We will be
reporting directly to the Central Bank of Jordan but also submitting monthly
balance sheets and the like to the Bank of Israel,' explained Mr Fayez
Abulien, general manager of the Bank of Jordan.
Some bankers in Amman have reservations about operating in the West Bank.
'Since the intifada (Palestinian uprising) began, a culture of non-repayment
has grown up and bad debts will certainly be a problem,' said one banker.

FT  05 APR 94 / Plans for peace summit of political leaders revived in S
Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Plans for a peace summit of South Africa's main political leaders have been
revived amid fears that the new state of emergency in Natal may not be able
to contain violence, Patti Waldmeir and Michael Holman report in
Johannesburg.
Top politicians - including African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela,
President F W de Klerk and Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi
 -appear to have discussed the meeting when they attended an Easter Sunday
church service in northern Transvaal.
Mr Mandela said afterwards that the peace summit, which was to have taken
place last week, would be held on Friday.
The death toll in Natal province since the state of emergency was imposed on
Thursday stood last night at 61. In one of the worst weekend incidents, nine
people, including a baby and five children, died on Saturday when a gang
fired on a rural home near Port Shepstone. The family were said to be ANC
supporters.
South African defence forces were deployed in Natal since the imposition of
the state of emergency in the province. A combination of the Easter holiday
and a quiet response to the move by Chief Buthlezi, chief minister of
KwaZulu homeland and the Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini may have helped eased
tension.
Mr Mandela said last Thursday that he expected the controversial KwaZulu
police force to be confined to barracks but the 4,000-strong force has been
allowed to continue normal duties. The chain of command remains unclear and
security force chiefs have referred the question back to Pretoria.
Meanwhile, Chief Buthlezi's Inkatha Freedom Party appeared to be picking up
support in Natal, according to the last public opinion poll allowed before
the general election on April 27-29. A poll for the Johannesburg Sunday
Times suggests that, if Inkatha had not boycotted the election, it would
have been neck and neck with the ANC for control of Natal.
The poll was conducted before the imposition of the emergency.
National support for the ANC had fallen from 40.9 per cent last November to
31.9 per cent in March, the poll reported. Backing for Inkatha had risen
from 18.7 per cent to 27.5 per cent.
The paper suggests Inkatha's advance may be due to the entry in the
political arena of the Zulu king with a demand for recognition of the Zulu
nation.

FT  05 APR 94 / Sophistication and a sort of stability come late to Soweto:
On a visit to South Africa's most famous township, Patti Waldmeir sounded
surprising opinions and sensed an indomitable spirit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR

<TEXT>
SoWeTo stands for South Western Townships. It is less a name than a set of
geographical co-ordinates for the greatest labour camp created in the name
of apartheid.
But even apartheid was not strong enough to suppress the life force of this
township-city of 3m people, which sprawls near Johannesburg and now, on the
eve of the new South Africa, is making a rapid, if belated, entry to the
twentieth century.
Within days, cellular telephones will be installed in Soweto's famous 'black
taxis', the minibuses which catapult hundreds of thousands of commuters the
30km to Johannesburg each day. Soweto's first luxury hotel opened recently,
its 28 rooms the only ones available in this city the size of Chicago. In
Soweto, you can play golf, sweat through aerobics, get your hair
straightened, and give your money away to accountants, dentists, lawyers,
doctors (and drug dealers).
In other words, you can live in Soweto - just what apartheid's geographers
were most determined to prevent. They wanted to design a township so
unpleasant and inconvenient that no-one would wish to settle there, thus
keeping Johannesburg safe for whites. For decades, shopping, drinking,
getting keys cut or clothes cleaned was in effect illegal in Soweto.
Licences were granted for only a tiny handful of shops. Others operated
illegally but were often shut down by police raids. There were almost no
amenities - there are few enough today - and transport to town was slow and
inconvenient, before deregulation in the 1980s led to the thriving 'black
taxi' and its more flexible service.
So Soweto rose above apartheid's design to become the most sophisticated
black community in South Africa. That sophistication is not just economic,
it is political. During a recent visit to the township, random conversations
with pedestrians and shop-owners turned up few who said they were going to
vote for the African National Congress. Opinion polls give the ANC at least
60 per cent of the national vote so this was surprising.
Perhaps it is only natural to find more political heterogeneity in a
community which is older, more settled, and more middle-class than almost
any other black township in South Africa. Unlike many of the country's other
townships, thrown together as millions moved to the cities illegally in the
1980s, urbanisation in Soweto goes back three or four generations. People
there have left behind the rigid tribal life of rural areas, where
individual preference gives way before communal choice. They make up their
own minds and are well-educated enough to believe that their vote is secret.
Political tolerance is a fragile flower but here, as elsewhere, the ruling
National Party is at least able to operate an office in Soweto (on the floor
just above the ANC headquarters, in one of the townships's only office
buildings).
At the Alex Hair Salon, where Mr Alfred Motshabi, the manager, is offering a
pre-election special on hair care, the NP has a natural constituency of
professionals and African yuppies. Mr Motshabi says that, from overhearing
his clients' conversations, he would guess that only a small minority will
vote ANC and many will vote NP. At the Blue Fountain, Soweto's most famous
nightclub, Mr Jeffrey Moloi (son and partner of Mr Godfrey Moloi, the owner)
says many of the bar's patrons will vote for the National Party. 'I
overheard a client say the other day that (President F W) de Klerk has built
bridges in South Africa - what has (ANC leader Nelson) Mandela built?'
Mr Toby Makwakwa tells a more sinister story of political heterogeneity. He
owns a string of businesses, including two car dealerships, a fast food
shop, a spares and vehicle repair centre, and has a share of a cellular
telephone consortium. He says he pays protection money to all the political
parties (except the National Party, which is probably too frightened to
demand it).
'We give,' he says simply, to the ANC, the black-supremacist Pan-Africanist
Congress, the Azanian People's Organisation (which is so radical it is
boycotting the elections). 'We must give or we'll be put on the black list
and then they'll vandalise our business,' he explains, though noting with
pleasure that this political levy has come down sharply since the chaos of
the late-1980s when Soweto was part of the great revolt against apartheid -
yet another sign of returning stability.
Apartheid's legacy is apparent, even so. Gesturing at the top-of-the-range
executive cars crowded onto the showroom floor of Toby's Ford, Toby admits:
'People have certain perceptions that, if you buy a car from a black
businessman maybe it will be defective. But those are just perceptions,' he
adds, saying he has no intention of leaving Soweto, though he clearly could
afford to do so.
Mr Jeffrey Moloi agrees: 'If we all move to Sandton (a posh white suburb),
Soweto will be dead. Who's going to lead the people we leave behind?'
Anyway, he adds, he likes Soweto: 'It's big and so many things are
happening. We have so many famous people in Soweto.'
Mr Moloi has ample reason to like Soweto: his family has major business
interests and his father recently built a R2m (Pounds 400,000) house there.
The endorsement of Ms Blessing Mhlongo, shop assistant and supporter of the
Pan-Africanist Congress is simpler: 'It's nice, Soweto'. She only hopes that
a post-apartheid government will make it just that little bit nicer.

FT  05 APR 94 / Kuwait debtors register in repayment scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
About 6,000 Kuwaitis owing KD5.5bn (Dollars 18.5bn) in domestic debt, some
more than a decade old, have met a March 31 deadline to register for
repayment under a government-backed scheme to settle the Gulf state's
'difficult debts', according to Mr Nasser al-Rodhan, the finance minister.
A further 3,500 debtors owing KD900m (Dollars 3bn) missed the deadline and
could be excluded from the settlement programme entirely, under existing
law.
The 'difficult debts' were incurred by investors on Kuwait's unofficial
stock exchange, known as the Souk al-Manakh, which collapsed in August 1982,
leaving some KD7bn of net indebtedness. Since then, a few have repaid under
an earlier and now defunct settlement programme.
Under the latest settlement programme, which was passed by Kuwait's National
Assembly last year and is designed to clear the debts once and for all,
debtors who failed to register by March 31 could face government prosecution
in the courts and be made to pay what they owe in full, plus interest.
However, it is more likely that the law regulating settlement of the debt
will be amended, according to a report in Kuwait's al-Watan newspaper
quoting Mr al-Rodhan.
The aggregate debt figure of Dollars 21.5bn given by the finance minister is
Dollars 4.5bn more than the total Souk al-Manakh debt figure previously
given.
It is nearly Dollars 2bn more than the debt paid in July 1992 by the
government when it bought all personal and corporate debt from the private
sector from the country's banks in return for a record and one-off issue of
government bonds.
Mr al-Rodhan's figure is thought to represent gross indebtedness, including
some debts which do not revert to the Souk al-Manakh disaster.

FT  05 APR 94 / Import slowdown narrows trade gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's current account deficit fell to Dollars 23.4bn (Pounds 16bn) last
year, after a rapid increase in non-oil exports and slowdown in the growth
of imports.
The newly independent central bank also disclosed in its annual report that
reserves last year rose to Dollars 24.54bn, Dollars 6bn more than at the end
of 1992. Foreign investment reached a record Dollars 33.33bn in 1993, of
which Dollars 28.43bn was portfolio investment, and the rest direct
investment in plant and machinery.
The figures were released amidst further weakness in Mexico's stock market
and exchange rate, as foreign and domestic investors appeared concerned by
the rise in long-term bond rates in the US. The stock market fell by 6 per
cent yesterday to a new low for the year, while the peso weakened to 3.36
against the dollar, after opening at 3.35.
'You have a severe correction throughout Latin America in response to higher
bond yields in the US and falls in Wall Street,' said Mr Geoffrey Dennis,
head of emerging market research at Bear Stearns.
While Mexico's current account deficit was slightly less than the Dollars
24.8bn revised deficit for 1992, it accounted for 7 per cent of Mexico's
gross domestic product. The slowdown in increase of imports last year is
mainly attributed to the weak economy. As growth picks up, the deficit is
expected to rise again.

FT  05 APR 94 / Quiet debut for new China market: Trading volumes light on
foreign exchange's first official day of operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
China's interbank currency market made a quiet debut yesterday on its first
official day of trading, with the yuan exchange rate fluctuating in a narrow
band and eventually closing at Yn8.69 to the dollar.
Trading volumes were light, said an official of the Shanghai-based National
Foreign Exchange Trading Centre, which has been operating experimentally
since early March.
Foreign bankers said they were still seeking details of ground-rules for the
operations of the new market, including its relationship with the some 100
currency 'swap centres' countrywide that it was meant to replace.
Bankers were critical of what they regarded as a step back from the currency
reforms announced in late December. These foreshadowed the early phasing out
of the swap markets used by joint venture companies to exchange local and
foreign currency.
Chinese banking officials described the retention of the swap market system
as 'transitional' until the national interbank market was fully operational.
This may take some time since a national electronic dealing network is far
from complete.
The new Shanghai market, which is designed to facilitate moves towards full
convertibility of the yuan, is linked to exchanges in five larger cities -
Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hangzhou.
A foreign banker in Shanghai said that the new interbank market was
effectively a 'three-in-one' market. It would serve for the time being as a
'swap centre' for joint ventures, an interbank market for Chinese
institutions and as a market for foreign banks restricted to selling foreign
currency on behalf of Chinese customers. Joint venture customers are being
confined to swap centre trading for the time being in an apparent attempt to
lessen pressures on the market in its early phase.
Bankers praised moves towards a genuine market. 'The most important thing is
that the People's Bank of China (China's central bank) has decided to allow
the yuan to fluctuate - to find its true value,' said one.
Bankers are predicting a possible depreciation of about 10 per cent in the
value of the Chinese currency to Yn9.5 to the dollar by the end of the year.
But they also warn that if efforts fail to dampen inflation, currently
running at more than 20 per cent in the larger cities, the yuan may well
depreciate by a larger amount.
China unified its rates of exchange at the beginning of this year,
abolishing its official managed exchange rate of about Yn5.7 to the dollar.
It adopted the prevailing swap market rate of about Yn8.7 to the dollar as
the new rate.
The authorities, in the initial phase of the new interbank market, are
restricting fluctuations to 2.5 to 3 per 1000 to counter a possible sharp
depreciation. They say this step will be temporary.
Rates applying in the swap centre will track the weighted average in the
interbank market. This follows objections by bankers to an initial Chinese
proposal that the rate applied to swaps should be that prevailing at the
close of trading on the previous day.

FT  05 APR 94 / Fears as Indian inflation hits 9.9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's inflation has risen to an annual rate of 9.9 per cent, prompting
fears that it could climb above the politically sensitive 10 per cent level
and provoke attacks on the government's economic liberalisation policies.
The data, released on Sunday, refer to the rate of increase in wholesale
prices for the week ending March 19, the latest period for which figures are
available.
Inflation has risen sharply in the past year from a recent low of 6.7 per
cent, due partly to increases in government administered prices of basic
commodities such as food and fuels and partly by a rapid rise in the money
supply.
The increases in administered prices from artificially low levels are a
central element of economic reform, which includes decontrolling prices and
reducing subsidies.
The rise in the money supply has two principal causes - larger-than-planned
government borrowing and the inflow of foreign exchange into India.
According to officials at the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, the
money supply has risen by about 17 per cent in the year to the end of March
1994, compared with a target of 12 per cent.
The government has said it could drive down prices by releasing low-priced
food from its official stocks and by spending some of its Dollars 15bn
(Pounds 10.2bn) of foreign exchange reserves to import essential
commodities.
Such policies could help the poor, who are most vulnerable to prices
increases, but they may not hold down inflation in prices of industrial
goods.
Also, the increase in the inflation rate could force the postponement of
future interest rate cuts.
Officials are concerned that the inflation rate is hovering at about 10 per
cent when the general climate for prices in India is favourable.
International oil prices and interest rates are low and India's farmers have
had six good monsoons in succession. An unexpected deterioration in this
price climate could well raise the inflation rate further.
Another worry is that the economy is growing at only a moderate pace - an
estimated 3.8 per cent for the year ending March 1994. If growth
accelerates, as the government hopes, the upward pressure on prices could
also increase.

The US State Department yesterday labelled Nigeria as a major drug
trafficking country, bringing an immediate halt to US aid, writes George
Graham in Washington.
Nigeria joins Burma, Iran and Syria on the State Department's list of major
drug producing or trafficking countries that are failing to co-operate in
international drug control efforts.
The US suspended most of its Dollars 32m aid programme to Nigeria last year,
after military leaders annulled a presidential election and seized power.
Under the terms of the Foreign Assistance Act, it will now also deny
Export-Import Bank financing and vote against loans to Nigeria from the
multilateral development banks. Mr Robert Gelbard, assistant secretary of
state for international narcotics affairs, said Nigerian drug couriers
accounted for 35 to 40 per cent of the heroin coming into the US.

FT  05 APR 94 / S Korean economy to grow by 6.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea's leading private economic institutes predict that the economy
will grow by at least 6.5 per cent this year, up from 5.6 per cent in 1993,
writes John Burton from Seoul.
The greater growth is attributed mainly to increased industrial investments
and higher domestic consumption.
Companies are adding production capacity due to a surge in exports caused by
the weakness of the Korean won, the currency, against the Japanese yen and
by stronger demand in its biggest overseas markets, including the US, Japan
and China.
The central bank, however, warns that the current account, which posted a
slight surplus of Dollars 450m (Pounds 305m) in 1993, may fall into a
deficit again this year as imports increased due to stronger domestic
demand. The brisk economic activity is also reviving fears of inflation,
which reached 5.8 per cent in 1993, the bank said yesterday.

FT  05 APR 94 / Japan plans to link cable TV services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's ministry of posts and telecommunications is drawing up a plan to
bring together the country's fragmented cable television operations as a
nation-wide network which could provide a full range of multimedia services.
The move is to help build up an information super-highway and spur the
market for multimedia services.
'We believe that building a (nation-wide) cable TV network will enable
advanced services to be realised and that this could eventually become a
full service network,' an official said.
Such a network could also provide significant competition to NTT, the
privatised telecommunications company which still has a virtual monopoly of
Japanese domestic telecommunications services.
The ministry's decision to support the building of more extensive cable TV
networks reflects a growing recognition of the role cable TV is likely to
play in providing multimedia services, such as video-on-demand.
Until recently, ministry regulations had hampered the growth of cable TV in
Japan, leaving the country behind the US in building an information
super-highway.
In particular, a ministry guideline that required cable TV operators to be
locally capitalised had left the industry fragmented, under-funded and
unprofitable.
The latest ministry plan aims to overcome these problems by encouraging
operators to co-operate and extend coverage. The ministry would provide
support in making standard the systems used by different cable companies so
that they could be linked.
Last month Tokyo Electric Power, the country's biggest electric utility,
Tokyu, a railway company, and two trading companies, all of which have cable
TV interests, linked so as to provide multimedia services on cable.
Japan's first fast breeder nuclear reactor is due to go critical today - the
stage where a nuclear chain reaction becomes self-sustaining, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Monju reactor in Fukui, eastern Japan, has been under development since
1985 at a cost of some Y600bn (Pounds 3.8bn). It is to be one of the main
pillars of Japan's plutonium programme.
The launch of Monju, named after a Buddhist saint, comes almost 20 years
after similar facilities in the UK and France, and as international concern
about nuclear proliferation is increasing.

FT  05 APR 94 / More arrests after Mexico assassination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The office of Mexico's attorney-general has arrested three more people for
alleged involvement in the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio,
presidential candidate of the governing Institutional Revolutionary party
(PRI).
The arrests bring to five the number detained on suspicion of murder or of
conspiracy to murder in the Colosio case. The attorney-general's office is
also looking for two more people whom it suspects of involvement in the
assassination, which took place at a campaign rally in Tijuana last month.
The two have yet to be identified.
An official in the investigation said the evidence definitely showed a
concerted effort to kill Mr Colosio. The government will not comment on
conspiracy theories, and no evidence has emerged to link the alleged killers
previously arrested to organised groups. However, it has been variously
suggested in the Mexican press that drug traffickers, members of the PRI or
radical political groups planned the murder.
The new suspects are Mr Vicente Mayoral, his son and a former state
policeman, Mr Rodolfo Mayoral, and Mr Rodolfo Rivapalacio, a PRI official
who helped to organise security for Mr Colosio when the candidate was in
Tijuana, and who employed some of the suspects to control crowds.
The police had already arrested Mr Mario Aburto, a 23-year-old mechanic, for
the murder of Mr Colosio, and Mr Tranquilino Sanchez, for abetting the
assassination. Mr Aburto, who has been identified by witnesses as the man
who fired the fatal shots, has confessed to the crime. Mr Sanchez, like Mr
Vicente Mayoral, had been employed by Mr Rivapalacio to control crowds at
the rally in Tijuana.
The new arrests are largely based on video and photographic evidence, which
appear to show some of the suspects helping the presumed assassin gain
access to Mr Colosio, and others blocking the path of the candidate and his
bodyguards. The video-tape also shows some of the suspects talking with the
alleged assassin before the murder.
Mr Jose Cordoba, President Carlos Salinas's powerful chief of staff, became
the latest political casualty of the aftermath of the assassination when he
was forced to resign last week. Mr Cordoba, seen as an unofficial
vice-president of Mexico, has been appointed the country's representative at
the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington.
The enormous power exercised by Mr Cordoba, French-born son of Spanish
immigrants who became a Mexican a decade ago, was much resented by many
government officials and widely attacked by the press. The attacks on him
threatened to hurt the campaign and image of his close friend and ally, Mr
Ernesto Zedillo, the PRI's new presidential candidate.
Reports suggested that party officials had demanded Mr Cordoba's resignation
as the price for supporting Mr Zedillo.
His presence is likely to be missed by Mr Salinas for Mr Cordoba has been
crucial in formulating economic policy and political strategy over the past
six years, and he was a proponent of the North American Free Trade
Agreement.

FT  05 APR 94 / A swashbuckling player no longer: The declining fortunes of
Malaysia's Bank Negara
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For several years Bank Negara, Malaysia's central bank, has been known as
one of the more swashbuckling players in the world's foreign exchange
markets. Not any more.
At the end of last week, Bank Negara disclosed that it had lost more than
MDollars 5.7bn (Pounds 1.45bn) through foreign currency transactions last
year. In 1992, the bank was out of pocket by more than MDollars 9bn after
similar ill-judged forays into foreign exchange markets.
Like a down-at-heel punter finally admitting the error of his ways, Bank
Negara has announced its withdrawal from the big-time forex business.
The losses have sent shock waves through Malaysia's financial community. Mr
Jaffar Hussein, Bank Negara's governor, has been forced to resign. Other
heads are likely to roll.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, prime minister, has said Bank Negara's losses will not
have an adverse effect on the national economy. 'Even in business, there are
times when losses are incurred,' he said.
Others are not so sanguine. Opposition politicians have described the news
from Bank Negara as 'the greatest financial scandal in Malaysian history'.
Bank Negara itself has admitted that the forex losses of more than MDollars
15bn during the past two years could have rendered it technically insolvent
but for the financial backing of the government.
Mr Jaffar, who will stay on until early May, has taken full responsibility
for the losses. 'In the absence of perfect hindsight, mistakes will be made:
indeed, mistakes were made' said Mr Jaffar. 'When I realised the extent of
the losses, we started to unwind the whole thing . . . an unfortunate
chapter in the bank's history is now closed.'
Mr Jaffar is one of the country's most respected bankers. Under his
nine-year stewardship of the central bank Malaysia's banking sector has been
radically overhauled.
Many feel Mr Jaffar has been made a scapegoat. They say ultimate
responsibility rests high up in government. The government should not have
allowed its central bank to indulge in large-scale forex trading.
In the mid-1980s Malaysia tried, and failed, to corner the world tin market.
'The government had massive losses then but didn't learn,' said a foreign
banker based in Singapore. 'A central bank should be the custodian of the
country's currency. I can't believe the finance ministry did not know what
was going on. It must have encouraged the bank to become one of the big time
players in the forex market.'
One of the ironies of recent events is that Bank Negara has recently been
battling to drive speculators out of the Malaysian dollar market. At the
same time the bank itself is accused of being a speculator in other
currencies.
Bank Negara began stalking the forex markets in the late 1980s. The good
times came to an end in 1992 when the bank went heavily into sterling and
the D-Mark. The consequences were disastrous. The European Monetary System
crisis erupted. In 1992, the Malaysian dollar appreciated by nearly 30 per
cent against the pound and by more than 11 per cent against the D-Mark.
The 1992 losses - amounting to MDollars 9.3bn - were only disclosed after
some energetic prodding by economists and journalists. Bank Negara said it
did not want to disclose the size and details of the loss as this might have
endangered the bank's position in the forex market. Anyway, said bank
officials, the 93 per cent plunge in special reserve and contingency funds
shown in the bank's accounts was 'only a paper loss'.
Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the finance minister and deputy prime minister, told
parliament he was satisfied there had been no mismanagement at Bank Negara.
'I have confidence in the integrity of Bank Negara in managing the country's
reserves,' said Mr Anwar last year.
The opposition compared the affair to an early 1980s scandal when Bank
Bumiputra, a state bank, had lost millions of dollars through lending to
speculators in the Hong Kong property market. The opposition said the 1992
forex losses were four or five times bigger than those incurred by Bank
Bumiputra. Calls for an inquiry were rejected.
Presenting its 1993 accounts, Bank Negara decided to come clean. It said
most of the 1993 losses were the result of costs incurred in unwinding
forward postions adopted in the previous year. Bank officials rejected
criticism that they had been too adventurous. 'Our reputation is
exaggerated,' said one bank official. 'You have to do something to preserve
the value of your currency. You have to be in the market. You cannot simply
sit on your hands and do nothing.'
Bank Negara said all forward forex trading positions had been unwound and
that the bank in future would confine itself to spot trading in managing its
international reserves.
The central bank also announced its first ever net operating loss, of
MDollars 712m for 1993, mainly caused by the costs of mopping up the very
large amounts of foreign funds that had flooded into the country. The funds,
attracted by Malaysia's strong economic growth and soaring stock market,
threatened to unleash an inflationary spiral unless they were stopped from
entering the financial system.
While Bank Negara appears to have made a clean slate of things, there are
still some unanswered questions. A main point of interest is what happened
in the last days of 1993 when the Malaysian dollar fell by more than 5 per
cent against a basket of currencies.
Analysts say Bank Negara was behind the fall in the currency: it sold large
amounts of the Malaysian unit and bought dollars. The move improved the 1993
accounts by raising the value of foreign currency in Malaysian dollar terms.
It is estimated that, without this fancy accounting footwork, forex losses
in the 1993 accounts would have been up to MDollars 3bn higher.
The bank has admitted that there were internal deficiencies in the way forex
trading was monitored. The head of the forex trading department, the number
three in the bank hierarchy, is said to be 'on long leave'.
But is Bank Negara the only one responsible for the losses? Critics say
senior government figures were a party to what was going on.
Mr Daim Zainuddin was Malaysia's finance minister for much of the 1980s. Mr
Daim, a close confidant of the prime minister, is one of the country's most
influential and wealthy businessmen. He is also a special economic adviser
to the government.
'It's a huge loss,' said Mr Daim. 'I would like to forget about it . . .
those responsible have resigned.'
Not everyone would agree.

FT  05 APR 94 / S Korean economy expected to grow by 6.5%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea's leading private economic institutes predict that the economy
will grow by at least 6.5 per cent this year, up from 5.6 per cent in 1993.
The greater growth is attributed mainly to increased industrial investments
and higher domestic consumption.
Companies are adding production capacity due to a surge in exports caused by
the weakness of the Korean won, the currency, against the Japanese yen and
by stronger demand in its biggest overseas markets, including the US, Japan
and China.
The central bank, however, warns that the current account, which posted a
slight surplus of Dollars 450m (Pounds 305m) in 1993, may fall into a
deficit again this year as imports increased due to stronger domestic
demand.
Last year's surplus was the first since 1989.
The brisk economic activity is also reviving fears of inflation, which
reached 5.8 per cent in 1993, the central bank announced yesterday.
It was among the highest in Asia, although down from 6.2 per cent in 1992.
The Korean economy has steadily recovered since 1992, when gross national
product growth fell to 4.7 per cent, the lowest since 1980.
The Samsung Economic Research Institute predicts that GNP will increase by
6.5 per cent this year.
Other institutes are more optimistic, with the Hyundai Research Institute
expecting GNP growth of 7.3 per cent.

FT  05 APR 94 / Monju fast breeder reactor at crucial stage

<TEXT>
Japan's first fast breeder nuclear reactor is due to go critical today - the
stage where a nuclear chain reaction becomes self-sustaining.
The Monju reactor in Fukui, eastern Japan, has been under development since
1985 at a cost of some Y600bn (Pounds 3.8bn). It is to be one of the main
pillars of Japan's plutonium programme. The launch of Monju, named after a
Buddhist saint, comes almost 20 years after similar facilities in the UK and
France, and as international concern about nuclear proliferation is
increasing. Some analysts fear Monju's launch will give North Korea an
excuse to produce plutonium, while some US critics have suggested Japan
wants to build up its own nuclear arms.
The Japanese government has indicated its long-standing commitment to its
nuclear fuel recycling programme, originally established in the 1950s.
Japan, which lacks its own source of energy, has regarded plutonium, as the
'dream energy source'.
But faced with increasing international pressure, the glut in uranium, the
high cost of using plutonium, and protests from local residents in building
new nuclear reactors, government officials have recently suggested that it
would postpone some of its plutonium development programme.

FT  05 APR 94 / France in talks on submarine sales to Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, said yesterday that France was
holding talks with Islamabad about selling French submarines to Pakistan,
Reuter reports from New Delhi.
'Yes, we are having discussions on the proposed sale to Pakistan,' Mr Juppe
said during a visit to the Indian capital. He declined to identify the
submarines France could sell to Pakistan.
India has fought three wars with Pakistan since both countries became
independent from Britain in 1947 and officials said the proposed sale would
strain relations with France.
'Any sale of submarines to Pakistan would raise the already high temperature
very drastically,' an Indian diplomat said. 'We don't believe anyone
supplying them to Pakistan is truly working for peace.'
Mr Juppe denied reports that France was planning to sell Mirage 2000
warplanes to Pakistan.
Pakistani officials say privately that Islamabad would want to buy the
French aircraft if a stalled deal with Washington for 38 US-built F-16s does
not materialise soon.
Senior US officials recently offered to revive the deal with Pakistan by
making a one-time exception to a US law that bars Washington from supplying
arms to Islamabad because Pakistan is suspected of having a nuclear arms
programme.
Mr Juppe, the first French foreign minister to visit New Delhi in seven
years, said he had failed to persuade Indian officials to change their views
on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which India has refused to
sign.
'France is for the renewal of NPT (next year) without any new conditions.
India continues to thinks differently,' he said.
Under the NPT treaty, all of India's nuclear facilities would have to be
opened to international monitoring.
But India says the treaty, which aims to control the spread of nuclear
knowhow, favours countries which possess nuclear arms while discriminating
against others.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund has agreed to an increase in Cambodia's
share to 65m special drawing rights (Pounds 60.5m). This that could let
Cambodia borrow the equivalent of as much as Dollars 370m from various IMF
loan facilities.
Cambodia's IMF quota had been stuck at SDR25m since 1970 because its
isolation from the international financial community had left it out of
several quota increases.
With IMF membership reinstated six months ago, Cambodia has already borrowed
about Dollars 9m from the IMF's systemic transformation facility, which is a
loan account designed to help former communist countries.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial production in west Germany will rise by 2 per cent this year
thanks to rising foreign demand, according to the latest economic report
from the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute.
The report, which supports an increasingly widespread view that the economy
has seen the worst of the recession, points to a revival in the motor
vehicle, electronics, engineering and chemical sectors, all of which are
heavily dependent on the export market.
Economists suggest that a year of cost-cutting measures and wage restraint
have helped make west German industrial products more competitive on the
world market.
Ifo said new orders were up 2 per cent from November 1993 to January this
year, compared with the first quarter of 1993. Foreign orders rose 7.5 per
cent over the same period.
The institute expects the growth in foreign demand to prompt a 5 per cent
increase in car production this year, following a 20 per cent fall in 1993.
It also forecasts growth in the electronics sector of 2-3 per cent, compared
with a fall of 6.5 per cent last year; and 3 per cent growth in the chemical
sector, after a 2 per cent decline last year.
However, recovery in the engineering sector will remain sluggish, with 1 per
cent growth in production forecast from a low base. Engineering output fell
by 12 per cent in 1993.
Economists emphasise, however, that the rate of recovery will depend on the
speed in which other European Union countries emerge from the recession, as
well as continuing efforts by industry to reduce labour unit costs.
DIW, the Berlin-based Institute for Economic Research, has even forecast a
0.5 per cent contraction this year, contrary to the government's
expectations of growth of 1-1.5 per cent.

ITALY
Italians like winners. Even if they do not back them, they are quick to
recognise them.
With few exceptions, the Italian media did not expect Mr Silvio Berlusconi
and his Forza Italia movement to come out on top in last week's elections.
But as results came in they moved with considerable speed to correct this
error - not least at the state-run RAI broadcasting network where many now
fear for their jobs as a result of the sceptical tone reserved for Mr
Berlusconi throughout the election campaign.
Mr Berlusconi's position as the man most likely to head the next government
has seen the media magnate and three-month-old politician treated with a new
respect.
Not once in the wake of the elections has he been referred to by the once
oft-used nickname 'Il biscione' - the colloquial name of a viper. Instead he
has been regaled as 'Il Cavaliere' - the knight.
Leading the shift away from scepticism to respect has been Corriere della
Serra, which has always regarded itself as the weather-vane of sensible
opinion. Mr Paolo Mieli, the editor, took the view that Mr Berlusconi and
his friends in the right-wing Freedom Alliance were obliged by the sheer
scale of their victory to form the next government.
'It is now up to Berlusconi to maintain his campaign promises,' wrote Mr
Mieli. 'We read on his lips: 'less taxes and one million jobs without cost
to the state'. So now we would either like to be able to thank him or pass
him the bill if he fails to keep his promises.'
Mr Berlusconi's arch enemies, the daily Repubblica and its weekly
stable-mate, L'Espresso, have also begun to lower their aggression a few
notches. The old venom remains, but there is an element of wait and see from
veteran Repubblica editor Eugenio Scalfari, who spectacularly misread the
mood of the nation.
L'Espresso's cover contented itself with the ironic title 'Goal]' - likening
the Berlusconi victory to that of his AC Milan football team. Inside, the
magazine reserved some space for the shape of things to come by alleging
links between Mr Marcello Dell'Utri, one of Mr Berlusconi's closest
associates, and the Sicilian mafia.
In contrast, the other main weekly, Panorama, now controlled by Mr
Berlusconi's younger brother, Paolo, came up with an adulatory front page:
'How Berlusconi wants to change Italy.' It showed a confident Mr Berlusconi
staring into the future with a rising sun shining on his face.
Already one paper, Sardinia's Unione Sarda, has witnessed serious ructions
between pro- and anti-Berlusconi camps. The editor and his two deputies
resigned last week over what they claimed was victimisation and attempts to
censor them after the newspaper's proprietor, Mr Nicola Grauso, took
exception to reports about his and Mr Berlusconi's masonic links.
But the sub-text of post-electoral reporting has been perplexity over the
Berlusconi phenomenon and the incongruity of his potential allies in
government. Readers have been treated to a bewildering change of headlines
regarding the attitude of Mr Umberto Bossi, the populist leader of the
Northern League. Last Thursday Mr Bossi and Mr Berlusconi had sealed the
outlines of a deal for government - 'Peace with Bossi'; by Saturday it was
'Bossi snubs Berlusconi' when the former refused to attend a negotiating
session. Then by Sunday it was 'Bossi: No to Berlusconi as Premier.'
Meanwhile, commentators have had a field day digesting an interview given
last Thursday to La Stampa by Mr Gianfranco Fini, the astute leader of the
neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance and the third likely partner in a
Berlusconi government. Mr Fini declared Mussolini to be 'the greatest
statesman this century'. Did this mean, asked L'Unita, the daily newspaper
backed by the former communist Party of the Democrat Left (PDS), that the
right was irredeemably fascist?
Others left their conclusions to the cartoonists. Corriere della Serra
showed Mr Fini sitting atop the open tomb of Mussolini with the (seasonal)
caption 'Resurrexit', while La Repubblica pictured Il Duce in a wheelchair
with a bubble caption: 'Now I can die in peace'.

FT  05 APR 94 / VW rejects fresh claims against Lopez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen has again been put on the defensive by reports of impending legal
action for perjury against Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, group
production director.
The German motor group dismissed as 'highly speculative' a weekend report in
the news magazine Der Spiegel that Mr Lopez faced a charge of making false
sworn statements in a court action last year. Meanwhile, it is believed that
a separate German investigation into allegations that Mr Lopez and three
colleagues stole General Motors' industrial secrets, before defecting to VW
a year ago, has been widened to include other former GM workers.
Until recently only Mr Lopez and three of the seven close colleagues who
joined him at VW - all from the US group - had been under suspicion.
According to Der Spiegel, the Hamburg prosecution service has told Mr
Lopez's lawyers that, if they do not present a defence, it will shortly seek
a judgment on the perjury allegation based on evidence on file. Legal
experts said this indicated that the prosecutor was confident of winning a
prosecution. German penalties for perjury range from a fine to imprisonment.
The magazine based its report on statements attributed to Mr Andreas Behm,
the Hamburg state prosecutor, although VW said it stemmed from comments from
GM lawyers. Mr Lopez's lawyers had spoken to Mr Behm and still expected no
charges, the German group said in a weekend statement.
Suspicions of perjury against Mr Lopez arose last year in a civil action in
which VW failed to win a gagging order intended to prevent Der Spiegel
repeating allegations of industrial espionage which lie at the heart of
continuing criminal investigations in Germany and the US.
Central to the magazine's latest report is an affidavit dated last June in
which Mr Lopez said he neither asked for nor received photographs of a
secret new model planned by Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, shortly
before he left to join VW. He contradicted this four months later in another
affidavit presented in a separate civil hearing.
VW's weekend statement reiterated that the company remained convinced that
no GM data had come into its possession or was used to its benefit.
A German criminal probe against Mr Lopez based on allegations of misconduct,
embezzlement and breaches of competition law has been under way since last
spring. Investigators have made no formal statements since late last summer
when they seized masses of computerised data in raids on VW's headquarters
and the homes of its new employees from GM.
The recent widening of the investigation is believed to be related to
information found among these data.
A federal inquiry in the US, started last summer, is also continuing. The
investigation into suspected wire and mail fraud - the illegal transmission
of data across state boundaries - is focused on VW's local subsidiaries.
However, at least two main board directors have been questioned before a
grand jury.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader of the populist Northern League, looks set to
place further hurdles in the path of the early formation of a new Italian
government by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate. Mr Bossi has
announced he intends to hold discussions in Rome tomorrow with Mr Mario
Segni, head of the referendum movement and the leader of the centrist
Italian Pact.
He has also hinted that these discussions could involve other parties
outside Mr Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance, which won last week's general
elections. 'I want to listen to what these people have to say about
programmes of government: not just gossip,' he said at the weekend.
In talking to the Italian Pact, which won 46 seats in the Chamber of
Deputies, Mr Bossi is trying to raise the stakes with Mr Berlusconi. From
starting out as conciliatory in the wake of the elections, Mr Bossi is now
embarked on a collision course with Mr Berlusconi.
First he snubbed Mr Berlusconi by deliberately not attending a meeting on
Friday between the League and the media magnate's Forza Italia. The first Mr
Berlusconi heard of Mr Bossi's absence was when he arrived at League
headquarters in Milan.
Then over the weekend Mr Bossi announced his intended round of meetings in
Rome, from a mountain holiday retreat, and raised once again his objection
to Mr Berlusconi assuming the premiership.
These moves by Mr Bossi are seen as tactics to boost his bargaining position
in a future Berlusconi government and head off opposition from the
grassroots of his party angry over any linkage with the neo-fascist
MSI/National Alliance.
But the League leader risks seriously embarrassing Mr Berlusconi if he
continues in this vein and threatens to complicate the task of forming a new
government.
At the same time, there are increasing signs of irritation from Mr
Gianfranco Fini, the leader of the MSI. He made clear over the weekend that
Mr Berlusconi and Mr Bossi could not organise a deal to form a government
without the full inclusion of the MSI, the third party to the Freedom
Alliance.
In particular, Mr Fini is irritated by suggestions of the League and Forza
Italia accepting a rewritten constitution with a strongly federalist
structure for the new Italy.
Faced with these problems, Mr Berlusconi chose to adopt a low profile during
the Easter holidays. He was advised by an editorial in Il Giornale, his most
supportive newspaper, to move more cautiously. The paper pointed out that
the first step was for the new parliament to reassemble on April 15 and only
thereafter could President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro begin to consider asking him
to form a government.

FT  05 APR 94 / Devaluation fears batter Turkish lira: Currency chaos
presages austerity package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's currency markets were in chaos again yesterday, with the lira
falling by more than 10 per cent in the interbank market on the eve of an
announcement of the government's long-awaited austerity package.
The dollar was trading at TL30,500 in the interbank market, compared with a
closing rate on Friday of TL27,000, as banks rushed to close their foreign
exchange positions amid rumours the package could include another
devaluation, following the 12 per cent realignment on January 26. The
Central Bank's opening price yesterday was TL22,500 to the dollar.
Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, is expected to unveil a package of
reforms today to restore market confidence in her economic management and
curb the fiscal deficit which is running at 17 per cent of GNP.
Last month's local elections, which saw Mrs Ciller's True Path party squeeze
a narrow victory, strengthened the prime minister's hand, but it remains to
be seen whether she has the courage to administer the far-reaching changes
most economists say are now needed.
The reforms are understood to include measures aimed at reducing foreign
exchange holdings in an attempt to undercut the speculators. The rush for
foreign exchange yesterday underlines banks' concern that the government
will make it more costly to hold foreign exchange by raising the statutory
amounts banks must lodge with the Central Bank as reserve requirements. In
addition, many banks were trying to close foreign exchange open positions.
Interbank rates have risen as high as 1,000 per cent in the last 10 days,
but have since fallen back.
Rates yesterday were about 250 per cent.
In a further indication of the government's desperate search for cash, the
Treasury this week took the unprecedented step of issuing bills with an
interest rate of 125 per cent through branches of the Turkish state telecom
company.
Turkish newspapers reported the package, which will apply for six months,
would include job cuts in overstaffed public sector industries, price rises
for state sector industry products, faster privatisation, an investment
freeze, and increases in value added tax.
However, some economists suggest this will be insufficient to curb growth
and squeeze inflation, which reached an annualised 73.6 per cent in March,
according to figures announced by the state statistics department yesterday.
Tax and privatisation revenues have been lower than expected and the earlier
devaluation has added to foreign debt servicing costs. Central Bank reserves
are about Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.19bn).
Confidence has been further damaged by the decision of US rating agencies to
downgrade twice since the start of the year, and by the Treasury's decision
to pull its recent Dollars 750m global bond.

Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, yesterday
announced that talks would begin this week in Geneva to see whether UN
peacekeepers or observers could complement Russian efforts to make peace
between Georgia and its breakaway Abkhazia region, writes Leyla Boulton.
The UN chief, in Moscow for talks with the Russian leaders, had earlier
witnessed the signing of an agreement by Georgia and Abkhazia on the return
of refugees displaced by the recent conflict. They also signed a joint
appeal for the UN to deploy a peacekeeping force in the region, partly so as
to counter Russian control over the situation.
Mr Boutros Ghali told a news conference that the UN would have to decide
whether to send a multinational force to operate in parallel with Russian
troops already there, or simply to send observers. But, dashing Russian
hopes for UN cash to finance its existing operations there, he said Russian
troops already on the ground could not be given a full UN mandate because
they were not under UN command.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky emerged triumphant from a weekend congress of his
ultra-nationalist, anti-Semitic Liberal Democratic party only to deny fresh
evidence that he is concealing a Jewish background from his voters.
Mr Zhirinovsky was officially appointed the presidential candidate of his
party at the congress, attended by guests including General Vladimir
Sterligov, a far-right former KGB general, and Mr Anatoly Lukyanov, the
former Soviet speaker accused of masterminding the 1991 coup but recently
granted an amnesty by the Russian parliament. Their presence suggested that
Mr Zhirinovsky is already preparing to enlist support in the 1996
presidential election from other ultra-nationalist parties and from the
communists.
However, just a few days after gaining blanket powers to run a party which
is basically a one-man show and would collapse without him, Mr Zhirinovsky
was engaged in damage control against new evidence that he is of part-Jewish
ancestry, despite his assertions to the contrary.
Film shot by CNN of his personal records in the archives of Alma Ata, the
capital of Kazakhstan, the former Soviet republic where he was born,
suggested he changed his name from Edelstein at the age of 18. The CNN
report said his mother's first husband, whose surname was Zhirinovsky, died
20 months before he was born, while the marriage certificate to her second
husband, Wolf Isakovich Edelstein, gave his nationality as Jewish. His
mother's document show her nationality as Russian.
CNN also filmed an archive official saying she had refused a Dollars 100
bribe to help unknown visitors take away the documents last month.
If widely publicised and believed inside Russia, the news would deal a
death-blow to Mr Zhirinovsky's presidential hopes given the anti-Semitism of
much of his constituency and of Russia's political establishment in general.
If he manages, however, to persuade the Russian public that the report is
part of a plot against him, especially one prepared and delivered by
foreigners, it could play to his advantage. Confronted with the records, Mr
Zhirinovsky told CNN they were 'prepared by the Turkish secret service'.

The Red Cross has suspended plans for immediate evacuation of thousands of
Moslems and Croats from Prijedor in northern Bosnia after Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic placed tough limits on the number of people he would allow
to go, Reuter reports from Sarajevo.
The International Committee of the Red Cross had planned a mass evacuation
of thousands of non-Serbs from the Prijedor area following reports that up
to 20 Moslems and Croats had been killed in a new outbreak of ethnic
violence.
But Mr Karadzic agreed to let go only those people whose lives were
considered under threat.

FT  05 APR 94 / Meciar skulks in Slovakia's political wings: The ousted PM
is determined to beat his enemies at the next election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'What did I do wrong?' a cartoon figure of Mr Vladimir Meciar, Slovakia's
recently ousted prime minister, asked Joseph Stalin, the late Soviet
dictator, on Slovak TV last week. 'You didn't abolish parliament,' came the
reply. This struck a chord with the many Slovaks who accuse the ex-premier
of Stalinist tendencies.
Mr Meciar, leader of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), was
forced to resign last month after he lost a vote of confidence in the
parliament he has dominated since taking his party to victory on a wave of
nationalist euphoria in the Czechoslovak elections of June 1992.
But it was the Slovak president, Mr Michal Kovac, who delivered the coup de
grace. The president had obliquely criticised Mr Meciar with repeated calls
for greater tolerance in Slovak political life. This expanded to a scathing
personal attack on the prime minister and, in turn, gave Slovakia's
fragmented opposition parties the courage to call for his resignation.
But removing Mr Meciar from political life will not be easy. He plans to
emphasise his role as 'father of the nation' and devote his prodigious
energy to the task of dividing and confounding his enemies in the run-up to
a general election set for September 30. If he wins he will exact
retribution.
'When re-elected, I will allow the president to swear me in, but then he
will have to resign,' he said shortly after losing power.
What sustains Mr Meciar's confidence, and worries his opponents, is the
knowledge that he has already emerged from a previous political eclipse. He
was deposed by a similar parliamentary coup in April 1991, but he went on to
form his own nationalist party and led it to victory 15 months later while
Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech leader, was sweeping to power in the Czech
Republic on a programme of economic reform.
Since then, Slovakia and the Czech Republic have moved in contrasted
directions, and Mr Meciar has suffered by the comparison. The Czechs, with
low inflation and low unemployment, have forged ahead with privatisation and
preparations for entry to the European Union. The Slovaks, with a weaker
industrial base, have seen unemployment soar to 17 per cent of the
workforce, their currency devalued and privatisation stumble to a halt amid
allegations of corruption and sales of state enterprises to political
cronies.
In politics, Mr Meciar has suffered a welter of defections from HZDS ranks
as well as criticisms of intolerance, secrecy and lack of vision.
The new coalition government is led by Mr Jozef Moravcik, former foreign
minister who broke away from the HZDS with 10 other rebels in February. He
has six months to establish this new force's credibility as an effective
government and win the votes needed to keep Mr Meciar from forming a new
government. Mr Moravcik has made clear the government's priorities 'to speed
economic transformation, de-politicise privatisation and take more effective
steps to attract foreign investors'.
The government's first move has been to block 13 of the 45 privatisation
projects approved by the Meciar government in the six weeks before its
removal. The new finance minister and former Meciar supporter, Mr Rudolf
Filkus, has blocked the transfer of shares to the new 'owners' pending
closer scrutiny. Mr Filkus was removed as ambassador to Austria, Slovakia's
main foreign trade and investment partner, for criticising the ex-premier's
policies towards Slovakia's ethnic Hungarian minority.
Blocking suspect privatisations both underlines the government's commitment
to greater transparency and signals its intentions to play hard politics
against what it recognises as a formidable political opponent.
Already the removal of Mr Meciar has led to a lightening of the political
mood. The new government's main task is to demonstrate an alternative style
of government, removed from the rawness of the Meciar regime with its
penchant for fast official cars and its aggressive assumption that critics
were both personal foes of the leader and enemies of Slovakia itself.
Mr Moravcik and his coalition partners do not underestimate the difficulties
ahead. None of the party leaders can match Mr Meciar's forceful personality,
and the coalition parties, which control 83 of the 150 seats in the Slovak
parliament, make uneasy bedfellows. They range from the catholic KHD party,
led by Mr Jan Carnogursky, to the former communists of the Party of the
Democratic Left (SLD).
In the middle sits a hastily-formed 'centre alliance' composed mainly of
defectors from the HZDS such as Mr Moravcik and his predecessor as foreign
minister, Mr Milan Knazko.
The 'historic compromise', which has brought Catholics and former Marxists
together in shared hostility to Mr Meciar, is particularly fragile. 'For
decades our people were persecuted by communists,' Mr Carnogursky recalls.
'Here, in parliament, the SLD's young leaders such as Petr Weiss are like
social democrats and we can co-operate with them. But, in the small towns
and villages, many SLD voters remain old-style communists and the
antagonisms run deep.'
Mr Meciar, whose two years in government allowed him time to sift through
the former secret police's files for ammunition against political enemies,
has made no secret of his intention to exploit any sign of dissent within
the new government's ranks.
But independence, Mr Meciar's war-horse in the 1992 elections, is no longer
an issue. From all sides, people argue that the most important thing now is
to make Slovakia work, and above all to get the economy up and running.
The new government has taken over negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund for a new Dollars 360m (Pounds 246.5m) stand-by loan. The
central bank is forecasting that the economy, with its bias towards heavy
industry and trade with the east, will bottom out this year. Its main task
now is to persuade voters and investors, both domestic and foreign, that it
will push ahead with economic reform, and that it can win the election and
form a stable government, even if Mr Meciar is skulking in the wings.

Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian prime minister, yesterday said a new wave of
'ethnic cleansing' in the Serb-held north of the country had put a
resumption of overall peace talks in doubt, writes Laura Silber from
Belgrade.
Mr Silajdzic also attacked the United Nations Security Council for not
acting to stop a Serb artillery and tank offensive against the Moslem
enclave of Gorazde, despite its status as a UN-protected safe haven.
The UN commander for Bosnia, General Sir Michael Rose, said he would visit
Gorazde tomorrow to take a look at the situation.

FT  05 APR 94 / Israel steps up withdrawal from occupied territories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Middle East peace efforts gained urgency yesterday as Israel stepped up
withdrawing and redeploying troops and equipment in the occupied territories
in preparation for Palestinian self-rule and the arrival of the first
contingent of Palestinian policemen.
The move will add momentum to regional peace talks after months of delay and
bitter wrangling and marks Israel's first concrete steps towards winding
down more than a quarter century of occupation of the territories, where
1.9m Palestinians live.
Israel's actions bolstered the confidence of Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine
Liberation Organisation leader, who said he was making plans to return to
the territories next month and be based in Jericho.
The rapidly unfolding Israeli withdrawal also caused Syria's President Hafez
al-Assad, concerned that Israeli-Palestinian progress would leave
Syrian-Israeli talks in a backwater, to fly to Cairo for talks with Egyptian
president Hosni Mubarak.
In both the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho soldiers yesterday
loaded equipment and furniture on to trucks and evacuated prisons and police
and military facilities to prepare for up to 500 Palestinian policemen
expected to arrive this week.
Palestinians also said the Israeli army was close to completing the
evacuation of 600 prisoners from the Ansar II prison camp in Gaza city to a
detention facility in Israel's Negev desert. The Ansar camp is to be used by
Palestinian policemen as a training and command centre.
Some Palestinian youths stoned soldiers packing up equipment but at other
places crowds of teenagers gathered round the departing Israeli troops
clapping and chanting Palestinian nationalist slogans. PLO leaders welcomed
the long-awaited change on the ground.
'It can be seen that the Israel army is evacuating a lot of areas, thinning
out many forces,' Mr Soufian Abu Zayda, a PLO official in Gaza, told Israel
radio. 'That says the agreement is beginning to be implemented in the field.
That is what is important.'
Israeli military officials said the government had instructed them to be
prepared to complete evacuation of the Gaza-Jericho area by April 14  - the
date originally agreed in the peace accord signed last September.
The army said it had been told the final evacuation moves should be finished
five days after Israel and the PLO conclude negotiations under way in Cairo
on a self-rule agreement for Gaza-Jericho.
Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator in Cairo, said he foresaw smooth
progress and expected agreement within two weeks. Talks on the deployment of
the first contingent of Palestinian police continued into the night in
Cairo, with the PLO drafting into the negotiations two of its most senior
military officers, major generals Nasr Youssef and Abderazzak al-Yahya.
Officials from Norway, Denmark and Italy, which are to supply the 160
international observers for Hebron, also met yesterday in the Egyptian
capital, but gave no indication when the first of their officers would
arrive in the West Bank town.
Israel also said it would allow 46 Palestinian activists deported from the
territories for political activity to return to their homes today.
Violence flared again in Hebron, site of February's massacre of 29
Palestinians by a fanatical Jewish settler, as Israeli soldiers shot and
wounded 18 Palestinian demonstrators.

FT  05 APR 94 / US stocks fall sharply amid fears of rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares on Wall Street fell sharply yesterday in response to worries that
robust US economic growth reported on Friday would make interest rate rises
more likely.
However, fears of a Wall Street collapse proved unfounded. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average dropped 83 points to 3,552 in early trading but then
rallied to close 42.61 points lower on the day at 3,593.35.
Just before the close of trading, the White House sought to calm nervous
investors. President Bill Clinton, speaking in Cleveland, Ohio, said he
thought the reaction in the markets to Friday's jobs data was overdone and
predicted interest rates would fall. 'I would encourage the American people
not to overreact,' he said.
US stock markets had been closed on Good Friday and yesterday was the first
chance for share traders to react to Friday's announcement of a 456,000
increase in non-farm payrolls in March.
The rise, the largest monthly increase since October 1987, indicated the US
economy was growing strongly and raised fears the Federal Reserve Bank would
find it necessary to push up interest rates again.
The Fed has increased short-term rates from 3 to 3.5 per cent in two moves
since early February. Since the first increase in short rates, on February
4, bond and share prices have fallen around the world.
While share prices recovered late in the day, the bond market fell sharply
amid heavy trading. The renewed fall, which pushed the yield on the
benchmark 30-year government bond up to 7.41 per cent, was prompted by
technical factors and was not linked to any fresh economic news or the
behaviour of the stock market.
The 30-year government bond was down nearly 1 3/4 points on the day, having
already fallen 1 1/2 points in thin holiday trading last Friday in reaction
to the jobs data.
Early today, the Tokyo market opened firmer, with the Nikkei 225 index
rising more than 130 points to 19,257 within the first half hour of trading.
However, yesterday's nervousness on Wall Street was expected to set the tone
for stock markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt, which resume trading today
after the Easter holiday.
Traders expect further weakness in London shares. The FT-SE 100 index, which
closed on Thursday at 3,086.4, is already 12.4 per cent down from its peak
recorded on February 2.
When the Dow fell 50 points at the start of yesterday's trading,
restrictions on program trading were imposed, under New York Stock Exchange
rules.
However, there was no sense of panic and mutual fund management group
Fidelity reported little sign of selling by private investors.
Wall Street's weakness prompted heavy falls in several Latin American
markets. Mexican stock prices ended more than 6 per cent down and Brazilian
shares fell more than 10 per cent.
Earlier, in anticipation of the fall on Wall Street, share prices in the
rest of the world edged lower.
Most European stock markets were closed for the day, although the Madrid
general index fell 2.9 per cent to a low for the year.
Asian stock markets mostly ended down, with traders nervous ahead of Wall
Street's opening. Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand recorded falls of between
2 and 3.3 per cent.

FT  05 APR 94 / Water chiefs urged to fight curbs: Institutions press for
Ofwat's likely proposals to be referred to MMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the UK's biggest fund managers are urging water companies to appeal
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission rather than accept tough price
limits that could be set by Ofwat, the water industry regulator.
In an unprecedented move against the regulator of a privatised industry,
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management and the Prudential, the UK's
largest institutional investor, have written to water company managers. They
are concerned that water company profits and dividends will suffer if a
forthcoming review by Ofwat is too harsh. Their move marks a new level of
investor activism over the way privatised utilities are regulated.
Several utilities, notably British Gas which took its case to the MMC, have
resisted regulators' proposed price caps. However, this is believed to be
the first time leading investors have intervened by pressing managers to
consider an MMC referral.
The institutions' move not only pits them against the regulator but also
consumer groups which welcomed the long-term review of prices when it was
announced in November by Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, with a
promise to 'get customers off the endless price escalator'.
Ofwat will decide this summer by how much more than inflation water
companies can raise bills between 1995 and 2000. Its decisions will be
announced on July 28.
The Prudential's letter said: 'We do regard it as important that if the
company is forced to operate under financial constraints which fail to
reflect an appropriate balance between the interests of shareholders and
customers, then the company should be prepared to seek a reference to the
MMC.'
Both institutions disagree with the way Ofwat sets price limits. They
question the rate of return on capital the regulator has said it will allow
companies to earn, and its method of calculating each company's capital
value.
Any successful appeal to the MMC would have to show that Ofwat's methodology
was flawed.
In its letter, the BZW offshoot said: 'In view of the risks to long-term
value inherent in Ofwat's assumptions, we believe there would be much to
gain by challenging them, even if this involves an appeal to the MMC.'
The companies sent strategic business plans to the regulator last Thursday.
They are due to be given Ofwat's draft decisions on May 20. Each company
will be able to raise objections at a meeting with the regulator in June
before final price limits are published.
Mr Byatt said recently price increases proposed by the companies in the
business plans - which on average allow for an increase well above the rate
of inflation - would be unacceptable to customers.
The water industry argues that the rises are needed to pay for modernising
the infrastructure of drains and treatment plants, and to bring water
quality up to the standards specified in European Union directives.
Mr Byatt has said he is considering cutting the rate of return water
companies have been allowed to earn since their privatisation in 1989. He
argues this was set at a deliberately high level to attract new investors.
With the industry well established, Ofwat argues the risks are lower, and
companies should fund future improvements through greater efficiency or
higher borrowing.

FT  05 APR 94 / Russian pilots warn of chaos in aviation industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Russian-leased Airbus crashed last month because the pilot handed the
controls over to his teenage son, the head of the Russian pilots' union has
confirmed.
Mr Alfred Malinovski, the union chief, said the A310 crash, in which all 75
people on board were killed, was not only a 'crime' but the tragic result of
the chaos in civil aviation in the country since the state airline Aeroflot
was broken up into 160 carriers.
Mr Malinovski said the youth appeared to have inadvertently switched off the
autopilot. The mistake was not rectified quickly because the co-pilot was
away from his seat. He added: 'The general reason (for the crash) is the
system's loss of manageability. Civil aviation cannot be run like a

Russian International Airlines operates most international traffic with the
west. Based at Russia's main Sheremetievo-2 international airport, it had
leased five Airbuses and was thinking of leasing five more to make up for a
shortage of Russian-produced aircraft to renew its fleet. Its airliner
crashed en route from Moscow to Hong Kong.
Mr Malinovski said that since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the once
monolithic Aeroflot had been deregulated without any rules, and the civil
aviation authorities' lack of staff and finance meant officials could no
longer ensure proper maintenance and supervision of the airline industry.
He said the information obtained from the flight recorder would be published
when the Russian authorities completed their investigation.
Mr Malinovski revealed that human error and poor maintenance caused the
death of 120 people on a flight to Moscow from the Siberian city of Irkutsk
in January. The aircraft had been operated by Baikal Air, one of the
Aeroflot offshoots.
He said the Tupolev-154 burst into flames after a pilot ignored a warning
light which came on when he switched on the engines.
Poor maintenance meant such lamps often came on when they were not supposed
to.
Mr Malinovski said the investigation - the results of which have not yet
been published - had shown that a scrap of metal had come loose in the
engine and twisted up the turbines, causing engine failure and an explosion
shortly after takeoff.
He said the latest disaster would force the authorities to look for ways of
reimposing more effective controls over the industry.

FT  05 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): French giant likely to return to
profits - Suez
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A highlight of France's corporate calendar this week will be the
announcement on Wednesday of the 1993 results of Suez, one of the country's
largest holding companies with a web of interests across French industry and
finance.
Suez, which fell into the red in 1992 for the first time in its history, is
universally expected to have come back into the black during 1993, but the
likely level of profits is unknown.
Mr Gerard Worms, the chairman of Suez, trumpeted the group's return to the
black when he announced a net interim profit of FFr516m (Pounds 59.1m) in
the first half of last year.
The group has since stepped up its asset sale programme, notably with last
autumn's lucrative deal to sell control of Colonia, the German insurer, to
Union des Assurances de Paris, the French insurance group.
Yet investors will be as interested to hear Mr Worms' views on the timing of
future asset sales as in the results themselves. Of particular interest is
the fate of Groupe Victoire, the French insurance company of which Suez
gained full control following the Colonia deal with UAP.
So far Victoire's prospective purchasers - from the UK's BAT Industries to
Germany's Allianz - have denied interest in it. Suez's shareholders must be
hoping for news about the progress of the sale.

FT  05 APR 94 / People: Unisys attracts computer luminary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Malcolm Coster was in his mid-40s when he sold his share of James Martin
Associates, a brilliantly successful software company, to Texas Instruments
for what he describes as 'drop dead money', writes Alan Cane. It was enough
to live comfortably for the rest of his life and reject all but the most
attractive job offers.
Fortunately for Unisys, Coster (right) was far from ready for retirement.
This month he accepted the job of president of its Europe, Middle East and
Africa division, based in London but with responsibility for more than 7,000
employees in 55 countries.
Now 50, he comes to Unisys via Coopers &amp; Lybrand's management consultancy,
where he headed international business development, ran the UK consultancy
service and looked after strategy and planning. 'It was getting a little
heavy,' he says.
A mathematics graduate from London University, Coster cut his computing
teeth in the 1960s with CEIR, the UK's oldest software house. Later he
became systems and programming manager for Lloyds Register, then creating a
sophisticated management information system.
A further spell with CEIR, newly renamed Scicon and owned by British
Petroleum, led to Coster being given responsibility for BP's systems
worldwide with funding of Pounds 300m a year. Some of that went to the
computer guru James Martin, who in 1983 persuaded Coster to help him launch
James Martin Associates with the aim of building an automated software
development system, now known as the Information Engineering Facility.
Unisys represents a different challenge. Brought back from the dead after
several years of losses by chairman James Unruh, it still has a long way to
go to achieve sustained, profitable growth. That, says Coster, is the
appeal: 'It is the chance to be a hero.'

FT  02 APR 94 / Television (Monday): Get comfortable for The Wrong Trousers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever else you do or don't see on television this Easter, watch The Wrong
Trousers at 6.00 on BBC2 this evening. It is only a few years since I served
on a jury which gave the award for best student film to Nick Park for his
animated plasticene characters.
His first professional film 'Creature Comforts' won an Oscar, and now The
Wrong Trousers has brought home Britain's only Oscar in 1994. This is the
story of the inventor Wallace (with the marvellous voice of Peter Sallis)
and his dog Gromit, and a splendidly villainous penguin who disguises
himself with a rubber glove.
If you have seen it before, watch it again.
The Young Musician Of The Year moves on to select those who will play in
Sunday's concerto final. Today: the piano final (7.20 BBC2).
That is followed (8.00) by Portrait Or Bust, in which Alan Bennett returns
to the art gallery in his home town of Leeds to look at the pictures and,
more important perhaps, the other people looking at the pictures. This is
made by the same team which produced Bennett's memorable nostalgic programme
'Dinner At Noon'.
It is hard to believe that Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse are really
going to destroy their most poptabulous creations, the jargon-spouting,
foot-tapping disc jockeys David Nice and Mike Smash.
Yet we are told that Smashie And Nicey - The End Of An Era really does mark
the end of the line (9.55 BBC1).
BBC2 provides the first showing on terrestrial television of Ridley Scott's
own cut of Blade Runner, the movie which invented the rust-bucket space age
(10.20).

FT  02 APR 94 / Television (Sunday): An in-depth look at the Channel tunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Serious Money presents a discussion about the future of the Channel tunnel:
will it revolutionise trade and travel or (given that everyone you speak to
says the same thing: 'I wouldn't dream of using it unless it was much
cheaper than the alternatives') is it doomed to economic failure? Among the
participants are Alistair Morton, Chairman of Eurotunnel, and Bob Reid,
Chairman of British Rail (5.15 C4).
Though Pie In The Sky is not the most zippy or compelling detective series
it has quickly become a regular fixture in our household. Mrs D. (caterer)
approves of Henry Crabbe's approach to catering and Mr D. (greedy pig)
imagines he would like Crabbe's cooking. Both enjoy the foodie jokes, and
the police element is proficient enough yet satisfactorily secondary. Merely
watching Richard Griffiths move about is rather wonderful (7.30 BBC1).
Did presenter Pete McCarthy dream up Travelog In France? Visiting four
contrasting regions, we are told, he starts his search for 'the real France'
in the local bar in each instance. 'I've got this idea for a series: I nip
across the Channel and lounge about in the boozers soaking up the
atmosphere. What do you think?' Brilliant Pete (8.10 C4).
Today's drama in the Arena Relics series is based upon the bizarre case of
Charlie Chaplin's disappearing coffin: in 1978 it was stolen from his grave
in Switzerland and a ransom was demanded from his widow (8.35 BBC2). Best
movie of the day is The Maltese Falcon, John Huston's 1941 thriller with
Bogart as gumshoe Sam Spade and the villains played by Peter Lorre and
Sydney Greenstreet (11.00 BBC1).

restaurants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is a good day for staying as far away as possible from the television
screen: up a mountain, out on an estuary, or tucked into a nice little
Anglo-Italian restaurant eating something meaty with the currently
ubiquitous onion marmalade perhaps. Start with pasta because the British are
now so much better at cooking it: al dente is more common today than boiled
slimy, and real potato gnocchi . . . whoops, sorry, television.
For those with flu or babysitting obligations the trick is to hunt around
the edges of all the weekend rubbish and Easter treats. BBC2 promises Monty
Python's Fligender Zirkus, a special episode of the famous series, made for
German television and not shown in Britain since 1973. All the chaps are
featured including John Cleese and Michael Palin, as is Connie Booth who
went on to create 'Fawlty Towers' with Cleese (5.35 BBC2). A little later
BBC2 shows the semi-final for brass players in the Young Musician Of The
Year competition (7.05).
The late Dieter Plage, one of the world's greatest wildlife cameramen,
followed in the footsteps of the explorer Wilfred Thesiger, penetrating the
hot and desolate regions of Ethiopia, to make 'Forbidden Desert Of The
Danakil' in Channel 4's Kingdoms In Conflict series (8.00).
BBC2 is running a series called Arena Relics which today features 'Curse Of
The Firebeetle'. Described as 'a spaghetti western for the 1990s' and set
against the civil war in Peru, this tells the story of Ortiz, a grave robber
who happens upon the huge golden shield of the ancient sun god, Atahualpa,
and sets off for Lima to sell it (9.10 BBC2).

FT  02 APR 94 / Government postpones privatisation of Banque Hervet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yesterday announced that it was postponing the
privatisation of Banque Hervet, the medium-sized banking group, and that it
was providing a capital injection of FFr750m (Pounds 85.91m) to try to
stabilise its finances, writes Alice Rawsthorn.
The bank was badly affected by the recession and yesterday reported a
FFr1.2bn loss for 1993, prompting the state injection and the decision to
delay its sale.
Hervet, which is 55.41 per cent state-owned, was scheduled for sale on a
private basis later this year. Credit Commercial de France, the retail
banking group that owns 34 per cent of Hervet, was seen as the likeliest
buyer.

Sun Microsystems, the US maker of computer work-stations and operating

year before - well below the 12-15 per cent growth rate generally expected
by analysts.
In a brief statement after the stock market closed on Thursday, Sun said it
estimated that revenues in the period to March 27 were Dollars 1.17-Dollars
1.20bn, compared with Dollars 1.14bn a year earlier.
Sales in the US were held back 'to some extent' by the introduction last
week of new products, which had led some customers to delay purchases, said
Michael Lehman, chief financial officer.

FT  02 APR 94 / Ashdown warns on by-election
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, has warned that Labour may
help the Conservatives win the Eastleigh by-election.
Mr Ashdown accuses the Conservatives of 'talking up' Labour's prospects in
the hope of splitting the anti-government vote.
He stresses in a letter appealing for an all-out effort from party activists
that 'a strong Labour campaign could stop the Liberal Democrats winning'.
Eastleigh became vacant through the death of Stephen Milligan, who in the
1992 general election had a majority of 13,355 over Mr David Chidgey, who is
again contesting the seat for the Liberal Democrats.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday accused Serbs of a new wave of ethnic atrocities in
northern Bosnia and called for those guilty of war crimes to be brought to
justice. It said Serbs were trying to drive out Moslems, Croats and gypsies
from the towns of Banja Luka and Prijedor. The US condemnation follows
United Nations and Red Cross reports accusing Serbs of murdering 17 Moslems
and two Croats in the Prijedor area, although Serb police claimed they were
investigating only seven deaths.
Meanwhile, the UN is considering despatch of 800 Ukrainian peacekeepers to
Gorazde, the besieged Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia. This move comes as
Serb attacks on Gorazde have left 30 people dead and 132 wounded since
Monday. Serb media, however, claimed a Moslem offensive was under way.
The UN is also considering sending reinforcements for the French
peacekeeping contingent in the north-western Moslem area of Bihac, where
Serb and Bosnian forces yesterday signed a ceasefire. Plans for bolstering
peacekeeping forces in Bosnia follow approval by the UN Security Council on
Thursday of an extra 3,700 troops and advisers.

Japan as the only country actively pursuing the technology as an energy
source. The plant, is located in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, 335 km west of

FT  02 APR 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: He will or he won't
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The end of the first quarter. Tempus fugit. At the end of each threemonth I
indulge myself no end by taking stock. I ponder my career. Examine my
lifestyle. Count my money. Scrutinise my will.
And estimate how many quarterly stock-takings I still have to come - about
52, by my calculation, which is not a large number, sad to say.
I especially enjoy re-reading my will, and deciding which of the people
mentioned in it should be given greater prominence, or moved into the
shadows.
People change as they get older, especially people mentioned in wills. They
get nicer, or not; more grateful, or less. You have to keep on top of it,
and update the paperwork.
In addition to my usual stock-taking, I have been examining the predictions
for 1994 made in this column on January 1, to see how they are faring.
If they are proving to be idiotic my idiocy should be acknowledged, at least
by me, for I claimed that they were serious predictions, even if wishful
thinking had infected most of them. To calibrate my performance at the end
of the first quarter, I decided to award each forecast a provisional score
out of 10.
Markets: displaying a machismo that was entirely uncalled for, I predicted
that the FT-SE 100 would set a record high of approximately 3,660 before
Easter, then endure months of choppiness before falling like a stone in
September or October, and finishing the year below 3,000. As it happened,
the index topped-out at 3,520.3 on February 2.
I still think it will finish 1994 at a far lower level than experts were
predicting on January 1. But even if it does, my other forecast - that gold
would approach Dollars 500 an ounce, as a prelude to startling gains at the
end of the century - is looking flyblown. I am counting on China. The
Chinese love gold. Buy more, you toiling masses. Unless we all heave
together, the wretched gold price is going nowhere. Provisional score out of
10: 4.
US politics: I predicted 'a good year for Bill Clinton - Washington's dozy
columnists will finally warm to him - and a good year, too, for Hillary
Clinton.' I am sticking to my guns, storms in eggcups notwithstanding.
Score: 8.
UK politics: John Major would resign, to be succeeded as prime minister by
Kenneth Clarke; John Smith would meander through another low-key year as
Opposition leader; and something 'painful and messy' would happen to bossy
Virginia Bottomley, the UK health secretary. I still believe that Major will
quit Downing Street voluntarily, late in the year, probably late at night,
his poor wife in tow, screaming soundlessly. And Smith is certainly snoozing
through a low-key year. But Bottomley is uncrushed. In fact, still glowing.
Score: 7.
Sport: I like soccer, so I predicted that the World Cup would be a great
success. I know almost nothing about soccer, so I predicted that Norway
would beat Brazil 3-1 in the final. I also reckoned that the Grand National
steeplechase at Aintree would produce a fiasco to rival last year's. Neither
of these events has yet been staged. Score: 5.
The monarchy: 'A good year for Prince Charles, as more and more people come
to appreciate the attraction of having a divorced heir to the British
throne. What could be more fin de siecle or sophisticated?' (The divorce
itself was tipped for 1995). Without doubt, Prince Charles is having a good
year, having launched a massive PR campaign to buttress himself against the
sniggering of the populace. Score: 9.
Religion: 'The Church of England will stumble ever faster towards
disestablishment and outer darkness.' As forecasts go, this is one of my
bankers. Score: 8.
Hunting: 'People who hunt animals - big ones, small ones - will feel more
and more like pariahs as revulsion at their activities becomes pronounced.'
Score: 7.
Journalism: Incredibly, I reckoned that news desks would realise that people
are fed up with coverage of Russia and China, and wanted about 30 years'
silence from those two countries while they licked their wounds and
smartened-up their acts. Score: 0.
My average provisional score is thus six out of 10. This is not a good
score. It has made me gloomy. To revive my spirits, I have torn up my will
and am starting again from scratch. The fun is quite considerable.

FT  02 APR 94 / As They Say in Europe: Italy, a case of plus ca change?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN

<TEXT>
Many must have envied the Italians last weekend. They could choose among any
number of new parties, usually led by totally new politicians. For the first
time in the history of a democracy, voters could go to the polls without
being tempted from the path of reason by the siren call: 'Throw the rascals
out.' The rascals had already been thrown out by the police and the
judiciary.
But this cheery view was mistaken, as Monday's perceptive fantasy in the
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung indicated. It highlighted the problems faced
by the typical Italian voter: 'Mr Rossi has nothing to complain about. His
wife had come through her operation satisfactorily, the children bring
average reports home, the textile industry in his central Italian small town
is working well. But this election breaks Mr Rossi's head.'
Too much had changed, little was left over from the old system. New symbols,
new words, new faces. So, even by Sunday night, Rossi had not been able to
make up his mind. When he did, it seems he voted for Silvio Berlusconi's
Forza Italia.
The victory of this grouping and what the press call le tre destre italiani
 -the three Italian right wing parties - led to some complex speculation.
Corriere della Sera decided they each had, more or less, 'ancient and
profound roots but together represent a new phenomenon'. This is part of the
truth.
Berlusconi's policies were described by an Italian professor, writing in Le
Monde, as 'all originating in the Thatcherite pharmacopoeia of Anglo-Saxon
neo-conservatism.' That highlights what was truly a new phenomenon in Italy.
A party had not only put forward a political programme but had actually won
the election, too.
According to the professor, Marcello Da Cecco, Berlusconi's borrowed
programme ends in the 'definitive defeat of the trade unions and the
re-distribution of income in favour of the rich'. But Da Cecco did,
accidentally, explain how an Italian party had been able to succeed when
burdened with a political programme, especially such an appalling one. He
noted that it had 'neither been questioned nor discussed' during the
campaign.
By tradition, politics were never discussed on such occasions. Italian
parties had highly political names - Christian Democrats and so on - but no
content. Only slogans. Berlusconi's party seems to be the opposite: it has
policies, and a football supporters' slogan as its name.
But will Forza Italia, in fact, now try to put its published programme into
practice? The contradictions within the ramshackle electoral coalition which
the party leads have been well documented.
If, however, there should be an Italian government with policies that go
beyond paying off appropriate interest groups and being blown half-heartedly
by any wind that seems to prevail, the possibilities are revolutionary. Will
foreign policy no longer consist solely of trying to find out what
Washington thinks it ought to be? Will Italy's Euro-policies cease to be a
poorly constructed replica of France?
Berlusconi has no love for Brussels, though, and we could see one crucial
element of the 'Thatcherite pharmacopoeia' emerge as the new Italian
government pursues a European policy that is nearer to that of Britain.
Perhaps Italy will no longer be a reliable opponent of anything that smacks
of the free market and liberalisation.
Such a change would vindicate fully the complex game played by the British
government which, this week, ensured an increase in the number of votes
needed to block proposals in the EU's council of ministers.
Still, any kind of political activism will worry Rossi and the millions who
voted for Forza Italia. Italy's post-war success, a real economic miracle,
has been founded on the basis of a government which does nothing and creates
obstacles. As an Italian colleague, an expatriate Rossi, told me: 'The
trouble with policies is that they can go wrong.'
He is comforted that Berlusconi was helped to his present eminence by his
contacts with the former socialist leader, Bettino Craxi, now charged with
corruption. And that he was a member of the powerful P2 Masonic lodge which
seems to have lurked behind some unsavoury milestones of contemporary
Italian history.
So, the answer to the above question might still be a reassuring 'niente'.
Perhaps not that much has changed, even though all the papers write of 'the
Italian revolution'. As Niccolo Machiavelli, the greatest political
commentator of them all, noted: 'People are always taken in by appearances
and the outcome of events.'

FT  02 APR 94 / Private View: The bishop with a different Easter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Millions of Christians will not be celebrating Easter this weekend. It is
not because they have stopped believing in the Resurrection but because they
belong to the Orthodox Church.
Easter follows the first full moon after the spring equinox. For this
calculation the Orthodox still cling to the old Julian calendar, according
to which the spring equinox occured on April 3. The result is that their
Easter is still a month away.
The discrepancy is just one symptom of the great schism between the churches
of Byzantium and Rome, usually dated to 1054 AD when a papal legate threw a
Bull of Excommunication on to the altar of Santa Sophia in Constantinople.
A thousand years later, Christian clergy of east and west are still looking
for reconciliation. If anyone understands what that involves, it is Bishop
Kallistos of Diokleia, assistant to the head of the Greek archdiocese of
Thyateira and Great Britain, university lecturer and author of a standard
work, The Orthodox Church.
For behind the black-rimmed spectacles and whiskery silver beard - an
accoutrement which does for an Orthodox priest what a full-bottomed wig does
for a British judge - there hides an Englishman.
Bishop Kallistos began life as Timothy Ware, the son of an English soldier.
His father was a brigadier in the Durham Light Infantry and fought in two
world wars. Both parents were churchgoing, middle-of-the-road Anglicans.
The boy was not military, not even athletic, but very precocious
intellectually: he suffered a bout of religious scepticism at the age of 13
when, arriving at Westminster School, he began to read philosophers such as
Bertrand Russell.
'I do remember thinking when I was 13 there is no proof for the existence of
God,' he said. (Russell made the same discovery at about the same age, but
with quite different results.)
By the age of 14, Timothy Ware had returned to religion. 'Not because I
found any single answer,' he said, 'but because I concluded there were a
great many things in this world that could not be proved, that almost all
the things by which we directed and guided our lives were attitudes for
which there was no proof. Then I also thought about why I have feelings of
right and wrong - not just conditioning, but going deeper than that.'
He considered becoming a Roman Catholic but found the Pope's claim to
supremacy inconsistent with his reading of early church history. A visit to
a Russian Orthodox church at 17 made a deep impression but it was six years
later, after taking a double First at Oxford and studying theology, that he
joined the Greek Orthodox. When he was ordained in 1966 he was the first
non-Greek priest in the British diocese.
'In the end I felt what mattered was not nationality, but truth,' he said.
'If Orthodoxy taught the Christian faith with a fullness not possessed by
other communities, shouldn't I join them, whatever the historical
limitations? Truth is universal.'
In the west, Orthodoxy is largely a church of immigrants. It is also
fragmented along national lines. Parish organisation has improved but there
are few western converts, and those tend to be from the university-educated
professional classes: John Tavener, the English composer, is one famous
example and Bruce Chatwin, the author, was on the point of joining when he
died.
In Russia, however, the church is enjoying a big revival following the
collapse of communism. 'People feel communism has let them down desperately
badly and are looking for some meaning to life,' the Bishop said.
But is there, I asked him, any sign of a general religious revival as we
approach the millenium?
'What I do think,' he replied, 'is that while there is deep disillusionment
with organised religion there is nonetheless considerable spiritual thirst
and interest in the inner resources of the human person.
'This may take different forms. Some 20 years ago people looked to India or
Zen Buddhism. Nowadays people are drawn often to the 'New Age' - a lot of
what that means makes me feel very unhappy. Nonetheless, I can see a
spiritual craving there, a rebellion against the values of a purely material
way of life. The interest in ecology is another aspect of it. But churches
don't seem to be responding.'
How, I asked, could a church as antique and traditionalist as the Orthodox
hope to respond?
'I would want to say that tradition has to be understood as a living
reality, not simply rigid conservatism. Real loyalty to tradition implies a
critical spirit. You've got to look at your past inheritance and say which
bit of it is essential, which just historically conditioned. I would like to
see the Orthodox Church living its tradition much more intelligently and
reflectively.'
The focus of his religious loyalty is the doctrine of the Trinity, which he
described as much more than a theoretical piece of complex speculation, and
of the Incarnation.
'I am very troubled by the great growth of an extreme radical, liberal
position within Anglicanism,' he said. 'I respect the sincerity of the
people who are grappling with great questions. But the way they set out to
answer those questions is not likely to bring the country back. It's not a
way to help people in moments of crisis and despair.'
Also important, he added, was 'the immediacy of the invisible world'.
Christianity should never become 'just a philosophical theory or a social
programme'.
Orthodox rank-and-filers tend to resist reunion with western Christians.
Where Orthodoxy is the national religion there is no need. Immigrant
communities of the diaspora take refuge in it. And western converts do not
convert in order to be brought back again.
I asked the Bishop whether secularism could provide the impetus.
'I wouldn't want us to unite because we both felt weak. When two businesses
do a merger because each is losing clients that's not necessarily a recipe
for commercial success. I would hope myself that in the west we can have
friendly relations with other churches but remain firm in upholding our own
position.'
The most likely, even imminent, reunion would be with the so-called Oriental
Orthodox of the Middle East, north Africa, Armenia and India which veered
off after the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD.
Among western Christians, the Roman Catholics are doctrinally closest. But
there are some serious historical vendettas to be overcome. The Serbs, for
example, remember massacres at the hands of Croatian Catholic fascists
during the second world war, and have witnessed continuing destruction of
their churches even outside the fighting zones. In the Ukraine, there is
resentment against the Vatican-supported revival of the eastern Catholic, or
Uniate, church.
Bishop Kallistos said the chief doctrinal problem was the Pope's claim to
infallibility and jurisdiction over the whole of Christendom. But, he
argued, under another pontiff both claims might be susceptible to
redefinition.
So, too, might the filioque, an obscure but ancient theological argument
about the Trinity: the Latin church claims that the Holy Spirit proceeds
from God the Son as much as from God the Father.
Nor, the Bishop said, need there be much dispute about the real presence at
the Eucharist even though the Orthodox regard the Roman word
'transubstantiation' as a dubious piece of Aristotelian interpolation.
Orthodoxy is both more traditionalist, but also more mystical, fluid and
decentralised than Roman Catholicism. For example, its bishops do not take
the Vatican's hard line on artificial contraception, nor on divorce. They
permit married men to be ordained (but not priests to marry).
In relation to Anglicanism, the problem is reversed. There is no historical
legacy of hatred, but there are serious doctrinal obstacles.
'There are high-church Anglicans whose faith is really the same as ours,'
the bishop said. 'But over the past 50 years there has been a growing
liberalism too on the Trinity, the Incarnation and the bodily Resurrection.
We cannot envisage joining a body where such diversity of opinion is
possible.'
And women priests?
His answer was a surprise. For he thinks the gender of the clergy is 'an
open question' which has never been studied in theological depth. His
complaint about the Church of England's decision to ordain women is not that
it was done, but that it was done without a proper theological debate. 'Is
the difference between men and women only a matter of procreation? Or is it
much deeper, about different ways of thinking, working and feeling?'
The doorbell rang and the Bishop went out to meet another visitor. After a
few moments he came back and said: 'There is something else I would like to
say.
'I do believe that Orthodoxy makes demands on people. I would never say it
offers a soft option. But I also believe it is a faith as much for English
people as for Greeks or Russians. I didn't become an Orthodox just because I
like things Greek and Russian. I became one because I felt I could find in
Orthodoxy a fullness - and I do very deliberately use that word.
'It's not that I think Orthodoxy has everything and the western churches
have nothing. I simply believe that the light I had already found in
Anglicanism - that I'm sure can be found also in Roman Catholicism - was to
be found in a fuller, purer form.
'So it is not that the west has nothing but that the Orthodox church has
more. Having said that, I would add that from an empirical point of view and
for historical reasons there are many human failings in Orthodoxy. I don't
deny that.
'That is why I think Orthodoxy could learn many good lessons from the west.
The west can help us to understand our faith better. And that's the great
benefit we could derive from talking to western Christians: not that we
would import a lot of western ideas that are foreign to us, but see better
who and what we are.
'Also, in becoming Orthodox I did not feel I was betraying my own western
culture but really discovering its true roots and true meaning. I know that
to my friends it seemed a highly eccentric action. But I feel it's not made
me less English, but more English.'

FT  02 APR 94 / 'Douglas, I feel bowled out': Dominic Lawson imagines John
Major's feelings during the test match
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Major, we are told, follows the fortunes of the England cricket XI with
a passionate intensity. We have been told so by prime minister Major
himself, and he probably believed that at the time he said it, too.
Perhaps Major's latest debacle, his bungled attempt to change the basis of
the European Community's voting structure, owed something to the
distractions of watching the satellite television coverage of the English
cricket team's test match against the West Indies.
I can envisage foreign secretary Douglas Hurd making the short walk across
from King William Street to Downing Street, attempting to tell Major that
the Spanish were not going to continue to hold out with the British against
the rest, to be met with: 'Douglas, can't you see that we are on the verge
of a famous victory? The West Indies have not lost a match at Port of Spain
for 17 years. If Atherton's men can beat Curtly Ambrose and co, surely you
can beat those medium pace trundlers in Brussels.'
'But prime minister, Mr Atherton is playing 11 against 11. We are one
against 11. It's just not cricket out there in the enlargement
negotiations.'
'Just block the straight balls, Douglas, and whack the loose ones. Oh, and
remember to stay on the front foot, in case the French bowl something mean
and low.'
'Prime minister, I really think . . .'
'Oh shush, Douglas, Hick has just dropped another sitter, and I want to see
the action replay after the break. By the way, why are there so many
advertising breaks on Sky, Douglas?'
'Since you ask, prime minister, we agreed that Rupert Murdoch's channel
should not have to observe any of the rules which keep terrestrial
television tasteful. He said he wouldn't put up the money otherwise. I
believe this was when I was home secretary. Or perhaps it wasn't. We've had
so many home secretaries over the past few years, I really can't remember.'
'Stop reminiscing, Douglas, get back to that easy-paced wicket in Brussels,
and play yourself into form, like Graham Thorpe in the first innings.'
'Graham Thorpe, prime minister?'
'Oh you must know who I mean, Douglas, the plucky little Surrey left
hander.'
'I'm afraid, Prime Minister, that your cricketing metaphors are lost on me.
I was a wet bob.'
'Wet bob? Is that one of your awful political dining clubs? What are you
talking about, Douglas?'
'Schooldays, prime minister. We called cricketers dry bobs, and rowers wet
bobs. At Eton. You see . . .'
'I thought I told you never to mention that word in my presence.'
' Sorry, prime minister,' said Hurd, who, in the awkward silence which
followed, began humming 'blade on the feather', subversively, under his
breath - the Eton boating song had always inspired the foreign secretary at
such testing times.
'Well, Douglas, while you've been staring at the ceiling, singing the
European anthem, we've got the West Indies all out. Now Athers and the lads
have only got to get 194 runs to win. Sit down in Norma's chair and enjoy
watching an English triumph.'
The foreign secretary walked across the room, poured himself a glass of good
French brandy, and sat down. In the meantime Major seemed suddenly to have
slumped in his seat.
Hurd looked at the television with a puzzled expression on his fine
patrician features: 'Prime minister, why is Mr Atherton walking across the
screen with a cartoon picture of a duck under his name?'
'Shut up Douglas, this is serious.' A few seconds later another England
batsman trailed gloomily across the screen with the same undignified mallard
for company. And another. And another. ''Exit, pursued by a duck' one might
say, prime minister,' chortled the foreign secretary. Major groaned.
'All right, Douglas, have it your way. Go back to Brussels, and tell them we
give in.'
'Quack, quack, prime minister.'

FT  02 APR 94 / Arts: The many faces of Shylock exposed - Shakespeare and
anti-Semitism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD KAUFMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
My father, when conscripted to the pre-first world war Russian army, was a
Jew in little more than name. Then one day, during a trivial argument, the
non-Jew who was his greatest friend called him a dirty Jew. 'All right,'
thought my father. 'If to them I'm a Jew, to myself I'll be a Jew.' From
that day on, he observed his religion with the strictest orthodoxy.
In David Thacker's new interpretation of The Merchant of Venice for the RSC,
which opens at the Barbican next week, Shylock's Jewish identity is awakened
in the same way as was my father's.
When we first see Shylock at his financier's desk in the 1990s London yuppie
dockland - a clever analogy for Venice - in which this production is set, he
is dressed in the kind of clothes worn by those prosperous Jewish
businessmen who, on high holy days only, attend St John's Wood synagogue.
As the play progresses and the emphasis on his Jewishness increases, Shylock
dons a skullcap. Subjected - as the action approaches its climax - to the
full force of anti-Semitic prejudice, he responds by wearing the black
overall that is customary among ultra-Orthodox Jews.
Many critics, not all of them Jews, regard The Merchant of Venice, with its
apparently stereotyped Jewish villain, as unplayable. Such critics
misunderstand not only the play but its author. Compare The Merchant of
Venice with other works of English literature featuring Jews, and it is not
the similarities but the differences which are remarkable.
Marlowe's The Jew of Malta, written around the same time as Shakespeare's
play, presents a protagonist, Barabas, who conforms to the worst sort of
racial stereotype. He thinks only of money, and to get it he is perfectly
ready to cheat and deceive Christians:
'We Jews can fawn like spaniels when we please;
And when we grin we bite; yet are our looks
As innocent and harmless as a lamb's'
At the end of the play Barabas dies as he has lived - evil, violent and
unrepentant. That kind of caricature is repeated in the particularly nasty
anti-Semitism with which the vastly over-praised Charles Dickens portrays
that other well-known fictional jew - Fagin of Oliver Twist, the criminal
and corrupter of children.
On his first appearance Fagin is described as 'A very old shrivelled Jew
(with) villainous-looking and repulsive face . . . dressed in a greasy
flannel gown'. He is truly evil, egging Bill Sikes on to murder Nancy and
utterly defiant as he goes to his execution before a raucous and jovial
crowd.
Yet the depiction of Fagin was not some odious excrescence but the norm.
Instinctive and automatic anti-Semitism was endemic in English plays and
novels until early this century. Saki's stories are peppered with
anti-Semitic references, and so are John Buchan's. In The Thirty-Nine Steps
there is the early appearance of 'A little white-faced Jew in a bath-chair
with an eye like a rattlesnake', and the narrative is obsessed with
'Jew-anarchists'.
Anti-Semitism featured, too, in the writings of GK Chesterton, in whose
reputedly warm-hearted Father Brown stories the word 'Jew' is used as a
synonym for 'alien'. Three of this century's best-selling authors of
detective novels - Agatha Christie, Marjorie Allingham and Dorothy Sayers -
were reflexively anti-Semitic (even though Sayers's publisher was a Jew).
In The Merchant of Venice, Shylock starts out as benefactor who offers a
loan to an avowed anti-Semite. Antonio accepts the terms for forfeiture -
the pound of flesh - quite readily:
'If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
As to thy friends . . .
But lend it rather to thine enemy;
Who if he break thou mayst with better face
Exact the penalty.'
The key event that precedes Shylock's switch to a stubborn insistence that
the debt must be repaid, and in the manner to which Antonio has agreed, is
the defection of his daughter, Jessica. She not only runs off secretly to
marry a gentile, but she also steals much of her father's wealth and then
proceeds to throw in her lot with his enemies. Shylock is a loving father.
It is the loss of Jessica rather than his money that he principally laments:
'My daughter] O my ducats] O my daughter]'
It is understandable (though not pardonable) that, taunted by street-people
and insulted by his enemies, Shylock should become vengeful. Suffered of
injustice both in being robbed and in not having his loan repaid, it is he,
not Antonio, who is ruined. He is not the play's villain but its victim.
Thacker demonstrates that anti-Semitism is only one element of the bigotry
that pervades Venice. There is a telling moment in the first casket scene
when Portia flinches from the touch of the black Prince of Morocco and,
later on, Antonio's own friends mock his homosexual attachment to Bassanio.
Thacker not only illustrates the prejudice but dramatically emphasises it.
Shylock's 'Hath not a Jew eyes?' speech occurs some way into the first scene
of the play's third act. In mid-scene and indeed in mid-speech, the director
stops the play and starts the interval, thus imprinting on the audience's
mind what is the most profoundly effective apologia for Jewry in all
literature.
Thacker is able to create that coup de theatre because Shakespeare wrote
that speech. The Merchant of Venice reveals its playwright to have been a
moral pioneer, who transcended prejudices which prevailed not only in his
own time but for centuries to come.
The Merchant of Venice is not an anti-Semitic play, but one that exposes
anti-Semitism. Shylock, humiliated, robbed, compelled to betray and abandon
his own religion, is an ancestor of the Jews persecuted by Hitler. Portia,
Bassanio and the rest of that trivial-minded and selfish dominant group in
Venetian society were fore-runners of Nazis like Amon Goeth in Schindler's
List. At the end of the play, their hounding of a Jew accomplished, they
turn, complacent and impervious, to their merry-making.

FT  02 APR 94 / Arts: Eclectic and elusive - The curious case of Hans
Krasa's 1930s opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of all the works suppressed by the Nazis, one of the most curious is Hans
Krasa's two-act opera Verlobung im Traum (Betrothal in a Dream), which has
just been staged by the Prague State Opera - formerly Prague's German
theatre.
It was first staged there in 1933 by the young George Szell and won the
Czechoslovak State Prize, a rare honour for a German-language work. By the
end of the decade Krasa, a German-speaking Czech from a wealthy Jewish
family, was in the Terezin concentration camp, where performances of his
children's opera Brundibar (Bumblebee) helped to raise the morale of
inmates. He died in the gas chambers at Auschwitz in October 1944.
Along with Viktor Ullmann and several other Jewish contemporaries, Krasa is
now being rediscovered. Decca has just issued a recording of his string
quartet, his symphony has been played in Berlin and Brundibar was staged
last year at London's South Bank.
Verlobung im Traum owes its revival to two people: 83-year-old Pavel
Eckstein, a long-time Prague correspondent of Opera and now adviser to the
State Opera, who remembers the 1933 premiere and wanted to see a modern
staging; and Israel Yinon, a young Israeli conductor based in Mannheim.
Krasa's publishers, Universal Edition, had told Yinon the music was lost but
allowed him to rake through the cellars of their Vienna headquarters. It was
here that he found the score with Szell's pencil markings.
One question which surrounds such rediscoveries is whether their brutal and
poignant history masks a mediocrity of talent.
There can be no qualms about the libretto, compactly drawn from
Dostoyevsky's Uncle's Dream by two journalist friends of Krasa's, Rudolf
Fuchs and Rudolf Thomas. Set in a small Russian town in the mid-19th
century, it tells of the beautiful young Zina, her bourgeois family and
three rival suitors - including a decrepit old prince who is persuaded to
believe his betrothal to her was a dream. The action is in flashback, framed
by a brief prologue and epilogue in an archivist's library.
Krasa's music is eclectic, reflecting the harmonic modernism of his teacher
Zemlinsky, his cosmopolitanism and technical fluency. There are motoric
rhythms, jazz inflections, neo-classical passage-work, schmaltzy dance tunes
and snatches of Janacekian beauty. The most notable features are the light
orchestration and a vocal quintet built out of Casta diva, with which Zina
charms the prince.
An air of comic irony hovers over the whole, but Krasa's personality remains
elusive. At less than two hours, the opera outstays its welcome.
The State Opera's production, staged by Karel Drgac, designed by Rainer
Sinell and sympathetically conducted by Yinon, preserved the period setting
and looked good, thanks to an ingenious turn-table set and some
well-characterised ensembles. But the principals needed stronger direction.
The Romanian soprano Anda-Louise Bogza was an ideal Zina for the occasion,
sounding like the young Julia Varady and capturing a wealth of conflicting
emotion behind the outward composure.
Jaroslav Horacek gave a fine cameo as the Archivist, but the other players
were disappointing, in particular Rudolf Konstantin's Prince. I left the
theatre applauding the effort, but somewhat doubtful about the result.
The production, sponsored by BMW and the Czech Commercial Bank, moves to
Mannheim in June.

FT  02 APR 94 / Arts: Collectable playboy - Patricia Morison marvels at the
Demidoff exhibition at London's Wallace Collection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The life and times of Anatole Demidoff, Prince of San Donato, now featured
in an exhibition at the Wallace Collection in London, read like the stuff of
novels. Demidoff was a Russian aristocrat with a vast fortune from family
mines and factories in the Urals. Born in St Petersburg in 1812, he died in
Paris in 1870, so ravaged by syphilis that he was cruelly called Count
Decomposition.
Demidoff's was a life of scandalous amorality and yet with his insatiable
appetite for pleasure he combined a streak of philanthropy unusual among
Russians of his class. He, and still more his equally lustful ex-wife
Princess Matilde, feature prominently in accounts of Second Empire Paris.
Elsewhere too, Demidoff has left his mark. When next in Florence, I shall
look for Piazza Demidoff and the huge monument Anatole designed for his
father, the first Prince of San Donato. The marble figures of The Muse of
Society and Siberia with the young god Pluto appear, as well as the
half-naked Anatole at his papa's knee. It is not entirely to modern taste.
Nor, I guess, is Chicken Demidoff - too heavy on caviare and cognac.
The small Wallace Collection show commemorates Demidoff the collector, with
a sparkling essay by Francis Haskell. It relates how the count built up one
of the century's greatest art collections in the villa his father built in
Florence. The Villa San Donato, briefly renamed Villa Matilda in honour of
his wife, was really a palace grander than anything of its kind in
19th-century Florence.
It is unlikely Demidoff needed the money, but perhaps from weariness he
began selling off his collection nine years before he died. These
spectacular sales were highly gratifying to the 4th Marquess of Hertford,
another ageing expatriate roue living in Paris. He bought some 80 objects,
including paintings, watercolours, armour and weapons, snuff-boxes,
knick-nacks and jewels, now in the Wallace Collection.
The exhibition only takes up two small rooms so that had it been anywhere
else one might not think it worth bothering about. But then, this is the
Wallace Collection, a place of rare delights and many art-lovers' favourite
museum in all London. If you have never been, the Wallace Collection has an
unbelievable wealth of paintings, furniture, sculpture, majolica and
porcelain. While a paradise for clock-fanciers, it also has the finest arms
and armour outside the Tower of London.
The museum, five minutes walk from Bond Street in Manchester Square, is in a
brick and stone mansion with 19th-century galleries and sumptuous drawing
rooms so that it hardly feels like a museum at all. The collections were
amassed over three generations by two marquesses of Hertford and an
illegitimate son, Sir Richard Wallace.
Here you will find 17th-century Dutch low-life scenes and 19th-century
Orientalism and the best 18th-century French collection in Britain. Frame to
frame hang superb masterpieces by Titian, Velasquez, Rembrandt, Rubens, Van
Dyck, Boucher, Delacroix and more. Just as people are surprised to realise
that Manet's Bar at the Folie Bergere hangs in the Courtauld Collection, so
the Wallace Collection's trump card is Frans Hals's Laughing Cavalier.
And yet, not one painting nor candlestick have you seen anywhere else. The
Wallace Collection is an exceptional cultural asset seemingly doomed to
obscurity - except that doomed is hardly the right word.
By the terms of Lady Wallace's will, nothing can be either lent or borrowed.
No grandiose temporary shows means almost no press coverage. Hence,
therefore, the freshness and air of exclusivity that reigns over Hertford
House. On its silk-hung walls we find works of art blessedly safe from the
hurly-burly shuttlecockery of the international exhibition scene.
The Demidoff show may be the incentive you need. It sheds light on the
shared tastes of two aristocratic playboys, with money to burn and
conservative tastes. Not for them the Barbizonists or squalid Realist
paintings. Pictures of historical events appealed: battles, lives of
painters and, above all, Napoleon. (Had Matilde not been a Bonaparte, she
would have been safe from Demidoff's clutches.)
Naturally they had an eye for decorative women, for Fragonard's Fountain of
Love and Ary Scheffer's airborne nude in Paulo and Francesca. Paul
Delaroche's Execution of Lady Jane Grey, however, was a little too painful
for the Marquess - or perhaps simply too well clad. She ended up at the
National Gallery.
The exhibition runs to July 25.

FT  02 APR 94 / Arts: Royals on the dole - Alastair Macaulay reviews The
Queen and I, on stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Name? 'Elizabeth Windsor.' (A Social Services officer is interviewing the
next woman in line for an emergency supplementary payment.) 'Address?'
'Number Nine Hellebore Close' 'Former address?' 'Buckingham Palace, The
Mall.' 'What were you doing there?' 'I was being the Queen.' 'You were in an
institution? We can't give you any money.'
Sue Townsend's 1992 bestseller The Queen and I is a dark joke, a barbed
dream of republicanism in which Mrs Elizabeth Windsor and family learn to
live in the modern hell of a council estate in the Midlands. Now it has
become a play, which has just had its premiere, neatly, in the Midlands (at
the Leicester Haymarket), and will tour England and Wales before reaching
London's Royal Court on June 7. The play is different in many details from
the novel. Updated to suit recent Royal developments, and including a few
songs (too few - phew - to qualify it as a musical), it is funny, touching,
shrewd.
Part of the fun of The Queen and I (on page or stage) is to do with Royal
gossip. How would Margaret cope? Philip? The answer in either case is
wickedly amusing. In the stage version the adulterous Charles, who has been
allocated a single person flat, soon shacks up with Leanne, the most
promiscuous girl on the estate, and becomes a good dad to her illegitimate
baby. Diana starts a flirtation with Fitzroy, a local black, and works out
with him ('Once your muscle tone goes, you may as well be dead'). The stage
Queen and I is also mildly feminist: which leads to its funniest scene - a
women's group in which Liz, Diana and neighbours practise assertiveness -
and its best song, What Makes the Husbands Leave Home?' And the fact that
Liz Windsor herself turns out to be matey, outspoken, decent, hard-working,
will please royalists as well as republicans.
But the stage version of The Queen and I is more overtly socialist than the
novel. Some of its stylised versions of gangland chants are trite - a
simplistic effort to understand the gang mentality that sounds in fact
condescending. Elsewhere, however, the realities of council estate life are
caught with realism, as well as humour. It proves both gratifying and
credible (not to mention ironic) that, on her first Christmas Day in her new
home, Mrs Windsor of Hell(ebore) Close, rallies and makes a televised speech
to the nation - no, not the Queen's Speech, de haut en bas, but the reverse:
a pensioner's appeal on behalf of those who, like herself, are making do on
inadequate benefits.
Max Stafford-Clark directs. The fun of all the performances lies less in
their precision of Royal mimicry (though Doon Mackichan makes very witty use
of Diana's tricks with her eyes) than in the impish vigour with which they
bring them to life. Thus Mrs Philomena Toussaint (David Howey) and Mrs Vi
Toby (Carole Hayman) become as vivid to us as their ex-Royal neighbours. The
songs, by Mickey Gallagher and Ian Dury, are the least surefire element of
the show. A certain glee comes from hearing the Windsors and their
neighbours do a rap number, but less than you might hope.
The fine cast is led by Pam Ferris as the Queen - an outstanding
performance. She brings out some surprisingly serious dimensions. Talking
nostalgically to a vision of her old nanny, she suddenly exclaims softly,
'Crawfie - we lived in Paradise'. The line - a gentle echo of Lear's 'I have
ta'en too little care of this' - brings a real pang. At the same time, she
is as good as everyone else in the play's element of naughty caricature. The
way she uses her corgi on that Social Services officer (you have to see
this) is the play's funniest moment.
The Queen and I continues at the Haymarket, Leicester, until April 16. In a
double bill with Jim Cartwright's Road, it tours to Bath, Cardiff, Hull,
Woking, Blackpool, Norwich and the Royal Court Theatre, London.

<TEXT>
Anthony Neilson's new play at the Finborough Arms (SW10) cocks a snook at
John Major's Back to Basics. That is an unsurprising thing for a new play to
do; but though this is a strongly written piece (by the author of
Penetrator, which recently transferred from the Finborough to the Royal
Court Upstairs), its satirical purpose is a touch too deliberate.
The final tableau of family life has been shadowed at the start, and the
intervening development of character and plot turns out to be largely a
strategy for making the ending seem as grotesque as possible.
Largely, but not entirely. The characters are interesting even if the plot
is melodramatic. Two effectively parent-less half-sisters are each living
with an older man: in one case a tramp who has lost his memory and is being
perversely persuaded by Fliss that he is really her long-lost father; in the
other a sadly middle-aged wife-deserter whose affair with Claire is
compromised by the fact that she is enjoying a sado-masochistic relationship
with his angry, layabout, Glaswegian son, Sid. Melodrama ensures a quota of
sticky ends.
The play unfolds in rapidly changing naturalistic scenes like a soap opera,
but has a pungent sexual frankness not yet available to TV and a certain
poetic force. Though Sid is verbally vicious in the best Glaswegian manner,
he can rise to the inclusive metaphor: kinky fun with Claire and some
tabasco becomes a vision of the burning up of the entire social fabric.
Dickie, his father, tells him that he left his wife because she had started
to 'move through life like treacle'. What happens inside a marriage, he
opines, 'is a mystery, like the pyramids or the cosmos'.
Poor kindly Dickie is trying his best to please young Claire but only
alienates her with his inept presents and his guzzling. Roger McKern brings
to the role a well-drawn pathos. Claire herself, reasonable though
hard-bitten, and only sheepishly kinky, is attractively taken by Sophie
Langham. Rachel Weisz is excellent as her 'mad', Sloaney sibling. Timothy
Barlow's Tramp stumbles about with mostly mute grandeur, gasping and
tormented. Alastair Galbraith's Sid is alarmingly close to home.
To make a soap opera convincing in a pub takes much ingenuity. The author,
directing, and his team have exploited every inch.

The West End theatre had a record year in 1993, writes Antony Thorncroft.
Ticket sales topped 11.5m, 6 per cent higher than in 1992, and beating by 2
per cent the previous record year of 1990. Some of this total can be
attributed to the re-opening of three theatres, the Savoy, the Criterion and
the Donmar. But even so, the West End seems in remarkably good health.
In particular, the serious play - long considered endangered in an age when
theatre-goers were besotted by costly, escapist, musicals - has made an
impressive come back. An Inspector Calls, Oleanna, Medea and Six Degrees of
Separation performed well at the box office as did classic revivals such as
The Importance of Being Earnest and She Stoops to Conquer.

SCOTTISH SAMURAI: THOMAS BLAKE GLOVER 1838-1911
by Alexander McKay
Canongate Press Pounds 25, 162 pages
Job losses and employment pressures are hardly new, even if they are causing
pre-millennial stress in most of today's developed countries. They date, no
doubt, from the earliest days of civilisation.
Even in Japan, pressure to cut industrial costs by booting out more and more
workers was building up steam more than a century ago.
Take tea-sifting. In 1867, a resourceful and lusty Scottish businessman,
Thomas Glover, anxious to boost the profits of his three Nagasaki tea
plants, hit upon a way of using steam-driven machinery to sift tea.
The British consul's Report on Trade in Nagasaki for 1867 observed that the
machinery was doing remarkably well, but that 'a better constructed and
finished machine is now on the way out from England . . . It is a great
saving in manual labour, which is a great consideration in an establishment
where 1,600 hands are generally employed during the tea-firing season.'
This machine - invented and constructed on the spot - was state-of-the-art.
We do not learn from Scottish Samurai how many of the 1,600 workers were
thrown into the street by Glover's invention, but the author reckons that
some of Glover's drive and inventiveness rubbed off on the Japanese.
We are also told that Glover can be regarded as one of the guiding spirits
of Japan's 20th century economic miracle.
Scottish Samurai is a remarkable story. The son of a Scottish coastguard
officer, Glover left Aberdeen as a young man, first for Shanghai, then for
Japan. He became an entrepreneur, ship-builder, gun-runner, anti-Shogun
rebel and adviser to Mitsubishi. He was a friend of Japan's first prime
minister and was decorated by the emperor in 1908.
He was also a man of the flesh, fathering at least four children by Japanese
beauties. There is a bridge leading into Nagasaki's red light district of
Maruyama which the Japanese call the Shian Bashi, or Hesitation Bridge.
Further in there is a second bridge, Omoikiri Bashi, or Made-Up-Your-Mind
Bridge, for the tumescently-committed. Glover, it seems, was not one to have
been deterred by Shian Bashi.
This is a great story: the sort that Bernardo Bertolucci would pay good
money for.
The book, however, is unengagingly written and gaspingly over-priced. It
seems to have been partly sponsored by Aberdeen city council. Nothing wrong
with that, especially, except that Pounds 25 for such a flatly-written tale
(the author is 'employed by a major oil company on an oil production
platform in the North Sea', if you please) is impertinent.
Skip the book, and just hope that someone films it.

a new setting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CARLO GEBLER

<TEXT>
BRAZIL
by John Updike
Hamish Hamilton, 261 pp, Pounds 14.
Not to he confused with the film of the same name, John Updike's new novel
is a retelling of the Tristan and Iseult story. The setting, however, is
Brazilian not Breton and the period covered is the 1960s to now.
Yes, this is a departure for the man who has been taking his scalpel to the
American East Coast middle-class and their sexual mores for 30 years. His
skills, however, have not deserted him; first and foremost, his fluency with
words (page succeeding page, it never ceases to amaze); and second, his
facility for structure, for architecture.
The novel starts on Copacabana beach with the first meeting of the
ill-starred couple: Tristao is a black shanty-town dweller, Isabel is the
white upper middle-class daughter of a Brazilian diplomat.
Fleeing from her father (who disapproves of miscegenation), they go west (in
the time-honoured tradition of American fiction) to the Chilean border,
where they meet their nemesis in the form of an Indian shaman. Tejucupapo,
as he is named, turns Tristao white, and Isabel black. Knowing that daddy
can't object now that his son-in-law is the same colour as he is, the couple
retrace their steps through the very terrain through which they had earlier
fled, until at last they arrive at Copacabana, at the very spot where they
met 20-odd years earlier. The narrative then draws to its melancholy
conclusion.
And this being Updike, there is naturally a corresponding emotional
symmetry. When the couple first meet, Isabel, is in awe of her 'bit of black
rough' with his 'swelling yam', while Tristao is gentlemanly and humble. She
wants to submit and to serve; meanwhile, he can't believe his luck. Once
their colouring is reversed, she becomes aggressive, while Tristao,
eschewing chivalry, wrestles her into submission and then partakes with her
(some people aren't going to like this) 'of the criminal bliss of rape'.
Which brings this reviewer to that other Updike hallmark: his interest in
sex because of what it reveals about character, and the unflinching
virtuosity with which he describes the many and varied private acts of
couples - all without ever becoming titillating or striking a false note.
Yes, again this is a typical Updike book; there is a lot of sex in it, but
it is emphatically not a work which one would describe as 'sexy'.
In Brazil, one finds Updike as he always is; and those who like him should
like this novel, although maybe not quite as much as those books in which
the old wordsmith is describing his native habitat. The North American
settings, because they are familiar to the author, obviously come easier to
him. In Brazil, he has had to marshal an enormous amount of research and
then represent it in Updike-speak.
His energy, however, is unstinting and his panache is extraordinary. Whether
he's writing about Brazilian flora and fauna (his descriptions of natural
history in this book are superb) or the miserable gold mining area in the
Dourada, he's always engaging.
While Updike is always Updike the question remains: why South America, why
Brazil? Well, why not, is one answer. Nabokov changed from old to new world,
switching languages in the process. Graham Greene may have been Berkhamsted
born and bred, but that didn't not stop him writing about Indo-China and
South America.
But those writers had an aptitude for such an endeavour, whereas Updike is
not a chameleon who can change his colouring to suit his locale.
Another answer is that writers need new worlds and they are perfectly
entitled to carve them out. Perhaps Updike is bored with his usual milieu
and wants a change. Maybe, but I suspect that what lies behind Brazil is
something deeper and more important.
North America, for white writers at any rate, is no longer the epic canvas
that it once was. Everything's been conquered; there's nothing left to
discover.
The world Updike trawled in the Rabbit series and Couples has been
over-fished. White middle-class America is also getting smaller and, as it
shrinks, it becomes - at least for a writer of Updike's particular
intelligence - a less congenial place.
Updike can use the 'R' word to describe the love-making (sic) of two
Brazilians and get away with it. However, relocate the narrative to say, New
Hampshire, and chances are the Thought Police from the Ministry of Political
Correctness are going to go nuts.
'Hey,' I can hear them saying after reading the passage referred to, 'he
supports rape in marriage.'
He doesn't. But if you're one of those sexual hygiene freaks who believe the
world should conform to your beliefs and can't bear it being messy, untidy
and contradictory, you could easily persuade yourself that he does.
Given these factors (and the pressure on writers to conform is only one part
of this picture), it should come as no surprise that Updike has moved south
to give himself more room in which to operate.
Perhaps this is also a signal of a larger change that white middle-class
American writers are about to make. If it is, the world will not be any the
poorer for it - so long as Updike's high standards are maintained - for
Brazil is a fine and memorable achievement.
Novelist and film-maker Carlo Gebler's fifth novel, The Cure, will be
published next February.

FT  02 APR 94 / Books: Brittan stakes a claim on glory - Conservatives may
not be too happy with this European manifesto

<TEXT>
THE EUROPE WE NEED
by Sir Leon Brittan
Hamish Hamilton, Pounds 17.99, 248 pages
It may seem a rum idea, especially after the events of the past couple of
weeks, that the European Union should choose a Brit as the next president of
the European Commission. Yet Sir Leon Brittan, the former cabinet minister
and a long-standing vice-president of the Commission, is strongly in the
running for the post. This book is his manifesto.
Not all members of the British Conservative Party will like it. Sir Leon is
in favour of moving towards European monetary union as soon as possible. He
believes that it will be hard to maintain the European single market without
a single European currency. He defends the objectives of the common
agricultural policy. And not only does he accept the Treaty of Maastricht
pretty well en bloc; he thinks it should be built on.
Whereas UK Prime Minister John Major once said that Britain should be at the
heart of Europe, Sir Leon comes close to arguing that an enlarged European
Union is Europe.
He does not say, but clearly implies, that its development will continue
with or without the full participation of the British.
A natural Tory reaction to the book might be that Sir Leon has 'gone
native', though in truth he was pretty native to start with. None of that,
however, should prevent the British government from fully supporting his
candidacy. It must be better for Britain to have someone they know and
understand in a place that matters.
Anyway, it is not primarily Westminster and Whitehall at which the book is
aimed. The main target is Paris and some of the smaller European capitals.
For there can be no question of the next president of the commission being a
Frenchman since the outgoing president is Jacques Delors. Even the French
would not expect to hold the post twice in a row.
The Germans have seldom been seriously interested in putting up a candidate
of their own, and the Italians have retreated into their internal affairs.
So if the presidency is to go to a big country, Britain is in with a chance
despite the fact that there was a British president - the now Lord Jenkins
of Hillhead - from 1977-81. With French support and the sympathy of the
smaller countries, Sir Leon could be there.
On the evidence of The Europe We Need he would be the right man for the job.
The 'we' in the title is left ambiguous. It could refer to Britain or to the
Union as a whole. Sir Leon does not discriminate. As a lawyer by training,
he realises the size of the task, which is no less than to continue to
develop the constitution of an expanding united states of Europe.
Those words are mine, not his, and the choice of small letters for united
states is deliberate. Yet that is exactly what the book is about. Sir Leon
goes through the whole range of policies. He wants free trade, deregulation
and vastly reduced state subsidies, all of which we know.
On a European defence policy, he prefers to go slowly and only on the basis
of consensus - a line that should appeal to the French as well as the
British. He would not over-hurry the entry of eastern European countries,
but would help them on the way.
The core of the book, however, concerns his views of the Union's
institutions, in particular the Commission and the European Parliament. To
outsiders, the Commission frequently appears an interfering bugbear. The
normal inside view is that it is simply the Union's civil service, proposing
policies to the Council of Ministers but not taking ultimate decisions, and
not much bigger than some of the London borough councils.
Sir Leon has a different emphasis. He writes that the Commission was
'conceived as more than a secretariat, but definitely less than a
government'. Under the Delors presidency, he argues that it 'reclaimed its
status as a political body'. He would like to move on from there and
streamline the Commission's activities.
Especially after the next enlargement, the Commission would take more of the
form of a national government. There would be a greater hierarchy and an end
to the horizontal structure where, in theory, all commissioners are equal.
Instead there would be seniors and juniors. The big countries would always
have a senior post; junior posts would rotate between all member states.
Any potential loss of democratic control would be balanced by greater powers
for the European Parliament and a new committee of parliament, made up of
members of national parliaments and designed to oversee the work of the
Commission and the Council of Ministers.
There are many more proposals: for instance, for a three-tier voting system
that would preserve the principle of unanimity on important questions. Yet
it is on the parliamentary side that Sir Leon seems least sure of himself. A
bold man would propose either to abolish the Parliament altogether, allowing
scrutiny to lie with national parliaments, or to give it more direct power.
This is at the heart of the British dilemma, particularly in the Tory Party.
Westminster is jealous of the powers of the European Parliament: the MEPs
have little access to Westminster, hence there is no co-ordination.
One answer might be to restore the dual mandate, allowing British
politicians to sit in both places. Until the dilemma is resolved, the
British Parliament is likely to remain hostile to Brussels and Strasbourg.
Sir Leon may not have all the answers, but as a lawyer he reads the texts
and takes them seriously.
The great British failing has been to ignore the texts - such as the Treaty
of Rome - until it was too late to change them.
This book should be read as a draft text on the future of the Union, for Sir
Leon is in the mainstream of Europe.

HOW WE DIE
by Sherwin Nuland
Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 15.99, 280 pages
Nuland clearly does not give a damn about bestseller status; surely some
marketing executive tried to dissuade him from such a comfortless title?
But, as he writes, in his seventh decade he knows he has little energy or
time to spare for mealy-mouthed euphemism.
Praise be for both title and book: a painstaking examination of the half
dozen commonest avenues leading towards life's only certainty - death.
A consultant surgeon with 30 years of experience in US hospitals, Nuland has
written a fine book about the process of dying and the lessons he has
learned from trying to prevent death. The book is suffused with a robust,
humane tone, with the flavour of Thomas Love Peacock's 'we are all of us
born to disappointment; it is as well to be prospective'. Neither coldly
stoic nor falsely sentimental, Nuland evinces a literary mind, one equally
capable of dissecting a corpse as of placing death in a larger,
philosophical and literary context. He has distilled the medical essences,
the esoteric Latin names and complex anatomical details into a skilled
literary journey towards the Styx.
Here we see Alzheimer's, cancer, Aids and all the other major killers
against which we are impotent. How they work; how we suffer; how our loved
ones share the agonies. Nuland has few certainties apart from the clinical,
but his most significant is that the greatest futility of medical research
is its hunt for an elixir which will endlessly stave off death. We must die
to make room for those that follow. Given that his text is as well graced by
literary as medical references, it is therefore odd that he overlooks
Swift's Struldbrugs, the immortal creatures in Gulliver's Travels who were
condemned to agonies of perpetual boredom, regret and lassitude. Nuland
understands these.
But if there are few certainties there are useful sagacities. 'The dignity
that we seek in dying must be found in the dignity with which we have lived
our lives . . . The honesty and grace of the years of life that are ending
is the real measure of how we die.'
When he says towards the end that he will not 'allow a specialist to decide
(for him) when to let go' because 'I will not die later than I should simply
for the senseless reason that a highly skilled technological physician does
not understand who I am', that feels a perfectly logical conclusion to a
lifetime grappling with irrationalities.
How We Die is not bleak, though its subject is awful for most of us. Nuland
hopes his book shows relentless death can be rendered less mysterious, and
thereby far less terrifying. Of the numerous personal stories he gently,
almost lovingly recalls, there is one unifying thread - apart from death
itself. It is that courage to face death squarely is perhaps the greatest
comfort of all. His words ought to enjoy longevity.

JOHN STEINBECK: A BIOGRAPHY
by Jay Parini
Heinemann, Pounds 20, 614 pages
Is it still true, as I suppose, that most people love reading John Steinbeck
in their teens, yet only rarely return to him in their maturity? Was his
friend John Hersey right when, explaining Steinbeck's astronomical sales, he
said, 'Readers loved him. Even people who really did read books read
Steinbeck'? Has persistent denigration by academic critics denied him his
proper reputation notwithstanding his Nobel Prize?
The virtue of this long but readable book is that Jay Parini, by achieving
an excellent balance between biography and literary appreciation - always a
difficult task - makes a strong case for the quality of Steinbeck's work in
the course of a well-told life story.
He establishes the structure with confident authority: the family homes in
Salinas and Monterey; the unsatisfactory parents who nevertheless supported
their son while he mastered his trade; the failure at Stanford; the early
experience on the road, as labourer, rancher, sailor, solitary; the three
wives, the alcohol and the depressions; the unfailing conviction of his
vocation as writer; and then the breakthrough to worldwide success with
Tortilla Flat, followed by Of Mice and Men and, in 1939,The Grapes of Wrath.
Parini then moves deeper. He understands that the fame of The Grapes of
Wrath - one of the great 'angry books', the instant classic which describes
so unforgettably the plight of the Okies fleeing from the Dust Bowl - can
mislead us about Steinbeck's true gifts. The 1930s may have been the period
when the American novel went political but Steinbeck, an instinctive New
Deal Democrat rather than a radical sophisticate, always knew that realism
was, in his words, 'a dead end for the novel'.
His own ambitions lay more in the myth-making function of the artist. He had
a life-long obsession with the Arthurian legend (which is clear in Tortilla
Flat and Cannery Row) and, arising out of his scientific bent, he held
well-developed theories about the relationship between the individual and
the larger social unit which he called the 'phalanx'.
'Man is a double thing,' he once wrote, 'a group animal and at the same time
an individual. And it occurs to me that he cannot successfully be the second
until he has fulfilled the first.' That is rather a good way of
understanding The Grapes of Wrath.
As Parini points out, this philosophy is not so far from Jung's Collective
Unconscious, and it is particularly interesting to find that one of
Steinbeck's close friends in pre-war Monterey was Joseph Campbell, later to
become America's most influential mythologist. (This California group of
'whores, scientists, bums, winos and local artists' included Steinbeck's
best friend, the marine biologist Ed Ricketts, George Albee and John Cage,
as well as Campbell, who had an affair with Carol Steinbeck which may have
contributed to the eventual divorce.)
Out of all this detail, Parini focuses on his argument: 'Like Joyce and
Eliot and any number of other writers, Steinbeck used myth to organise his
ideas and ground his work in archetypal patterns. The important point is
that Steinbeck summoned a reality that was fresh and highly particularised,
always trying to examine 'the group' and its effects on the individual.'
There is a lovely line from Steinbeck's diary as he was writing Grapes -
'Carol says, stay with the detail'.
After earning a mere Dollars 870 in his first seven years, Steinbeck took
off. The critics soon decided that he had peaked already, but the public
disagreed. There were to be films and plays and travel books and journalism,
as well as more novels.
Parini takes us smoothly through the fame and the fortune, the years as war
correspondent, the move to New York, the bad second marriage and failure as
a father, divorce and more drink and crisis, a happy third marriage, East of
Eden and the screenplay of Viva Zapata].
Steinbeck wrote a book a year between 1931 and 1950 and was only defeated by
his attempt on his beloved Malory, for which he moved to Glastonbury.
These later years are told at a fast lick, but it would be churlish to
complain. The argument of the book is not simply that Steinbeck is unfairly
under-esteemed but that it is wrong of the critics to declare that his work
declined after the famous bestsellers.
Does Parini make his case?
I suspect that he protests too much. But in order to be sure, I'll have to
go back to the books - which is a good test of a good biography.

FT  02 APR 94 / Sport: Tracking the next generation - The state of British
tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At a time when gloom has descended on those who follow tennis in Britain,
with last week's humiliating Davis Cup defeat at the hands of lowly
Portugal, it may seem surprising to suggest that the much-maligned Lawn
Tennis Association, after years of stagnation, is at last getting it right.
But that is what the facts indicate, in spite of the resignation of captain
Tony Pickard, who has had more success with Stefan Edberg than with British
teams.
The role of the LTA is to encourage the game's growth at grass roots level,
to build facilities that will allow that growth to take place, to establish
a competitive structure for counties, clubs and individuals, and to provide
training and guidance for the best of our players so that they may fulfil
their potential.
During the post-war period those objectives were shamefully neglected. For
40 years club and county tennis continued cosily as an elitist sport with
little attempt by the LTA to broaden its appeal. A few ambitious clubs did
replace the wooden clubhouses that had been constructed in the 1920s and
1930s with more substantial premises, but most were reluctant to modernise,
worried that higher annual subscriptions would lose members. Golf and squash
had no such inhibitions.
Meanwhile the rest of Europe was building for the future. The French, for
example, first under Marcel Bernard and then for 20 years under Philippe
Chatrier, transformed the fortunes of both the French open and the national
club infrastructure, based on its regional leagues.
It was always a weakness of the LTA that its chairman served for only one
year. There was no continuity of leadership and the well-intentioned, but
inadequate, amateur officials were more concerned about planning their paths
to the summit than in revitalising the game. The extension to a three-year
term in 1982, when the post of chairman was changed to president, was an
improvement but it was not until the appointment of a full-time executive
director in 1986 that a truly professional approach could begin.
Ian Peacock has held that post for seven years and has presided over a
growth in LTA registered membership from 16,000 to 52,000 - and an increase
in the number of tournaments from 500 to 900.
He has seen the number of multi-court indoor centres built under the Indoor
Tennis Initiative grow from zero to 29, with 11 more in various stages of
development. He has encouraged private clubs to build indoor courts and
reports investment of 5.5m in projects at various stages of completion.
County centres have already been built in Derbyshire, Norfolk and
Buckinghamshire and eight more are about to come on stream.
Thanks largely to the increasing revenues from Wimbledon, which passes its
surplus to the LTA each year (Pounds 16.4m in 1993), a bold five-year
programme of facility developments, totalling Pounds 63m, is under way. In
Nottingham, Edinburgh and Bournemouth, construction has already begun on
large tournament sites where the court surface will be an American version
of clay.
Two other key centres, one in Wales the other in the home counties, will be
similarly equipped. In total there will be 41 clay courts in use at these
sites by 1996. All will be available for national and county training at
agreed times.
The importance of clay as a surface for young players to learn their skills
can hardly be over-emphasised - especially in Davis Cup matches.
Years ago there used to be a springtime circuit on shale courts which,
though faster and more slippery than continental clay courts, had roughly
the same playing characteristics.
Clubs found their upkeep too costly and were encouraged by the LTA to
replace shale with acrylic hard courts, the surface used by more and more
international tournaments. Thus a generation of players grew up with no
chance to develop clay court skills at home.
As Richard Lewis, director of national training, admits: 'When we tried to
address that problem five years ago by constructing European clay courts in
key areas we ignored what was an altogether more appropriate surface for our
climate - American clay with its year-round usage against the seven months
of European clay and much lower maintenance courts.'
Now clubs are being encouraged to lay the American surface with grants of
Pounds 5,000 per court for a minimum of two, provided they also commit to a
junior development programme. It is a welcome, if belated move.
Lewis has sensibly surrounded himself with highly qualified coaches and
captains. Ann Jones looks after the Federation Cup women, and Mark Cox heads
up the Rover scheme for young hopefuls and is assisted by former US Wightman
Cup player Sharon Walsh.
Another former highly ranked American, Janet Newberry, started this week as
the new women's national training manager, and will attempt to bring the
same belief to her players that Bill Knight has instilled so impressively
among the men.
Former Russian No 1, Olga Morozova, and Ian Barclay, Pat Cash's coach, look
after the 12-16 age group at the Rover School at Bisham Abbey. Barclay also
contributes to the education of coaches.
With Dr Michael Turner appointed as the new medical officer, alongside
nutritionist Dawn Thorpe and trainer Steve Green, the former Olympic
sprinter, there is a thoroughly professional look about the LTA's training
department.
The fact that the men have just lost to Portugal merely confirms their known
inadequacy on clay. On hard courts or grass it is a different story. Mark
Petchey, who lost both singles in Portugal, has just beaten World No 2
Michael Stich and was within a whisker of beating Andre Agassi in Key
Biscayne. At Wimbledon last year, Andrew Foster, Chris Wilkinson and Chris
Bailey all performed to their full potential.
The next generation will be better prepared. At this very moment 25 boys and
girls aged between 12 and 15 are at the Bruguera club in Spain where, for
three weeks, they will learn the basics of competing on European clay. It is
a skill few Britons have ever mastered. Fred Perry is still the only British
man ever to have won the French Open - and that was 59 years ago.

FT  02 APR 94 / Sport: Around the world in 80, 70, 60 days? - Yachting

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Joked Robin Knox-Johnston: 'Weather forecasts are a very perishable
commodity.'
Those people anxiously scanning the horizon during the Easter holiday might
well agree. Unlike most holidaymakers, Knox-Johnston had his fingers crossed
for a south-westerly gale. He was speaking by radio from the deck of ENZA
New Zealand, while it was still 1,000 miles away from Brest and the record
for a circumnavigation under sail.
Knox-Johnston was predicting that she would clip four days off the existing
79-day record, and the voyage was completed yesterday in 74 days, 22 hours
and 17 minutes. Bruno Peyron, the French multi-hull star, set the 79-day
record a year ago.
ENZA is the biggest, most powerful catamaran afloat. To achieve such a
remarkable voyage her eight-man crew, led by Knox-Johnston and co-skipper
Peter Blake, have sailed her round Capes Horn and Good Hope at average
speeds close to those of a cross-channel car ferry.
'We're perky but all pretty tired,' reported Blake, skipper of the winning
Steinlager II in the Whitbread race of 1989-90.
'Even the youngest and strongest are puffing and panting when they handle
sails. It's the lack of aerobic fitness.' Our longest walk is 20ft to the
loo.'
Blake spent nearly two weeks confined to his bunk after a serious back
injury in the first month of the trip. Convalescing in such surroundings
makes one think warmly of crumbling inner-city out-patient departments.
'I fell 8ft on to the edge of the chart table,' explained Blake, a broad man
weighing around 200lbs. 'The boat came off the front of a big sea at an
angle of 45 degrees and instantly went from 28 knots to stationary. I was
just coming out of the hatch and just fell backwards.'
He broke a couple of ribs and several muscles tore away from the pelvis.
Initially kidney damage was suspected and medics consulted by high frequency
radio were talking about a helicopter evacuation via Tasmania. 'Fortunately,
Peter's a big strong lad,' said Knox-Johnston, with the sympathy of
Bluebeard.
On the outward leg of the journey ENZA had some of the most exciting sailing
one can imagine. In the first 16 days after leaving Brest she averaged 403
miles a day meaning, in practice, well over 20 knots for much of the time.
Crew-member David Alan-Williams, a naval architect who designed the radical
trimaran Steinlager I for Blake in the mid-1980s, gives the landlubber a
telling analogy for helming ENZA at high speed during darkness.
'Drive down the nearest motorway at night, when it is raining hard, with the
car at maximum speed,' he advised. 'Turn off the headlights and turn sharp
left across the nearest ploughed field.'
He was not able to think of a way to recreate the effect of a lookout in the
bows, calling out drift-ice. Collisions are a sensitive subject aboard ENZA.
A year ago the catamaran's first record attempt was abandoned after it hit a
submerged object. In early 1993 most observers still doubted whether the
Jules Verne Trophy was achievable. To sail around the world non-stop in 80
days or less seemed unimaginable.
The reality is now clear. But the sailors still need luck. At Cape Horn, the
fair weather for ENZA ran out. She was hove-to in the middle of a severe
storm for nearly two days. Blake described it as the worst sea-state he had
seen in 500,000 miles and 20 years of ocean-racing.
'In the Drake Passage off Tierra del Fuego we had 60ft seas on the beam and
all we could do was sit there and roll. It's not too good for
record-breaking,' he observed.
For Knox-Johnston, 55, the circumnavigation has brought back a few memories
and provided a sharp comparison. In 1969, as a 30-year-old merchant navy
officer, he won the solo Round the World race in his wooden ketch Suhaili.
She was built in Bombay by gentle Indian shipwrights using adzes. ENZA came
out of an aircraft factory, constructed largely of carbon-fibre.
'To put the speeds into some sort of perspective, 25 years ago I averaged
four knots around the world,' said Knox-Johnston. 'ENZA has been averaging
more than four times that.'
On just the sixth day after leaving Brest on the Atlantic coast of France,
ENZA logged an extraordinary 520.9 miles in a 24-hour run while reaching off
Sierra Leone. It is claimed as a world record, but has yet to be ratified.
The question everyone is asking is just how fast can a sailing boat circle
the globe? When the Trophee Jules Verne (for breaking 80 days) was first
proposed in France it was ridiculed as unattainable.
'I think 70 days is quite feasible but you'd need a lot of luck with the
weather,' said the naturally-cautious Blake.
Meanwhile, in France, the initial record-breaker Bruno Peyron is working on
design and sponsorship for a 125ft, schooner-rigged catamaran capable of 45
knots. Sixty days around the world is the target in his sights.

FT  02 APR 94 / Sport: Forget the Masters, this is serious - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is only one serious golf tournament next week - and it is not at
Augusta.
Several hours before Greg Norman and others tee off on Thursday for the 1994
US Masters, 640 golfers, mainly British, will assemble at Royal Cinque Ports
(Deal) and Royal St George's (Sandwich) in Kent for the Halford Hewitt Cup,
an annual contest between old boys of some of Britain's best-known public
schools.
The unique character of the event is hard to pin down. Suffice to say that
it is a combination (among other things) of that peculiarly British
affection for the alma mater, the glorious unpredictability of the
(peculiarly British) weather, the unfamiliar pressures in this highly
individualistic sport of playing for a team, and the chance to renew
acquaintances from year to year.
The 'Hewitt', which dates back to 1924, probably owes at least as much to
the inspiration of a Cambridge golf and soccer blue called G L 'Susie'
Mellin as it does to Halford W. Hewitt who presented the Cup. According to
Peter Ryde, who chronicled the first 60 years of the competition in his book
A Festival of Foursomes*: 'What is important in thinking of the tournament
is that the name of one should not be remembered without that of the other.'
In a foreword to Ryde's book the late Gerald Micklem (one of England's
finest amateur golfers) wrote that the Hewitt was really a series of little
tournaments within a big one.
For many of the 64 participating schools getting through one round - or
beating an old foe - is the limit of their ambition. Reaching the last 16 on
Saturday morning when everyone moves to Deal - the true 'home' of the Hewitt
 -is another incentive for those drawn to play their first two rounds at
Sandwich.
Part of the unpredictability lies in the draw, which always takes place at
the East India Club in London in January and is unseeded.
This means strong teams often clash early on - Eton and Harrow being a case
in point this time - while others have a supposedly 'easier' ride.
My own school, Uppingham, appears to be in that happy position this year,
judging by a complex table compiled by our organiser and showing the number
of quarter-final and semi-final appearances over the last 10 years of all
the teams in each section of the draw.
The official 'form guide', however, is the so called Andersen scale - named
after a veteran Malvern campaigner - which ranks schools on the basis of
both their overall record and their recent record.
What stands out is the sheer consistency of those at the top: the best
between 1984 and 1993 (Malvern, Shrewsbury, Tonbridge, Harrow, Watson's and
Eton) all feature in the top 10 'all comers'.
The standard of golf reflects the mixed composition of many teams - from
players who have represented their countries to the club hackers sometimes
required to make up numbers. Reputations, though, count for little when the
wind blows and nerves start to jangle.
There are few more stomach-cramping experiences than the dawning realisation
that it is 'your' match which will be the decider, that the rest of the team
and its camp followers are gathering around the 18th green to watch the
action, and that you may have a three-foot putt or less to take it down the
19th.
And what a 19th (by which I do not mean the clubhouse). Played for the first
time the first at Deal seems a relatively straightforward par four - a drive
and a flick for longer hitters.
Played for the second time - perhaps in front of scores of other competitors
relaxing on the clubhouse verandah - the burn across the front of the green
suddenly becomes a daunting challenge even with wedge in hand.
At least one school has lost after two of its five pairs won their matches
by handsome margins in the 'country', whereas the other three all lost after
extra holes.
Ryde's book sums it up by quoting the verdict of one competitor to the
effect that the Hewitt would be the greatest fun in the world were it not
for the golf. Another has a sodden North of England, Scottish or West
Country competitor remarking: 'If I'd known it was foursomes, I'd never have
come'.
Best of all perhaps is the 'telegram story' of 1949 which sounded a still
relevant warning for successful schools who take their opponents too
lightly. It involves the late Leonard Crawley, a golf writer on the Daily
Telegraph and pillar of the formidably strong Harrow side, who failed to
arrive in time for a first round match at Deal.
His hapless captain later in the day received a telegram from the victorious
underdogs which read simply: 'Tell Crawley bring his pen but leave clubs
behind'.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Christy O'Connor neither won a major championship nor assembled a good Ryder
Cup record. So if crude statistics are the measure then the Irishman will
struggle for a place in history as those who witnessed his genius diminish
with the years.
Thankfully, there is not yet a shortage of such witnesses to counterbalance
the statistical distortions, and they have queued up to contribute to a
diligently researched biography of the great man as he approaches his 70th
year.
It is entitled Himself (Colorman, Pounds 16.99), the name given to O'Connor
many years ago by his supporters in recognition of the fact that he never
tried to be anyone else. Edited by Seamus Smith, sports editor of the Irish
Press newspaper, the book pieces together O'Connor's life from chapters
written by various golf journalists and fellow professionals.
Like Ballesteros, some of O'Connor's best moments in his career came at
Lytham. In his first three Opens over the Lancashire links he never finished
outside the top six, and last year, aged 68, he still finished tied for 8th
in the British Seniors Championship.
His last Open appearance also came at Lytham in 1979, which marked the first
of Ballesteros' two wins. So why did O'Connor never win a major
championship?
Well he failed to win an American major because he never played in any.
O'Connor received 18 invitations to the US Masters at Augusta and turned
them down because he could not afford the fare.
But he did play in 28 Opens and led a few, too. The consensus, including
O'Connor's view, is that he tried too hard.
O'Connor won just about everything else he played in over a long, long
career. His record 10 Ryder Cup appearances is testament to that longevity.
Even at 59, he still finished 26th in the Irish Open.
Two years ago, he was asked to partner Jack Nicklaus to mark the completion
of a course Nicklaus built in Kilkenny. The organiser feared the ageing
O'Connor would be shown up in front of his own people as the course is of a
daunting length Jack shot 74. Christie shot 72.

FT  02 APR 94 / Financial Times Round the World Ski Expedition: Skiing
through a packed lunch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They began the year in North America and moved
to Europe in the middle of March.
We have come a long way since we skied Cloudmont, Alabama in torrential rain
on March 1. In the past few days we have hurtled down the slopes of St
Anton, Lech and Zurs under a cobalt blue sky and Sagamore - and a host of
other strange towns in the US - seems like a dream to us now.
During our final fortnight in the US we passed through places such as
Accident, Mechanicsville, Krumsville and even Ambridge.
But since arriving in Austria we have driven far less and skied far more,
catching up on some of the backlog in our effort to ski 5,000 miles during
our year on the slopes.
If we could spend the whole of 1994 in Europe we could ski 5,000 miles with
comparative ease. However with the prospect of glacier skiing, when the snow
is hardly skiable after mid afternoon, and skiing out of season in the
Himalayas and Japan, our target is likely to slip further from our grasp.
After leaving Alabama for North Carolina, a look out of the window in Maggie
Valley (named after a former postman's daughter), told us all we wanted to
know: it was still raining. We guessed it would rain all day - and it did.
We braced ourselves for an uncomfortable day skiing at Cataloochee knowing
that at least it had a more respectable vertical drop - 730 vertical feet -
than we had found in some other southern and mid-west resorts.
The next day managed to be worse: fresh snow on the ground, freezing rain
and thick fog in the air. Hunched nervously over the wheel of our huge white
limousine from Indianapolis, which was not equipped with winter tyres or
front-wheel drive, and peering through the windscreen for any sign at all of
the outside world, we slithered past the entrance to Sugar Mountain without
even seeing it, and climbed higher into the fog.
'Where is this damn mountain?' I asked Lucy desperately. Any mountain would
have done - so we made do with Beech Mountain, which we chanced upon. We
didn't care that a number of unhappy skiers were queueing to demand their
money back - we were at last going to get our skis on snow.
Conditions were, however, unusually difficult: icy patches, strong winds,
and a resort anxious to capitalise on the sudden low temperatures by
switching on all the snow cannon. But the thick fog meant the cannon were
invisible. Skiing quietly and listening like mad was the only way of
avoiding a faceful of icy snow or even a collision with a snow gun.
For the third day running, all thoughts of trying to catch up with our
miserable mileage were lost in the gloom.
We found Sugar Mountain when at last the sun came out. By lingering there
into the night and going back for more the next day, we clocked up 25 miles
in our two visits. This was more like it.
But on the road, things were still not going well. In The Virginias, Lucy
plotted a course from Snowshoe to Massanutten which she promised me 'would
not involve any mountains'. We set off, Lucy fell asleep, and I negotiated
six mountain passes in 160 miles. I didn't count the night's tally of
hairpin bends, but they came thick and fast.
During an equally difficult drive the following night to Wisp, Maryland, the
freezing fog on Backbone Pass became so frighteningly impenetrable that even
though the occasional truck went trundling through I simply had to stop the
car and wait for it to clear. It never did, so with teeth gritted and
eyebrows knitted we drove blind for a couple of hundred yards until we
suddenly found ourselves out of the clouds. How do the truck drivers do it?
The journey from Liberty, Pennsylvania to Belleayre, New York was even worse
and to spare ourselves a dice with death we booked ourselves a room at a
roadside hotel in Newfoundland, not far from a place called The Promised
Land.
I like the way American resorts have themes. In New York State, our last
port of call in the US, Belleayre's trails all have Indian names: among them
are Wanatuska, Tongora, Utsayantha and Nimkish.
Hunter Mountain, where New York skiers congregate, dedicates many of its
trails to famous New York areas - Madison Square, Central Park, 7th Avenue
and Broadway - as does Hunter Mountain Shiobara, its namesake in Japan.
Nearby, Windham's trail names all start with W: Wolverene, Wonderfully
Wicked, Why Not? and - rather insensitively - Wheelchair.
New York state, as the locals point out, is very different from New York
city. Larry Miller of the River Run B&amp;B in Fleischmann's, a picturesque
Catskills town, escaped to the mountains from New York but goes back
occasionally.
'No one locks their doors around here,' he says. 'But when I have guests
from New York the first thing they want to know is can they lock their
bedroom doors.
'When I go back to New York I become just like them. But it's so peaceful
and crime free here you'd never believe it was the same state.'
Not entirely crime free, however: a week before we arrived at fashionable
Hunter Village, one guest shot another dead at the Heartbreak Hotel.
After visiting towns based on the Americans' idea of what a Tyrolean village
ought to look like (Leavenworth, Washington State was the best attempt, and
Gatlinburg, Tennessee the tackiest) it was a joy to be back in the real
thing.
Kitzbuhel, even with patchy snow, was a delight, and a fair portion of
Soll's Ski Welt circuit was intact. Mayrhofen had plenty of snow although
much of it was verging on boilerplate.
One closed run almost robbed us of a meeting with one of the Zillertal's
great characters, an 82-year-old farmer called Andler. 'It is a shame this
run is closed,' said Charly, our guide. 'There's a great schnapps hut down
there. Shall we do it?'
Lucy did not need to be asked twice. In a trice she was at the door of
Andler's dilapidated hut and the toothless incumbent fixed her with a
sparkling eye, planting a wet kiss on her cheek.
A makeshift bed sprawled in the corner of the room where the old man made
his schnapps and his cheese, and he promptly suggested that Lucy might like
a rest after her drink.
She declined, which did not prevent his hands wandering as we left.
'He may have been 82, but he was certainly not dead to the world,' said
Lucy. 'Andler is quite an appropriate name.'
There were so many people in St Anton, Lech and Zurs last week that we
decided to eat late and ski hard during the lunch hour.
But skiing through lunch took on a new meaning when two restaurants opposite
each other on the trail down from Valluga to Stuben overflowed, blocking the
piste so that we had to weave through a sea of off-duty skiers.
In Lech we spotted dozens of Princess of Wales look-alikes in powder-blue
suits. And then we saw the real thing, also skiing in her lunch hour.
The Princess skis rather nicely these days. Such a shame she cannot be left
to ski in peace. But then, she chooses high profile resorts.
I have picked up plenty of great contacts in Alabama, North Carolina and
Tennessee which she is welcome to. They would never spot her in a million
years in Ober Gatlinburg, Tennessee.

FT  02 APR 94 / Gardening: Heading for the last Roundup - Poisoning, pruning
and planting, that's the programme for Easter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Early Easters are a blessing for gardeners and this one rounds off a
miraculous March. The wind might have been strong but spring flowers are
running in the fast lane.
The flowering cherries have gone mad and nobody, not even in Eden, can ever
have had a better Saturday than last weekend's. If Easter repeats that, even
non-gardeners will wonder what they can best do outside.
If you trust them, put them to work on the three essential 'p's' in
horticultural life - poisoning, pruning and planting.
The indispensable poison is still Roundup, which is the correct starting
point for anyone with a new garden or plans for a new bed. I emphasise this
every year because it kills by contact with greenery, not by lingering in
the soil. It wipes out rough grass, dandelions, nettles and buttercups and
shakes up everything unwanted, annihilating annual weeds.
Conditions are perfect for its use this weekend. Your worst enemies are
bursting ahead of themselves into frantic early growth and, if you choose a
dry spell of a few hours, you can round them up and reckon that one or two
applications will kill them by the end of the month.
My own Easter enemies have two origins: the wet winter and the surrounding
lawn. The exceptional rains have turned almost everybody's lawns into pile
carpets of uninvited moss. It might look soft and cuddly this weekend but,
in a normal June, the entire carpet will die and turn brown, and the lawn
will look fearful. I am intending to strike first with Maxicrop Moss Killer,
raking out the debris at the end of the month.
The lawn bothers me for a different reason. After six years of frantic
upheaval on my new site, I now see that nature has quickly diagnosed one of
my great blind spots. I made flower beds in the lawn and did not edge them
with a solid barrier against the adjacent grass. It intrudes with amazing
cunning and the buttercups are unspeakable.
If you are cutting out a new bed of any size, it pays to edge it with a
solid barricade, something much firmer than the strips of thin metal which
are palmed off on 'front gardeners' by DIY stores. In Oxford, my
predecessors in the years of academic splendour edged the lawns with long
runs of solid metal, 3in wide and  1/2 in thick.
Metalworkers or blacksmiths will quote you a price for special orders in
quantity, but we have come down a grade in the Patten-Major era and now are
using long lengths of treated timber,  3/4 in thick and 4in wide. They are
held firm by pegs knocked at intervals into their undersides and hammered
down into the ground. The timber then sits at the level of the adjoining
lawn but blocks all the invaders which try to violate your recognised
boundaries.
Wooden edging will last for 10 to 15 years, by which time we may be back
with an age of academic splendour, and metal can return. But anyone who is
looking out on a new country garden this weekend is advised strongly to
attend to a permanent edging for anything which they cut out as a border or
flowerbed with the help of a spray and Roundup.
If you and your helpers cannot face poison, you will probably take refuge in
pruning. You might also have forgotten to prune your roses a month ago but,
when you set about them belatedly, do please be more restrained. Hard
pruning will delay their flowering now they are so far into growth.
If you want to find a non-gardening husband something useful on which he can
vent his aggression, direct him in a week or two's time to the forsythias,
which have had such a superb season this year. Their flowering stems will
need to be cut back immediately the flowers drop.
Meanwhile, let him loose on dead wood, especially in the cistuses and
deciduous ceanothus. If you have neither, point to an ordinary buddleia and
let him hack that until it is reduced to a height of about 3ft.
Meanwhile, I am fed up once again with the line between 'professionals' and
'amateurs' which is drawn in the garden trade. This carries the implication
that 'ordinary' gardeners should never be allowed to use what professionals
use in order to present the best possible plant to the market.
For years, I have fiddled around with general fertilisers such as bone meal
or the one to which every conservative heart will rally, Basic Slag. I now
realise that professional growers pack the best plants which we buy in
containers with slow-release fertilisers which put chemicals to the plant
over a period up to two years, releasing them like rationed sweets to
children.
The best-known is Osmacote, but it is hard to scale down for use on one or
two shrubs at a time. I have gone over to Agroblen because it comes in
individual tablets which can be given like an aspirin to an orange blossom
and will last for two years. A 10kg bucket cost me Pounds 29.25 (plus VAT)
from every big gardener's sundries' supplier: Joseph Bentley, Beck Lane,
Barrow-on-Humber, South Humberside DN19 7AQ.
Enough of the practicalities. If it looks a bit bleak at home and the
neighbours are doing wheelies on the mini-tractor, get into the car and head
for an established arboretum or botanical garden.
At Hilliers Arboretum, Ampsfield, Hampshire, those marvellous magnolias are
flat out this week and almost peaking too soon. From Cornwall to the milder
parts of Scotland, from Trewithen to Logan, the story is the same.
Camellias, magnolias and early to mid rhododendrons are ahead of themselves
marvellously.
On my lime soil, if I could only plant one, it would have to be the pure
white magnolia Soulangeana Alba, just opening to perfection without any
stain from rain or severe frost as we all take a holiday weekend and exhaust
ourselves instead, in the garden.

FT  02 APR 94 / Property: Easter, just the time to see Rome and buy - David
Lane investigates the Eternal City's housing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Easter in the Eternal City has a timeless quality. It is a season for
pilgrims, drawn to the basilicas and churches, and for art and history
lovers, attracted by the galleries, museums and sites of imperial Rome.
There could, however, be another type of visitor this year: the prospective
property buyer.
Prices have fallen steeply during the past two years, dropping by between 20
and 30 per cent in the historic centre over the past 12 months alone.
Political uncertainty and the continuing weakness of the economy mean the
turning point in the property market has not been reached, although some
estate agents expect improvements in the autumn. Others forecast the
beginning of next year, while the real pessimists say prices will not start
to pick up until 1996. 'There is little money around. The market is still
falling and there are good opportunities for finding bargains,' says Greti
Walcher Miraglia, of estate agent Internazionale Immobiliare.
She says prices in the historic centre (approximately, the area between the
Piazza Venezia, the river Tiber, Piazza del Popolo, Piazza Barberini, Santa
Maria Maggiore and the Colosseum) have been affected much more than the
fringe around the centre and the suburbs. Price falls over the past year
have been below 10 per cent in some outlying districts.
Despite this, many foreign residents find the centre still costs too much.
It also falls short on convenience for those who work in the southern EUR
suburb. But the garden district of Casal Palocco, near the Ostia lido and
close to Fiumicino airport, has a large expatriate population of businessmen
and employees with the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation.
Another popular district is the Via Cassia, outside the ring road to the
north; it is well located for English schools and the Olgiata golf course.
Also favoured by foreigners, including diplomats, is the Parioli area.
Separated from the centre by the Villa Borghese park, it has property prices
of L6m to L7m a square metre (convert at roughly L2,500 to the pound) that
fit between the more expensive historic centre (L8m to L12m per sq m) and
those in the EUR-Laurentina-Torrino districts (L3m to L5m per sq m).
Casal Palocco, EUR, the Cassia and Parioli have their supporters. But
wealthy foreigners without the constraints of working location or schools,
and with the time to enjoy Rome's many attractions, opt unerringly for the
historic centre. This is the real Rome of palaces, squares, churches,
craftsmen's studios, smart shops and restaurants.
And where is more central than Largo del Nazareno, a minute's walk from
Piazza di Spagna? Here, Internazionale Immobiliare has on its books a
recently renovated, fourth floor, split-level flat offering reception room,
two bedrooms, two bathrooms and kitchen at L950m. Refurbishment has brought
a lift, a service not often found in apartments in this area.
'Two small terraces are an additional attraction in this apartment of about
100 sq m. The building has only four apartments and there is no porterage.
But this will keep condominium charges low,' says Walcher Miraglia.
Her firm also is selling a fourth floor penthouse in Via del Pellegrino,
which runs off the Piazza Campo de' Fiori, close to the Palazzo Farnese. At
75 sq m, this is a small property with a reception room, bedroom, bathroom
and kitchen and small terrace, all in good order. There is no lift, though.
Price: L600m.
'Most demand is for apartments in the range of 100 to 120 sq m,' says
Walcher Miraglia. 'This is considered ideal for a pied-a-terre, as
apartments of such size can offer a reception room, two bedrooms and two
bathrooms and are easy to manage.' But buyers generally want a terrace or a
fine view.
Most apartments in the historic centre are either smaller, (around 70 sq m)
or much larger (more than 200 sq m). The demand-supply ratio means buyers
get more square metres for their lire in larger properties. 'Internazionale
Immobiliare has a 400 sq m apartment, in need of restoration, in an historic
building in Corso Vittorio for which the asking price is L6m per sq m,' says
Walcher Miraglia.
Sant Andrea, the prestige property division of Gabetti (Italy's largest
estate agency) also has an outstanding large apartment on its books. This
takes up the third floor of an 18th century building near the Piazza del
Parlamento. 'It is 380 sq m, has been restructured and boasts superb
ceilings,' says the agency's Laura Melega. The apartment has a triple-size
reception room, five bedrooms, three bathrooms and servants' quarters.
Price: L4.7bn.
For buyers seeking only a pied-a-terre, rather than part of a palace, Sant
Andrea offers a third floor apartment of 100 sq m in a 17th century building
in Via Giulia. 'It is hard to imagine anywhere more typical of old Rome,'
says Melega. 'It has a reception room, two bedrooms, a kitchen and a
bathroom. There is no lift but there are marvellous views of the Tiber and
church cupolas.' Price: L800m.
Finding the right property should not be difficult in present conditions.
Neither is obtaining mortgage finance locally. All the large Italian banks
have mortgage lending operations, although bureaucratic procedures can be
tiresome and time-consuming.
English-speaking purchasers may find it easier to deal with one of the two
large UK specialist real estate lenders - the Woolwich building society and
Abbey National - that operate in Italy. Certainly, they would be served more
quickly.
'Provided the paperwork is in order, the Woolwich can approve a mortgage in
three days,' says Massimo Notte, its managing director in Italy. A similar
time scale is achieved by Abbey National. In contrast, Italian banks rarely
take less than four weeks.
Pietro Bertollo, Abbey's manager in Milan, says: 'The term of the mortgage,
which covers a maximum of 85 per cent of the value certified by our
surveyor, is usually 10 years but it can be lengthened to 15 or 20 years.
The variable interest rate is presently 10.8 per cent. We have no problems
in lending to non-residents.'
Woolwich is equally at ease with non-Italians and non-residents. Like Abbey,
it grants mortgages to Britons resident in the UK for buying property in
Italy. 'Woolwich lends up to 75 per cent of the property's value. The term
is up to 20 years and the variable interest rate is presently 10.6 per
cent,' says Notte.
Procedures for buying are straightforward. When agreement is reached, the
buyer usually deposits 10 per cent of the price. Then, the sale contract is
signed before a notary. The declared price is often lower than the price
paid, though.
Financial factors may, however, reduce some of the appeal of purchasing a
Rome pied-a-terre. There is a tax of 4 per cent on the declared value of
first homes. A registration tax of 2 per cent adds to mortgage costs, and
the notary's fees may be substantial while the annual local property tax
amounts to about 0.5 per cent of declared value in Rome, in addition to
which there is an annual city charge for rubbish collection. And, as the
Eternal City's governors tackle the temporal task of balancing the books,
higher property taxes seem likely.

FT  02 APR 94 / Property: Planning permission that never lapses - Cadogan's
Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bulldozers ripping up the turf in the sprawling Cotswold village of
Quenington, Gloucestershire, have exposed a loophole in planning rules.
Quenington, in the beautiful valley of the river Coln, is made up of
isolated farmsteads with fields between. In 1979, the Cotswold district
council gave permission for two bungalows to be build in a field on the edge
of the village, as well as conversion of a barn already there into studios.
Soon afterwards, most of the village was declared a Conservation Area (CA)
so the council could keep tighter control on development. The field has CA
land on three sides but was not itself included.
Work began on the barn - and stopped. Years passed. The villagers continued
to enjoy the green field, assuming that the planning permission had lapsed.
Not so. It lapses if nothing has been done within five years. But, if work
has started, the permission remains valid indefinitely.
Attitudes have changed, though. The council probably would not approve such
a scheme in 1994 and must regret not having drawn a larger CA. Now, more
than 200 of the village's 400 inhabitants have signed a petition against the
project (with only nine in favour). But nothing can be done.
What has happened in Quenington is a lesson for buyers, solicitors and local
councillors. Meanwhile, opponents of the scheme believe the government
should amend the law so that permission is revoked automatically for
developments that are not finished in a specified time.
*****
When the big house in the village is up for sale, worry stalks the pub.
Where will the fete be held? Who will chair the parish council? Or give
money to the church? Will the new owner employ as many staff? That is the
buzz in Kingsey, on the border of Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire near
Thame, where the 17th century Tythrop Park - listed grade I, with 1,034
acres - is for sale from Savills (071-499 8644) for more than Pounds 4.5m.
Tythrop Park was built by James Herbert, one of the Herbert/Pembroke family
that owns Wilton in Wiltshire. Indeed, the carved elm staircase, which is
the glory of the main house, could have come from Wilton.
Among the motifs of the house, a Boscobel oak alludes to Charles II, a
visitor there. Around the stairwell are classical busts, life-size reliefs
of Juno and Minerva, portraits of James and Jane Herbert, and a statue of
Venus.
The present owners bought the house (almost derelict) with 10 acres 30 years
ago - the asking price was Pounds 16,500 - and have restored it with love
and flair. It remains to be seen if the new owner is as sympathetic - to
village as well as house.
*****
If you do not set too high a guide price in a sale, you could get a pleasant
surprise. Joint auctioneers Allsop and Savills suggested Pounds 425,000 to
Pounds 475,000 for Hinwick House, a lovely Queen Anne property in
Bedfordshire (described in this column on March 19/20). The hammer came down
at Pounds 590,000 to an overseas buyer.
*****
In the same vein, the Pounds 875,000 price from Savills (071-730 0822) for
the 1690 Zoffany House, which fronts on to the river Thames at
Strand-on-the-Green in west London - a splendid house in one of the
capital's handsomest areas - is Pounds 20,000 less than it was two years ago
with the same agent.
The house has a blue plaque recording that John Zoffany, a painter, lived
there. His studio, now a bedroom, faces north over the garden.
*****
Down-river in London's Docklands, the house of film director David Lean, who
died in 1991, has just come to market (also Savills). He turned four
Victorian warehouses at Sun Wharf, Narrow Street E14, into a dramatic home
with a large garden so close to the river that you could fall in.
He kept the brick inside so that you do not forget how the house began. It
is rich in terraces, unusual views of the water and the barges, and has
cunning lighting. Mod cons include a cinema - and a turntable in the garage
so that you need not back into the street. At Pounds 3m, it is ideal for
somebody in showbiz - or a big bonus-winner in the City or nearby Canary
Wharf.

FT  02 APR 94 / Travel: Survival is a dogfight for the wild bunch - Wild
dogs in Africa may become rarer than the rhino. Michael J Woods tracked them
down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a dull pock, like the sound of a tennis ball bouncing lightly on
grass, as the compressed air-gun expelled its tranquilliser dart. The
African wild dog sprang to its feet as if it had been stung. With a yelp it
dashed off, a red woollen tassel dangling from the syringe in its shoulder.
'It won't go far,' said Dr Gus Mills, and we sat in his truck for the 10
minutes needed for the drug to work. It took a little time to find the
sleeping dog in the thick bush, as its black, white and tan blotched coat
blended remarkably well with the broken shadows cast on the grey dusty soil.
Once located, though, a radio collar was swiftly fitted, a sample of blood
taken and the antidote injected. In less than a minute the dog was on its
feet and had gone to join the rest of Mbyamiti pack, which now had two dogs
carrying radio transmitters.
Gus Mills is a scientist who works in Kruger national park, a long
rectangular area about the size of Wales on the eastern boundary of South
Africa. He has been researching African wild dogs, also known as Cape
hunting dogs, for some years. His subjects are rangy animals with noticeably
large rounded ears, three-coloured coats and a height of a little over 2ft.
They are efficient hunters, running as a pack and killing at dawn and dusk
if they can, and lying-up in shade during the heat of the day. Only for the
short breeding period are they tied to a den; for the rest of the year they
are nomadic and appear to need a large territory to survive.
There are only about 360 wild dogs in Kruger; the lion and hyena populations
both top 2,000 for the same area. All is not well with wild dogs. They have
become very scarce in Africa - rarer, some say, than the rhino, which makes
them Africa's most threatened large carnivore.
Historically, their undeservedly bad reputation has led to persecution by
farmers. Until 20 years ago, they were even shot in some national parks.
There are still farmers who will not tolerate dogs and consider them vermin,
so that packs straying from conservation areas are at risk.
Only big stretches of protected wilderness will suffice to provide wild dogs
with enough space to survive. The national parks in the north of Botswana
and Zimbabwe and in the south of Tanzania fulfil these requirements, and
contain reasonable numbers of dogs. But these very extensive areas are
largely unpenetrated by roads and, for the discerning visitor, for whom a
glimpse of a dog is more exciting than any of the big five (lion, leopard,
elephant, rhino, buffalo), spotting one is extremely difficult.
Things seem to be slightly easier in Kruger. Finding them by radio is the
only way that researchers such as Gus Mills can ensure that packs are
monitored on a regular basis, and dogs are often seen by visitors to the
park. In fact, Gus was able to use tourist sightings of wild dogs to obtain
a measure of the number of animals in the park.
By offering a free film for every usable photograph of a dog, he soon had
pictures of almost every animal. The dog population in Kruger is one of the
densest so far recorded in Africa, and the extensive network of roads is
frequently used by packs on the move.
'Morning and evening are the best times to look for dogs,' Gus told me.
'That is when they hunt, for they rest in the heat of the day and then their
low profile and disruptive coloration make them almost impossible to spot.'
Kruger has much to offer in addition to wild dogs. I came across lions and
elephants in abundance along with rhino and giraffes. Many of the smaller
animals, so often missed elsewhere, are visible here, too. I found a dwarf
mongoose den by the roadside and was able to watch the lightning activities
of its delightful inhabitants as they foraged through the undergrowth and
then rocketed across open areas for fear of raptors.
On two occasions I had to wait for leopard tortoises to cross the track and
once swerved to avoid a chameleon, bright green against the khaki sand,
rocking its way so very slowly over the ruts.
But it was wild dogs I wanted to see, and the more I questioned Gus Mills,
the more mysteries I encountered. Packs, for instance, fluctuate markedly in
size, and Kruger's Skukuza pack, which numbered 40 dogs in 1989, now
consists of just three males.
Dogs disappear in large numbers for no apparent reason, and bodies are
rarely found. This was the reason for putting a collar on a second animal of
the Mbyamiti pack, as an insurance against the death or disappearance of the
dog already collared.
In Kruger, a wild dog's expectation of life is unusually short - rarely
beyond four years (a hyena's is about 15). Gus has heard several accounts of
lions killing both adults and pups, and would like to investigate more fully
the role lions play in the lives of dogs.
Fortunately, international awareness is growing. The Kruger wild dog study
is funded by the National Parks Board and the independent Stuart Bromfield
Wild Dog Fund of the Endangered Wildlife Trust. This trust also finances
other wild dog projects in South Africa, along with the newly-established
Licaone Fund in Italy.
Meanwhile, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature has
published an action plan for African wild dogs, so there is considerable
hope for the future.
I spent a week in Kruger, and it wasn't until my last day that I found dogs
for myself. The sun was sinking and, briefly, painting the bush a golden
green. The insects were tuning up for their evening chorus and the cacophony
of guinea fowl was at its loudest. There was a sudden snort from an impala
ram in the undergrowth beside the vehicle and he quickly made himself
scarce.
Then I was aware that, coming towards me along the road ahead, were a dozen
lean dark silhouettes with familiar big round ears. The long legs carrying
those lithe bodies touched the ground so lightly that the animals almost
seemed to float along in a distance-devouring trot. I stopped quickly and
the grinning dogs went by. The sun lit them for a second, then they wheeled
and melted into the trees - a moment of pure magic.
Michael Woods was a guest of the South African Tourism Board (London tel:
081-944-8080) and Kruger national park.
He flew from Bristol to Amsterdam with KLM and then caught its long-haul
flight to Johannesburg. KLM runs a similar service from 16 UK regional
airports, thus avoiding the often time-consuming journey to London and the
two-hour check-in.

FT  02 APR 94 / Travel: A rare foray into Burma's far north - Victor Mallet
visited Kachin State, an area previously closed to foreigners by the
military junta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We could tell they had not seen many foreigners by the way the babies
puckered their faces and howled when they glimpsed our white and somewhat
hairy features.
Children whimpered and hid behind their mothers. Young women giggled and
screamed, and, with an innocence inconceivable elsewhere in south-east Asia,
dragged the white men off to be photographed alongside them and their
friends. They made us bend our legs so as not to appear absurdly tall in the
pictures.
Kachin State, in the mountainous far north of Burma, has been closed to
foreigners for 32 years by the military junta because of the war between the
central government and the guerrillas of the Kachin Independence Army.
Now the fighting has stopped and the two sides have signed a ceasefire. The
junta decided to allow a group of journalists to fly to Myitkyina, the state
capital, and visit the remote surrounding area sandwiched between China and
India on the upper reaches of the Irrawaddy river. It seems we were lucky.
Myitkyina - pronounced Mee-Chee-Na - is now said to be off limits again.
We were lucky, too, to catch the end of the manau festival, an animist
harvest ceremony of dancing which brings together thousands of merrymakers
from the six branches of the Kachin race. It was banned until last year as a
dangerous opportunity for the expression of Kachin nationalism.
Under a structure much like a large maypole, to the sound of amplified
chanting and the boom of a great drum hanging from a bamboo frame, the
Kachin danced the conga-style sut-manau to ensure prosperity. Leading the
dance were men wearing swords, Chinese silk robes of red and gold, and hats
made of hornbill heads.
The festival included a beauty contest, a Burmese pop concert, a fun-fair
for children and much drinking of rice wine. It was mainly at the
sports-ground, where the fair was held, that we were seized by young women
as props for Kachin snapshots.
The elders, on the other hand, know all about foreigners, having fought for
the British and Americans against the Japanese during the second world war.
Christian missionaries from the west also loom large in the history of the
Kachin. 'We were semi-Neanderthal, we were mountain people, not civilised,'
said Zau Nan, an enthusiastic minister at the Kachin Baptist Church in
Myitkyina. 'We worshipped mountains and rivers and spirits. But by the grace
of God, messengers from God came from Sweden and Germany.'
Asked about the festival, he described with gusto the various kinds of
manaus. But, steadfast Christian that he was, he refused to accept they were
animist rituals designed to appease the spirits.
Christianity is not the only purveyor of foreign influence in Kachin state.
Madonna - the pop star, not the mother of Jesus - is portrayed naked but for
a few jewels on her nipples in a colour poster adorning the Popa Hotel's
restaurant above the railway station.
Sitting at a tea shop in Myitkyina's main street, looking at passers-by on
their bicycles, horse-drawn carts and army trucks, we heard Pink Floyd's The
Wall from the teashop sound system. The local cinema, an upper room of
somebody's house boasting a video machine and filled with clouds of cheroot
smoke, was playing Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and A Bridge Too
Far.
Burma's generals, citing the danger of 'neo-colonialist plots', still try to
keep foreign influences under control. We met a local official in Myitkyina
who, we thought, might help us arrange interviews, but he was given the cold
shoulder by the all-powerful military intelligence apparatus. 'The MI man is
very discouraging,' the official told us. 'He said: 'You must not help them
talk to anyone', and slammed the 'phone down.' This was odd: it was the
government which had arranged the trip in the first place.
The generals do have some friends, even foreign friends. As we waited in
Rangoon for our flight to Kachin State, we were accosted by a wild-eyed
American in the departure lounge. He looked like the kind of person one
tries to avoid in Californian fast-food outlets for fear they will suddenly
produce a lethal weapon.
He was wearing a longyi, the traditional Burmese sarong, and he rounded on
us - as representatives of the western media - for the supposedly unfair
treatment meted out to Burma's military rulers in the international press. I
could almost have sympathised, but at that moment a resident of Myitkyina to
whom we had been chatting idly about life in Kachin State was hauled away
for 30 minutes of interrogation for having 'spoken to tourists'.
In the countryside north of Myitkyina, such unpleasantness was all but
forgotten. This is a land famed for its jade mines, where much of the forest
is still uncut, and where villagers still talk of catching the few remaining
tigers and carrying them over the hills to sell to Chinese medicine-makers.
The confluence of two rivers - one called the 'Useful', because it is
navigable, the other the 'Useless' - which join to form the Irrawaddy, is a
popular site for gold panners and a picnic spot for Burmese tourists. The
ceasefire has made it accessible. Foreigners, however, are rarely seen. We
heard giggles and screams; it was time to pose for more photographs.

FT  02 APR 94 / The Nature of things: Unravelling the prehistoric codes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The study of ancient genes, brought to life so spectacularly in the Jurassic
Park film, is beginning to transform archaeology.
While re-creating a dinosaur will remain a fantasy for the foreseeable
future, researchers are already extracting and identifying DNA from
materials thousands of years old.
The results will contribute a wealth of information about human history over
the past 10,000 years in three main areas: people's evolution and migration
patterns; their agriculture and diet; and health and sickness in ancient
societies.
Research findings illustrate the potential of genetic archaeology in each
area.
Human DNA has been extracted from prehistoric bones found in Polynesia, by
Erika Hagelberg of Cambridge University.
Comparing the occurrence of one particular genetic mutation among the
ancient and modern inhabitants of the region, she concludes that the islands
of the central Pacific such as Samoa and Tonga were probably first settled
about 2,500 years ago by people moving west from the Melanesian
archipelagos; this contradicts the traditional view that Polynesia was
colonised directly from south-east Asia.
Many of the puzzles surrounding prehistoric migrations and settlement
patterns - such as the movement of people north-westward through Europe and
southward through America - will be solved by a systematic analysis of
ancient DNA from archaeological sites, combined with tests on contemporary
populations.
Wheat DNA has been isolated from charred grains found at Danebury, an Iron
Age British hill fort, by Martin Jones, another Cambridge archaeologist. His
group identified part of a gene linked to glutonin, a key protein which
helps to determine the bread-making qualities of the grain, and compared it
to modern wheat varieties.
Such research will provide fascinating information about ancient foods. But
tracking the genetic patterns of crop plants and domesticated animals will
also be useful for another purpose: to complement the evidence emerging from
the human genetic studies about population movements.
Tuberculosis DNA from human remains found in Borneo and Peru, dating from
before the first European contacts, has been isolated by Mark Spigelman of
the Institute of Archaeology, London, and Arthur Aufderheide of the
University of Minnesota. Their discoveries show that the TB bacillus
occurred throughout the ancient world. This means that early European
colonists should no longer be blamed for bringing TB to the New World.
Several research groups are now working to find out whether other diseases
such as syphilis, measles and influenza were present in pre-Columbian
America.
The study of ancient diseases is proving particularly popular, because the
findings will be relevant to modern medicine. Epidemiologists could learn a
lot from the ebb and flow of bacterial and viral infections over the
centuries - and their relation to changes in the virulence of the germs on
the one hand and in human living conditions on the other. Although TB, for
example, was present in pre-Columbian America, it may not have caused
serious disease until the colonists destroyed the structure of indigenous
society.
Previously, archaeologists had only been able to study slow-acting diseases
that leave their mark on human bones, such as leprosy and syphilis.
Paleogenetics should enable them to look at the population dynamics of other
important infections such as smallpox, plague and malaria.
Although bones have so far been the main source of bacterial DNA, Mark
Spigelman is developing an alternative - ancient faeces and guts - in
collaboration with Colin and Liz Fricker, two microbiologists employed by
Thames Water (who are interested in using the same technology to detect
traces of bacterial contamination in water). The team has just succeeded in
isolating DNA from E Coli bacteria in the gut contents of Lindow Man, an
Iron Age bog body dated to 500 BC. The discovery opens up the possibility of
investigating germs in ancient cesspits, which would give information about
community health as well diseases in individuals.
The study of ancient genes is still scientifically controversial - though
most of the debate centres on reports of DNA fragments extracted from
insects trapped in amber many millions of years old. Some experts refuse to
accept that the DNA molecule is chemically robust enough to exist for so
long, even if it is sealed in an antiseptic preservative such as amber. They
suspect that the 'dinosaur age' insect and bacterial DNA extracted by the
Californian researchers, George Poinar and Raul Cano, is actually modern
genetic material introduced by accidental contamination.
Even the sceptics concede that DNA may survive under exceptional conditions
for up to 10,000 years, which covers most of the period of interest to
archaeologists. But they point out that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -
the gene-amplifying technology used to fish a few DNA fragments out of a
sample and make billions of copies for analysis - is extremely susceptible
to contamination.
The first results of genetic archaeology will have to be confirmed by
independent experiments - by scientists working separately on the same or
very similar material - before they are generally accepted as valid. But
this is unlikely to take long, as scientists are moving rapidly into the
field. The prospects are that we will learn more in the next decade about
the way our prehistoric ancestors lived than we have over the past century.

FT  02 APR 94 / Death is outwitted by gods reborn in spring: The many
celebrations of rebirth at Easter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULES CASHFORD and JDF JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomorrow, in thousands of Christian churches around the world, millions of
men and women will celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. They will
rejoice - in the words of the Apostles' Creed - in the historical figure who
'was crucified, dead and buried. He descended into hell. The third day, He
rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right
hand of God the Father Almighty.'
Tomorrow, children will open their Easter eggs. Churches will be decked with
flowers and, in some parts of Europe, bonfires will blaze. But we might
choose to remember that, far more than 2,000 years ago - long before the
birth of Christ, and at almost precisely the same time of the year -
countless people celebrated the re-birth of their own particular god from
death.
They believed there was not just one god but many - or, rather, many
different names for the same one. In Bronze Age Sumeria, around 2,500 BC,
they called him Dumuzi; in Babylonia, Tammuz; in ancient Egypt, Osiris.
Later, in Phrygia, he was Attis; in Canaan, Baal; and, in Greece, Dionysos
and Adonis. All of these gods died and descended into the underworld.
It happened to 'goddesses' too: Inanna in Mesopotamia and Persephone in
Greece. Many stayed there for three days; some for three months. Then, they
were rescued. Death variously was outwitted, cheated, forced to barter, even
killed. Life won a respite, an exchange, a deferral, a victory. Like winter,
death's dominion was only temporary.
Can we be surprised if these celebrations of rebirth over the millennia of
human history always take place in spring? Yesterday, on the holy Friday
Christians call 'Good', millions mourned the death of the son of God,
crucified on a cross in Golgotha - 'the place of a skull'. The churches were
dim, the altars bare, the priests wore black, the hymns were melancholy and
despairing.
This is the wasteland, where death is the end and even God dies, slain by
human ignorance. At this darkest point in the ceremony, the cross becomes
the focus, for this instrument of death now appears as the Tree of Life.
In early Christian iconography, the cross is often depicted as a tree, both
cut and budding, with lopped-off branches and green shoots, as in the 13th
century Evesham Psalter Cross. In Byzantine art, crosses twist into branches
and curl over into sprays of flowers. Rarely are they the distilled
abstractions of later Protestant meditation.
In the third century, Helena, mother of the Roman emperor Constantine,
travelled many lands in search of the true cross. In legend, this was made
from the Tree of Life which stood in the centre of the Garden of Eden, at
the source of four rivers, and granted immortality.
Standing in counterpoise to the Tree of Knowledge, the cross, as the Tree of
Life, thus redeems the fate of Adam whose skull became the skull at
Golgotha, burying Death. In the magnificent 16th century mosaic at the
Church of San Clemente in Rome, death and resurrection are portrayed in one
image. Christ stands against the cross as the trunk and branch of the Tree
of Life, its joyously-spiralling leaves extending into the universe. The
cross is the Cosmic Tree at the centre of the world. For Christian doctrine,
the symbol of the cross as the Tree of Life is entirely intelligible within
its own tradition.
Yet, these are universal symbols, far more ancient than Christianity, and
their recurrence in the myths and folklore of the world is arresting and
fascinating. Osiris of Egypt was imprisoned by his wicked brother, Seth, in
a coffin. It was thrown into the Nile but was washed ashore and came to rest
inside the trunk of a tamarisk tree. He was released from the tree, dying
again and then being re-born, and a pillar of wood with four crossed
branches - the Djed column - was raised upright as the sign of his life
everlasting.
Adonis (the name Adonai means the Lord) was born from the myrtle, and
anemones rose from his blood; Dionysos was dismembered as the grapes from
the vine, wreathed in the ivy that is ever-green. Phrygian Attis was tied to
a tree of pine. Even the Buddha attained his supreme awakening as he sat in
meditation beneath the Bodhi tree.
Originally, the symbolism of the cross was a not a solar but a lunar image,
inscribed on neolithic pots as the four quarters of the moon, our first
source of measurement - an image of change and changelessness, time and
eternity.
Transferred to the earth and the solar year, the four points of the lunar
circle become the four directions of the universe, the four cardinal points
of the zodiac (the equinoxes and solstices), the four seasons of the
temperate climates, even the four phases of the day. In other words, an
image of totality in time. Symbolically, the cyclical waxing and waning of
the moon's light offered an image of transformation, for in its perpetual
return to its own beginnings it unified what apparently had been
dismembered. The moon 'died' and yet rose again out of the dark.
All over the world, and throughout a host of cultures, gods, goddesses,
heroes and heroines 'died' during the three days when the moon vanishes.
They went down into the underworld (like Inanna of Sumeria), or into the
belly of the whale or of the dragon (like Jonah in the Old Testament, Jason
of the Greeks, Raven of the Eskimos), or were, like Joseph, thrown into the
well.
Then, they were reborn: Persephone returned to her Harvest Mother, Demeter;
Inanna, naked in death but sprinkled with water, put back her seven veils
and ascended to the upper world. And Jesus, of course, also descended into
hell for three days before his resurrection.
Many, if not most, of the world's religious calendars are lunar in origin
and, for Christians, the drama of the moon's cyclical phases remains
reflected in the timing of Easter to the first Sunday after the first full
moon following the spring equinox.
Significantly, the rites of Christ's incarnation are governed by the solar
calendar and fall on fixed dates, since they are connected with the birth of
the sun (Christmas at the winter solstice, for instance, where Jesus takes
over the role of Sol Invictus from the Roman god Mithras). By contrast, the
Easter rites of his death, resurrection and ascension are governed by the
lunar calendar, because of the images of death and rebirth in the waning and
waxing of the moon.
Easter was named in the middle ages after the Saxon goddess of the dawn,
Eostre, whose feast was held at the spring equinox. Her sacred animal was
the egg-laying moon-hare, which gives us our Easter eggs. So, the underlying
language directs us continually to images of rebirth - the birth of the sun
from the dark of the night, the ascendancy of the light of the new year over
the darkness of the old, and the full moon as the sign of the resurgence of
life over death. And, finally, the cross is transformed from the Tree of
Death into the Tree of Life at the time when all nature buds from an
invisible source.
Perhaps the drawing of parallels, in symbol and ritual, between Christianity
and other mythologies might not have to be greeted, so many centuries later,
with cries of outrage and apostasy from the literalists. Christian theology
is, understandably, committed to the premise that earlier rituals were only
anticipations of the coming of Christ who was their apotheosis. Inevitably
it interprets other traditions in this light.
But the Christian Mystery need not be reduced merely by virtue of its
resemblance to other Mystery religions. Why need its participation with
other traditions in a common store of wonder and worship diminish its own
unique reality? Could it not rather be met with delight - even awe - that so
many of the world's people, have experienced the divine in a similar way?
When, for instance, Mary Magdalene first saw the risen Jesus, she took him
for the gardener - an image that would have been familiar to Mesopotamians,
for whom Dumuzi-Tammuz was known as the gardener in the garden of life.
When Mary, the mother, and Mary Magdalene are shown sorrowing on either side
of the cross, they can be compared with the sisters mourning Osiris. And, as
the Djed column was raised in ancient Egypt after the Nile's life-giving
inundation, the people cried 'Osiris is risen' just as, tomorrow, we
proclaim: 'Christ is risen.'
Why, though, should either festival be lessened by comparison with the
other? And, more than this, might not our own celebration - with our
advantage of the knowledge of both - be enlarged by an awareness of the
other? Not least on the ground that one way of loving our neighbours is to
include their humanity within our own?

FT  02 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Decent fizz for a tenner - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rules for making sparkling wines vary from region to region but,
typically, stipulate a minimum time for ageing the wine on the lees. Those
for champagne now insist on at least 15 months, but research shows that it
takes at least 18 months for this process to have any perceptible impact on
flavour by rounding out acidity and adding complexity.
It is almost impossible for the consumer to establish how long a bottle of
non-vintage fizz has been aged on lees, but Laytons of London NW1
(071-388-5081) has managed to track down an unusually respectable champagne
for Pounds 9.95 which, it claims, has benefited from four years in bottle.
Laytons Champagne Brut NV, available from Laytons and Andre Simon shops in
London, certainly tastes mellow for reasons of age rather than added sugar.
This is more than can be said for most champagne under a tenner.
*****
Meanwhile, in my swoon over vintage madeira earlier this year, I forgot to
mention that Bottoms Up - most unusually for a high street retailer - takes
this exciting style of wine seriously.
The chain's exceptionally attractive list boasts no fewer than five
examples, including the first-class Blandy's Bual 1954 at Pounds 65.
Probably best value is Rutherford &amp; Miles' Malvasia solera 1863 at Pounds
39. The unit price might seem high, but these are powerful wines which will
last in an opened bottle for months and months.
*****
London wine lovers have three important consumer wine fairs to choose from
on Saturday, May 14. The organisers are taking advantage of the annual
influx of wine producers to the London Wine Trade Fair the following week.
Wine merchant La Vigneronne's Alsace Wine Fair takes place between 11am and
6pm in the Sherfield Building of Imperial College, off Exhibition Road,
London SW7. An entrance ticket costing Pounds 15 (from 071-589- 6113) allows
tasters 15 tastes and further tasting coupons are on sale.
The Great Australian Wine Tasting is from 11am until 5pm in the Old
Horticultural Hall in Greycoat Street, London SW1. The Pounds 12 cost of
tickets (from 071-925-0751) can be redeemed on orders of Pounds 75 or more
taken at the fair and there are no restrictions on grog intake. At the end
of the LWTF week, some winemakers will be staying on for the Oddbins Wine
Fair at the Park Lane Hotel on May 13, 14 and 15. Charity tickets are Pounds
10 from any Oddbins branch.

FT  02 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Truffles to covert - Nicholas Lander spends an
afternoon making chocolate truffles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is fortunately very rare for this column to report a new type of injury.
But it is with equal amounts of sadness and pleasure that I have to draw
readers' attention to 'truffle elbow'.
This self-inflicted malaise has been creeping up on Sara Jayne's right elbow
for 12 years, ever since she made her first chocolate truffles for a dinner
party.
Since then her love affair with the chocolate truffle has grown, as has her
expertise with the chocolatier's most difficult task - tempering the
chocolate. But the excitement, and challenge, of making delicious
hand-rolled truffles, with flavours such as lapsang souchong, calvados and
coffee beans, still remains.
Jayne managed to obtain some expert advice from such eminent pastry chefs as
Michel Roux, whose recipe she still uses, John Huber, principal pastry
lecturer at Thames Valley University, and Ian Ironside, now head pastry chef
at the Gleneagles Hotel, Scotland. But she confesses that during the initial
four years she made some mistakes. In 1989 she found a factory and with two
staff was doing well until January 1991, when the recession struck. With
only two orders in one month, she decided to bring the business back to her
small domestic kitchen in Clapham, south London.
Jayne had been shown by a master chocolatier how a top-of-the-range
microwave could melt the chocolate to the right temperature in seconds - but
this was not for her. Instead, everything was done in spotless stainless
steel pans, the chocolate melted over a giant heavy-bottomed roasting pan
that acts as a bain marie.
It is the subsequent enrobing process which Jayne believes has brought on
truffle elbow. Her recipe below gives the 'easy' option of coating the
truffles in cocoa powder. But for the finest truffles this will not do.
More couverture chocolate has to be melted to exactly the right temperature
(31`C). Then, grasping a dipping fork gently, lift the truffles and dip them
in the liquid chocolate to enrobe them, avoiding the appearance of small air
bubbles on the chocolate's surface. This continuous dipping process is the
cause of truffle elbow.
Jayne's criteria for making the finest chocolate truffles included the best
ingredients (Cacao Barry couverture chocolate from Ritter, 081-903-7177 or
Valrhona, available at many delicatessens) and the best quality piping bags
and dipping forks from Keylink, Rotherham, (0709-550206).
Then in order of importance came practice and patience - it takes her an
hour to box and ribbon five 1lb packs of truffles and she has recently
ordered her 200,000th petit four case.
SARA JAYNE'S BASIC CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE Ingredients: 1lb bitter couverture
chocolate;  1/2 pt whipping cream, preferably Devon; cocoa powder to dust or
couverture chocolate to enrobe.
Break the chocolate into tiny pieces and put into a large bowl over hot
water (off the flame). Cover tightly, stirring occasionally until nearly
melted.
In a saucepan bring the cream to the boil and then pour into the melted
chocolate and blend thoroughly. Leave to cool at room temperature which will
take a few hours.
Using an electric hand mixer, whisk the cream and chocolate mixture until
the consistency of softly whipped cream - not too hard or it sets.
Spoon this mixture into a 14in piping bag with a half inch nozzle and pipe
small amounts on to a tray of waxed paper or cling film. Refrigerate for
about one hour.
Sieve about 8 oz cocoa powder into a large bowl. Ease the truffles one at a
time off the baking sheet and roll in the cocoa powder, dropping them gently
into petits four cases. Keep refrigerated.
Sara Jayne's truffles: Pounds 17 per lb (inc post and packing) from 517 Old
York Road, London SW18 1TS. Tel: 081-874-8500.

FT  02 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The excitement lives on in Soho - Nicholas
Lander finds adventure in a central London area with a past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Behind me, in the immaculately tended square, the plane trees swayed and the
beds were full of newly-planted flowers. To the left stood a former private
house and a garden with a mulberry tree under which Dickens wrote A Tale of
Two Cities. Ahead lay three small streets teeming with restaurants.
The scene was reminiscent of an old quarter of Brussels, Paris or Strasbourg
perhaps. But I was in Soho Square, central London - an area more usually
well-known for its porn shops - and the restaurants of Greek, Frith and Dean
Streets beckoned.
When I bought the lease on my Soho restaurant L'Escargot in 1980 - I could
not afford the freehold (Pounds 150,000 for 5,500 sq ft) - there were two
reactions. First, I was told that no one would come because it was difficult
to park and, second, if I survived I would make no money as I would have to
pay too much protection money to racketeers. I never met a racketeer and
within a few years it became difficult to park all over central London.
Since, Soho has been down, up, down and is now on the up again. Such
fluctuations are dangerous because they can produce the large rent rises -
as one chef pointed out rents never go down - that closed many businesses in
the late 1980s.
For the restaurateur, Soho is a good trading location. There is considerable
lunch business, albeit much more price sensitive than it was in the 1980s,
and in the evening the potential for three types of dinner bookings - pre
and post-theatre and those who just want to dine out in a lively area.
Agencies for chefs and kitchen supply shops are there, too. And it is also a
popular area if you just want a drink.
But Soho has changed. I have never seen the streets and pavements so clean.
According to Alastair Little, who has run his own restaurant in Frith Street
for nine years, Westminster Council provides three rubbish collections a
day. (This is not altogether good news for a restaurant critic because the
number of rubbish sacks waiting for collection used to provide a reliable
sign of just how busy a restaurant was.) There are still beggars and drunks
on the streets but no more than in any other major European city.
Soho is no longer the gastronomic island within London it used to be - the
sole source of Mediterranean ingredients, raw and prepared, to which
Elizabeth David, Jane Grigson and their readers hurried in the 1950s and
1960s. Hamburger Products and Bifulco's, the Italian butchers, have long
gone and, according to fishmonger Dave Richards on Brewer Street, the wet
fish business is not as good as it was. Yet Camisa and the Algerian Coffee
Stores prosper on Old Compton Street and on Brewer Street, Randall and Aubin
has been renovated and has broadened its stock.
But now that fresh pasta, anchovies and peppers are available in
delicatessens and supermarkets around the country there is less reason for
many people to make the trip into Soho. In other London boroughs and other
parts of the country the standards of cooking have improved and chefs who
learnt their craft in Soho now make their names elsewhere in the capital:
Adam Robinson at the Brackenbury, Shepherd's Bush (081-748-0107), and Martin
Lam, at Ransome's Dock, Battersea (081-223-1611).
But where Soho still impresses is in the diversity of it restaurants and the
breadth of its appeal.
For those who remember it from their youth there is the Gay Hussar
(071-437-0973) with Elena Salvoni serving on the first floor as she did at
Bianchi's in the 1950s, the redesigned Au Jardin des Gourmets (071-437-1816)
and L'Epicure (071-437-2829) virtually unchanged from the 1960s when it was
prime minister Harold Wilson's favourite restaurant.
For those still in their youth Old Compton Street beckons. The number of
coffee houses and bars that this street seems capable of supporting is
astonishing - Cafe Boheme, Caffe Nero, Cafe Beta, the Soho Brasserie, Bar
Sol Una, Balhans and Village Soho as well as the long running Bar Italia in
Frith Street. For those who can think, drink and listen to loud music The
French House (071-437-2477), Dean Street, is a valuable addition.
Today, however, there is a new dimension to the gastronomic excitement long
associated with Soho. Within 300 yards, along Frith Street, Alastair Little
(071-734-5183), Anthony Worall-Thompson (Dell' Ugo 071-734-800) and Bruno
Loubet (Bistro Bruno 071-734-4545) sharpen their knives. Further down are
two good Thai restaurants, Bahn Thai (071-437-8504) and Chiang Mai
(071-437-7444).
For these chefs Soho's culinary attraction lies in its proximity to
Chinatown. Little had just popped down there for some large red chillis
which he would grill for a chilli salad. Loubet goes there regularly to buy
pigs' ears and tails, black beans, ducks' tongues, Chinese chives and
spices.
Soho in the 1990s still provides food for the adventurous in a location with
a frisson of excitement.

FT  02 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Taking the eggs out of Easter - Philippa
Davenport makes an alternative to pudding for an Easter lunch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Easter day in Greece, the usual 'good morning' greeting is replaced by
'Christ is risen' as children crack their hard-boiled eggs against those of
their companions in a spring-time version of conkers.
In Britain, eggs tend to be soft-boiled for serving at the Easter breakfast
table. For years, though, I had a childish horror of fresh eggs cooked
lightly. Growing up at a time of rationing when powdered eggs were the norm,
I was repelled by the sticky yolks and semi-jellied whites of soft-boiled
eggs.
One memorable Easter, I went to a tea party at the house of some friends
where, with leaden heart, I saw the table was laid with an egg cup and spoon
at every setting. 'A special treat,' our hostess smiled as we sat down and
the eggs were brought in. My misery deepened when I realised there was no
bread and butter on hand to blot up the worst excesses of eggy liquefaction.
I had no choice but to crack into the beastly thing. I raised my spoon and
bashed the shell ferociously, hoping to spill some of its contents. What
blessed relief to find the egg was not really an egg at all. It had been
blown out and refilled with melted chocolate.
Although it was a harmless, sheep-in-wolf's-clothing type of prank, it was
the sort of surprise I prefer to live without. In fact, I have been nervous
of Easter eggs ever since - unless they are made by Faberge. I offer you,
instead, an undisguised and egg-less chocolate confection.
CHOCOLATE &amp; PRUNE PETITS FOURS (makes about 16)
These are fiddly to make and not worth attempting by the impatient or those
in a hurry. But they are unusual. One or two per person makes an attractive
alternative to pudding at the end of a fine meal, served with coffee and
perhaps brandy or port.
To mould the chocolate shells, you will need some small fluted paper cases
of the sort sold by kitchenware shops and some hardware stores for making
mini-muffins, chocolates and other confectionery.
For the chocolate shells: 5oz best bitter chocolate;  1/2 oz unsalted
butter.
For the filling: 6oz big squashy prunes; 1 1/2 oz sultanas; 1 1/2 oz
currants; 3 fl oz or so each of port and water; 1 tub creme fraiche or
clotted cream; a little cocoa powder.
Put the dried fruits and liquids into a flame-proof casserole with a heavy,
well-fitting lid. Bring very slowly to simmering point. Cover and cook over
the lowest possible flame for one hour, stirring occasionally, until the
fruit is very tender and has absorbed most of the liquid.
Set aside, still covered, for 1 1/2 hours until cold. Then, stone the
prunes, whizz all the fruits and their juices to a rich dark puree, and
refrigerate.
Dice the chocolate and melt it with one teaspoon of warm water in a bowl
placed over a pan of barely-simmering water. Away from the heat, beat in the
butter.
Using a teaspoon, line the paper cases with chocolate, smoothing it across
the base and up the sides right to the top. Spread it thickly: a good ratio
of chocolate to filling makes for good eating, and stout walls are less
fragile and easier to un-mould than thin ones. Chill on a plate.
When the chocolate shells have set solid, fill and un-mould them. To guard
against the chocolate softening messily in the warmth of the kitchen or the
heat of your hands, take the shells out of the refrigerator just one at a
time, work on each one quickly, and put it back in the fridge before
starting on the next. Do not overdo the filling: two-thirds full is better
than brimfull.
Spread a small spoonful of the rich, dark prune puree across the base, add a
snowy covering of cream, and shake a pinch of cocoa powder over the top.
Strip off the paper carefully, loosening it round the rim and peeling it
downwards.
Keep the petits fours in the fridge until you are ready to serve them, and
hand them round on the chilled plate on which they have been stored.
Green &amp; Black's organic chocolate, made with 70 per cent cocoa solids, dark
and agreeably un-sweet, was an instant hit when launched a few years ago.
But it was difficult to buy unless you lived near a health food shop. Now,
it has reached the supermarkets; it is available at Safeway and Sainsbury,
with Waitrose and Tesco to follow soon.
Just in time for Easter, Green &amp; Black is bringing out another chocolate
that looks set for success. Again made with 70 per cent cocoa solids, this
one is called Maya Gold and is flavoured with orange, vanilla and allspice.
Maya Gold is, moreover, the first product to go on sale bearing not only the
Soil Association symbol but also the mark of the Fairtrade Foundation in
recognition of Green &amp; Black's long-term trading commitment to the Maya
Indian cocoa growers of Belize.
Launch stockists are Sainsbury, Tesco, the Co-op and Asda. A 100g bar costs
Pounds 1.95.

FT  02 APR 94 / Fashion: Simple and so chic - Lucia van der Post finds hats
to turn the classiest heads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I first became aware of Patricia Underwood's hats in the summer of 1985. I
remember it because I wanted one of her soft, floppy, 'wilting-rose' straw
hats so badly I almost took out a bank loan. That tells you a lot about
Patricia Underwood's hats. Firstly, that they are dangerously desirable and
secondly that they cost wicked amounts of money.
She has, more than any other hat designer, developed a personal style that
is instantly recognisable. The style revolves around the finest, softest of
straw or crinbraid which is crafted into shapes and lines of the utmost
simplicity. She is to hats what Armani is to the unstructured jacket. But
all that artless-looking simplicity requires dedication to the craft of
hat-making.
There is no hint of excess or decoration on Underwood's hats. Understated,
simple, effortlessly classy, they never shout louder than their wearer.
Nobody . . . (well perhaps that's a bit sweeping, I've just remembered Dolly
Parton) . . . almost nobody, could look vulgar in a Patricia Underwood hat.
If that makes them sound puritanically austere let me assure you that they
are among the most flattering of hats.
Flattery is, in my view, a hat's most important function. The magic lies in
the most subtle, most refined sense of line and proportion. Patricia
Underwood's unadorned, hand-made, hand-finished hats rely on shape, colour
and proportion, not fancy trims and artificial flowers, for their effect.
Great skill goes into finding the line and the shape that give the face its
most beguiling frame.
Her personal style is founded on simplicity - on the day I interviewed her
she was wearing a navy-blue Jil Sander suit, navy-blue silk shirt, almost no
make-up and one of her own fine black straw hats.
She evolved an approach to headwear as part of a woman's look and personal
style rather than a distracting ornament. Her hats have a modern cerebral
quality about them. These are hats to please the most up-to-date and
liberated of women.
She believes that: 'Hats create amazing possibilities. One cannot be neutral
in the presence of a hat. It sends a message. When I think about the design
of a hat, I consider what that message might be.'
Just listen to Michael Malone, an American author, writing about the hats of
his youth: 'In the 1980s, to my delight, America rediscovered the romance
and power and sexiness of hats. The brown hat of Indiana Jones said danger
and adventure just the way Bogie's hat said danger and mystery years ago.
I've long since lost (my) long-loved Yankees cap, and the cowboy hat with
the red trim. But I remember how they made me feel. Like the movies, they
had that magic to tell us who we are.'
Patricia Underwood is full of wise advice on how to choose one. 'Our
grandmothers never needed advice on how to wear a hat. It was part of their
daily lives which they understood instinctively.
'Today there is a new young generation which does not associate hats with
churchgoing or eccentric aunts or grandmothers and they are discovering,
and, in some cases, re-discovering, themselves in hats. The trick is to find
the pleasing relationship between the width of the cheekbone and the top of
the hat - this is a matter of visual judgment.
'A hat is part of a woman's style and therefore it must match the mood of
her clothing - for this a full-length mirror is necessary.
'When choosing a hat to go with a printed fabric always choose it in the
least prominent colour. If you look deep into a tweed or even a
single-colour fabric there are nearly always other muted colours and shades.
Choose one of those and the fabric will be enhanced.'
Underwood adds: 'Few faces are perfectly symmetrical. When putting on a hat,
never wear it absolutely straight - a subtle, but I really mean subtle,
little tilt will integrate it with the face.'
Although her hats are simple, they do change and evolve. Some of her newest
designs are photographed here.
For this summer there are baby bonnet shapes in finest crinbraid. There is a
subtle but simple almost 1920s-style cloche. There are finely-stitched suede
berets and some of the newest combine knit and straw or crinbraid - some
have knitted crowns, others knitted brims. Prices range from Pounds 120 to
Pounds 350.
Browns of west London stock Underwood's hats and are offering 50 readers a
chance to share high tea and hat-talk with Patricia on Tuesday May 17, from
6.30pm to 8.30pm. She will be discussing hats for the high summer season
with Ascot particularly in mind. Tickets will go to the first 50 readers who
send a cheque for Pounds 20 made out to The Teenage Trust (a charity that
helps teenagers with cancer, registration number 1009984) to Janet
Fischgrund of Browns Press Office, Browns, 23-27 South Molton Street, London
W1.
Anyone wanting to know even more about hats might like to obtain The Hat
Book, designed by Rodney Smith and Leslie Smolan (Dollars 25, published only
in the US) by Nan A. Talese, Doubleday, Carbone Smolan editions).

FT  02 APR 94 / Fashion: Men who change gear - Many can't wait to throw off
their dull weekday attire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL KEERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is only at weekends that many men feel they can dress as they choose.
Professional dress is so proscribed that there is little scope for
individuality during the working week. But at weekends, men reveal a little
more about their personality in the way they dress, whether it is to play
sports, play with the children - or play the peacock.
Michael Naylor-Leyland, 37, is executive assistant manager of The
Lanesborough, the luxury hotel on Hyde Park Corner, in central London. His
working days are spent in formal morning dress - not the ideal for someone
who admits: 'I like eccentric clothes, and I've always worn fairly odd
things.' So at weekends, a sartorial butterfly emerges from this
professional chrysalis.
At the centre of Naylor-Leyland's off-duty wardrobe are more than 20
waistcoats, collected over the years. 'I've got velvet, beaded, striped,
even Regency double-breasted waistcoats,' he says. Several come from Tom
Gilbey's celebrated Waistcoat Gallery. 'The great thing is that, along with
a splash of colour, waistcoats give you a couple of extra pockets.'
The names in his wardrobe are well-known for their colourful menswear. A
purple cashmere jacket is from Jasper Conran, another, in Prince of Wales
check printed with purple roses, is by pop-star designer Stephen King.
Naylor-Leyland used to like the extravagant creations of Scott Crolla, and
enjoys the 'wonderful waistcoats and jackets' of Richard James. All are
designers of bold, vivid clothes; even when it comes to jeans, his
favourites are bright red, from Replay.
He likes to wear polo-neck shirts, in red, black, white or purple;
comfortable and casual, they can also look 'faintly formal' worn under a
jacket. 'I never wear a tie in my spare time except under duress,' he
explains. 'I was probably hanged in a previous life.' And because he does
not wear them for work, even his suits can be idiosyncratic, like one from
Katharine Hamnett 'which has baggy trousers and a jacket which is almost a
frock coat.'
Right down to his shoes, Naylor-Leyland exhibits a colourful individuality,
at odds with his professional appearance. His favourite footwear is a pair
of cuban-heeled cowboy boots, bought when he spent a year in Brazil. 'They
were practically a uniform out there, and they're just incredibly
comfortable once you've worn them in.'
In the UK he seeks out classic Frye cowboy boots, and recommends 'a pleasant
shop with an unpleasant name' - R Soles, in London's King's Road. He has
also indulged in 'several pairs' of woven Turkish slippers by interior
designer Nicky Haslam. And he still wears the light slip-ons in purple suede
which Johnny Moke, a King's Road shoemaker, made for his wedding. Only his
socks, it seems, remain in the traditional male palette of black or blue.
Socks, he says, are unimportant.
Francis Hazeel, 49, is a property banker, who runs a German mortgage bank in
the City. His work attire is exactly what one might expect, a traditional
striped shirt and suit. Hazeel says, it is 'not so much a uniform as the
right thing to wear in respect of one's clients as much as one's self'. But
in dressing for the weekend, he completely rejects the equivalent traditions
in British casual dress.
'A lot of my friends eschew the Tattersall check, woolly tie and cavalry
twill point-to-point look, and I totally reject that look,' he says. 'It's
for criminals and country solicitors.'
Instead, his off-duty clothes tend to be American and selected on the basis
of practicality.
'As soon as you become a parent, it affects your wardrobe,' explains Hazeel,
father of boys of 4 1/2 and 10 weeks. 'Basically, my weekend style, which I
would describe as halfway between preppy and grunge, is based on the idea
that it's going to get chucked upon.'
Like many men, Hazeel gets everything from The Gap. 'It's a one-stop shop,
well-priced and the colours are wonderful,' he says. 'I can find everything
in that spectrum of denim blue, navy blue, grey, and chino tan. My Gap blue
denim shirt is probably my most favourite possession.'
The taste for Americana runs throughout his weekend wardrobe, from Bass
Weejun loafers in black and brown and Levi 501s, to fly-button chino
trousers bought from Banana Republic in the US. 'They're all very sporty,
easily serviceable clothes, extremely practical but stylish. Cotton, linen
and denim is really the style of the 1990s, and I find the American style,
particularly Gap style, is more adaptable and certainly smarter than British
country clothes. I only hope - no, I'm sure, my wife confirms it - I don't
look like an Ivy League jock.'
He does have some smarter weekend clothes, for those times 'after 7pm, when
parents have to come out of their chrysalis'. There is a tartan, wool jacket
from Harvie &amp; Hudson, and ties from the Royal Academy. Its shop sells a
striking selection of artists' designs.
'When my casual clothes get shabby, I keep them for painting in,' he
insists. 'Cleanliness is still the gentleman's great motto; a clean mind,
clean body and clean clothes.'
Neil Duckworth, 38, is managing director of Tag Heuer sports watches in the
UK. During the week, he's 'forced to wear tailored suits' but at weekends he
reverts to the sporty style which, he feels, reflects his true character.
'I play a lot of tennis,' he says, 'and I'm always getting changed in and
out of sports gear, so I want weekend clothes which are hassle-free.'
A lot come from Henry Cotton, a label which has the combination he likes of
outdoor styling, ease and comfort, and good quality construction. They also,
he says, have no ostentatious or overt labelling.
'I don't consider myself label-oriented,' he explains, 'but labels do help
when it comes to shopping. And I do like brands which, like my own, have an
authenticity to them.'
Duckworth almost invariably chooses clothes in greens and blues, the colours
at the centre of the Henry Cotton 'country and coast' palette. But he livens
his outfits with a dash of colour, like a red T-shirt, or a shirt from Sam
Browne in Fulham, 'a little more trendy' than most of his clothes.
Naturally, he switches his watch at weekends, from the stylish steel and
gold Tag Heuer chronometer he wears during the week, to a more robust Series
2000 model, with a brown leather strap 'which looks more casual and trendy.
A watch is part of a wardrobe, and should be businesslike or sporty to match
the rest of your dress.'
Weekend trousers tend to be jeans, from Emporio Armani, 'because smart jeans
like those will go with anything, from a trendy top, to a smart shirt and
blazer for lunch.' And with the same kind of versatility, footwear is
Timberland boat shoes, in brown or blue.
For smarter weekend occasions, he has two jackets from Gieves &amp; Hawkes. One
is a classic blue blazer, the other, 'a bit more of a blaze of colour', a
sports jacket in a combination of yellow and green. In both cases, he
prefers the classic style of Gieves &amp; Hawkes. 'My physique just seems to
suit a more traditional cut,' he says. 'Or perhaps it's my age . . .' And
beneath, he wears button-down shirts from Ralph Lauren, 'not cheap, but
really very nice material'.
It's not a huge range of clothes - but, he says, that is deliberate. 'I
don't want an extensive wardrobe,' he says. 'It's the weekend. I don't want
to have to think too much.'

FT  02 APR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Brothers in business - The
Mirpuris are interchangeable, except when it comes to pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILF ALTMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Princess Royal asked: 'Are you going for the hat trick?' as Robert
Mirpuri, Managing Director of Magicwell, a North London children's clothing
company, proudly received an award for the second year in succession.
The occasion was the annual awards dinner of the British Apparel Association
of which the Princess is president. The Mirpuri brothers' firm, Magicwell,
had just won again the 'Outstanding Export Achievement' award in the
childrenswear category.
The business was started in 1980, although its roots go back further, and
has been built mainly on overseas sales.
In 1970, brothers Robert, Harry and Michael Mirpuri, plus a cousin and an
uncle, set up a childrenswear shop in south-east London. By 1974 they owned
four shops specialising in clothes for 2-12 year olds.
Robert recalled: 'Retailing, combined with a little wholesaling, taught us
two important lessons - the value of being close to and listening to our
customers, and stocking what they wanted, and secondly offering a good
service. If we had a good order in the morning, we'd run to the supplier in
the afternoon and get the order out on the same day.'
In 1980 the three brothers decided to branch out on their own to concentrate
on exports, mostly to the Middle East at first.
They began above their shop in Islington which they still own. 'It helps us
to keep in touch with customers' tastes,' Michael explained. The other shops
were sold.
During the course of the sale they were impressed by accountant Melvyn
Singer of Berg Kaprow Lewis, who has since been a friend and adviser on such
key issues as financing growth, revising the capital structure of the
company, tax planning and so on.
As retailers and wholesalers, the Mirpuri brothers were already selling to
visiting Arabs in the mid-70s. Coming from the Sudan they all spoke Arabic
and began to appreciate that fashionable children's clothes were becoming a
growth market.
'We started making up collections through our supplier contacts,' Harry
recalled. 'We went out cold to Kuwait, Bahrain and Dubai. I well remember
our first big order was worth Pounds 17,000. In our first year, export sales
came to Pounds 132,000. For the next three or four years we doubled this
every year.'
Now the brothers take it in turn to make at least three overseas trips each
year. But while export sales account for about 90 per cent of turnover, more
efforts are being made to increase UK sales. Key accounts include Debenhams,
House of Fraser, Etam and Fenwick.
Total annual turnover has reached Pounds 6m and at the firm's North London
office and warehouse the average weekly business of Pounds 125,000 is
handled by seven employees and the three brothers.
Robert, the eldest, studied production. He looks after marketing and finance
 -the latter with advice as required from Melvyn Singer. Harry is
responsible for administration, shipping and documentation and Michael
handles UK sales.
The brothers work closely together. 'We are fully interchangeable,' said
Harry. 'Each of us can do the jobs the others do.' But that does not mean
they are paid the same. Robert explained: 'We pay ourselves and share
profits according to age. That's a traditional Asian custom when businesses
are built and run for the benefits of families.' Most of the profits,
however, are reinvested to allow for expansion.
The Mirpuris' strength is in design and sourcing. They are quick to spot
market requirements and tastes, and to develop ideas. Middle Eastern
customers like frills and flounces, fussy party frocks and mini three-piece
suits.
Almost all their ranges, including children's body vests and briefs,
lace-trimmed socks and fancy waistcoats are manufactured in the UK by
between 30 and 40 companies - many of them small businesses in the Midlands,
equally keen to come up with new ideas and to work on those put forward by
the brothers.
'It hasn't always been straightforward expansion,' said Robert. 'We've had
some very thin times, for instance during the Gulf War and more recently
when the pound was very strong. On the other hand we've benefited since
Britain came out of the ERM.'
The brothers admit their business success owes a debt to their family, not
least the entrepreneurial skills of their grandfather. At the turn of the
century he set sail from India for South America, then to Alexandria where
prospects were said to be better. From there he sailed along the Nile to
Port Sudan where he hired a donkey to carry bundles of Chinese silk and
Indian curios to the dockside to sell.
His sons built on this foundation by opening department stores in the Sudan
before coming to England. 'But this,' said Robert, pointing to a bulging
storeroom and the rows of frilly childrenswear, 'would have been beyond
grandfather's imagination.'

FT  02 APR 94 / Motoring: A cabriolet to fit seductive moments - Road Test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was the kind of motoring few believe still possible and fewer have
experienced. The road - well-graded, signposted lavishly and mostly
well-surfaced - ran through ranges of rocky hills that changed colour by the
minute. It was almost free of traffic; the sun blazed down from a cloudless
sky; and the open, two-litre Peugeot 306 cabriolet matched the mood
perfectly.
I was in Egypt, driving down the west coast of the Gulf of Aqaba to Sharm
al-Sheikh and the Ras Muhammad nature reserve on Sinai's southern tip. For
most of the way, the land is uninhabited.
On the straights, with clear visibility for miles, the Peugeot ran safely up
to its maximum 121mph (195kph). On the winding passes, it cornered as though
glued to the tarmac, the 123-horsepower engine singing sweetly in third and
fourth.
In Sharm al-Sheikh itself, a prudent 25mph (40kph) or less was dictated by a
combination of ferocious speed humps and locals unable to decide on which
side of the road to drive. But the Peugeot's suspension dealt as capably
with deep potholes as it had with the odd stretch of broken surface at high
speed.
For the cabriolet, Peugeot has reinforced the 306 hatchback body shell
heavily and tuned the suspension. As a result, the open body is so stiff
that, even on corrugated dirt roads, the fascia did not shake. (I have known
some open cars to shake so badly that the instruments became a blur on
moderately rough surfaces.)
The hood is super-efficient, too. Unlock a pair of clips on the windscreen,
press a button - and the top vanishes under an automatic pop-up panel in the
rear deck.
There is not quite so much room in the back seat as in a 306 hatchback but,
for a cabriolet, the boot is surprisingly wide and deep. Driving position
and general dynamics - the accurate power-assisted steering, light gear
shift, powerful brakes and sure-footed handling - are as good as one expects
of a Peugeot.
Even at maximum speed, hood and windows down, your head feels in no danger
of being blown off. Windows up, and with an optional extra (around Pounds
100) air-deflecting mesh in place, there is barely enough draught at modest
speeds to ruffle the hair.
A hard top that fits over the folded-down hood during winter months will be
offered later.
On the return leg, I drove a 1.8-litre cabriolet. It lacked just a little of
the bigger car's muscle (103hp against 123) but was just as enjoyable,
cornering as capably and riding the bumps a shade more comfortably than the
squatter-tyred two-litre. Curiously, the less-powerful model has slightly
higher gearing, but it drives just as flexibly at low speeds.
Mainland European buyers will also be offered a 1.8-litre cabriolet with
automatic transmission. But Britain - initially, at any rate - will get only
the two-litre manual, which arrives in May and is likely to cost about
Pounds 17,000.
Peugeot expects to sell 1,000 a year in Britain of the 306 cabriolets. Some
will be bought by people who might otherwise have gone for posh Escort,
Astra, Golf, Renault 19 or Rover 220 soft tops.
But Peugeot also has the upmarket BMW 3-Series and Audi 80 convertibles in
its sights. And the 306 - especially when topless - looks so seductive that
the 1,000-a-year forecast might turn out on the low side if the UK has a few
decent summers.
The day before visiting Sharm al-Sheikh in the 306 cabriolets, I drove a new
1.6-litre Peugeot 106 Griffe from Aqaba in Jordan to Petra. (There, I
swopped it for a sure-footed little Arab grey to ride down the narrow gorge
to the ruins of the ancient city.
Emerging to see the rose-red Nabbatean treasury glowing theatrically in the
sunshine was everything I had imagined it would be - a moment of sheer
magic).
Driving north up the main highway from Aqaba, the Griffe flew past
articulated lorries groaning uphill and creeping cautiously down. On the
sinuous minor road to Wadi Musa and Petra, I found it urbane and
entertaining.
For the return leg I tried the latest version of the sporty 106 XSi,
1.6-engined like the Griffe but with five more horsepower (95 against 90)
and firmer suspension.
On balance, I preferred the Griffe. It had all the handling and road-holding
anyone could use responsibly on public roads, plus the ride comfort of a
much larger car.
Aware that Griffe and grief sound the same to Britons, but have different
meanings, Peugeot will call the new luxury 106 the Gentry when it arrives in
September, priced between Pounds 11,000 and Pounds 11,500.
The XSi, due in the UK in June, will be just under Pounds 11,000.
A feature of the PSA/Fiat multi-purpose vehicles, the Peugeot 806 among
them, unveiled at Geneva show (this column, March 12/13) is a gear lever
protruding not from the floor but the fascia. Its movement is exactly the
same but the floor is left uncluttered.
Having tried and liked it in a new Peugeot Boxer light commercial, I think
it could start a new fashion. Or, thinking of the Renault 4 and Citroen 2CV,
which had something similar, it might revive a very old one.

FT  02 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Pioneers of pensions - Insurance for
life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Provident Life and Professional Life pioneered the concept of non-commission
personal pension plans and provided a blueprint for the modern pension
contract. So far, they have been joined by two recent entrants to the
individual pensions market: Mercury Life and Invesco MIM. But when life
offices are forced to reveal full charges and commissions from January 1995
onwards, more will join them.
Provident Life and Professional Life are backed by heavyweight parents -
both Winterthur and Skandia are among the European top-20 life offices.
Winterthur has an impressive top rating of AAA from Standard and Poor's.
As this series has revealed, most major providers are prepared to sell their
commission-loaded plans on a nil-commission basis. Under this system,
though, it is difficult to check how much of the commission actually is
re-invested in your plan.
With a genuine non-commission plan, if the adviser's remuneration is
deducted from the client's premiums, this will appear as an explicit charge
on the client agreement. And the flexibility of non-commission products
compares well with standard commission-based plans, since the charging
structure is explicit and there is no penalty for reducing or stopping
premiums.
A distinguishing feature of the two companies' plans is that, in addition to
internally managed funds, they offer access to external fund managers. This
allows the client to switch investment managers without the cost of changing
to another provider.
Professional Life's charges include an annual administration fee of 0.75 on
the first Pounds 5,000, reducing in stages to 0.25 per cent. The annual
charge of the external fund manager ranges from 0.2 per cent (BZW) to 0.95
per cent (Morgan Grenfell). There is also an establishment fee of Pounds
2.50 a month for five years.
The plans normally are sold on a commission-free basis, but Professional
Life will deduct a flat rate adviser's fee from the first premium if that is
the method preferred. The company offers a series of managed funds (invested
in a range of sectors) and sector funds (such as UK, US, European equity)
run by six external managers.
Most of these funds were launched in 1990, so they do not yet appear in the
five-year performance tables. Over three years, however, Fidelity and Morgan
Grenfell achieved excellent managed fund returns followed closely by
Gartmore, with performance consistently in the top 25 per cent. Professional
Life's money fund is a leading performer for the three years since launch in
1990.
The bulk of Professional Life's personal pensions are used as transfer
plans, although a few are transfers of benefits from occupational schemes.
Most clients switch from other providers to gain access to the range of
external investment managers.
Provident Life's initial charge depends on the premium size: for example, 2
per cent up to Pounds 19,999. The annual fund management charge is low: 0.5
per cent. There is also a set-up fee of Pounds 150 on regular premium plans,
and a service fee of up to Pounds 2.50 a month.
Last July, following a disappointing period of in-house investment,
Provident Life appointed Schroder to manage all but one of its equity-based
funds. The impact of the external management has yet to be seen - but
Provident Life's non-equity funds (property, fixed interest, index linked
and money) are run in-house and have an excellent record.

Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation). Provident Life and
Professional Life plans are structured on a nil-commission basis but
naturally they do impose other charges for administration. To reveal the
impact of these charges we asked for illustrations for a man age 45 who
expects to retire at age 65 (ie a 20 year contract), paying (a) pounds
200 per month and (b) a stand alone single premium of pounds 10,000. The
final figures show a theoretical value where no charges were deducted.

FT  02 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Half share in house
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My parents owned the house in which they lived as tenants in common. My
father died recently and left me his half share. If the house is sold, will
I be liable to CGT on my share? (I own and live in a house in another town).
If I gave my share to my mother, would she have to pay gift tax? If I
refused the inheritance, would it go automatically to my mother, thus
avoiding any CGT if the house is sold later?
What you might save in CGT could be more than lost in inheritance tax (on
your mother's death) if you renounce your father's bequest. Your reference
to 'gifts tax' indicates you do not understand the CGT and IHT systems - so
do discuss things with the lawyer.
Before the second anniversary of your father's death, you should give formal
notice to your tax office (under section 222(5)(a) of the Taxation of
Chargeable Gains Act 1992) that your existing home is to be treated as your
main residence, with effect from the day of your father's death.
This notice will give you the chance eventually to elect for your parents'
home to be treated as your main residence, and then to elect for your
existing home to be treated as your main residence once again, with a week
or so in between. Such judiciously-timed notices could bring you substantial
(or complete) relief from CGT on your half share without producing an
unacceptable CGT bill on selling your existing home.

FT  02 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A cottage to let
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am considering letting a terraced cottage as shared accommodation. I am
told the Revenue does not regard property letting as a business, regardless
of how much time is actually spent in managing tenancies, maintenance etc.,
and will not allow expenses to be deducted before tax. Is this so?
The letting of property is not a trade (and, consequently, the generous
expenses rules of case I of schedule D do not apply), but expenses are
deductible under the rules of schedule A (unfurnished letting) or case VI of
schedule D (furnished letting).
It is possible to elect for income from furnished lettings to be assessed
partly under schedule A and partly under schedule D case VI, which can be
advantageous in some situations.
As a first step, ask your tax office for the free pamphlet IR87 (Income from
letting property). Then, since you will need a solicitor, try to find a firm
which can give you tax advice as well as preparing documentation for the
lettings etc.

FT  02 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Scrip and the Revenue view
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am just setting about my capital gains tax computation for 93/94 and am
stuck on two issues:
1. The Inland Revenue approach to computing income and gains on disposal of
shares acquired through enhanced scrip dividends.
2. The date of acquisition of shares acquired via a trust settlement. My
father died in 1968, leaving shares in trust for me, with my mother
receiving all income until she died in 1986. When did I 'acquire' them for
CGT purposes?
As 1982 saw a new 'base line' of capital gains established, I have been
assuming that April 1982 is the date for indexing any gains from this trust
settlement.
1. A scrip dividend which is sold straight away has to be shown in your tax
return twice: first as income and then in the capital gains section.
For income tax purposes, you will be treated as though you had been paid a
dividend equal to 125 per cent of the market value of the scrip (on the
quarter-up basis), and as though income tax had been deducted from that
dividend at the rate of 20 per cent, broadly speaking. That notional income
tax is not repayable, however.
For CGT purposes, the scrip is treated broadly as though it were a rights
issue, taken up at a price equal to its market value (on the quarter-up
basis, as above). The calculation of the chargeable gain will, therefore,
depend upon whether part (or the whole) of your original shareholding was
acquired (or is deemed to have been acquired) before April 6 1982, for
example.
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CGT13 (The indexation allowance
for quoted shares); CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction); and CGT16
(Indexation allowance: disposals after April 5 1988).
2. On the bare facts outlined, you are deemed to have acquired the shares on
the day of your mother's death at their market value (on the quarter-up
basis) on that day.

answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as

FT  02 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: The commission-hater - Chantrey
Financial Services: 10th in a series on fee-based advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Harris, the managing director of Chantrey Financial Services, has a
dream. He would like commissions on the sale of financial products to
'disappear off the face of the earth.'
Harris says: 'In general, the financial services industry has been brought
up to think that any time spent will ultimately result in a product sale. I
think that is at the root cause of all our problems. We have created a
public relations image that is really appalling, and we have now got a very
long road and a hard job to try to put it right.'
Harris worked for a Canadian stockbroker before joining accountant Chantrey
Vellacott to develop its fixed interest business. He also began to take over
the investment portfolios of the firm's private clients. He founded Chantrey
Financial Services (CFS) in 1986 as the investment and financial planning
arm of the practice.
The rigorous professional approach by CFS reflects Harris's own trenchant
views on the manner in which independent financial advisers (IFAs) should
conduct their business. From the start, it offered comprehensive financial
planning, exclusively on a fee basis, and obliged its advisers to acquire
qualifications as part of their employment contracts.
Fees are time-based and range from Pounds 35 to Pounds 150 an hour. Any
commission received is rebated to clients or re-invested on their behalf.
Harris says: 'Everybody in CFS must produce an account statement daily, and
this has to account for seven hours of client work. All that information
goes into the main frame computer and is converted into a monthly print-out.
I can analyse this and see who spent what time on a client's account.'
Harris argues that the financial services arm of an accountancy practice
should enjoy the best of two very different worlds. He says: 'I am fully
aware that there are people in the accountancy firm with more knowledge on
tax than I have, and I don't think IFAs can give proper tax advice.
'Because of my investment background, there has always been a leaning to put
tax and investment planning together. It is very difficult to make an
investment without a tax consequence; and, when an accountancy firm is
looking at tax matters, the conclusion will often be an investment. They are
entwined.'
Harris concedes, however, that there can be a clash of cultures between
accountants and lFAs. His accountant colleagues sometimes have a jaundiced
view of financial services, and it can be difficult to find financial
advisers who operate comfortably within the framework of an accountancy
practice. 'You need someone who is technically competent, approachable, has
the patience of Job but is also commercially aware,' Harris says.
'On a day-to-day basis I am given a completely free rein, but I am also
responsible to shareholders for the performance of the company. I am sure
that a lot of clients probably see us as a department of the firm, and I
think it is a measure of our success that we are named in the same breath as
the tax practice.' Some 90 per cent of the CFS clients come through the
accountancy practice.
Chantrey Vellacott is the result of a merger between two firms (one dating
back to 1788), each with a rather different client mix. One practice
concentrated on personal tax clients, with a particular emphasis on the
legal profession, while the other dealt largely with successful family
companies. These two strands are reflected in Harris's clients today; 20 per
cent are lawyers.
About 40 per cent of the firm's income comes from investment management; 40
per cent from work on pensions and their derivatives; and 20 per cent from
personal or corporate financial services. The average investment portfolio
is around Pounds 100,000 but no minimum is imposed: Harris says there is
room for 'Mrs Smith with Pounds 5,000'.
'The starting point of any portfolio is always National Savings and
index-linked vehicles,' he says. 'Then, we look at the equity portion. We
would always suggest an international spread. For the most part, the
portfolios will tend towards investment trusts and units trusts and offshore
funds.' If clients want a direct exposure in equities, Harris uses
stockbrokers with which CFS has connections. He says: 'As a quid pro quo, we
get some advice and valuations free, so we are able to provide this added
value for clients.'
All client investments are managed on an advisory basis. 'As an investment
manager, there are times when I would be delighted to have discretionary
funds,' Harris says. 'It would make my life much easier. But we believe that
clients come to an accountant for advice, and that they then make their
decisions on the advice he gives.' Harris adds: 'I think our clients trust
us.'
He is optimistic about the future of lFAs such as Chantrey but less happy
about other developments in the financial services industry. 'I am sceptical
whether the (proposed new) Personal Investment Authority will work, and I
think the IFA sector will be under-represented on its board. Ultimately,
that must mean that the big banks and the life companies will have more and
more significance.
'I believe firms such as CFS will have a niche if they do their business
properly and would like to see that niche grow. But I am not terribly
confident that we will not end up with a fee-paying sector only for high net
worth individuals. I would be very disappointed if that happened.'

FT  02 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Buyer for M&amp;S - Directors'
transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As expected, the fall in the market has made it more attractive, and the
number of buys by directors recorded over the week is higher that it has
been for a while.
Marks and Spencer is such a high quality stock that it forms a part of every
portfolio. But the directors of M&amp;S most frequently appear on our listing
when they exercise options and sell the consequent ordinaries. It is,
therefore, interesting to note one director, Donald Trangmar, make such a
sizeable purchase - 145,000 shares at 415p.
The sale in Denman Electrical was made by Arnold Denman, its chairman and
chief executive. While he raised some Pounds 460,000 with the deal, the
transaction represents a very small proportion of his total holding of more
than 2.2m shares.
The sale in Osprey Communications also leaves that director with the body of
his holding intact, with almost 2m shares.
On March 19, we said that a director of Castings plc had sold 8,000 shares
worth a total of Pounds 20,000. This was incorrect: the director exercised
options over 8,000 shares but sold only 2,000.

FT  02 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: The pig-headed way to lose your
money - Why do people hold on to failing investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HELGA DRUMMOND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine buying Pounds 1,000 worth of shares on a Monday and discovering on
the Friday they are worth only Pounds 600. Do you hold them or sell and move
on?
Unless there is real hope of recovery, the wisest decision is to cut your
losses. Yet, many people prefer to continue with a failing investment,
sometimes eventually losing everything as a result. What causes such
irrational behaviour?
Such irrational persistence is known as escalation and a prime cause is
believed to be an investor's emotional attachment to his initial outlay.
Instead of accepting the situation for what it has become, his attention is
fixed upon restoring the initial Pounds 1,000.
More than money could be at stake, though. Few people care to look foolish
in the eyes of others, including their own stockbrokers and accountants.
They will go to extraordinary lengths to avoid admitting failure by seeking
out information which seems to support their preconceived views while
ignoring anything that contradicts these.
The most minuscule sign of improvement is interpreted as sure evidence of
certain recovery. Further price falls are dismissed as temporary setbacks.
Even when recovery never comes, people may in extreme cases even make
further commitments to a failing investment in order to maintain
appearances.
Even if investors pay proper attention to financial reports and statistics,
there is still the risk of a misjudgment. While decisions based upon
thorough research tend to be more reliable than those based on inspired
guesses and wishful thinking, copious intelligence can lead investors
seriously astray.
Quantity increases self-confidence while, simultaneously, impairing judgment
 -a dangerous combination.
The more information investors have, the greater their faith in their own
judgment. Yet, since human capacity to digest and analyse data is extremely
limited, even with the aid of sophisticated computers, significant pointers
may be overlooked in the sheer mass of reports, commentaries and analyses.
Irrational persistence may be aggravated if loss is accompanied by strong
feelings of disappointment. This tends to be most acute where the investor's
initial expectations were high. Advertisements create high hopes
deliberately by promising 'pure growth' and the rewards of the stock market
with none of the risks.
Such propositions are not only alluring in themselves - their more subtle
effect is to distract investors' attention from hard statistical data which
might qualify the prospects trumpeted.
The most hazardous advertisements are not the banner proclamations, however,
but the soberly-presented textual statements. For instance: 'Investment for
high rewards can never be risk-free and some of our recommendations don't
work out . . . The impact of . . . disasters can be mitigated by operating a
20 per cent stop loss rule. We have found from long experience that when a
share price drops by 20 per cent after we have profiled the company, they
are best sold . . . If losses are confined to around 20 per cent while
profits are unlimited, the odds on overall success are greatly improved.'
The effect of such a relatively sophisticated approach is to make the reader
feel sophisticated. Note how an atmosphere of candour is created by the
admission that some investments fail. The aim of such a disarming statement
is gain the reader's confidence.
The next step is to imbue the prospective investor with a sense of control
via the 'stop loss rule'. Note this facility is not expressed as a 'stop
loss option', (which, basically, is what it is) but a 'rule'. The very word
heightens the investor's feelings of power and ability to command.
The advertisement then emphasises the company's expertise in order to
present a possible 20 per cent loss as eminently reasonable and manageable
while, simultaneously, dangling the possibility of glittering returns.
Instead of making a crude appeal to greed, however, the whole thing is
couched in professional-sounding and euphemistic language such as 'unlimited
profits' and 'overall success'.
The financial services industry is replete with people claiming expertise.
Expert power succeeds because the investor believes the adviser is acting in
his interests.
So potent is this power that a person will believe an 'expert' despite being
almost certain he is wrong. Professed expertise, therefore, can lead an
investor seriously astray. Besides, even financial advisers of impeccable
integrity are susceptible to escalation. So, seek advice by all means - but
maintain vigilance and let your own judgment have the last word.
Feelings of potency can be created easily by the unscrupulous. The signs of
manipulation are easy to detect: they include flattering the investor's
judgment and decisiveness and emphasising previous successes. The problem is
that since such observations are highly flattering, they stand a good chance
of being believed. Pride does indeed come before a fall.
Helga Drummond, who lectures at the University of Liverpool's Institute of
Public Administration and Management, is researching escalation in
decision-making.

FT  02 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Troubles over? - The week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost every UK reference last year to Invesco MIM, the fund manager,
mentioned its record Pounds 750,000 fine from regulator Imro and its
involvement in the Mirror Group pension scheme. The fine has been digested
and Invesco paid the Mirror trustees Pounds 11m in a settlement without
admitting liability. Analysts say the group has cleaned itself up but
results for last year, due on Thursday, are expected to reflect a struggle
to retain existing institutional clients and attract new business. Most
forecasts for annual pre-tax profits are in the Pounds 30m to Pounds 40m
range, after an exceptional item of Pounds 11m for the Mirror pay-out,
compared with Pounds 12.6m after exceptionals last year.
Amec will on Thursday become the latest building and civil engineering
company to announce annual results for 1993. Hit more than most contractors
from its excursion into UK house-building, it is expected to have bounced
back into the black with analysts forecasting pre-tax profits ranging from
Pounds 22m to Pounds 25m. This compares with an Pounds 87.5m loss after
provisions of Pounds 114.6m in 1992.
Another indication of recovery in construction should come on the same day
from Hewden Stuart, the UK's biggest independent plant hire group. It is
expected to report pre-tax profits of about Pounds 18m for the year to
January 31, well up on the previous year's Pounds 12m.

FT  02 APR 94 / Television: Satellite dominated by numbers - The gap between
Sky's valuation and its viewers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sky Television launches what it grandly calls its Billion Dollar Preview
Weekend next Saturday, showing 24 films in two days free to anyone with a
satellite dish.
The films which collectively took more than Dollars 1bn at the box office
range from The Addams Family and Basic Instinct to Batman Returns and Alien
3.
The promotion is designed to show those who have satellite equipment but are
not paying for the scrambled movie channels what they are missing.
A simultaneous promotion is offering viewers satellite equipment installed
on a month's free trial. The hope is that consumers thinking of getting a
satellite dish will opt for the free trial now - and that once the dish is
fixed and holes drilled in the wall, they will not want the bother of having
it taken away - a clever piece of inertia selling.
And for Sky it is a no-risk deal: the cost of the free trial is being met by
manufacturers and retailers.
The history of satellite television in the UK suggests that people do not
queue to join the multi-channel revolution. They have to be cajoled by
special offers, heavy promotion and live sporting events.
Sky's top sport of the moment - the West Indian annihilation of the English
cricket team - is unlikely to generate many new sales, and so the promotions
on dishes and films appear well timed.
Five years after the launch of Sky Television the satellite business is
dominated by two sets of numbers - one extremely high, the other pretty low.
The high numbers are the values being attached to British Sky Broadcasting,
the Sky holding company, a consortium 50 per cent owned by Rupert Murdoch's
News Corporation. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, owns 17.5 per cent,
as does Chargeurs of France, with the Granada group owning 13.5 per cent.
The small numbers are the viewing figures, as the audience spreads itself
across 20 channels. In a recent week the 10th rated programme on Sky One,
the most popular satellite channel, Star Trek The Next Generation won an
audience of 350,000. The 10th rated programme on ITV, an episode of The
Bill, pulled in 12.95m.
Yet this week, stockbroker Barclays de Zoete Wedd produced what analyst
Vighnesh Padiachy described as a conservative valuation for a company
notorious for its losses and the Pounds 1.6bn already invested. The
valuation was Pounds 4.6bn. This compared with a previous BZW valuation of
Pounds 2.5bn.
What bridges the gap between the valuations and the viewing figures is the
fact that 80 per cent of Sky's revenues come from subscription rather than
advertising, and the fact that the number of subscribers continues to rise.
Sky says 3.5m homes receive at least some of its services, together with
other offerings outside the Sky package, such as Ted Turner's CNN and
TNT/Cartoon Channel and Eurosport.
The company adds that 3.3m homes subscribe to at least one of the pay
channels and the total number of channel subscriptions to the sports channel
and the two movie channels has reached 7m - with many households accounting
for three subscriptions.
BZW says it is the exclusive rights to key programmes - films and sport -
which will drive the subscriber base forward: 'As critical mass is achieved
and additional advertising revenues obtained, the strong cash flow generated
will put the group in pole position to secure further sports rights and
renegotiate the movie contract which will in turn further stimulate
subscriber interest.'
So will it soon be impossible to watch live sport on television without
enriching Rupert Murdoch? The future will probably not be quite as bleak as
that. But it is clear that other sports events will go the way of the
Premier League football contract - to Sky.
Sky is planning a second sports channel next year - to give greater play to
the sports rights it already has, and also to introduce pay-per view. This
will enable Sky to buy the rights to a world boxing title fight, for
example, and charge perhaps Pounds 5 a time to watch.
Sky has also expressed an interest in the Wimbledon tennis championships but
it is likely, at least for the time being, to settle for access to play on
the outer courts.
But viewing of new channels in homes with cable and satellite is measured at
just 28 to 34 per cent of total television consumption - and that was before
the West Indies made cricket just too painful to watch.

FT  02 APR 94 / Markets: Whatever you do, don't say b**r in public - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asked on national news on Wednesday what was wrong with the stock market,
the investment analyst smirked at the camera and said: 'It's a four-letter
word that begins with a 'b' and ends with an 'r', and we're not allowed to
say it in public.'
Wall Street may not want to talk about it, but traders and investors are
having to confront the possibility that the stock market is in serious
trouble.
As of midday on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen almost
300 points, or 7.5 per cent, since the Federal Reserve raised short-term
interest rates for the second time on March 22. Over the same period, the
broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index had dropped 27 points, or six per cent.
By midday Thursday, the Dow was trading more than 10 per cent below its
all-time high of 3,978.36, which was achieved only as recently as January
31.
The most recent declines have come against the background of a disturbing
deterioration in investor sentiment - an indefinable, incalculable, but
extremely important ingredient in the market mix.
While there have been plenty of diversions to unsettle investors lately -
new revelations in the Whitewater affair and fresh political unrest in
Mexico, Korea, the Middle East and South Africa - no one piece of news has
prompted the big sell-off.
Some fingers have pointed to the Fed's monetary policy-tightening 10 days
ago, but a quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates to the still
low level of 3.5 per cent hardly warranted the big decline in share prices
seen since the Fed's move.
The fact that the heavy selling cannot be blamed on a single news event
worries analysts, because the gloom that has descended on investors lately
is the sort that cannot easily be lifted.
Moreover, the downward spiral in prices is not easily halted. The further
prices fall, the more depressed investors become, and the more likely they
are to decide to sell stocks so they can put their funds into the relative
safety of cash instruments.
Two big Wall Street brokerage houses, Smith Barney Shearson and Dean Witter
Reynolds, recommended doing just that this week, when they advised clients
to lower stock holdings in their portfolios to 50 per cent and raise their
cash holdings accordingly.
Ultimately, if there is a single factor behind the sharp declines and
weakening sentiment it is increasing long-term interest rates. Since hitting
a low of just under 5.8 per cent last October, long-term rates, as measured
by the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond, have risen to 7.15
per cent.
That surge in rates has been driven by growing concern about inflation among
bond investors, who believe that although inflation remains low now, the
acceleration in economic activity seen since the latter half of last year
will push inflation to much higher levels before 1994 ends.
Whether these fears are justified or not (and a strong case can be made
that, because of productivity improvements and a global disinflationary
trend, the US inflation rate, currently at 3 per cent, will remain low over
the long-term in spite of the strengthening economy), the impact of rising
interest rates on investor sentiment has been profound.
The impressive gains in stock prices between 1990 and 1993 were primarily
caused by falling interest rates, which persuaded millions of individual
investors to take their money out of short-term cash assets, such as
certificates of deposit and money market assets, and put it into equities.
Share prices, on an upward path throughout that period, only served to
encourage further the flow of funds into the stock market.
Now that interest rates are rising, and share prices are falling, individual
investors are starting to think twice about whether the stock market is the
best place for their money. Yet, the latest figures show that while the flow
of money into stock mutual funds is slowing from last year's high levels,
more money is still going into the stock market via funds than is leaving.
This suggests that investors, while rattled by the rise in interest rates,
are still keeping faith with the stock market. How long that faith holds, is
the big question.
So where does the market go from here?
No one, of course, really knows, but there are essentially three views.
Either, stocks are nearing the end of a 10 per cent 'correction'. Or, they
are in the middle of a 15 per cent 'correction'. Or (and this is the bit
that Wall Street does not want to think about), share prices are at the
start of a long-term b**r market.

<TEXT>
New Finance Bill clauses accepted this week by the government will make it
easier for companies to establish and operate employee share ownership
trusts (ESOTs).
It will no longer be necessary for the majority of the trustees to be
employee representatives, and the maximum period for which shares can be
retained in the trust is being increased from seven years to 20.
ESOTs have until now been shunned by all but a handful of companies and
these changes are designed to boost the take-up rate.

FT  02 APR 94 / Markets: Proof of truth in an old wives' tale - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Here is some good news for anyone cringing at their new tax burden. April is
the best month of the year for buying shares. It is a particularly good
month for oil shares. But you ought to be thinking of ditching your
cyclicals over the next couple of months. And then, in June or July, you can
start nibbling at consumer shares again.
There is just one little catch before you pull out your wallet. These
exhortations are based on typical stock market behaviour since the second
world war. But these trends do not always hold true, and this year could
always be one of those exceptions that prove the rule. Certainly, February
and March have been atypically bad for shares.
You have been warned. Now, back to the seasonal theory.
The best known popular tag about the stock market is probably 'Sell in May,
and go away'. Sophisticates scoff at such old wives' tales. But Nick Glydon
of Credit Lyonnais Laing, who has spent years researching post-war
investment trends, has produced what looks like solid proof that this
particular tale has more than a kernel of truth.
The basic seasonal pattern is remarkably similar regardless of the period
chosen: 48 years, 20 years or just the past 10. Share prices start the year
strongly, top out in May, either fall or mark time during the summer, and
pick up strongly again in November/December. The new year surge has been
even more pronounced recently, with even flatter summer doldrums and a
sharper pick-up at the end of the year.
What makes the tenacity of the seasonal pattern all the odder is that the
fundamental explanation for it has ceased to exist. Once, it could be
rationalised by looking at a farming calendar. After the harvest, farmers
were rich and flooded the cities with cash, so interest rates fell and stock
prices rose. In summer, they needed to borrow until they could harvest their
crops and sell their animals, so interest rates rose and stock prices fell.
None of that remains relevant. What is more, the seasonal effect appears to
manifest itself in most of the other major world stock markets: Wall Street,
Tokyo, Frankfurt and Paris.
There are slight variations. The US, for instance, tops out slightly later
than Britain, but only by a few weeks. The only relatively sizeable markets
that break the mould are New Zealand, which is a bit freakish, and Mexico,
which currently stays strong in all seasons.
So, should you rush out and fill your boots with oil shares? Only if you
have other reasons for doing so. Even the men who research these seasonal
investment trends caution investors against following them blindly. They are
an additional prop for investment decision-making, not a self contained
investment system.
*****
From old wives' tales to the spicy modern world of derivatives. Financial
adviser Hargreaves Lansdowne is launching its first unit trust. Not one to
skulk in the shallow end, it is starting its new incarnation as a unit trust
manager with a warrant fund. The firm's 30-year-old investment director,
Michael Scott, reckons he knows more about warrants than most people.
Warrants give you the right to buy a security at a particular price over a
certain period. The warrant is, intrinsically, parasitic: it has value only
if it enables you to buy the security at less than its market price. If the
market price of the underlying security rises, the market price of the
warrant rises even more steeply. If it falls, the warrant falls faster. And
if you fail to use your right to buy before the end of the warrant's life,
it expires valueless.
In the right conditions, you can make a lot of money from warrants if you
get it right - and vice-versa. Until the market fell back earlier this year,
the climate had been ideal for warrants: almost anyone who owned them made
money just by sitting tight as a rising market made them steadily more
valuable.
The climate could well be less propitious over the next few years. If you
want to make money in a static or falling market, you need to trade actively
and catch companies on the turn. This is a challenging but essentially risky
game.
Is this a good time to be buying units in such an unusually speculative
trust from a novice unit trust management group? It is impossible to give a
definitive answer yet. But it is possible to state categorically that the
only investors who should even consider such a fund are those rich enough to
be able to afford to write off most of this investment if it comes to the
worst.
The promotional literature describes the fund as being 'only for the
adventurous'. Unfortunately that kind of 'warning' often tempts precisely
the kind of investor it should deter.
*****
Another tax regime, another tax trap. Most systems for collecting tax seem
to penalise certain types of taxpayer almost accidentally. Our tax checklist
on page III is drawn, deliberately, with a very broad brush. But it is still
possible to see something nasty happening to people who get the married
couple's allowance and have incomes between Pounds 27,145 and Pounds 28,865.
The increase in the tax bill rises almost vertically at that point. Another,
lesser, jump blights people earning between Pounds 21,840 and Pounds 22,360.

FT  02 APR 94 / Markets: Now Caradon must deliver - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Caradon, 1993 undoubtedly was a year of remarkable change. During the 12
months, it sold a business which in 1992 had contributed 30 per cent of
pre-tax profits, and bought another which will double the turnover of its
core building products activity.
At the same time, it held a Pounds 334m rights issue and, almost as a
sideline, changed its name. In spite of all this activity, underlying
profits were 5 per cent up and earnings per share, excluding exceptionals,
were unchanged.
It is hard to fault the Caradon management's handling of the strategic
changes it made last year. The sale of its 25.3 per cent stake in
CarnaudMetalbox had been on the cards for some time - indeed, almost since
the company was formed by the merger of MB Group's packaging operations with
Carnaud of France.
That was in 1989, shortly before MB merged with Caradon to form MB-Caradon,
which has now reverted to the Caradon name.
But CarnaudMetalbox had its problems, and Caradon had to play a waiting game
to secure the best price it could for its stake. Its chance finally came in
spring last year and it sold the stake in April for a net Pounds 467.5m,
giving a profit of Pounds 100.3m.
By then, though, interest rates had fallen. This meant two things: that the
returns on the cash would not match the profits Caradon was getting from its
packaging investment, and that prices of building product groups were
rising, almost out of reach.
So Caradon did well to strike a deal with RTZ to buy the Pillar businesses
(for Pounds 808.7m) against opposition from other interested parties. The
deal was announced in August, with the rights issue, and was completed in
October, leaving the balance sheet with gearing of only 8 per cent.
At the halfway stage, the diluting effect of selling the CarnaudMetalbox
stake could be seen in a 5.3 per cent fall in earnings per share. But by the
full year, with the benefit of only two months' trading from Pillar, this
had been made up to leave earnings unchanged at 15.2p a share. That said,
however, it could turn out that doing the strategic deals was the easy part.
The Pillar acquisition takes Caradon into new areas, notably building
products in North America, and its scale leaves little room for error.
Caradon undoubtedly has bought itself a great opportunity. The Pillar
business, although not neglected, did not do as well as it might have within
RTZ where the focus is on mining.
Pillar's margins are lower than Caradon's, giving potential for
improvements, and it brings market leadership in segments where Caradon has
not operated previously.
So far, the city has been willing to take Caradon's ability to turn that
potential into profits on trust. But, from here on, Caradon must start to
deliver.
What worried analysts about this week's results was evidence suggesting a
poorer performance in Caradon's UK building products than had been achieved
by its best competitors. If Caradon was not doing well in the business it
knew best, they asked, how was it going to sort out Pillar?
The Caradon management admits readily that, with so much going on at the
corporate strategic level last year, it might well have taken its eye off
the ball in the basic business.
UK building product volumes rose 9 per cent, as the market began to recover
from recession, but prices fell 1 per cent, leaving turnover up 8 per cent.
Operating profits barely were changed at Pounds 35.4m (Pounds 35.2m),
although much of the lack of growth could be put down to problems in
bathrooms where the troubles at Spring Ram led to pricing pressures.
Nevertheless forecasts are still for a large rise in present-year profits,
to Pounds 200m or more from 1993's Pounds 132.2m excluding exceptionals.
Chief executive Peter Jansen will not be drawn to make forecasts, but agrees
that 'it would go very hard with us' if earnings per share were not enhanced
by the Pillar deal.

FT  02 APR 94 / Markets: Psychology gains the upper hand - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you want a nice, restful weekend, please turn the page.
Still here? Steel yourself for the chart on the right and some of the
analysts' comments that follow.
Equities took an unnerving turn for the worse this week in London and New
York. Thus far in the markets' eight-week fall, most analysts had resorted
to rational explanations: key conditions, notably US monetary policy, had
changed; the markets would quickly accommodate and stabilise at lower
levels, they argued.
But psychology has now taken the upper hand, squelching fundamentals.
Falling share prices seem to have gained an ominous momentum of their own.
The rumblings are louder on Wall Street than in the City but the UK markets
are still taking their lead from the US.
The FT-SE 100 index racked up a net loss of 42.6 points on the week closing
at 3,086.4. It has now given up its entire 440-point gain since last
November's budget. Gilt prices, however, drawing some comfort from a
successful auction of floating rate bonds, edged a little higher.
This is prime time for pundits. Nick Knight, Nomura's London strategist,
said the FT-SE 100 was heading for 2,800. Robin Aspinall, of Panmure Gordon,
had been forecasting that level since last November. 'It seemed a phenomenal
distance away only a few weeks ago. Now it doesn't'
On Wall Street, Ms Elaine Garzarelli, Lehman Brothers' influential equities
analyst, said the Dow Jones industrial average was only halfway through a 15
per cent correction. Wall Street prices duly tumbled.
'Investors go through three phases in a stock market decline: complacency,
concern and capitulation. We have just entered concern. Capitulation is
ahead,' said Byron Wein, a leading US analyst with Morgan Stanley.
Retail investors in particular are vulnerable to losing their nerve. On both
sides of the Atlantic, they had swarmed into equities as interest rates
fell. Now rates are rising and equities falling, some will be tempted to
preserve slender gains, or forestall further losses, by selling shares.
Stability has to be achieved at some point, but how far down is the bottom
of the market? The accompanying chart shows what happened to the FT-A index
of European stocks in the corrections 1987, 1990 and so far this year. Mark
Howdle, chief European strategist at JP Morgan, does not believe the drop
will be anywhere near as steep as 1987 when a financial bubble burst, or
even 1990 when the Gulf War unseated markets. But he thinks the current
bottom could be another 5 to 10 percentage points below here.
The pattern is instructive. About a month into a downturn, stock markets
usually manage a feeble rebound, then continue to fall for another month or
two. After that, they bump along for many more months trying to build a firm
enough psychological and fundamentals base from which to rally.
Aspinall, one of City's most irascible bears, agrees with the pattern but
believes the bottom will be even lower. He has long advocated that the run
up in stocks last year was liquidity driven. Now that the 'cascade of cash'
is dwindling, stocks have a long way to retreat. 'Valuations are are still
too high in my view of the world. Low inflation and low growth are not good
news for equities.'
Those analysts trying to hang on to fundamentals point, for example, to the
4 per cent historic dividend yield which the Footsie will offer if it falls
to 2,900. But even so, they admit, a change in psychology would also be
needed before enthusiastic equity buying resumes.
'It's been a horrible quarter,' said Mark Tinker, an equity strategist at
James Capel. What equities need is a firm gilts market to stabilise them.
This support could materialise in the coming weeks when institutional
investors begin to implement their second quarter strategies. Pension funds,
for example, are likely to find attractive gilts' near 8 per cent yield. 'If
gilts can provide a prop, the equity market can go back to concentrating on
fundamentals and its own dynamics.'
The most dramatic turn of the week within equities came in the property
sector. After several months during which the sector traded at a very
unusual premium to net asset values, it reversed to its more normal
discount.
A number of property flotations were caught in the shift of sentiment.
Capital Shopping Centres, priced at a 13 per cent premium when the sector
was at a 20 per cent premium, had a rough first day of trading. Its shares
closed 22p below their offer price of 230p.
Similarly the Rugby Estates float was priced on Thursday well below its
initial target price.
The glut of property floats will cause some of the more opportunistic ones
to abandon their market plans or at least sharply scale back their pricings.
On the takeover front, GKN upped its offer for Westland from 290p to 335p
and promptly bought control in the market. From the start of the battle, it
had seemed only a matter of sweetening the bid a little since GKN started
with a 45 per cent stake in the helicopter maker.
The best quarter-end news, though, came from the stock-pickers. Forget the
markets, chose the companies, they argue. In fact, 23 of the 100 stocks in
the Footsie ended the quarter ahead. Leaders were Arjo Wiggins up 19.3 per
cent, British Aerospace 18.2 per cent, Ladbrokes 16.6 per cent and Reuters
11.1 per cent.
For those who even got the stock-picking wrong, Kingfisher was the worst
performer, down 26.5 per cent, National Westminster Bank was off 24.7 per
cent, HSBC Holdings 23.2 per cent and Guardian Royal Exchange 22.5 per cent.

FT  02 APR 94 / A prima donna's great performance: One of his fiercest
critics called him 'the great seducer'. Now, a media tycoon with no previous
political experience seems very likely to become Italy's next prime
minister. Robert Graham explains how the image triumphed over reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the nation that invented opera, the sudden emergence of Silvio
Berlusconi as the star of Italian politics seems only natural. As in opera,
the staging and music have been all important. The banality of a libretto is
masked easily by the magic of a prima donna's great performance. So, in
Berlusconi's spectacularly successful election campaign, form triumphed over
content, the package over the person, and the image over reality.
Italians like and admire the bella figura and do not always want to know how
it is created. Berlusconi's was a superb performance. One in four of the
Italian electorate voted for this self-made man whose media empire is the
second largest in Europe. Now, he looks set to become Italy's next prime
minister after less than three months in politics.
Eugenio Scalfari, editor of La Repubblica newspaper and one of Berlusconi's
most out-spoken critics, described him this week as 'the great seducer'.
And, indeed, Berlusconi's performance on the political stage has been an
extraordinary act of seduction, charming a sizeable segment of the Italian
public into turning a blind eye to his political qualifications and the more
questionable side of his past. Scalfari concluded that the main reason for
Berlusconi's success was his ability to convey the impression of
'do-it-yourself politics' - that an individual can take on the system.
No one could have imagined six months ago that Berlusconi, a non-politician,
would probably be Italy's next leader at the head of a newly-formed
political movement, Forza Italia. It was equally improbable to conceive the
public embracing a movement with a name culled from a football slogan ('Come
on, Italy]').
Berlusconi himself was at a crossroads in the middle of last year. His
political friends were vanishing off the scene, discredited by the
corruption scandals. His profitable near-monopoly over Italian commercial
television looked increasingly vulnerable as politicians across the
ideological divide sought to re-draw the map of public and private
television ownership. Berlusconi's Fininvest empire itself was floundering
under a burden of debt caused by over-ambitious purchases during the boom of
the 1980s.
When he formed Forza Italia last October, he seemed still to be playing the
businessman, orchestrating a political challenge through existing
politicians. Only at the end of January did he go public with his political
ambitions. He declared: 'I am telling you that we can . . . that we must
build together for us and our children a new Italian miracle.'
Even then, too much seemed stacked against him. He talked of family values,
passing over the fact that he had gone through a messy divorce before taking
a second wife. He talked of his faith in catholic morality while his
television stations pumped out cheap soap opera culture and a diet of
big-bosomed titillation. He talked of free enterprise, ignoring the
protected environment of much of Italian business from which he had
benefited. He talked of reducing Italy's huge mountain of debt when his own
companies, like the Italian economy, had grown on debt.
Above all, he appeared to have the terminal disadvantage of being associated
with the ancien regime - the clique of Christian Democrat and Socialist
politicians who had presided over a politico-economic system that had become
riddled with corruption. His Fininvest group grew on the back of political
protection provided in Milan by the Socialist party and its leader, Bettino
Craxi. He had also joined the P2 secret masonic lodge of Licio Gelli, who
had been linked with many of the obscure episodes of the past - such as the
collapse of the Banco Ambrosiano.
Berlusconi enjoyed a very public friendship with Craxi; this helped in 1990
to seal the unusual structure of television ownership in Italy. He gained
control over three channels, dominating commercial TV and providing access
to 45 per cent of the national audience. Nowhere else in Europe is one group
permitted such a near monopoly.
Fininvest came under the scrutiny of investigating magistrates in Milan who
questioned his close aides over how the television licences were carved up
at the end of the 1980s. His younger brother, Paolo, was charged with
corruption relating to a waste disposal contract. How, then, was Berlusconi
able to present himself as both new and acceptable?
For a start, he was a household name as 'Mr TV'. He was also responsible for
one of the most easily identifiable success stories in Italy. In 1986, he
bought the ailing AC Milan football club and, with a series of expensive
player transfers, turned it into a cup-winning machine. 'If one looks back
now, the building up of the Milan team, with its high-profile international
sign-ons, was the beginning of the construction of Berlusconi's political
ego,' says one of his former employees.
He worked assiduously to create the image of Berlusconi the winner through
Milan's relentless series of victories. He saw the Milan fans as his fans
and played to them with his well-staged appearances: landing at the stadium
in his helicopter and turning up, dressed immaculately, for training
sessions.
With hindsight, Berlusconi's critics overestimated the damage of being
associated with his political godfathers and under-estimated his existing
appeal among Italians, especially the young. During the 1980s, frequent
polls among them showed Berlusconi was their favoured role model.
Significantly, he picked up a high portion of the young vote in this week's
general election.
'He is a household name - people identify with him easily,' said Roberto
Lasanga, his election campaign manager when it began. 'He's new simply
because he was not a politician and never pretended to be. He doesn't talk
down to people like a politician. Instead, he takes people into his
confidence: he talks as someone who wants to put things right by entering
politics.'
In other words, Berlusconi was not hurt by being seen as a traditional
politician. On the contrary: in the one hostile television interview, he
managed to make himself a victim in the eyes of his supporters. He claimed
the interviewer had nothing on which to attack him except raising old
chestnuts such as his friendship with Craxi.
He and his advisers realised, correctly, that after two years' non-stop
exposure of one corruption scandal after another, Italy had been given an
overdose. Corruption had been replaced by concern over jobs and declining
incomes as the people's main worry.
Indeed, Berlusconi did not raise the corruption issue during the campaign.
And there was no impact when his brother, Paolo, was arrested halfway
through and admitted paying bribes for building contracts to develop a Milan
suburb - even though Paolo was running the construction company created by
Silvio and the bribes went back to the early 1980s when Silvio was very much
in charge. Nothing rubbed off on the candidate.
The same applied to well-publicised leaks that Marcello Dell'Utri,
Berlusconi's long-standing Sicilian friend and the brains behind his
political bid, was under investigation for links with the Mafia. Although
the information came from a highly respected former magistrate and head of
the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission, Berlusconi turned this to his
advantage and claimed his enemies were using the state apparatus to run a
vendetta against him.
The campaign organisers also discovered that people paid little heed to
political polemics on television except for those provided by a handful of
chat show hosts. Only these - not the politicians - were seen to articulate
the problems of ordinary Italians. In his television appearences or at
public meetings, Berlusconi avoided speaking from a lectern and adopted the
role of a chat show host, wandering across the stage with a microphone.
More importantly, Berlusconi - who had once written a thesis on marketing,
and made his fortune out of understanding the advertising market - realised
the value of targeting his audience with the right message. His researchers
discovered that ordinary people felt excluded by Italy's long-ruling
political establishment. This led to the formation of Forza Italia clubs,
allowing the public to take part in the political debate in the same way
that a football fan can follow his team through a supporter's club.
In less than four months, more than 13,000 clubs were formed nation-wide,
organised through Fininvest. Here, the human and financial resources of
Fininvest's advertising arm, Publitalia, and the empire's Standa stores
chain were invaluable.
The message and the manner in which it was put across by Berlusconi were
researched and scripted carefully in a way that no previous Italian
politician had bothered to do. Berlusconi, although 57 and balding, was made
to look youthful. He went around with a permanent make-up artist and, where
possible, sought to be filmed by his own in-house camera crew. His
double-breasted suit, immaculately pressed shirt and neutral tie made him
look successful without being too imposing - the kind of person every middle
class mother would trust immediately when answering the door bell.
As for the message, it bore a strong ideological tone of right-wing, free
market ideas. He even tried to enlist the services of Lady Thatcher in his
campaign although, unlike Britain's one-time Iron Lady, he conveyed his
message in a non-confrontational way, keeping political jargon to a minimum.
He spoke in disarmingly simple terms. 'This country has four million
employers. Just imagine if every one of these were to create one new job. We
can solve the problem of unemployment,' he told a television audience.
While this appealing solution to Italy's most pressing problem did not
impress the economists, it certainly had many Italians nodding in agreement.
They want to believe he can create 1m jobs and lower taxes.
All this helps to explain how Berlusconi got to where he is. It offers few
guidelines on how he will fare as a politician. In his favour, he has
enormous energy and determination and, according to his supporters, an
excellent business brain. But this is not necessarily enough to create a
good politician.
He and Forza Italia would have faded into obscurity if he had fared badly.
But, having come out on top, he now becomes vulnerable to the very things
from which his campaign strategy protected him: a critical and fickle public
audience; the magistrates investigating the practices of Fininvest and its
alleged criminal links; and the conflict of interest between owning
Fininvest and being a politician.
His personality as a manager is ill-suited to dealing with a fractious
political establishment, even if this establishment is being reconstructed.
He is vain and wounded easily by insults. He is a poor public speaker once
forced outside scripted remarks.
In particular, he has made himself a hostage to campaign promises that
cannot be fulfilled easily in the present climate without raising Italy's
debt or the spectre of inflation.
In short, he has studied carefully how to be a politician from the viewpoint
of marketing a product - Silvio Berlusconi, the new face in Italian
politics. But while elections may be about marketing, the broader art of
politics in Italy is about survival in a jungle of intrigue.
Let us not forget that Italy fathered Machiavelli. And if you listen to the
stories behind the music and the prima donnas of Italian opera, you will
find they are often of betrayal.

FT  02 APR 94 / The Long View: Some hard facts of life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good advice is the most valuable commodity in investment. But the life
assurance industry has insisted that it should cost nothing. That,
fundamentally, is why the life offices have got themselves into the most
dreadful public relations mess.
This week, one of the biggest and most highly-regarded mutuals, Norwich
Union, was forced to suspend its 800-strong sales force pending retraining
to levels thought satisfactory by Lautro, the life assurance marketing
regulator. But it is only the latest in a string of top companies, including
Legal &amp; General and Scottish Widows, to face disciplinary action.
The industry is in the dock over the mis-selling of personal pension plans
to people who would have been better advised to stay in occupational pension
schemes or the state scheme, Serps.
Unfortunately, it is often true that exceptional growth in any industry
leads to over-expansion and a collapse in standards. Success breeds
complacency and, ultimately, arrogance. By any reckoning the life assurance
industry has been remarkably successful at collecting savings.
At the end of last year life companies held assets of more than Pounds
400bn, up fourfold compared with 10 years earlier. They are selling 8m new
policies a year in the UK and collecting Pounds 35bn in premiums from
individuals. Meanwhile they are paying out Pounds 30bn annually in benefits.
Historically the life industry received two main political favours for
encouraging thrifty habits among the population. There was a tax incentive
of about half the standard rate of income tax, called life assurance premium
relief, and there was exemption from the investor protection laws introduced
in the 1930s. Life company representatives could continue to sell
door-to-door and they were not required to disclose policy costs and
charges.
Nigel Lawson abolished LAPR almost exactly 10 years ago but life business
surged on regardless, only partly because new tax reliefs were extended to
personal pensions.
The ability to conceal commissions and other selling costs was probably more
important than the tax breaks and, since the mid-1980s, the industry has
resisted efforts to introduce so-called 'hard' disclosure. Various forms of
soft disclosure have been conceded. But this month the regulators will
unveil a formula for disclosure in cash terms at the point of sale, to be
introduced at the beginning of 1995.
The ability of life companies to secure regular savings contracts has been
crucial. They aim to persuade customers to sign up for periods, usually, of
between 10 and 25 years. This is good business for the companies, ensuring
their commercial stability and enabling them to implement long-term
investment strategies. Such contracts are also arguably good for the
customers, not just because the discipline of a monthly instalment will
cause them to save more than they might otherwise do, but also because
regular savings will effectively smooth out the investment risks.
Small investors tend to do badly out of non-contractual savings because they
move out of building society deposits into stock market-related vehicles at
the wrong time of the cycle - producing, for instance, huge peaks in unit
trust purchases in years such as 1987 and 1993, but low figures in years
such as 1990 when shares were cheap.
However, people do not readily sign 25-year contracts. They have to be
persuaded, usually by salesmen on a one-to-one basis, during visits to homes
and offices. This is extraordinarily expensive (think of how much a plumber,
say, charges to make a call) especially if the salesman is an expert in
financial planning, which sadly few are - not at Norwich Union, certainly. A
typical salesman only sells one or two contracts a week, and looks for a
commission of hundreds of pounds on each.
At one time commissions were restrained by an industry cartel but this was
abolished and payments in the past few years have jumped. It has therefore
become even more important to disguise the selling costs. Advice, Mr
Prospect is told, is 'free'. However, the expenses are deducted from his
instalments over the first year or two, in what is called front-end loading.
These marketing techniques have been very successful in generating business
for the life companies. But they are now boomeranging. This is because the
intermediaries have a huge incentive to sell contracts regardless of whether
they benefit the customer.
Life companies are now agonising over how to overcome the effects of hard
disclosure. It is likely that they will attempt to obscure the costs of
commissions by spreading them over long periods. But that will not go down
at all well with salesmen.
A probable consequence will be a further sharp decline in the proportion of
long-term regular savings contracts being sold. Already there has been a big
swing towards single premium products.
The life companies will argue that the total savings ratio will suffer from
these changes, but it will also be true that savers will be less vulnerable
to the crippling costs of terminating contracts which they should never have
signed.
A structural shift in the UK's investment markets can be expected however.
Already flows into occupational pension schemes have tumbled because those
schemes are becoming more mature. Now the business of the life offices is
becoming more short-term in nature, and they may lose customers to other
kinds of institution such as unit trusts. The securities markets could
therefore tend to become rather more volatile as the stabilising influence
of the very long-term funds becomes less apparent.
Of course, if private investors are given good advice they may avoid the
pitfalls of panic buying and panic selling. But they will not receive that
advice free.

FT  02 APR 94 / End of BR as we know it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly half a century of centralised railway operations ended yesterday when
British Rail handed control of its network to a host of newly-created
businesses, writes Charles Batchelor.
Responsibility for nearly 10,000 miles of track and 2,500 stations has been
given to Railtrack, while more than 50 independent businesses have started
taking over passenger and freight train operations, railway maintenance and
rolling stock finance.
BR will continue in a much slimmed-down form, easing businesses still
nominally under its control into the private sector before it finally
closes.
In the early stages, the privatisation will lead to a doubling of subsidies,
though these are expected to fall in later years.
The government foresees pressure on its finances falling eventually. The
public fears higher fares and cuts in services.

FT  02 APR 94 / Russia agrees to private ownership of farmland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian cabinet has agreed a plan allowing state and collective farms to
auction off land to their workers as private property - the first time
Russians will be able to acquire title to land in the country's history.
This potentially massive shift in property rights in the agricultural sector
was agreed by ministers on Thursday. The decree law, which does not have to
be approved by parliament, will be signed by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the
prime minister, when he returns from a trip to Hungary next week.
The decision follows a year-long pilot project developed between the
International Finance Corporation - an arm of the World Bank - and the
administration of the Nizhny Novgorod region north east of Moscow. Mr
Chernomyrdin surprised both radicals and conservatives last month when he
praised the Nizhny project.
The decree instructs local authorities to introduce the system pioneered in
Nizhny throughout their areas, though state and collective farms will be
able to choose whether or not to take it up. Under the system, farm workers
and pensioners each receive a voucher entitling them to a part of the land
and machinery. They are encouraged to form companies with other workers to
bid for, and create, viable farm units.
The Nizhny experiment shows that most workers do form co-operative
enterprises.
Nizhny will remain central to the wider scheme, receiving a large slice of
the initial Rbs18bn (about Pounds 6.6m) set aside for the programme to
develop a centre for the training of managers and workers of privatised
farms.
The programme is particularly significant because of the conservative
leadership of the agricultural sector, represented in the cabinet by Mr
Alexander Zaveryukha, the deputy prime minister, and Mr Victor Khlystun, the
agricultural minister. These ministers have already signed the decree with
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the radical deputy premier for privatisation, who is
likely to take charge of the programme.
Although parliamentary approval is not needed for the decree itself, it will
probably be required for the detailed legislation. Opposition among the
deputies may make its passage uncertain, but support from conservative
ministers will help, as will signs of its popularity with farm workers.
Before the Communist revolution, legal title to all land was vested in the
Tsar. The seizure of land from peasants for collectivisation during the late
1920s and early 1930s caused widespread starvation which killed millions.

FT  02 APR 94 / Barings freezes Peps business as price war weakens returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barings said yesterday it would stop taking applications for personal equity
plans, the first indication of a possible shake-up in the Pounds 3bn-a-year
Pep market.
Baring Global Fund Managers, the merchant bank's asset managing arm, is
putting its Pep business on hold pending a review of its long-term retail
operations. Peps, introduced in 1989, are popular tax shelters for private
investors. Up to Pounds 6,000 a year can be invested free of capital gains
or income tax. A further Pounds 3,000 can be invested tax-free in
single-company Peps.
Barings is a relatively minor provider of Peps, which represent just Pounds
15m of its Pounds 3bn in managed assets. Other groups in the highly
fragmented market may soon follow its example, as returns from Peps begin to
weaken. Increasing regulation and an intense price war have substantially
raised the costs of participation for groups without a large market share.
Earlier this year M&amp;G, the UK's largest Pep provider, abandoned the initial
charge on its managed income fund. Most other Pep providers have followed
M&amp;G with some form of discount.
Mr Nick Wells, Barings product development manager, said the bank's
relatively minor position in the Pep market and its reluctance to discount
had prompted the decision to stop taking applications from next Tuesday, the
end of the 1993-94 tax year.
The bank had also decided that the Pep market would become even more
difficult in future. Competition would become increasingly cut-throat, as
opportunities for discounting developed in the transfer mar-ket, which
allows plan-hold-ers to switch managers.
Barings has not yet decided whether to withdraw completely from Peps. A
decision would be announced after the review was completed, Mr Wells said.
The extension of unit trust allowances and, more recently, the fall in
interest rates have sharply increased the popularity of Peps. The market,
which has more than doubled since 1992, is expected to reach Pounds 5bn this
year.
However, returns have been diluted by the price war. One leading provider
estimated it would now take up to five years to make a profit in the new,
more aggressive environment.
This made it difficult for niche specialists such as Barings to remain
competitive, he said. 'It is difficult to stay in this market unless you are
prepared to enter it in full,' he said. 'We have the benefit of volume and
that is an important factor.'

FT  02 APR 94 / Credit Lyonnais plans to speed up asset sales: Bank hopes to
raise FFr35bn from disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French bank which is the subject of a
FFr44.9bn (Pounds 5.14bn) government-backed rescue package, plans to
accelerate its asset sales by selling up to FFr35bn of its industrial
holdings, according to Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman.
Mr Peyrelevade, who was drafted into Credit Lyonnais by the Balladur
government in November to orchestrate the rescue and prepare the bank for
privatisation, had already announced plans to sell FFr20bn of assets by the
end of next year.
But he now intends to make additional disposals worth up to FFr15bn, he said
in an interview with the Financial Times.
'We plan to sell FFr20bn of assets over the next two years, but we won't
stop there,' he said. 'Our portfolio is now worth between FFr50bn and
FFr55bn. We'll continue to sell assets until it has been reduced to around
FFr20bn.'
Credit Lyonnais amassed a large number of industrial investments as part of
the aggressive expansion pursued by Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, its chairman for
five years until Mr Peyrelevade's arrival. The Haberer regime is now the
subject of an official inquiry in France after the announcement last month
of the rescue deal and of the group's FFr6.9bn net loss for 1993.
Most of Credit Lyonnais's investments are minority stakes in corporate
clients. The focus for the disposal programme is expected to be on its
holdings in private sector companies - such as Bouygues and Navigation Mixte
in construction, and Christian Dior in luxury goods. The group has recently
sold minority holdings in the Union des Assureurs Federales insurance group
and TF1 television station. However, it is expected to hold on to its
investments in other state-controlled companies - including Usinor-Sacilor,
the steel maker, and Aerospatiale, the aerospace group - as these holdings
would be more difficult to sell.
Mr Peyrelevade said he did not object in principle to a commercial bank
adopting the role of a German-style industrial bank. He stressed, however,
that Credit Lyonnais was not in a financial position to afford such a
strategy.
'It's not that I don't believe in the concept of an industrial bank taking
minority stakes in his clients,' he said. 'But they must be good investments
with growth potential and the bank must be able to afford it.'
One of Credit Lyonnais's most complex disposals will be that of MGM, the
stricken Hollywood movie studio that it must, under US banking regulations,
sell by mid-1997. Mr Peyrelevade said he had been approached by a number of
potential purchasers for the studio, which is the subject of legal suits.

FT  02 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Life insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week Norwich Union became the latest life insurer to concede - under
pressure from its regulator - that its sales force is not up to scratch. But
while the regulator's more robust attitude should be welcomed, improved
training and supervision may not, in themselves, stop life insurance being
mis-sold. Whatever their training, commission-based salesmen have a powerful
economic incentive to favour certain products.
Full disclosure of commissions from next year may change that, since the
true costs of buying life insurance will be clearer. Spreading commissions
through the life of a product rather than charging up-front would be one way
of making the costs easier for customers to swallow. Such level charging
would give salesmen an incentive to sell policies which are likely to run
their full course. Surrender values should also improve, unless companies
introduce exit charges or penalties to weight the risk of early surrender
back in their favour.
The snag is that the transition to level charging would squeeze life
companies and independent financial advisers which rely on up-front
commissions to meet working capital requirements. That points to a wider
range of commission structures, and perhaps more customer choice about how
to pay. Whichever system emerges, though, life insurers must find a way of
selling more policies which run to maturity. Otherwise the regulator is sure
to ask whether long-term life and pensions products should be sold on
commission at all.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a refreshing candour about Deutsche Bank's admission that it does
not expect much by way of earnings increase this year. Last year's 23 per
cent jump in group net profit owed much to special factors that will not
easily be repeated. These include not only a 76 per cent increase in
earnings from proprietary trading, but also a substantially higher
contribution from commission income which reflected the general buoyancy of
financial markets. While net interest income rose 7 per cent, margins fell
slightly. The bank expects the squeeze to continue in 1994.
Classic continental accounting practice might suggest that Deutsche has
chosen to smooth the large 1993 increase in operating profit by adding
heavily to its loan loss provisions. These are indeed up 72 per cent, but
there appears to be only limited scope for reducing them this year to
compensate for any loss of momentum at the operating level. Deutsche itself
has repeatedly warned that bad debts may continue even when economic
recovery starts, and it is not as if the 1993 provisions are particularly
high in the first place. At DM3.3bn they are not quite 1 per cent of total
group lending.
In contrast to British banks, which out-performed the local equity market
strongly as interest rates came down, Deutsche under-performed the Dax index
by some 12 per cent over the past year. Despite the 10 per cent increase in
its dividend, there seems scant prospect of that trend reversing itself,
especially since financial market turmoil makes trading profits uncertain.

FT  02 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Redland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Redland makes a convincing case that its German wonder story will continue
for a while. Sales in the west may soften next year as tax subsidies for
housing decline, but Redland achieved the notable feat of making more money
in east Germany than in the UK last year. That part of the German market, at
least, should keep sales marching strongly ahead - although there must be
longer term doubts over whether a 24 per cent return on sales will
eventually invite fiercer competition.
Whatever happens in Germany, Redland should still benefit from an upturn in
volumes and prices in the UK and France, where it makes operating margins of
just 4 per cent on turnover of almost Pounds 900m. Redland has still to reap
the full benefits of rationalising Steetley's French businesses. There is
mileage left in improving its pricing strategy in the UK, too. An additional
bonus will come from Redland's tax juggling, ensuring UK and French profits
are effectively earned tax-free.
Even so, Redland's earnings may prove lacklustre set against its UK peers
because of the spread of its operations and the profusion of shares. The
prospects for dividend increases are also comparatively dull. Redland was
one of the few building materials companies not to have cut its dividend
during recession. That has left it with an uncomfortably high pay-out ratio.
But in today's market conditions, Redland's dividend yield of almost 6 per
cent makes its shares look more defensible than most.

FT  02 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Wall Street blues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the price falls of recent days, fear has a head start over greed
in the minds of US investors at present. Wall Street falls on Mexican
assassinations, Wall Street falls on trade worries with Japan. Behind the
excuses, Wall Street falls because once the prop of 6 per cent bond yields
is removed, the yield on shares looks very meagre indeed. The vertigo and
price falls are made worse by the heavy flow of speculative money into
capital markets last year, which is now starting to reverse. In the face of
such psychology, this year's earnings recovery is small consolation.
It may take some stability in the US Treasury bond market to restore
confidence to equities. The fear that short term interest rates may rise
above 5 per cent next year in an effort to bring growth down to a
non-inflationary rate has sparked a rise in bond yields to 7 per cent.
Yesterday's employment data, showing the strongest monthly job creation
since 1987, reinforce the impression of strong economic growth. While rising
inflation is not yet obvious, a lack of surplus capacity means that it may
not be far away.
Once the scale of the problem is better gauged, a gap between short and long
interest rates of 2 percentage points should be perfectly sustainable.
Before then, however, uncertainty and natural over-reaction may force long
rates higher. US equities may well suffer too, since there is little
incentive to buy and speculative hedge funds are being forced to sell. There
is fundamental value in shares, but until the immediate pressures start to
moderate, that may pass unnoticed.

FT  02 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Italy piles on the
post-election euphoria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apart from extremes, reflecting immense enthusiasm in Italy and dejection in
Poland, bourses ended the first quarter of 1994 with a whimper, writes Our
Markets Staff.
MILAN continued on its euphoric, post-election course, the BCI index adding
27.45 or 4 per cent to a 44 month high of 722.99 and adding another 1.68 per
cent to reach 735.11 yesterday, taking the rise over the week to nearly 10
per cent.
The market was hit by a flood of orders from domestic and foreign buyers,
encouraged by the speed with which differences were apparently being ironed
out by Mr Silvio Berlusconi and the right-wing alliance, committed to free
market principles.
Trading was extended on both days to cope with turnover which surged on
Thursday to an estimated record L2,000bn compared with the previous L1,400bn
peak set on January 31.
In London, Robert Fleming Securities commented that the strong surge in
support for the right wing has left the post-election scene much clearer
than had seemed likely.
Mr Marcus Grubb at Salomon Brothers, who has increased his end of year
target for the Comit index from 750 to 775, recommended that investors
increase their weightings. He accepted that volatility would increase if the
newly-elected right-wing alliance experienced difficulties in forming a
coalition government, but said this would be a buying opportunity.
The insurance sector, an underperformer before this week, continued to power
ahead on Thursday, on hopes that the new government would encourage private
pension schemes and reports that motor premiums will rise by 7-13 per cent
when Rome lifts controls in July. RAS rose L1,754 or 6.5 per cent to
L28,879, Fondiaria L776 or 6.2 per cent to L13,214, Toro L2,453 or 8.5 per
cent to L31,233 and SAI L1,257 or 6.6 per cent to L20,395. The sector
extended its strength yesterday.
FRANKFURT blamed Wall Street again as the Dax index fell 14.42 to 2,133.11,
a fraction up on the week but down 5.9 per cent on the first three months of
this year.
Turnover fell from DM7.5bn to DM6.6bn. There was a suggestion of profit
taking in cyclicals. In chemicals, Bayer announced a costly fire and fell
DM5.80 to DM373.20, but Hoechst also dropped, by DM5.40 to DM323.70. BMW
escaped a general automotive downturn with a rise of DM4.50 to DM828.50.
RWE, which has had problems in nuclear power generation, fell another DM8.50
to DM438. Metallgesellschaft stretched its recovery to a third day, rising
DM11.50 to DM208, but it was still the worst Dax performer of the first
quarter with a fall of over 25 per cent, said Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck
Finck in Dusseldorf.
Mr Frahm noted that cyclicals had produced most of the good share price
performances in the first quarter, and financials, or defensive stocks the
worst. The exception was the top performing stock, Lufthansa, up by more
than 25 per cent on the quarter and by over 80 per cent over the past twelve
months. The airline's shares, he said, were a speculation on privatisation
on attractive terms before the German general election next October.
PARIS was given a slight lift just before midday by a 10 basis point cut in
the Bank of France's intervention rate, bringing it down to 5.90 per cent.
But this was not sufficient to provide momentum for the rest of the session,
and the CAC-40 index ended the day off 1.93 at 2,081.94. The index has
slipped 2.5 per cent over the week, mainly due to a sharp loss on Wednesday.
Turnover was FFr4.8bn.
With activity restrained ahead of the long weekend holiday, investors
concentrated on a number of companies reporting results. Canal Plus gained
FFr9 to FFr985 after announcing a gain in 1993 group profits.
Eurotunnel, which said that its 1993 results would be available on April 21,
slipped 45 centimes to FFr43.85.
Saint-Louis, the food group, which announced after the close that it
expected 'significant' growth in 1994, ended the day up FFr7 at FFr1,715.
AMSTERDAM regained the 400 level in the AEX index, having dipped below it
during early trading. The index closed off 0.86 at 403.85, a fall on the
week of 0.7 per cent.
There were some exceptions to the generally easier mood. Aegon, the
insurance group, gained Fl 1.30 to Fl 94.60 after announcing better than
expected 1993 results, and prospects for improvement in 1994.
BolsWessanen , the food and drinks group, added 70 cents to Fl 41.40 as it
announced details of its 1993 dividend.
ZURICH finished a quiet, shortened pre-holiday session easier but above the
day's lows after some buying emerged at the lower levels. The SMI index
ended 19.7 down at 2,794.8 after a day's low of 2,769.6, for a fall on the
week of 1.3 per cent.
Ciba continued to move against the trend in response to positive comment
after this week's results and presentations to analysts. The registered
shares rose SFr5 to SFr882. Banks were weak on continuing worries about the
outlook for US interest rates: UBS fell SFr14 to SFr1,183, SBC lost SFr3 to
SFr406 and CS Holding dipped SFr5 to SFr625.
ISTANBUL picked up more than 3 per cent on Thursday, and another 6.7 per
cent yesterday as investors reacted to the sharp fall in overnight borrowing
rates from 400 per cent to 200 per cent in two days. The composite index
closed at 15,027.77, up 940.61 and by 11 per cent on the week.
ATHENS fell 1.6 per cent on Thursday, the general index testing the
1000-point support level for nearly two hours, but it recovered 1.3 per cent
yesterday to close 13.04 higher at 1,016.54.1.

A major fall in prices on the Warsaw Stock Exchange saw almost all of its 23
listed stocks down by their maximum 10 per cent daily limit on Thursday,
when the WIG all-share index fell by 1,510.2, or 9.4 per cent to 14,536.9,
writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw
The WIG has now fallen by 30 per cent since March 8 when the market first
began to weaken.
The latest decline, which started on Monday and which looks set to continue
for a session or two after the holiday, has taken 22 per cent off the
market's total capitalisation - 108,497bn zlotys last Thursday.
The week's fall appears to have been triggered by foreign investors anxious
to take profits before the end of the quarter. These disposals completed a
month or two during which foreigners realised that average p/e's around the
35 mark were too good to last.
Local investors have been selling to accommodate a steady stream of new
share offers and rights issues. This week, the Securities Commission (KPW)
said that it expected to receive up to 20 new prospectuses for approval in
the near future, was still examining nine and had received another three in
the past few days.
The Privatisation Ministry itself announced that it intended to pass nine
prospectuses to the KPW before the break. These include the Polfa
pharmaceuticals factory in Kutno, the Poznan Brewery, two major foreign
trade enterprises Rolimpex and Stalexport as well as the Stomil Debica tyre
factory.
Four completed rights issues since January have raised 1,413.7bn zlotys
while new share offers and rights issues currently on offer are worth a
further 1,559.3bn zlotys.

FT  02 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow fights back after heavy
morning deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US blue-chip stocks ended with modest gains on Thursday after another
buffeting from an unstable bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 9.22 better at 3,635.97, after
fighting back from a 67-point deficit at mid-morning. The final push into
positive territory came only about an hour before the close, as a burst of
program-guided buying, coinciding with the end of trading in the first
quarter, lifted the bellwether index by about 30 points.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also reversed course during the
session. It climbed back from a six point decline to end 0.21 better at
445.76; but declining issues outnumbered advances by 1,532 to 738.
For a second consecutive day, activity was hectic, as portfolio managers
sought to square positions before their books closed for the quarter. NYSE
volume reached 398m shares, topping the previous day's level of 390m. The
American SE composite ended 2.43 lower at 443.11, and the Nasdaq composite
down 1.45 at 743.46.
It was an appropriate end to a week of turmoil. After a net loss of 147
points since Monday's opening, confidence was in short supply when investors
began the last session before the Easter three-day holiday.
Share prices were already slipping by mid-morning, when the Chicago
Association of Purchasing Management released its March index of business
activity. The data were received badly. Not only did the index indicate a
overall surge of activity in the region, but more importantly for the
inflation-sensitive bond market, the report's prices-paid component showed a
big rise.
In response Treasury prices, especially on the long end of the yield curve,
dropped precipitously, triggering frenzied selling in stocks. Within an
hour, however, share prices stabilised amid a cross-current of
program-driven trades.
As the day progressed, buyers finally trickled back into the Treasury
market, tempted by low prices. In equities,
bargain hunters snapped up some of Dow components battered earlier in the
week. Caterpillar recovered Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 112 and Allied Signal
Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 36 5/8 . JP Morgan gained Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars
62 5/8 , McDonald's Dollars 1 to Dollars 56 7/8 and IBM Dollars 1 to Dollars
54.
The Dow transportation index, hammered over the past week, slipped a further
3.31 to 1,635.19. Airline stocks held up well, but trucking issues were
weak, with the expiration of a pivotal labour contract only hours away and
talks between union representatives and management stalled.
On the Nasdaq, Microsoft improved Dollars 1 1/8 and Intel gained Dollars 1
1/4 to Dollars 67 1/2 . But Pyramid Technology sank Dollars 3 7/8 to 7 7/8
after a profits warning.
Canada
Toronto stocks pulled out of another steep slide in late trading and ended
mixed to positive bias after falling for six consecutive sessions. The TSE-
300 composite index finished a busy session 15.71 points higher at 4,329.62.
Volume was 80.44m shares valued at CDollars 1.0bn.
Strong bank stocks, golds, a rebound in debt markets and bargain-hunting
combined to offer a late lift. The gold and silver index climbed by 233.46,
or 2.2 per cent to 10,778.81 after a solid rally in gold prices. Comex gold
closed up a sharp USDollars 5.70 at Dollars 394.30 per ounce, after bouncing
off a two-and-a-half-month high of Dollars 396.50.

FT  02 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei in modest
recovery after Thursday's setback
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rise in the yen hurt share prices on Thursday, but the Nikkei
regained some ground yesterday on buying by dealers and individuals, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index, which plunged 447.99, or 2.3 per cent, to 19,111.92 on
Thursday, firmed yesterday by 165.24 to 19,277.16. after a low of 19,161.63
and a high of 19,378.08.
The 225 was down 2.8 per cent on the week. Wednesday's fall on Wall Street
and fears over mounting US-Japan tensions over trade, which depressed
investors' confidence, subsided as the New York stock market regained some
ground overnight.
The Topix index of all first section stocks, which fell 25.01 to 1,563.21
Thursday, ended up 7.97 to 1,571.18, while the Nikkei 300 rose 1.38 to
287.11 following a 5.26 point decline the previous day. Volume was 230m
shares, against 305m. Gainers led losers by 643 to 361 with 160 unchanged.
Analysts expect the current volatility in share prices to continue due to
the uncertainty of yen movements against the dollar, and turmoil on the
political front.
On the trading floor, mobile phone related issues were higher. Kenwood, the
most active issue of the day, rose Y6 to Y996.
Fuji Photo Film fell Y90 to Y2,200 and Konica lost Y8 to Y630 on a
preliminary decision by the US to impose anti-dumping duties on their
products.
In Osaka, the OSE average, which fell 254.78 to 21,495.30 on Thursday, rose
60.85 to 21,556.15 in volume of 15.1m shares.
Roundup
The region's markets were upset by the sharp fall on Wall Street on
Wednesday. Manila was closed on Thursday and Friday. Seoul, Taiwan, Kuala
Lumpur and Bangkok were open on Friday, Taiwan reacting most strongly to the
Dow's late recovery on Thursday.
HONG KONG's losses were trimmed by a late round of buying as news that Li
Ka-shing's Cheung Kong Group had bought a large site at a government land
auction was seen as a vote of confidence.
The Hang Seng index finished 202.30 down at 9,029.91, down 2.2 per cent on
the day and the week. Turnover remained scant at HKDollars 4.51bn.
Hongkong Land, 10 cents higher at HKDollars 22.60, bucked the downward
trend. AUSTRALIA saw its sixth straight fall, to its lowest since December
1993. The All Ordinaries index lost 39.30 at 2,053.1 down 4.6 per cent on
the week, in turnover of ADollars 395m.
Blue chips led the fall, with BHP down 48 cents, or 2.8 per cent, at
ADollars 16.48 and News Corp 25 cents at ADollars 8.95.
TAIWAN fell back 1.3 per cent on Thursday, but recovered most of that
yesterday when the weighted index rose 59.65 to 5,308.87, 0.8 per cent down
on the week. Turnover was TDollars 34bn.
KUALA LUMPUR took its lead from Wall Street, ignoring a Bank Negara's
forecast of sustained economic growth and its smaller-than-expected losses
on foreign exchange operations. The composite index, which lost 10.05 on
Thursday, picked up 7.22 to 952.72 yesterday, 1.8 per cent down on the week.
SINGAPORE was cautious about developments abroad and the Straits Times
Industrial index ended 47.49 or 2.2 per cent lower at 2,080.90 lower in
quiet trading ahead of the long weekend, little changed on the week.
KARACHI declined on profit-taking, the KSE 100-share index falling 23.24 to
2,540.46. Losers led gainers 112 to 237.

Gold shares in Johannesburg recorded small gains following a rise in the
price of bullion, while industrials moved lower as political tension
continued. There was little direct reaction to the state of emergency
declared in Natal.
The overall index rose 2 to 4,937, industrials slipped 50 to 5,644 and gold
strengthened 18 to 2,012.
De Beers put on R1.25 to R105 and Anglos R1 to R202. In golds, marginals
made some of the steepest gains. Doorns added 15 cents to R2.75 and Loraine
45 cents to R15.25.

Derivatives markets shared in the volatility seen in equity sectors in the
final pre-Easter trading session, writes Terry Byland. For much of the day,
the June contract on the Footsie traded at a small discount to the cash
market but traders stressed that dealing was restrained.
The final reading of 3,058 showed the contract at a substantial discount to
the cash market but some ground was recovered in after hours trading.
Trading volume was swollen to just over 15,000 contracts in the June
contract.

FT  02 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Redland strong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Building materials group Redland was one of the best performing stocks among
FT-SE 100 constituents after analysts upgraded profit expectations following
the release of better than anticipated full-year figures.
The group reported profits of Pounds 278.9m, against a range of forecasts
between Pounds 260m and Pounds 270m, with the results followed by a bullish
presentation from the board.
At the day's best, the shares were up 25 but came off the top with the
market to finish 15 up 539p on balance, after hefty trade of 7.3m.
Mr Simon Brown at Strauss Turnbull raised his forecast by Pounds 10m to
Pounds 335m and believes the stock to be undervalued, 'given the Steetley
acquisition two years ago together with the high quality of the assets and
the management.'
Mr Mike Betts at Goldman Sachs, who has been negative on the stock over the
last few months, raised his estimate by Pounds 23m to Pounds 328m and moved
the stock from a sell to a hold recommendation.
He said: 'The stock will perform well in a weak market as the yield will
underpin the shares.'
Media and publishing group Pearson retreated sharply after announcing an
agreed Dollars 462m offer for Software Toolworks, a US software publisher.
Some analysts expressed concern over both the price being paid and the
strategic logic of the move.
Pearson shares slippped by 26 to 641p, the biggest faller in the FT-SE 100.
There was other takeover activity in the media sector. Capital Radio set the
radio broadcasting sector alight with the Pounds 32.8m agreed offer for
Southern Radio. Capital shares jumped 21 to 418p, while Southern surged 25
to 118p, 3p above the offer price. The move excited other radio shares, with
Chiltern gaining 11 to 163p, GWR Group 37 to 895p and Metro Radio 10 to
349p.
Advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi appeared to have resolved its boardroom
differences with a statement that the chief executive and chairman would
both be keeping their current roles. The shares responded by slipping a
half-penny to 135 1/2 p, with one analyst commenting that the deal failed to
resolve the problem over the future direction of the company.
Software group Unipalm made its expected strong debut, the shares coming to
the market at 100p and finishing the day at 136p.
Capital Shopping, the property group which came to the market on Wednesday
at 230p, had another weak day along with the sliding sentiment in the the
sector. The shares slipped a further 2 to 206p and gave rise to fears for
other forthcoming property flotations, which were priced prior to the
sector's recent bout of weakness. Rugby Estates is rumoured to have had its
original issue price cut by some 30 per cent prior to coming to the market
the week after next.
A weak performance overnight by Wall Street impacted on several stocks.
Reuters fell back 26 to 1960p, Glaxo was off 10 before recovering to close a
net 4 off 600p, and ICI fell 18 to 789p.
Firm gilts, continued hopes of a rate cut and positive sentiment over early
payment of bills by consumers avoiding VAT helped the electricity sector.
Among the better performers, Eastern gained 14 to 675p, Yorkshire 13 to 651p
and Manweb 16 to 738p.
Great Universal Stores continued to attract attention, the shares gaining 16
to 607p. There are rumours that the company is planning to spend a Pounds
1bn buying back a chunk of its shares.
Kingfisher was again buoyed by this week's buying recommendations from
several brokers and the shares added 8 to 577p.
At the start of the busy Easter period for DIY groups, WH Smith gained 12 to
533p on hopes for its restructuring proposals for Do It All, due after the
break.
Nervous trading in British Airways ahead of US committal proceedings
instigated by Virgin Atlantic, left the shares trailing 8 1/2 to 404 1/2 p,
after trade of 3.4m.
Aero-engine group Rolls-Royce recovered from recent weakness gaining 6 1/2
to 181 1/2 , on volume of 7.2m. Also recovering was Inchcape, which reported
poor figures earlier this week. The shares put on 2 to 515p.
Taylor Woodrow continued to benefit from its recent favourable figures and
the shares put on another 5 to 159p.
The rest of the building materials stocks followed the market lower.
Hepworths shed 15 to 391p, while Harrisons &amp; Crosfield lost 8 to 197p,
following a cautious note from NatWest Securities.
Building products and security printing group Caradon which reported
improved figures earlier this week, was also the subject of a cautious note
from NatWest Securities. The shares fell 11 to 363p. after NatWest said that
' ..we would prefer to rate RMC, Marley, Rugby and Blue Circle more highly
since they have owned for some time the operations that will deliver the
anticipated performance.'

FT  02 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Hogg up on HSBC purchase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bid speculation in insurance broker Hogg Group sent the shares racing 24
ahead to 165p, in trade of 1.1m, after an announcement that a subsidiary of
international banking group HSBC had taken a 6 per cent stake. Hogg advised
shareholders to take no action.
News of the move took the market by surprise and came a day after Hogg
reported halved profits to Pounds 6.01m, and reduced its dividend. The
company's shares have been in the doldrums since January when it surprised
the market with a profits warning.
The general view among market watchers was that the HSBC move was the first
strike ahead of a full bid and analysts quickly moved to work out a possible
price.
One analyst said: 'There is no reason for this move other than for a bid.
There is synergy with HSBC's insurance interests and Hogg would also fit
well with several of Midland Bank's operations. Shareholders will have to be
made an offer of at least 210p a share.'
Another analyst said: 'The management have lost credibility and the major
share holders are unhappy. These are the circumstances of a bid.'
In an otherwise quiet banking sector, shares in HSBC firmed a penny to 739p.

FT  02 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares give ground in a volatile
trading session - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The final trading session for the first quarter of 1994 saw UK stocks slip
lower in volatile trading ahead of the Easter weekend. With most European
financial markets closed until Tuesday, investors were waiting cautiously to
see how Tokyo and Wall Street would react to the US jobless data expected on
Friday.
Plunging sharply at the opening, after Wall Street had suffered its largest
daily fall for the year, London stocks steadied in the Footsie 3,061 area,
with the help of firmer bond markets across Europe.
Recovery was very uncertain, however, when the pound came under pressure
again on nervousness regarding the political outlook for Mr John Major, the
UK prime minister.
The market turned better when gilts responded favourably to comments on the
UK economy from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer.
Encouraged also by good company results in the building sector, the FT-SE
Index moved into positive territory, and was within seven points of the
3,100 mark in early afternoon. A cut in the Bank of France intervention rate
steadied nervousness on the interest rate front.
However, the mood changed very quickly when both the Dow Average and US
Federal bonds turned off after a firm start to the new trading session in
New York. The Footsie slipped back to show a fall of nearly 10 points before
rallying yet again.
The closing reading put the FT-SE Index at 3,086.4 for a net loss on the day
of 6 points. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell 14.2 to 3,752.9. Seaq volume of
725.6m shares compared with 773m in the previous session, when retail
business jumped sharply to return a worth of Pounds 1.76bn.
Hopes that UK markets can disengage from the US were dented by the readiness
with which the Footsie reacted to bearish movements in the Dow Average. Some
analysts warned that selling was inhibited by the the end of the trading
quarter and that the London market was much more nervous than it might
appear.
'1987 re-visited,' was the title of the week's strategy note from Mr
Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research, once the bull but now the bear of the
London stock market. He sees the Dow Average at 3,200 and the Footsie at
2,800 in the near term. He believes that a further cut in UK base rates is
almost inevitable on political grounds but should be taken as the final
signal to sell equities.
Volatility has become the keynote of both equities and gilts at present. The
FT-SE Index travelled through a range of more than 30 points again yesterday
to show a loss on the week of around 1.4 per cent on the week. Government
bonds, although  1/2 point better at the longer end yesterday, have suffered
similar changeability which has prompted hints of large losses by some
trading firms.
The closing picture on the stock market was somewhat mixed, with special
situations providing most of the highlights. Firmness among the store and
retail issues was somewhat deceptive, with both Kingfisher and GUS moving
higher against the market trend. The blue chip multinational stocks were
unsettled by uncertainty over the US dollar and the prospect of an extended
weekend break in the London market.

FT  02 APR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar rose sharply in New York yesterday after the release of strong
jobs data renewed speculation of a near term tightening in US monetary
policy, writes Philip Gawith.
The March non-farm payroll rose by 456,000, roughly double market
expectations, and the largest such rise since a gain of 556,000 jobs in
October 1987.
The dollar rose more than two pfennigs on the news from DM1.6770 to
DM1.6980, before slipping back below DM1.6950 in late morning trading. It
was also higher against the yen trading above Y103.60. Volumes were very
thin on account of the Easter break.
Activity in foreign exchanges was otherwise very subdued with most markets
closed for the long weekend.
Although the initial view of the US jobs figures was that they supported an
early tightening, a closer look suggested a more complicated picture. Mr
Lacy Hunt, chief US economist at Midland Global Markets in New York, said
the labour market was in fact weaker than the headline figure suggested.
Citing the low rate of growth in hourly earnings, and the deflationary
effect of jobs growth in low-paying service jobs, he suggested an early or
dramatic move from the Fed was unnecessary.
The D-Mark finished generally weaker in Europe on Thursday with evidence of
position-squaring ahead of the Easter break. The largest move came from the
Italian lira which rose on hopes that an Italian government might be formed
sooner than expected.
After closing on Thursday ten lira firmer in London at L963.3 against the
D-Mark, the lira rose further yesterday to L959.75 after reports of a
successful meeting between
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the victorious Freedom Alliance leader, and his
alliance partner,the Northern League.
Elsewhere on Thursday, the Bank of France cut its intervention rate by ten
basis points to 5.90 per cent - the second such cut in the week. The franc
ended slightly firmer, at FFr3.414 to the D-Mark from FFr3.419 on Wednesday.
The escudo ended firmer, at Es102.7 from Es103.2, after the Bank of Portugal
lent support to the ailing currency by raising its emergency lending rate to
13 per cent from 11 per cent.
German call money rates fell sharply on Thursday to 5.25/6.00 per cent, from
6.75 per cent on Wednesday as tight end-of-month conditions eased.
In the futures market the June euromark contract firmed by three basis
points to 94.55. The December contract rose nine basis points to 95.00.
Sterling weakness persisted on Thursday with the UK currency finishing at
DM2.4785 against the D-Mark from DM2.4829. It was slightly firmer against
the dollar finishing at Dollars 1.4846, but lost a cent in thin trade
yesterday to trade below Dollars 1.4750.
There was better news in the futures market where bullish comments by the
chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke about growth and inflation prospects revived
hopes of an early cut in interest rates. The June short sterling future
finished one basis point firmer at 94.53 while the December contract was
seven basis points higher at 94.03.
In the discount market the Bank of England moved quickly to remove a large
Pounds 1.95bn shortage with two early rounds of assistance.

FT  02 APR 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): S African worries lift
platinum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Platinum was the main beneficiary of a wave of buying that lifted precious
metals prices in early trading on Thursday following the declaration of a
state of emergency in South Africa.
The London afternoon price fixing for the white metal - 70 per cent of which
is produced in South Africa - was at Dollars 418 a troy ounce, up Dollars
8.50 from Wednesday and only Dollars 1 short of the 2 1/2-year high reached
last August.
The price was later trimmed by profit-taking but traders thought the bull
run still had some fuel in the tank. 'We are powering towards Dollars 420,
although we may not see it today,' one dealer told the Reuter news agency.
He added that there was no sense in going short of platinum ahead of the
elections being held in South Africa later this month.
The gold market also responded to deepening concern about the situation in
South Africa, but with the same lack of conviction that characterised its
attempt on Monday to break resistance above Dollars 392 an ounce. Having
faltered again on Thursday morning at Dollars 390 the price was fixed in the
afternoon at Dollars 389.20 an ounce and closed at Dollars 389.75, up 35
cents on the week.
Silver fared rather better. The 15-cent retracement that followed the
abandonment on Tuesday of speculators' attempts to drive the price to
Dollars 6 an ounce was all but recouped on Thursday morning; and at the
London close it still stood at Dollars 5.71 1/2 an ounce, up 1 cent from
last Friday but 3 3/4 cents below the 4-year high that it had reached
earlier last week.
At the London Metal Exchange speculators turned against the copper market in
mid-week, eliminating most of the recent Dollars 80-plus rally. The metal's
three months position closed on Thursday at Dollars 1,888.25 a tonne,
Dollars 8.25 off the day's low but still Dollars 68.50 down on the week.
The fall, most of which was suffered on Wednesday, came as little surprise
to big copper consumers and merchants, who had been waiting for a 'technical
correction', said Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at the Merrill Lynch
financial services group.
'They were hoping the market would cool down a bit during the summer,' he
explained, 'and were anxiously waiting to buy any and all price dips down
from 86 cents a pound (Dollars 1.895 a tonne) to 80 cents (Dollars 1,763).'
With demand for copper strong in the US and picking up in Europe and supply
becoming 'something of a problem', he doubted that the price would go much
below the latter level in 1994 and thought it should be back at 95 cents by
the end of the year.
Aluminium's supply/demand balance has also been improving and that helped
the LME market to show more resilience to speculative sales this week than
copper. The three months price closed on Thursday at Dollars 1,314.50 a
tonne, down Dollars 18 on the week.
US sellers sparked a big shake-out in the cocoa market, although there were
no significant fundamental developments to justify the fall. At the London
Commodity Exchange the May futures position touched Pounds 882 a tonne
before ending at Pounds 893, down Pounds 40 on the week.
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' decision last weekend to
leave its output ceiling where it was appeared to be taken as the signal for
traders to unload the cover they had taken against the outside possibility
that the ministers would this time grasp the nettle of over-production.
In consequence the June delivery position at London's International
Petroleum Exchange was quoted at Dollars 13.38 a barrel in late trading on
Thursday day, down 58 cents on the week.

FT  02 APR 94 / International Company News: Recovery at Paribas continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Paribas, the leading French banking group, last year continued its recovery
with a 64 per cent increase in net profits to FFr1.45bn (Dollars 253m) from
FFr886m in 1992.
Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman, said the group, which fell into the red in
1991, benefited from a strong performance in market trading activities and
also from its US and Asian banking interests. However, he added that it had
continued to be affected by the European recession.
The group mustered a 13 per cent increase in operating income to FFr32.68bn
in 1993 from FFr28.96bn in 1992. Net banking income rose far faster, despite
the sluggish state of the French market, with a 21 per cent rise to
FFr31.31bn from FFr25.88bn.
However, revenue from other sources fell by 56 per cent to FFr1.37bn from
FFr3.08bn mainly due to a reduction in asset sales.
Gross operating profits rose by 16 per cent to FFr13.08bn from FFr11.28bn.
However, Paribas was again forced to make hefty provisions on its
non-performing property and industrial investments.
The level of operating provisions was 15 per cent higher in 1993 at
FFr8.78bn against FFr7.65bn in 1992. Paribas said that it had made
particularly heavy write-downs on its industrial investments in France,
Belgium, Switzerland and Italy.

FT  02 APR 94 / International Company News: La Generale posts 40% increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Societe Generale de Belgique, the diversified Belgian holding company,
posted an increase of 40 per cent in its net profit last year. Total net
profit for the group was BFr8.7bn (Dollars 1.5bn), up from BFr6.2bn the
previous year.
The group said that part of the increase in profit had been due to the sale
last year of its 18.4 per cent stake in Union Miniere, the Belgian mining
group, and 42.2 per cent stake in the cement group CBR. This had contributed
to the BFr2.3bn of exceptional profits last year.
But the improved performance of service companies such as Generale Bank,
Tractabel and AG Group, in which Generale holds significant shares, had also
contributed to its overall profit, the group added.
Speaking in Brussels, Mr Etienne Davignon, president of the Generale group,
was upbeat about the prospects for 1994, after a series of years which have
seen the holding company prune a number of its financial assets.
'In spite of all the gloomy predictions, we estimate that the group could
see in 1994 results at least as good as 1993,' he said.
The group has proposed a dividend of BFr85 per share, against BFr84 last
year, and a one-for-10 bonus share issue.

FT  02 APR 94 / International Company News: Foreign side boosts Deutsche
Bank

<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank's expanding foreign business and sharp growth in returns from
trading on its own account were the main contributors to its 23 per cent
increase in net earnings last year, according to Mr Hilmar Kopper, chairman.
Forecasting a similar result of DM2.2bn (Dollars 1.3bn) after tax for the
current financial year, he said foreign profits rose 63 per cent in 1993.
Deutsche Bank AG, the parent company, had 'quite a bad year' in its domestic
operations, where net earnings were virtually unchanged at DM1.4bn.
Operating profits for the first two months, excluding risk provisions, were
about level with the same period last year, Mr Kopper said at a press
conference.
'The group made good progress in its efforts to offset risk through regional
and sectoral diversification,' he said in a review of last year.
The chairman, repeating earlier warnings that the banking system was
typically worst affected at the end of a recession and well into the upturn,
said provisions against bad debts had increased 72 per cent to DM3.3bn.
Almost the entire amount had been set aside against risks in Germany.
However, sprightly economic recovery abroad and growing business in
currencies and securities compensated for some of the domestic difficulties.
The Morgan Grenfell group generated DM439m in earnings, and the Banca
d'America e d'Italia made DM314m, Mr Kopper said. As reported earlier, DB
Luxembourg generated DM633m pre-tax partly from a heavy flow of funds out of
Germany prompted by the introduction of a withholding tax last year.
Profits from own account trading rose 76 per cent to DM2bn, including a
DM400m contribution from derivatives, which Mr Kopper stoutly defended
against recent international criticism.
The debate about derivatives had obscured their main purpose as a hedge
against risks. 'A bank that fails to exploit the full range of opportunities
is not doing its job,' he said.
Net commission income rose 26 per cent to DM5.8bn, while net interest
earnings rose 7.4 per cent to DM11.7bn. The group's net interest margin
narrowed further from 2.30 per cent to 2.21 per cent, and from 2.57 per cent
to 2.49 per cent at the parent company.
This proved that charges that the bank was not passing on rate reductions
were unfounded, Mr Kopper said. He also pointed out that the group had
invested DM4bn in eastern Germany, and had yet to make any profits there,
but it was not complaining.
By rule-of-thumb reckoning, earnings from the former GDR might start flowing
in two or three years, he added.
Summarising last year's results, Mr Kopper confirmed group operating profits
rose 16 per cent to DM5.3bn after risk provisions, while operating expenses
increased 12.6 per cent to DM11.7bn. Excluding first-time consolidations,
the rise was 6.5 per cent, he said.
Deutsche announced this week a DM1.50 dividend increase to DM16.50 per
share. Including tax credits the pay-out will give domestic shareholders
DM23.57, compared with DM23.44 last time.

Shareholders in Metallgesellschaft approved the second phase of a rescue
package for the beleaguered German metals group after a stormy annual
meeting which focused mainly on alleged shortcomings of the supervisory
board.
Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chief executive, called on shareholders to approve the
issue of profit-sharing certificates with a value of up to DM111m (Dollars
66m), after they had voted through a DM3.4bn rescue package at an
extraordinary meeting in February.
Mr Neukirchen, one of Germany's best-known company doctors, was appointed
when the group almost collapsed in December, after its US operation lost
DM2.3bn in oil futures trading.
Many shareholders lambasted Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, chairman of the supervisory
board, for failing to safeguard against the huge exposure the group had in
oil futures, an activity Mr Schmitz said he did not know about.
Meanwhile, Metallgesellschaft said this week that the pressing need to cut
costs meant it was withdrawing its 49 per cent stake in South East Asia
Metals Company, a joint venture with the Thai group Padaeng Industry to
build a smelting works.

writes John Ridding.
The company showed that the relative stability of its results demonstrated
its resilience in the face of a deterioration in the European economy last

Mitsubishi Bank, a leading Japanese commercial bank, announced a Y91bn
(Dollars 580m) rescue package to help its troubled finance subsidiaries.
The bank will give up some of its loan claims and forgo interest on Y330bn
in loans made to Daimond Teito Shoken and Diamond Factor. The subsidiaries
face mounting debts due to the prolonged recession and further falls in land
prices.
However, Mitsubishi said the measures would not affect its profits for the
year ended in March as the bailout would be financed through equity sales.
Meanwhile, Standard and Poor's, the credit rating agency, downgraded the
long-term debt rating of Mitsubishi from AA to AA-, and that of Sumitomo
Bank and the Bank of Tokyo from AA- to AA+ due to continued bearishness over
the banks' asset conditions.

FT  02 APR 94 / International Company News: Renault beats forecasts with
FFr1.07bn profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Renault, the French state-owned vehicle group, suffered a sharp fall in
profits last year, but managed to achieve a net result of FFr1.07bn (Dollars
186m) despite the contraction in the European car market. Mr Louis
Schweitzer, chairman, forecast improved earnings in the current year.
The result for last year, which compares with net profits of FFr5.68bn in
1992, was higher than most industry analysts had forecast. Mr Schweitzer
said it demonstrated the competitiveness of the company in the midst of
depressed markets, adding that few other European car manufacturers had
managed to remain in profit through the recession.
The Renault chairman said the group was seeking to forge new industrial
partnerships following last year's collapse of its plans to merge with
Volvo. But he played down the prospect of a far-reaching alliance. 'We need
to develop limited co-operation agreements with competitors, like other
players in the industry,' he said.
Mr Schweitzer said talks were being held with Fiat of Italy, but denied a
'global' agreement was being discussed. The negotiations are thought to
include the sharing of foundry facilities. Renault dismissed the idea of
plans to exchange engines with Fiat or to seek an alliance between RVI, its
trucks and buses division, with the Italian group's Iveco truck operation.
Last year's profits were supported by financial income of FFr537m, compared
with a charge of FFr43m in 1992, reflecting lower interest charges, and
improved income from its financial subsidiaries. Reduced losses from its
shareholding in Volvo, which has been partly unwound since the collapse of
the merger, also helped earnings.
Mr Schweitzer's prediction of an improved performance this year is based on
signs of recovery in the European vehicle market and continued cost-cutting
and efficiency measures. Renault said that the French market had been
strongly boosted by government measures which include the payment of
FFr5,000 to car-owners who trade in a vehicle more than 10 years old to buy
a new one. According to Mr Schweitzer, the measures could bring about
200,000 extra orders in the French market.
Turnover last year fell from FFr184.25bn to FFr169.79bn, after adjusting
last year's figures for an accounting change which consolidated revenues
from financial services. In unit terms, Renault sold 1.79m vehicles, a 12
per cent fall on 1992. In western Europe, sales of cars and light passenger
vehicles fell 17 per cent to 1.39m, while market share slipped slightly from
11.3 per cent to 11.1 per cent.
Renault is one of the 21 companies slated for privatisation. The sale of the
government's controlling stake, however, which had been forecast to take
place this year has been pushed back until 1995.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trizec, North America's biggest publicly-traded property developer, has
gained another 24 days of court protection while it tries to convince
creditors not to push it into bankruptcy.
An Alberta judge has given the Calgary-based company until April 25 to work
out an agreement with the creditors, notably a group holding CDollars 1.2bn
(USDollars 870m) of senior debentures. The two sides agreed that if they
cannot bridge their differences by then, the number of days required for
notice under bankruptcy laws will be reduced from 10 business days to one.
The debenture holders, many of whom are European investors, have rejected
plans presented by Trizec last August to restructure part of its CDollars
4.8bn debt. Repayment of the debentures fell due last autumn.
But Trizec announced an agreement earlier this week for a CDollars 600m
equity injection by Horsham, the Toronto investment company controlled by
entrepreneur Mr Peter Munk. Horsham would end up with a stake of at least 43
per cent.
Trizec expects that the Horsham deal will enable it to offer the senior
debenture holders a higher proportion of cash, in place of the securities
included in its original proposal. Details of its revised offer have not yet
been released. The debenture holders have so far dismissed the Horsham deal.

<TEXT>
Bank Hapoalim, Israel's largest bank, has announced a 36.3 per cent increase
in net profits to Shk374.3m (Dollars 126.4m) for 1993. Its net return on
equity rose to 8.8 per cent, from 7 per cent in 1992.
Net profits in the fourth quarter of 1993 reached Shk162m, almost double
their level in the corresponding period of 1992.
Mr Amiram Sivan, chief executive officer, attributed the improved
performance to increased operating income from capital market activities,
greater profitability at various bank subsidiaries and affiliates, and a
reduction of 22.8 per cent in provision for doubtful debts. Operating
income, given in dollar terms by the bank, rose 16.4 per cent to Dollars
588.6m due mainly to the expansion of diversified banking services in such
areas as brokerage, underwriting and mutual and provident fund management.
Total consolidated assets increased by 2.3 per cent to Dollars 35.9bn.

On turnover of Pounds 32.6m (Pounds 32.2m) profits improved from Pounds

Mr Harold Ennis, chairman, said severe competitive pressures had prevailed
in most of the group's markets and prices either remained stable or fell.
The better margins were a result of innovation and improved efficiency, he
added.
Earnings per share rose to 16p (13.1p). Because of the placing to fund the

a final, was declared in February, making 4p (3.68p) for the year.

FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Downturn in France hits Ash &amp; Lacy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A difficult year for its galvanising plants in France left 1993 pre-tax
profits for Ash &amp; Lacy, the metalwork company, 9 per cent lower at Pounds
3.41m, against Pounds 3.74m.
Turnover was slightly higher at Pounds 54.2m, compared with Pounds 53.9m.
The West Midlands-based company said that trading conditions had continued
to be difficult, particularly in France which suffered a further weakening
of demand affecting its large scale plants.
UK galvanising increased sales and profits with a good contribution from the
Midlands and manufacturing increased profits as a result of a good
performance from the storage tank division.
Earnings per share were 8.26p (9.76p). An unchanged final dividend of 3.9p
maintains the total at 6.4p.

FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Capital Radio expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Capital Radio, the London commercial pop music broadcaster, has extended its
reach to the south of England with an agreed Pounds 32.6m takeover of
Southern Radio.
The boost to the process of consolidation within the commercial radio
industry came the day after Capital's London rival LBC announced it had gone
into receivership.
Capital, the flagship company of commercial radio whose two London licences,
Capital FM and Capital Gold, will soon be up for renewal has already
received irrevocable undertakings covering 55.9 per cent of the Southern
shares.
The deal is 115p in cash for each share of Southern, a group formed in 1991
by the merger of Invicta Sound and Southern Radio. The group broadcasts in
Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.
The deal will reinforce Capital's position as the main player in the UK
industry. Apart from its two London licences the company also operates BRMB
and Xtra AM in Birmingham and has stakes in a string of other radio
companies including GWR, Metro Radio and Chilton.
The bid for Southern, which returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 956,000 on
turnover of Pounds 8.6m in the year to September, is designed to increase
Capital's business outside London where competition continues to grow.
The Radio Authority is about to advertise four new radio licences for London
and further licences are possible next year.
Commercial radio revenues in the UK have been rising, helped by two new
national stations - Classic FM and Virgin 1215 - launched in Britain and a
raft of more local stations and a better co-ordinated promotional campaign
for radio.

FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Taking a walk on the wild side - Pearson's
purchase of The Software Toolworks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pearson's agreed offer of Dollars 462m (Pounds 310m) for The Software
Toolworks, the interactive software publisher, looks a little like one of
the California's company's most recent hit products - MegaRace.
The CD game, which sold 100,000 copies in its first week, is described as 'a
wild, on the edge, virtual driving experience through the landscape of a
future Megalopolis'.
The planned drive into the new world of multimedia by a company, which was
starting to acquire a reputation for caution and being bridesmaid rather
than the bride, will be seen by some as a little bit on the wild side.
The price for Software Toolworks, which specialises in the production of
'entertainment, edutainment and infotainment' for personal computers and
video game machines such as Nintendo and Sega, is no less than 120 times the
company's pre-tax profits for the year to March 1993, although the multiple
is something like 57 for the present year.
'Whenever you back an emerging market you are taking a risk,' said Mr Frank
Barlow, managing director of Pearson, which has interests including the
Financial Times, Penguin Books, Thames Television and a stake in Sky
Television, the satellite venture.
To counter suggestions that the price was high Mr Barlow added that
conventional wisdom used to suggest that the price for Sky had been high.
Pearson, which has taken a strategic decision to concentrate on information,
education and entertainment, also announced formally that it was setting up
a new division, Pearson New Entertainment Europe. It will be led by Mr Nick
Alexander, who is joining Pearson from Sega Europe.
Mr Barlow described New Entertainment Europe, which will be run separately
from Software Toolworks, as 'taking an each way bet'.
Lord Blakenham, chairman and chief executive of Pearson emphasised that the
price was in line with other relevant transactions around the world.
Earlier this year, for example, Electronic Arts, one of the largest computer
game companies, bought Broderbund, another software company for Dollars
400m, although Broderbund then had profits of Dollars 20m a year. In the
nine months to December 1993 Software Toolworks had pre-tax profits of
Dollars 6m on sales of Dollars 107m.
Pearson intends to launch a tender offer for all the 29.5m outstanding
shares in Software Toolworks, a company quoted on Nasdaq.
The offer will remain open for 20 business days and the deal is dependent on
more than 50 per cent of the shares being tendered. The California company
which has been through difficult lossmaking times is now expanding under new
management and last year produced 105 titles with plans to produce another
155 this year.
It has the rights to use the Nintendo Mario Brothers characters for
educational purposes and the Star Wars characters as well as developing its
own brands, which include Chessmaster and typing and piano teaching systems
on CD-Rom. Its future profits growth is linked with the consumer market for
CD-Roms where the cost of production is much lower than for video games
cartridges.
Sales of CD-Rom software in the US reached an estimated Dollars 2.6bn in
1992 up from Dollars 304m in 1988.
To a considerable extent Pearson and Software Toolworks chose each other.
While Pearson looked at a large number of possible acquisitions, the
software company had talks with 20 possible partners.
Mr Bob Lloyd, chief executive of Software Toolworks, said the company was
impressed with Pearson's track record of working well with creative groups
in the media business. Or, as Mr Barlow put it on Thursday with a smile,
'dealing with difficult people'.
There are a lot of earrings and long hair at Software Toolworks, the Pearson
managing director noted with satisfaction. However, in comparison to annual
staff turnover rates of 50 per cent in some parts of the software industry
Software Toolworks had a 5 per cent turnover rate over three years.
The City decided the deal would be dilutive in the short term and marked
Pearson shares down 26p to 641p on Thursday.
If the deal is finalised it will be the largest so far of its type and one
of the most significant moves so far by a conventional European publisher
into multimedia.
As the blurb of MegaRace says: 'Winning is all that counts'. It is too early
to know how big the prize will be even for 'winners' in the wild multimedia
race.

FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Redland better than expected with Pounds
279m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Redland, one of Britain's biggest building material
groups, jumped by 40 per cent last year from Pounds 199m to to Pounds 279m.
Comparisons between the two years were distorted by profits and losses on
the disposal of businesses and properties. A better guide to performance was
a 28 per cent rise in operating profits, after interest payments, to Pounds
267m (Pounds 208m).
The shares, following the better than expected results published on
Thursday, rose 15p to 539p. The market was also encouraged by the company's
comments about the continuing strength of the German housing market and
rising UK building material prices.
The company said it had generated Pounds 297m of cash during 1993, compared
with an outflow of Pounds 369m in 1992. This had enabled it to reduce net
borrowings from Pounds 661m to Pounds 384m and gearing from 67 per cent to
43 per cent, including auction market preferred stock as debt.
Turnover rose from Pounds 2.09bn to Pounds 2.47bn. Earnings per share rose
to 26.1p (23.7p), adjusted for the loss on the disposal of an investment in
an associate.
The maintained final dividend of 16.75p makes a same-again total for the
year of 25p.
Mr Robert Napier, chief executive said: 'In the UK prospects do at last look
more encouraging, with the housing market improving. After many years of
decline, building material prices and margins are now recovering. The
changes to the road programme announced by the government are unlikely to
have any adverse impact in 1994 and 1995.'
UK operating profits in 1993, excluding Pounds 6m for the costs on plant
closures, rose from Pounds 24.8m to Pounds 28.8m.
Trading remained strong in Germany. Housing permits issued in eastern
Germany more than doubled and over the country as a whole the rise was 22
per cent. German operating profits increased from Pounds 115m to Pounds
150m.
Profits from the US more than doubled to Pounds 54.5m (Pounds 26.7m)
assisted by increased sales in Florida following Hurricane Andrew and the
completion of Denver's new international airport.
These special factors may not be repeated, but the company was encouraged by
rising US construction activity as the economy continued to improve.
Mr Napier said that elsewhere in Europe the outlook was mixed, with the
Netherlands steady but little sign of improvement in France.
Australia and the Far East were trading well. Overseas profits, in total,
rose from Pounds 209m to Pounds 281m.

FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Westland joins GKN stable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
M&amp;G and Schroders, the largest institutional shareholders in Westland Group,
are expected shortly to accept GKN's increased takeover offer for the
helicopter manufacturer.
The two institutions, which together control 25 per cent of the Yeovil-based
company, are likely to take the revised 335p-a-share cash offer following
the Westland board's reluctant decision to recommend acceptance of GKN's
Pounds 577m hostile bid.
Mr Alan Jones, Westland chairman, made the recommendation following a
meeting on Thursday with Sir David Lees, his GKN counterpart.
Sir David told him that the engineering group had secured enough shares to
ensure its stake could not be diluted below 50 per cent.
GKN, which increased its 290p-a-share offer by 15 per cent earlier this
week, has purchased more than 13.4m Westland shares at 335p and now controls
52.35 per cent of the enlarged share capital - allowing for conversion of
preference shares.
Although Mr Jones claimed GKN's revised offer still undervalued Westland, he
told investors: 'It would not be in the interest of shareholders or warrant
holders to continue to retain minority holdings in a company that formed
part of the enlarged GKN group.'
Royal Insurance, which controls 4 per cent of Westland, has signalled its
intention to follow the recommendation and other institutions are expected
to follow suit.
United Technologies, the US parent of Sikorsky helicopters, will also gain
from the revised offer.
The group is expected to receive around Pounds 86m rather than the Pounds
75m on offer at the 290p price.

FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: De-listing fear for London Securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Securities, the property investment company, has warned that if
ongoing discussions for the completion of a property purchase are not
completed by the end of this month the company would be threatened with
de-listing.
London Securities completed a company voluntary arrangement in 1992, whereby
its previous assets were put under the control of its secured lenders,
leaving the company as a cash shell.
It is considering the purchase of properties from its Nu-Swift, the fire
protection and property group which with a 29 per cent stake is the
company's largest shareholder.
It yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 342,000 for the year to
September 30 1993, reflecting the absence of operating businesses. Losses
per share were 0.6p.

FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Dunton cuts losses and makes Pounds 760,000
rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dunton Group, with interests in brickmaking, engineering and property, cut
its pre-tax losses from Pounds 852,000 to Pounds 636,000 for the half year
ended November 30 1993.
The USM-traded group is also calling for Pounds 760,000 net via a 1-for-3
underwritten rights issue at 6p a share to help reduce debt.
The balance of debt will be tackled via a restructuring arrangement with the
group's bankers. Dunton said restructuring would leave it with totally
ungeared properties and positive cash balances.
At the same time Mr Clive Travers has resigned as chairman and sold the
majority of his shareholding to the directors and others. Mr David Williams,
executive chairman of Mosiac Investments and non-executive director of Waste
Recycling, has been appointed a director and non-executive chairman of
Dunton.
Turnover was Pounds 933,000 (Pounds 879,000) and interest charges came to
Pounds 484,000 (Pounds 694,000). Losses per share emerged at 1.45p (1.73p).

FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: HSBC prompts bid talk with 6% stake in Hogg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HSBC Holdings has acquired a 6 per cent stake, worth about Pounds 6m, in
Hogg Group, the insurance broker and Lloyd's underwriter, in the last few
days prompting speculation in the City that a takeover bid was in the
offing.
Mr Anthony Howland-Jackson, chairman and chief executive of Hogg, said HSBC
had shown interest in the past but that no formal approach has been made
recently. 'Clearly we can only assume they have bought these shares with
something in mind.'
Hogg discussed the stake with its bankers, on Thursday, when HSBC announced
the holding. HSBC said it was one of a number of investments in the
insurance industry.
The acquisition led to mounting investor interest in Hogg's stock, the price
of which has been depressed following a profits warning in January. On
Thursday the shares closed at 165p, up 24p on the day.
Mr Tom Bennett, insurance analyst with Banque Paribas Capital Markets, said
the announcement looked 'like a precursor to something'.
He added: 'Takeover enthusiasm has raised its head and is bound to tinge all
players in the sector.'

FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Calor boosted to Pounds 51.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Calor Group, the dominant supplier of bottled gas in the UK, is increasing
its dividends for the first time since it demerged its oil interests in
1988.
A final dividend of 6.5p increases the total for 1993 to 12.5p (12p) out of
earnings per share which recovered to 19.5p (12p).
Pre-tax profits rose by Pounds 17.9m to Pounds 51.5m last year largely
because of the absence of Pounds 14.8m of exceptional costs, incurred in
1992, relating mainly to the restructuring of the core gas business, the
directors stated.
Mr Howard Robinson, chief executive, said the dividend increase reflected
the company's strong balance sheet and cash flow. 'We also wanted to restore
income for shareholders after the advance corporation tax changes last
year.'
However, he added that it should not be taken as a signal that dividends
would rise 'ever onwards'.
The company has cut its costs by more than Pounds 15m a year, reducing its
staff by 1,000 to 2,000, in an attempt to stem the long-term decline in its
market share.
'In 1993 we used the cost savings to offer better value for money to our
customers which reinforced our position as market leader,' said Mr Robinson.
Calor cut its prices which stimulated higher sales volumes with little help
from the weather or the economy.
Group turnover fell nearly 5 per cent to Pounds 295.9m and Calor's own cost
of gas rose but, thanks to the restructuring, operating profits from the
core gas business were little changed at Pounds 54.4m.

FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Queens Moat wins extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Holders of Queens Moat Houses' two debentures have voted overwhelmingly to
extend their waiver of the right to enforce their security, this time until
the end of June.
At the same time, bank lenders to the hotel group, in discussions over a
Pounds 1.3bn refinancing, extended the standstill agreement until May 27.
The standstill had been due to expire on Thursday night.
Of the votes cast, 97.2 per cent of one group and 98.9 per cent of the other
were in favour of the extension.
QMH hopes to publish its results for 1993 by the end of the coming week.
Once these are available it aims to finalise details of its refinancing and
put these to creditors and shareholders. When proposals have been accepted
the group's shares, which have now been suspended for a year, are expected
to be relisted.
The holders of the two debenture stocks - Pounds 200m of 10 1/4 per cent and
Pounds 15m of 12 per cent first mortgage debentures - have rights over 27
hotels. These were valued at Pounds 137.5m on December 31 1992.
The trust deeds for the stock say that the properties must be worth at least
150 per cent of the nominal value of the stocks, and so there was a
shortfall of Pounds 178.5m using that valuation.
QMH could not make up that shortfall by pledging further assets so the
debenture holders were entitled to enforce the security. In November,
meetings of the debenture holders agreed to waive this right until April 1
and it was this waiver that was extended at Thursday's meetings.
Interest payments on the 10 1/4 per cent stock, totalling Pounds 7.7m, were
paid yesterday.

FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Adjournment puts Heron creditors in
confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Creditors of Heron International were left in confusion on Thursday, after
meetings of senior and junior bondholders were adjourned in the absence of a
quorum. The meetings were held to approve a deferral of interest payments
due on Thursday until the end of June.
With the interest left unpaid, the bonds are technically in default, though
as yet no creditor has moved against the company. Under the terms of the
trust deeds, holders of at least 25 per cent of the bonds can ask the
Trustee to act.
Holders of 35 per cent of the bonds either attended the meeting or voted by
proxy, but the quorum required was at least 50 per cent. The meetings were
therefore adjourned and will be called again, probably towards the end of
April. At least 14 days notice is required. At the reassembled meetings the
quorum is two holders, whatever the value of the bonds they hold.
Heron had warned that without the interest deferral, and the postponement of
other payments due, the property and trading group might be unable to
continue trading.
In a separate development, Heron Properties, the US arm of Heron which was
detached from the group under last year's refinancing, is being sued in the
New York Supreme Court by Stratagem Development Corporation.
Stratagem - which is also suing nine banks and four people, including Mr
Gerald Ronson, chief executive of Heron International, and its head Mr Simon
Shane - and Heron have been embroiled in litigation for some years.
Stratagem is asking the US court to set aside the restructuring of the US
companies on the grounds that it constituted 'an unlawful fraudulent
conveyance'. It asserts that Heron Properties gave security over assets to
the nine defendant banks with the intent of preventing the payment of
unsecured creditors such as Stratagem.

<TEXT>
British Petroleum, the UK-based international oil company, is in talks with
two venture capital funds about selling the remainder of its nutrition
business to a management buy-out team. The sale is expected to raise about
Dollars 500m (Pounds 342m).
The Netherlands-based business is an important supplier of feed and animal
products in Europe, with interests in North and South America and a turnover
of Dollars 2bn last year.
BP, which has been selling off its nutrition interests over the past 18
months, said it was negotiating with CINVen and Baring Capital Investors
about the sale of its Agri Specialities, Aquaculture, Breeding and Feed and
Animal Products business.
BP has raised over Dollars 1bn in cash from nutrition disposals.

FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Cementone rises 22% to Pounds 1.21m
</HEADLINE>

   By TIM BURT

<TEXT>
Cementone, the specialist paints and building chemicals manufacturer which
came to the market earlier this year through a reverse takeover of
Multitrust, has announced a 22 per cent increase in profits.
Strong demand for the group's admixtures and bulk chemicals helped lift
pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 995,046) in the year to December 31.
Operating profits rose by 6.7 per cent to Pounds 1.45m (Pounds 1.36m), but
the group benefited from reduced interest payments and increased investment
income.
A decline in paint sales, however, contributed to flat turnover of Pounds
17.4m (Pounds 17.2m).
Mr Alfred Baxendale, the chief executive, said the group was proceeding with
plans to dispose of the asset portfolio inherited from Multitrust, the
property investment company.
Earnings per share rose to 4.05p (3.44p), and Mr Baxendale said the group
would announce its first interim dividend in September this year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gaskell, the carpet manufacturer, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds
403,000 for the 12 months to the end of December, against Pounds 131,000.
Turnover was up 8 per cent at Pounds 30.5m (Pounds 28.3m) but there was an
operating loss of Pounds 174,000 (Pounds 619,000 profit). This was offset by
an exceptional credit of Pounds 913,000 representing profit realised on
machinery destroyed by fire.
The dividend for the year is maintained at 4.25p, with a final of 2.75p.
Earnings per share came through at 5.3p (1.6p).

FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Rugby cuts flotation price to 115p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hillsdown has decided at the last minute not to sell its stake in Rugby
Estates, the company run by its former property team, because of a
significant cut in the flotation price.
The pricing for the Rugby flotation was announced on Thursday, and the
property company is being valued at Pounds 20.75m, compared with an initial
target of up to Pounds 30m.
The offer comes in the middle of a glut of property flotations, a sharp
reduction in the property sector's premium to asset value, and the recent
under-subscription of the public offer for Capital Shopping Centres.
These factors forced the company to scale down pricing and the size of the
share offer. It is placing 13.24m shares at 115p, which will raise Pounds
14.24m for Rugby, compared with the initial aim of raising Pounds 19.7m from
the share offer. The placement amounts to 73 per cent of the enlarged
company.
The pro-forma net asset value per share is 116.8p and the issue price
therefore represents a 13 per cent discount to net asset value, compared
with the initial expectation of a premium.
As a result of the reduced offer price, Hillsdown is to retain its 13 per
cent stake, diluted from 49 per cent, because of the new shares.
Mr Andrew Wilson, managing director, said he was pleased with the amount
raised by Rugby.
The company will have 32 per cent gearing on flotation, but Mr Andrew
Wilson, managing director, said he would be happy to reach an average figure
of 100 per cent.

FT  02 APR 94 / Shoppers in the line of fire: Effects of UK tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If it were not for the British consumer, the economy would still be looking
glum. Spending by individuals has motored the UK back to recovery over the
past year or so. But this weekend, it is as if they are being penalised for
their efforts.
Building societies have already written to mortgage holders informing them
that payments will rise at the end of April because of a cut in tax relief
on interest payments; VAT was imposed on consumers' gas and electricity
bills from yesterday; and take-home pay will also drop, with increased
national insurance contributions and a reduction in the married couple's
allowance.
In total, the tax changes will raise about Pounds 8.4bn in 1994-95, or 1.3
per cent of gross domestic product. Over the next three fiscal years, they
will raise a total of between Pounds 15bn and Pounds 17bn, the equivalent of
7p in the pound on the standard rate of income tax.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, says the tax increases - introduced in
the last two Budgets - are essential to reduce the public sector borrowing
requirement, which is expected to reach about Pounds 48bn in 1993-94. The
government believes the present PSBR is enormously high and has to be
reduced in order to regain control over public finances. Moreover, it argues
that a low PSBR would encourage confidence. But with recovery still fragile,
is Mr Clarke wise to tinker with what is currently the economy's main
driving force?
A particular feature of the recovery is that it has been almost entirely
consumer led. Since early 1992, consumer spending has risen by an average of
2.7 per cent a year, while government expenditure and private investment -
the other main components of demand - have barely increased.
In contrast, the recovery after the recession of 1974-75 was led by strong
export growth, while that of the early 1980s was - at least initially -
spurred by a rise in capital spending.
This time, consumer spending has been encouraged by a fall in mortgage
interest rates, from a peak of 15.4 per cent in 1990 to about 7.6 per cent
today. The benefit of lower rates is still being felt, as homeowners with
mortgages reviewed annually switch to making lower payments.
The continuing impetus to growth from interest rate cuts allows the
government to argue that the recovery can withstand tax increases. This
conclusion is shared by the majority of the Treasury's six 'wise men', or
economic advisers, in their latest report.
Several City analysts agree with the Treasury panel. Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK
economist at investment bank Morgan Stanley, says some of the tax increases,
such as on tobacco and vehicles, have already been introduced, while others
 -the freezing of tax allowances, for instance - will not reduce nominal
take-home pay. 'Roughly half the fiscal pain (from higher taxes) is either
behind us or will go unnoticed,' he says.
Mr Gardiner predicts GDP growth of 2.8 per cent this year, compared with the
Treasury's forecast of 2.5 per cent and with 1.9 per cent in 1993. He
forecasts that, without the tax increases, consumer spending would have
grown by up to 4 per cent this year, but he still expects a healthy 2.7 per
cent rise.
Similarly, Lombard Street Research, part of discount house Gerrard and
National, concludes: 'Concerns (about the tax increases) seem exaggerated,
given that the increases will amount to only 1 per cent of personal
disposable income in 1994-95 and about 0.2 per cent of personal wealth, and
have been known about for a year.'
There is some evidence to support the argument that the tax increases are
not coming as a shock to consumers. They appear to have started scaling back
their spending already: the annual growth rate in retail sales slipped to
2.5 per cent in February from 3.7 per cent the previous month.
Even if the tax increases do have an effect, consumers could keep spending
at the same rate by increasing borrowings or by running down their savings.
There are three incentives for consumers to reduce their savings: falling
unemployment, which reduces the need for precautionary saving; lower nominal
interest rates; and subdued inflation. The savings ratio - personal saving
as a percentage of disposable incomes - dropped to 10.2 per cent in the last
three months of 1993, from 11 per cent in the previous three months.
It may fall further: Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at broker James Capel,
predicts that by 1995 the ratio will have fallen to about 8 per cent. That,
he reckons, will be in line with 'the equilibrium savings ratio in periods
of low inflation, such as the 1960s'.
But not everyone shares the government's confidence that consumer spending
will withstand the tax increases. Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge
University, a dissenter among the six wise men, says: 'This is a very feeble
recovery. The balance of payments is weak, unemployment is still high and
output is unimpressive. If it was not for the falls in unemployment, you
would not have much sense of a recovery.'
Similarly, Mr Peter Warburton, at Robert Fleming Securities, says it is
doubtful that growth has gained enough momentum to resist the fiscal
tightening: 'If interest rates had been cut earlier in the year, then we
could perhaps have started off on a positive footing. Now we are facing the
most unpleasant change in taxation for 13 years, and negative momentum is
liable to build.'
Nevertheless, even if the tax increases do depress consumer spending more
than the government might hope,there could be long-term beneficial effects.
In the past, surges in UK consumer spending have sucked in imports, leading
to a deterioration in the balance of payments, a fall in sterling and
eventually a rise in interest rates.
The UK's trade position is already deteriorating. The current account
deficit widened to Pounds 2.6bn in the last three months of 1993 from Pounds
1.8bn in the previous three months, as earnings from services and financial
transactions proved insufficient to compensate for the deficit in 'visible'
goods.
Mr Andrew Sentance, of the London Business School, says: 'Consumer spending
now absorbs a much higher share of GDP in the UK than in other countries,
reducing the proportion of national resources devoted to investment. If this
imbalance is redressed, the UK will be able to maintain a higher rate of
investment without balance of payments or inflation problems. That should
put the economy in a better position to sustain growth over the medium
term.'
There are some tentative signs that investment is emerging from the
recessionary doldrums. Gross domestic fixed capital formation increased by
2.5 per cent between the third and fourth quarters of 1993, the fastest
quarterly increase for five years.
The risk, which cannot yet be ruled out, is that Mr Clarke has got his
calculations wrong - and has stifled consumer spending to such an extent
that the recovery will stall. But the pick up in investment offers some
encouragement to the government that the tax package will amount to a gentle
application of the brake, allowing the economy to steer a smoother growth
path.

FT  02 APR 94 / Vengeance of a Union scorned: Ian Davidson argues that the
UK has averted one European crisis, but a showdown is inevitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's capitulation over voting rights in the European Union has
averted a serious crisis in Europe. But this is at best only a temporary
truce in the UK's long-running battle to resist and, if possible, reverse
the trend to closer political integration in Europe. The prime minister has
abandoned this particular attempt to reduce the scope of majority voting in
Europe; but his government remains unreconciled to the objective of a
quasi-federalist Union which is supported by most member states.
What has happened this week has settled nothing in Britain, and settled
nothing in Europe; it is only a short-term postponement of a showdown
between the UK and its European partners which is steadily becoming more
inevitable.
Such a showdown is already lying in wait, in the Inter-Governmental
Conference scheduled for 1996. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, tries
to minimise the significance of this week's capitulation, by implying that
it could be reversed in 1996. In reality, the central aim of the IGC, in the
minds of most member states, will be to strengthen political integration. It
is therefore bound to be a scene of confrontation between Britain and its
partners.
Moreover, by then the political stakes will have been raised by another
order of magnitude, because the west Europeans will be wrestling with the
political implications of expanding their Union into central and eastern
Europe. London claims to believe that enlargement of the Union will, or at
least should, turn it into a looser, more inter-governmental type of
grouping. But most of the other members maintain that a larger Union must
become more integrated, and no doubt the candidate countries in eastern
Europe will agree with them.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has made clear that he will be pressing for the
opening of the European Union to the east; and he has explicitly derided the
idea that such an enlarged Union should be turned into a loose free trade
area.
Paradoxically, the confrontation over blocking minorities blew up precisely
because the member states had wanted to avoid it. In the spring of 1992, it
was argued, by the Commission among others, that the prospective
negotiations to expand the EC, through the admission of the four European
Free Trade Association countries, would require a big revision of the
decision-making arrangements, including national voting weights and majority
voting rules.
Decision-making was already difficult enough in the Community of 12; so the
rules had to be adapted to make sure that it did not become more difficult
in a Community of 16. A second reason was that existing voting weights were
skewed in favour of the small members; Germany, for example, has 200 times
the population of Luxembourg, but only five times the number of votes in the
Council of Ministers. Since all the Efta candidates were small, enlargement
would make this bias in favour of small countries even worse.
But by the time of the regular European summit in the summer of 1992,
governments were having second thoughts. They had been deeply shaken early
in June, when the Danish electorate turned down the Treaty of Maastricht. So
when the 12 leaders met later that month in Lisbon, they were doubly anxious
to avoid any bruising new arguments over politically sensitive issues. They
announced that this enlargement could take place without any revision in the
principles of majority voting or the future of the institutions. By
implication, these questions would be back on the agenda for the following
enlargement, taking in the countries of eastern Europe. In the meantime, new
members from Efta would have the same voting weights as corresponding
existing members, and the required majority thresholds would be adjusted
mechanically.
Like most decisions born of panic, this was a stupid position to have taken.
The 12 were setting up a future situation which would be difficult to
change. They seemed to assume that the small countries, which would total 11
of the future 16 members, would willingly give up their voting weight
advantage, without compensation; and they ignored the fact that six of them
would have to submit this sacrifice of national advantage to a referendum.
For the sake of a quiet life now, the 12 were storing up trouble for the
future.
Even for the short term, the 12 were taking a risk. Such an imbalance in
voting power between large and small countries could undermine the
legitimacy of the whole system, which is already under challenge in several
member states. At one extreme, the UK, Germany and two small countries,
mustering more than 40 per cent of the population of the Union, could be
outvoted by the rest; but eight small countries, with barely 12 per cent of
the population, would command a blocking minority. The original
small-country bias was part of the founding bargain between the six
like-minded states; but the imbalance is becoming more acute in a Community
where members are less like-minded, and some (like Britain) not committed to
the underlying premiss of integration at all.
If the voting weight bias favouring the little countries is ever to be
reversed, the reform will obviously have to be paid for; and the currency of
payment will probably have to be more integration. That is the challenging
position, as sketched out by the Belgian government: if political legitimacy
is said to reside essentially with the nation states and the sovereignty of
national parliaments, then this fact must be reflected in the (relative)
equality of the nation states in Brussels; but if it is claimed that
population counts, then this fact must be reflected in the democratic
legitimation of the Brussels decision-making process.
In theory this week's compromise settlement should close off until 1996 the
danger of a crisis over the institutions of the Union. But that crisis may
yet break in through another door, if the German government lives up to its
declared determination to hurry the opening of the Union to the countries of
eastern Europe. Clearly they will not be ready for full economic membership
of the Union for some years to come. But if Germany presses for a different
form of political membership, then it will become impossible to resist the
reopening of all the issues of decision-making and voting weights and
institutional legitimacy, which many had thought had been quietly put off to
another day.

Sir, In her letter of March 25, Mrs S Copperwaite of Merrill International
demonstrates all the enthusiasm of a good student. After all, poets are read
mostly by other poets, watercolour painters viewed by others of their skill,
and investors also think the world revolves around their profession.
I am a fan of Michael Prowse and agree that a well rounded education
includes economics. The trouble is that formal schools of economics admit
they cannot create an expanding market at will.
I read somewhere that most economic reports are studies in obfuscation and I
agree.
Until this problem is cleared up, I think schools could use some
understanding of moral standards, honesty and charity backed up by the
age-old tenets of whatever major religion is followed by the student and his
family, whether he/she is an investor, watercolour artist, poet or whatever.

FT  02 APR 94 / Money out of chatterboxes: Phone companies need Britons to
speak more to each other at home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The problem with television is that people must sit and keep their eyes
glued on a screen; the average American family hasn't time for it.'
So said the New York Times in 1939; the rest is history. In the case of
telephones, however, ingrained habits and perceptions about the cost of
calls have proved remarkably enduring in the UK and much of Europe.
The typical home telephone in the UK is used for less than four minutes a
day, according to figures released by British Telecommunications this week.
In Agatha Christie's detective novels, set in inter-war England, the phone
was in the hallway, used for the imparting of brief, telegram-length
messages. Sixty years later there are far more phones, but for most people
they serve the same function.
There is a marked sexual bias to domestic calling patterns: men make twice
times as many work-related calls as women. But women make twice as many
calls to relatives and run up larger phone bills - except among the
under-24s, where BT's figures show that it is men who spend most on social
calls.
The statistics suggest that increasing the usage of the telephone line
should be the overriding goal for telecoms companies, and a far higher
priority than seeking to outwit each other in battles with regulatory
authorities over pricing and competition issues.
The modest use of home telephones affects not just the profits of
telecommunications companies. It also has a vital bearing on the prospects
for the much-touted 'information superhighways', intended to provide a
plethora of new telecoms services in the home.
If the British home phone were engaged for 14 minutes a day instead of four,
BT could spend Pounds 1bn a year on building a UK-wide fibre-optic
superhighway, lose a quarter of its domestic customers to Mercury and the
fledgling cable companies offering telecoms services, and still turn in
larger profits than today.
Such thinking explains why BT's forthcoming advertising campaign, to be
launched next month, will focus on two messages: the real cost of a phone
call, and how it can improve the quality of life. It may also explain why Mr
Stafford Taylor, BT's new head of personal communications, says BT's mission
is to get friends and relations to speak to each other - a far cry from the
old days, when BT was a nationalised utility, and it took weeks even to get
a phone connected.
Comparisons between the UK and the US illustrate the scope for growth. In
the US, the typical home phone is used for 18 minutes a day. Americans spend
twice as long on the line to relatives than the British and more than four
times as long chatting to friends. But the sharpest contrast is in
'telebuying': American households spend an average of six minutes a week
purchasing goods and services via the telephone, compared with half a minute
in Britain.
Culture, geography, even variations in climate partly explain such
international differences. Americans live further apart than Europeans;
their service industries are more geared to the phone. Within Europe, the
Scandinavians and Italians spend far longer on the line than the British,
according to BT - possibly because colder weather keeps the Danes and Finns
indoors, while Italian families are more communicative than their English
counterparts.
Nonetheless, marketing and perceptions of price also account for British
reticence on the phone. The price of calls has fallen by about 40 per cent
in the UK in the last decade, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development studies show that the price of residential calls is similar in
the US and the UK. Yet British perceptions have not changed: the typical
caller overestimates by three times the cost of making a call.
The same disparity applies to mobile phones. A study* by the Manchester
School of Management, based on a survey of 500 university employees, reveals
gross overestimates of the price of mobile services.
Ironically, the prices volunteered by the respondents as 'reasonable' were
almost identical to today's actual prices. The average price volunteered for
a mobile handset was Pounds 190; Pounds 77 was considered reasonable, which
is about the going rate for a bottom-of-the-range model. On average,
respondents thought that peak-rate calls cost 57p a minute and off-peak
calls 35p; they considered 24p and 14p, respectively, to be reasonable -
within a few pence of what Vodafone and Cellnet, the two largest operators,
charge.
Unsurprisingly, only 5 per cent of those surveyed had a mobile phone or
pager. There was also little enthusiasm for the concept of constant
contactability - 71 per cent said they did not want to be available by phone
at all hours of the day.
But barely one in eight said they would 'never' want to make or receive
calls when out and about, and only 18 per cent thought that society was a
better place before the arrival of mobile phones. It is fair bet that if the
price was low enough, and known to be so, almost everyone would buy a mobile
phone.
More effective marketing would seem a prime requirement for tapping that
latent demand. US telecoms giant AT&amp;T spends about 10 times as much as BT on
advertising as a proportion of revenues.
BT's figures might lead it to use advertising to persuade men to make more
social calls and women to work more from home. But if the US is any guide,
phone companies and consumers alike would gain most from a fierce,
well-publicised price war. Consumers would have the actual cost of calls
drummed into them; line usage would rise; phone company profits might be
boosted - in the cause of getting people to talk to each other.

March 30) shows that the true democrats in Ukraine are not politicians, but
its citizens.
Despite a confusing electoral law 75 per cent of the people voted in the
first round.
Regardless of the final outcome one clear message has been given. Ukrainian
citizens seek solutions through democratic institutions. Although in the
west this sentiment is taken for granted, in a former authoritarian state,
where two-thirds of the people are classified as living under the poverty
line, it is the one bright hope for the future.

FT  02 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Social clause safeguard for Gatt
trading system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER MADDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Christian Aid's experience in more than 70 developing countries is that
labour standards could indeed be an excuse for a new protectionism
('Workers' rights and free trade', March 28). But allowing for a
free-for-all would be just as bad. Global economic integration with a
competitive devaluation of standards could leave workers in both north and
south worse off.
Unemployment in industrial countries is already increasing the pressure to
adopt unilateral protectionism. Integrating a social clause into the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade could be the best safeguard of a rules-based
multilateral trading system.
By addressing workers' rights at next month's Gatt meeting governments will
also be addressing the concern of consumers who increasingly want to know
that what they buy is 'fairly traded'.

FT  02 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lethal move for small business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LESLIE THAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The debate rages on in your editorial ('Late payment of bills', March
28) with regard to the need for legislation to assist the cash flow of small
and many medium-sized businesses.
It is perhaps likened to killing the proverbial 'cat'. Why can MPs and
others who lobby not see that this action will only accelerate the demise of
the small business? All the major customer will do is use a supplier
(accepting, of course, that some suppliers might just have an added 'unique'
product advantage built in) which tends to be more lenient with regard to
cash collection. The dog-eat-dog syndrome will ensure that there are many
other willing suppliers happy to fill a hole left by a conscientious
objector.
As for balance sheet policing, a simple window dressing exercise at the year
end will resolve that. The solution lies simply in ensuring that adequate,
skilled resources are applied to the management of assets.
Until then, I fear, the giants will continue to hold all the cards.

Sir, As a partially deaf person and a shareholder, I have much appreciated

I hope this innovative idea is here to stay and I would like to add one

FT  02 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: NHS draft governance codes not
adequate on internal auditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Alan Pike reports Mr Alan Langlands, the new chief executive of the
National Health Service, as stating that the draft codes on corporate
governance, published by the NHS executive, have received positive comments
from professional bodies ('Health pay put first in line for treatment',
March 30). I would like to point out that the Institute of Internal
Auditors-UK was disappointed with certain elements of the drafts.
While the IIA-UK applauds the move for stronger internal control, it
believes that Mr Gordon Greenshields, head of the NHS finance executive, was
misguided in recommending that internal auditors be CCAB (Consultative
Committee of Accountancy Bodies) qualified. CCAB qualifications do not place
sufficient emphasis on how to ensure good internal control. By focusing on
the financial reporting objective of internal control, they fail to address
the other objectives of internal control which fall within the much broader
approach covered by internal auditing.
The IIA-UK firmly believes that NHS internal auditors who hold the
Institute's MIIA and QiCA qualifications are better equipped to fulfil their
role. These qualifications provide the holder with the knowledge required to
report on the whole system of internal control and not solely on its
financial aspects.
The NHS is responsible for 15 per cent of public spending - mismanagement of
these funds, or unacceptable risk-taking, is a cause for public concern.
Properly qualified internal auditors play a vital role in ensuring that
these risks are minimised.

FT  02 APR 94 / Leading Article: Back to go, painfully
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Few at Christmas predicted that the world's financial markets would look as
shaky as they now do at Easter. Yet there is at least one important respect
in which the unsettling behaviour of the markets gives grounds for hope. The
successive squalls that have upset bond and equity prices, culminating in
Wall Street's nervous slide this week, are partly a reflection of a
healthier global economy. Bond markets always turn when the accelerating
pace of economic activity starts draining liquidity from the system.
Investment in inventory, plant and machinery then takes priority over the
claims of portfolio investors.
This is certainly true of the US, where business investment is buoyant and
the economy is set to grow this year at between 3 and 4 per cent. The UK is
following at a more sedate pace. But part of the global bond market shakeout
has been to do with the growing perception that growth is reaching hitherto
stagnant parts of the world. Surveys of business confidence in continental
Europe reveal unexpected signs of optimism and economists are upgrading
their growth forecasts for 1994. Even in Japan, where real gross national
product contracted marginally in 1993 and business investment continues to
fall, there is a hint that an economy which seemed poised for serious
deflation may now have bottomed out.
It looks at first sight like a return to normality after a lingering
recession which was induced in large part by the lending excesses of the
1980s and by the strains of German unification. Yet to call this normality
would be going too far, because the unusual financial conditions that
prevailed in the recession continue to affect the behaviour of capital and
credit.
We have lived through a period in which the US Federal Reserve has engaged
in a gigantic and astonishingly successful exercise in rigging the markets
in order to recapitalise an American banking system shattered by bad debts.
This involved maintaining short-term interest rates at artificially low
levels, which precipitated a tidal outflow of dollars from bank deposit
accounts into mutual funds and other longer-term investments offering scope
for higher returns.
Neutral stance
Since his decision to raise interest rates in February, Fed chairman Mr Alan
Greenspan has indicated that it is time to return to a normal or 'neutral'
monetary stance. Yet the consequences of his earlier policy make it
difficult to return to normal without causing markets to slide. In effect Mr
Greenspan has to keep two separate and very different constituencies happy.
The first consists of sophisticated professional investors, many of whom
believe that the Fed has been slow to respond to a build-up in inflationary
pressure. After growth at an annualised rate of 7 per cent in the final
quarter of last year a federal funds rate of 3 1/2 per cent looks tame. The
average federal funds rate since 1979 has been 3 3/4 per cent - and that
average includes periods of very tight policy.
Inflationary threat
Such investors would have been happier to see the Fed move swiftly to
short-term rates of 4 1/2 or 5 per cent, instead of moving from 3 to 3 1/2
per cent in quarter point steps. Yet there are fears that less sophisticated
investors in the mutual funds - the second constituency - might then panic
if they discovered, in any resulting market fall, that stock market
investment is not protected by deposit insurance schemes. Small wonder Mr
Greenspan has pursued a gradualist course. Yet the consequence is that the
professionals become more nervous. If the inflationary threat is real,
short-term rates of 3 1/2 per cent look low for this point in the cycle.
Hence much of the recent market turbulence.
The problem for Europe is that the impact of an overshooting US bond market
is benign when prices are moving up, but threatening when they are moving
down. Monetary policy in continental Europe has been too tight over the past
18 months or so when US capital has spilled over into European capital
markets. Yet that same outflow has helped offset the monetary squeeze by
pushing European stock and bond markets higher. This enabled European
governments to finance their growing fiscal deficits more cheaply, while
helping companies rebuild strained balance sheets by raising capital.
Now the sharp fall in European bond markets is, in effect, tightening
monetary policy through its impact on long-term interest rates, while
short-term rates remain high in real terms. Yet the Bundesbank is reluctant
to change monetary tack to offset the market induced tightening. This
approach is understandable while the markets are still sorting themselves
out. But if continued for too long it would kill off the European recovery.
The resulting uncertainty is the opposite of a recipe for an immediate soft
landing in the markets, especially against a background of unusual political
weakness in Britain, Germany, France and Italy. Stand by for another squall.

FT  02 APR 94 / Dragon with an eye on its futures: As China opens up to the
world, Shanghai's financial markets are developing fast - perhaps too fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shanghai, in the spring of its economic transformation, appears to be
confounding even the most determined optimists. Few predicted it would move
quite so fast in re-establishing itself as a financial centre and magnet for
foreign investment.
After an uncertain start in the 1980s Shanghai's almost passionate embrace
of the marketplace is palpable. The opening on Monday of an interbank
currency market is yet one more indication of the rapid steps being taken
towards restoring the city's former financial status. Indications that the
Shanghai Securities Exchange will soon allow foreign brokers unrestricted
membership, thus freeing them from the obligation of trading through local
counterparts, is another sign of progress towards realisation of the city's
dream of becoming first a national and then an international financial
trading post.
All the more remarkable, perhaps, is the speed of the city's recovery after
years of relative decline. This slide in its fortunes owed much to Beijing's
decision to keep Shanghai, with its history of destructive radicalism during
Mao's Cultural Revolution between 1966 and 1976, on a tight leash, while
allowing free rein to the southern regions adjacent to Hong Kong.
As a consequence, Shanghai's once virtually unchallenged status as China's
industrial and exporting powerhouse was gradually eroded. Between 1978, the
year China tentatively opened its doors to the outside world, and 1992-93,
its contribution to national exports declined from 30 per cent to 7 per
cent.
In 1985 it surrendered to neighbouring Jiangsu province its coveted status
as the regional centre with the greatest absolute value of industrial output
Like an oriental Gulliver, Shanghai was being strangled. But Shanghai's
fortunes changed in 1992 when ailing senior leader Deng Xiaoping, anxious to
ensure his economic reforms were consolidated before he died, ordered that
the shackles be removed.
The enterprising Shanghainese needed little encouragement to do what comes
naturally to them - making money. Although substantial obstacles remain -
such as a crumbling infrastructure after decades of neglect, and an archaic
banking system unable to meet the demands of a modern economy - municipal
officials make liberal use of superlatives to describe their ambition to
transform Shanghai into the 'dragon head' of China's economic revolution.
Shanghai's vice-mayor Xu Kuangdi likens the future roles of Shanghai and
Hong Kong to those of complementary players in a 'Beijing Opera'. Hong Kong
will continue to be a conduit between China and the countries of South East
Asia, while Shanghai will form a 'golden highway' between 'China and the
rest of the world'.
Mr Xu would seem to have a point about Shanghai's role when it comes to
markets - whether equities, bonds, commodities' futures or currencies. In
scarcely more than a year Shanghai's markets have undergone extraordinarily
rapid development.
The city is home to the country's three dominant commodities' futures
markets - petroleum, cereals and metals. The last of these is now the
world's third largest metals exchange and is beginning to influence trading
in London and Chicago. Trading volume on the Shanghai metals exchange soared
to Yuan388.9bn (Dollars 44.7bn) in 1993 from Yuan48.8bn after opening for
business in May 1992.
Shanghai's fledgling interbank market will form the nucleus of a national
currency trading system. All important regional exchanges will eventually be
linked electronically with Shanghai, and it is hoped this will facilitate
steps towards making the Chinese yuan a fully convertible international
currency. But progress is likely to be slow since a national electronic
dealing system is far from being in place.
The city will also soon be home to an experimental gold exchange to be
organised by the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, which
holds the monopoly over gold trading.
Initially, the gold market will be restricted to enterprises directly
involved in the Chinese gold industry, but gradually it will be allowed to
evolve into a gold exchange open to the public. Chinese consumers last year
purchased 223 tonnes of gold jewellery, according to the World Gold Council,
making China the fourth biggest market for gold behind the US, India and
Saudi Arabia.
It is a measure of Shanghai's growing strength as a financial centre that
attempts by provincial governments, such as Jiangsu, to establish their own
futures markets are tending to wither on the vine. Indeed, the central
authorities have called a halt for the moment to the proliferation of
futures exchanges following the near collapse of some and pending the
drafting of new trading regulations.
Shanghai officials are using the city's revival to spur the growth of what
they refers to as its tertiary sector, which includes both financial
services and high-technology industries. At the same time the city is
shrinking the low-technology state-run sector dominated by textiles. By the
year 2000 tertiary industries will account for 45 per cent of the city's
economy, against 37.8 per cent at the end of 1993, according to the
municipal plan.
In this, the municipality is being assisted by a surge in investment, much
of its destined for projects in the city's new Pudong Development Zone, on
the east bank of the Huangpu River.
In the first two months of 1994, foreign investors pledged Dollars 1.1bn of
new investment. By October, according to the American Consulate, 86 'Fortune
500' companies had invested in Shanghai, including McDonell Douglas, Du
Pont, Xerox and Coca Cola.
In spite of Shanghai's growing self-confidence, however, there are
considerable obstacles to the city's almost boundless ambition. These
include a huge knowledge gap in a population starved for years of contact
with the outside world. Teething problems abound, such as relatively
frequent computer glitches in the Securities Exchange's supposedly
state-of-the-art trading system. Trading surges tend to bring the system
down.
The markets, including securities and commodities' futures, are also
labouring under a lack of national regulations. Insider trading is a
persistent problem, especially in the commodities' exchanges, where some of
the bigger players are also China's monopolistic state trading corporations.
This poses a threat to individual and smaller institutional investors who
are in danger of being squeezed. The drafting of a new securities law and
commodities trading regulations is progressing slowly, to the chagrin of
local securities traders. Market managers recognise the need for a
confidence boost to lift the equities markets, which have been depressed
since last year and show little sign of recovering. This has tested the
nerves of local investors who have been deserting stocks in droves for
currencies and futures.
The Shanghai A-share market, restricted to Chinese investors in local
currency, fell by about 50 per cent last year from a high in mid-February
1993. The B-share market, denominated in US dollars for foreign investors,
has also experienced a bumpy ride and is well off its highs of last year.
In spite of its bearish mood, the equities market is still developing fast.
Trading volume increased fivefold in 1993. At the end of last year some 133
A and B share companies had been listed, up from 38 a year earlier. Numbers
of listed companies grew further to 177 by the end of March.
Western securities analysts in Shanghai believe the gloom in the stock
market is temporary and is, in any case, attributable to a difficult
learning process among investors unschooled in the vicissitudes of the
marketplace.
Mr John Crossman, chief representative in Shanghai of the Jardine Fleming
securities house, says it is understandable that China's emerging markets
should be volatile, and he expects this pattern to continue for the next
five to 10 years: 'There's tremendous risk in this market, but there are
also prospects for enormous gain. It's going to be wild.'
The disappointing performance of Shanghai securities markets and
reservations about China's regulatory abilities have not deterred foreign
banks and securities houses from moving to the city. At last count, there
were 26 foreign brokerages in Shanghai dealing in B-shares - including
Barings, Jardine Fleming, Credit Lyonnais and Standard Chartered.
Hard-pressed officials at the stock exchange joke that it seems now to have
become the city's principal tourist attraction. Among a steady stream of
high-level visitors in the past weeks have been Sir Andrew Hugh Smith,
chairman of the London Stock Exchange, Mr Joseph Hardiman, president of the
US NASDAQ exchange and Mr Peter Baring, chairman of Barings.
Not least among the attractions for them is the prospect of Chinese pension
funds which, swollen with contributions, would seek help in investing vast
amounts of money internationally. With China undergoing such a rapid
transformation to a market economy, and with a process of corporatisation of
previously state-controlled industries well under way, it is only a matter
of time before Chinese superannuation funds develop a big appetite for
investment opportunities abroad. The development of Chinese mutual funds and
unit trusts is also in the wind.
Visits to Shanghai by representatives of the international financial
community show that, after years of isolation, China, and Shanghai in
particular, is being drawn inexorably into the world trading and financial
system. But representatives of foreign securities houses also caution that
Shanghai has a long way to go towards realising its ambition to rival New
York, London or Tokyo.
Apart from an archaic banking system (banking reform lags far behind other
sectors) and lack of full currency convertibility, Shanghai also labours
under the burden of a primitive legal framework and an absence of
transparency in financial rules and regulations.
But foreign bankers and securities traders believe that these impediments
may not be a bad thing for the time being. 'They shouldn't go forward too
quickly,' says Mr Crossman of Jardine Fleming. 'If they move too fast they
run the risk of not having the regulations in place to assert control. Their
banking system could not cope, for example, with vast sums of money flowing
in and out.'
Shanghai may have to learn to be more patient if it is to consolidate its
gains - but patience does not appear to be a conspicuous virtue these days
in a city striving to regain its former glory.

FT  02 APR 94 / Man in the News: A prickly bear baited - Mangosuthu
Buthelezi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are certain politically correct cliches about Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party: he is mad; he is a
dangerous megalomaniac; he is an enemy of the South African people; he fears
electoral defeat and rejects democracy; he must be stopped.
Given the imminence of South Africa's first all-race elections, between
April 26 and 28, and the high hopes pinned to this great event of national
catharsis, few dare stray from the realm of the politically correct to
question the truth of these labels. With the juggernaut of majority rule
bearing down upon the nation, better simply to go on believing that
Buthelezi is an evil but ultimately impotent menace; then he can be crushed
with impunity, and with no fear for the consequences.
That is the reasoning which underpinned Thursday's decision to impose a
state of emergency in Natal province, and the black homeland of KwaZulu
(ruled by Chief Buthelezi). The elections must go on, in spite of the
opposition of Inkatha, which commands a large chunk of the electorate in
Natal/KwaZulu; Inkatha can be easily defeated because it commands no army;
once crushed, it and Chief Buthelezi will disappear forever.
Would that reality were so simple. For Chief Buthelezi has been preparing
for this battle - psychologically and militarily - for years. Since its
formation as a 'cultural movement' in 1975, Inkatha has worked hard to
rebuild the sense of a Zulu nation, so strong in the 19th century but
undermined by defeat at the hands of the British, the emasculation of the
Zulu chiefs and the fragmentation of the Zulu kingdom early this century. A
prince of the Zulu royal family and an uncle to the king, Chief Buthelezi
has coaxed the embers of Zulu nationalism into full flame, reaching a climax
earlier this week when Zulu warriors, marching to defend their King, were
gunned down by African National Congress security guards in central
Johannesburg. Chief Buthelezi's ethnic message may be denied by the
political elite, but it has penetrated the public consciousness.
History may well condemn him for fanning ethnic flames which threaten South
Africa's democracy. Historians will certainly condemn Inkatha - and possibly
Chief Buthelezi, though his responsibility has not been proven - for
operating 'hit squads' using weapons and training allegedly provided by
Pretoria's security services. Irrespective of history's judgement, Buthelezi
is a reality; and he is doubly dangerous because he is not simply - as the
politically correct would argue - a creation of apartheid whose power
derives from apartheid structures.
Ironically, it would be more correct to say that Buthelezi is a creation of
the ANC. As ANC deputy secretary general, Jacob Zuma (the only senior Zulu
in the ANC's top leadership) explained in 1992, 'forming Inkatha was the
ANC's idea - to have a political organisation to undermine apartheid from
within'. For decades, Buthelezi did just that, refusing to accept
independence for KwaZulu, and campaigning for the release from prison of
Nelson Mandela. But when the United Democratic Front emerged in the early
1980s as de facto internal wing of the ANC, it demonised all
'collaborators', chief among them Buthelezi. The Zulu leader opposed ANC
policy on two central issues: economic sanctions and the use of guerrilla
tactics to overthrow white rule. Today there is no political leader more
despised by the ANC.
Certainly, Chief Buthelezi will lose part of his power base once an ANC
government (which will sweep Natal as a result of Inkatha's election
boycott) pays the salaries of homeland police, civil servants, and possibly
the Zulu King. But the Zulu warriors who fought in the streets of
Johannesburg on Monday were not teachers, nurses and bureaucrats. They came
from the world of migrant workers' hostels and KwaZulu villages where
tradition and loyalty to the King remain powerful forces for resistance.
No army can hope to subdue every village and kraal in rural Zululand; and
even if they do so temporarily, violence will resume once they leave. The
risk is that the battles of 1994 will store up material for resentment and
revenge for decades to come.
Yet the ANC seems unable to resist the temptation to prod the angry bear
that resides in Chief Buthelezi's soul. They know they will get nowhere by
humiliating a man whose sensitivity borders on the paranoid. They know that
any attempt to trick him will backfire because he cannot bear to be taken
for a 'stupid kaffir', as he so often points out; yet they offer him
constitutional concessions which look good but mean little, and hope he will
not notice. And most seriously of all, they think he has no true support and
can be crushed by the legitimate will of the majority. In short, for the
ANC, Buthelezi is a dictator clinging illegally to power, with no genuine
constitutional complaints and no intention to negotiate. Their conclusion:
accommodating him is not only unnecessary, but impossible.
That may be true now, but it was not always so. Even early this year, the
ANC could have had a deal with Inkatha relatively cheaply, by agreeing to
devolve real power to the provinces, rather than guarding it at the centre.
The Zulu King was then on the sidelines, and could have been assured a place
as titular monarch of Natal/KwaZulu, by guaranteeing the security of royal
lands and palaces. Only when that deal fell through did he enter the fray,
increasing tension by calling for a sovereign Zulu kingdom and commanding
his subjects to defend their nationhood.
The chances are it is too late for a deal, and further violence is
inevitable. Many would welcome his demise, in South Africa and abroad. He
has alienated almost every local and foreign friend he ever had. His
counter-productive propaganda machine has made it impossible to understand
his policies, let alone defend them. He is, quite simply, in the way:
obstructing the event millions worldwide have waited decades to see, the
death of apartheid and the birth of a new non-racial democracy. And if he
does not move, he will be removed by force - whatever the consequences.

FT  02 APR 94 / MPs summon watchdog chiefs to further meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commons committee examining financial regulation has summoned the
chairman and chief executive of the Personal Investment Authority, the new
watchdog to protect private investors, for a further session of questioning.
In a move that intensifies pressure on the regulator, which is already
facing doubts about its future, the Treasury committee will take evidence at
the end of this month from Mr Joe Palmer, PIA chairman, and Ms Colette Bowe,
chief executive.
Mr John Watts, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the MPs
wanted to discuss with the PIA some of the points that had been raised by
other witnesses questioned since the authority first gave evidence early
last month.
At the initial session the authority faced scepticism from MPs over its
plans for the admissions process and for its ability to monitor its members.
Some committee members were dissatisfied with the authority's responses, but
want to give it a chance to sound more convincing.
In a Commons debate earlier this week some MPs also expressed doubts about
Mr Palmer's credibility as chairman of the new body.
He was previously chief executive of life company Legal &amp; General, which
recently attracted a record fine for systemic non-compliance with regulatory
requirements.

FT  02 APR 94 / Amnesty urged for 'black' economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses in the so-called 'black' economy should be offered an amnesty on
their undeclared activities if they agree to enter a new low-tax sector for
innovative enterprises, the Adam Smith Institute is to propose next week.
The institute says the sector would be the economic equivalent of a
greenhouse - a sheltered part of the economy in which fledgling businesses
could grow. The think-tank, which pioneered Thatcherite policies in the
1980s, says the greenhouse would operate like an enterprise zone, but with
its exemptions applying to an economic category instead of a geographical
area.
In the same package the institute proposes the abolition of capital gains
tax and inheritance tax.
The radical proposals are intended to demonstrate continuing intellectual
dominance by the right in policy thinking. The institute will urge a boost
to the UK economy through measures to encourage small businesses and
knowledge-based companies.
'The aim should be to encourage inventiveness and innovation, not to try and
keep it under control,' says the institute.
Among the recommendations are large tax cuts for innovative small businesses
and the lifting of regulations intended for larger concerns. The aim would
be to make Britain an exploiter of ideas which other countries would pay
royalties to use.
The proposals will apppear in a list of 100 targets the Conservative party's
leading free-market campaigners believe the UK can achieve in the next 25
years. The institute will urge that the communications industry be singled
out for special treatment.
Inventors and companies with innovative products in telecommunications,
television and information networks should be encouraged to make Britain a
world leader, it believes.
The government should set a target for every home to have access to
information and entertainment through alternative transmission systems such
as terrest-rial broadcasting, cable and satellite, the institute recommends.
Achieving this would mean relaxing regulation on companies to encourage
expansion.
The institute will urge the government to continue cutting taxes and public
expenditure over the next 25 years. It will propose a target of 10 per cent
for the basic rate of tax and 20 per cent for the higher rate.
It says public expenditure should be cut to 20 per cent of GDP by the year
2020, by further privatisation and cash controls on the public sector.

FT  02 APR 94 / Child agency faces new probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The operations of the Child Support Agency may soon come under fresh
scrutiny by MPs less than three months after its working methods were
changed.
The Commons social security committee will decide shortly whether to
investigate the controversial agency.
Some Tories favour delaying such a probe until later in the year on the
grounds that the new rules have not been in effect long enough for firm
conclusions to be drawn.
Mr Frank Field, the committee's Labour chairman, is thought to be keen to
press ahead. With the issue continuing to generate a great deal of mail and
many complaints at constituency advice surgeries, it is still high on most
MPs' lists of concerns.
Although Mr John Major, the prime minister, has underlined the government's
determination not to be stampeded into ordering further changes to the rules
governing the agency, there is a widespread acceptance in Whitehall that
more fine-tuning may eventually be needed.
The changes, introduced in February, enabled absent fathers facing big
increases in maintenance payments to pay the bills in stages over 18 months
and ensured that addresses of separated parents were not disclosed.

FT  02 APR 94 / Further delay for Channel tunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Channel tunnel will not be fully opened for passenger trains until at
least September, four months after the official opening on May 6.
This will mean that the Pounds 10bn project will not be able to take full
advantage of the peak summer season, deferring still further repayment of
its debts. The ferry companies have leapt at the opportunity to boost their
revenues by increasing sailings on cross-channel routes.
Eurotunnel, operator of the 32-mile link, said the opening had been delayed
by hundreds of relatively minor problems, including difficulties with
ventilation, control equipment and the rolling stock.
The company said yesterday that the September deadline did not represent a
further delay, saying there had been confusion between the start date and
the time when services reached full capacity. It still hoped to start a
limited service to paying passengers very soon after the official opening.
Last month Mr Andre Benard co-chairman of Eurotunnel, said the tunnel would
start passenger services before the start of the summer season. He did not
give a date for the introduction for a full service.
Mr John Noulton, the company's director of public affairs, said yesterday:
'We will start passenger services as soon as possible after the official
opening. They will build up during the summer and at the end of the summer
will reach a full level of service.'
In the face of continuing delays with passenger services, Eurotunnel is
giving priority to starting its freight services, but even these may be
delayed beyond the official opening.
Mr Noulton said the company had underestimated the time it would take to
complete commissioning tests. He denied that the banks had imposed any time
limits on the testing programme or that there was any fundamental problem.
He said: 'There are thousands of trivial problems but they were the expected
difficulties. The main one was the availability of locomotives. We couldn't
do all the tests or complete the training.'
Freight and passengers trains have been running through the tunnel regularly
in recent months as part of the testing.
A planned rights issue to raise a further Pounds 500m plus a similar amount
of debt is still due to go ahead before June. Eurotunnel's interim results
will be announced on April 21.

FT  02 APR 94 / Scottish Eurocentral terminal virtually complete
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scotland's Eurocentral freight terminal for the Channel tunnel is virtually
complete at Mossend in Lanarkshire, James Buxton writes.
When the tunnel opens one freight train a day will leave Mossend with
Scottish exports. It will be split and mixed with trains from other
terminals across the UK to form new trains destined for continental Europe.
The Mossend terminal, which is near the M8 motorway and the enterprise zone
that has been created to help Lanarkshire recover from the disappearance of
its steel industry, has received a strong level of inquiries from
prospective users.
Personal-computer manufacturers and whisky companies are expected to use it
for Continental shipments.
The terminal is about 400 miles from the Channel tunnel, the distance at
which rail freight is thought to become economic compared with road.

FT  02 APR 94 / Sports clubs win big VAT rebate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sports clubs will be entitled to rebates of as much as Pounds 40m because
the government yesterday amended value added tax regulations to bring them
into line with European Union guidelines, Robert Corzine writes.
The new regulations mean that playing members' subscriptions to non-profit
sports clubs will no longer attract VAT.
The ruling is retrospective to 1990, so the government will have to
reimburse the clubs for the more than Pounds 40m they have paid in VAT on
such subscriptions during the past four years.
VAT will continue to be levied on social memberships to sports clubs.

FT  02 APR 94 / Cardinal warns Major against 'rubbishing' IRA ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cardinal Cahal Daly yesterday challenged Mr John Major's scornful rejection
of the IRA's 72-hour post-Easter ceasefire. 'I believe the opportunity
should not be passed by,' Cardinal Daly said. 'It should not be rubbished.'
Speaking less than 24 hours after the prime minister denounced the IRA's
move as 'self-serving and cynical', the Primate of all Ireland said the
ceasefire raised 'significant hope', although it was 'disappointingly
short'.
'I am afraid, respectfully, I would not agree that this is a cynical
exercise on the part of the IRA,' he added. 'The significance is that for
the first time in 20 years they have initiated this cessation of violence.
Why not test it?'
As the leaders of the three main opposition parties in the Irish republic
issued a joint peace demand to the IRA, Archbishop Robin Eames, the
Protestant Primate of the Church of Ireland, responded to the ceasefire in a
more downbeat vein.
Although any cessation was to be welcomed, he said: 'The real Christian
agenda for Northern Ireland must be written by those who see that a complete
end to violence . . . will give us the opportunity to plan the way forward
in peace and justice.'
Yesterday's developments came as the British and Irish governments
reaffirmed that the ceasefire, starting at midnight on Tuesday, falls far
short of the permanent cessation required to admit Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, to round-table talks. Sinn Fein has called for 'immediate
and direct talks' with the British government to obtain clarification of the
Downing Street declaration signed by London and Dublin last December.
Dublin has expressed 'extreme disappointment' with the IRA's response to the
declaration, with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, urging Sinn
Fein to spell out what it means by its latest clarification demand.
Underlining Dublin's growing exasperation with Sinn Fein, Mr Reynolds has
departed for a week-long holiday in Cyprus.
Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, has said he 'would not seek to
protract' any talks with the British government and emphasised that Sinn
Fein is not seek-ing negotiation, only clarification.
An IRA bomb containing 200lbs of explosives and shrapnel was made safe by
soldiers in Armagh yesterday after a day-long operation, police said.

FT  02 APR 94 / Fraud at British Council attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Council, the government-funded body that promotes UK cultural
interests overseas, has been strongly criticised by a Commons committee over
lax accounting procedures which led to a fraud costing nearly Pounds
600,000.
The cross-party Public Accounts Committee said that the fraud was one of the
biggest it had investigated, and warned that there was a risk it could
happen again.
The committee said in a report to parliament that the council paid Pounds
520,072 by electronic transfer into the overseas bank accounts of bogus
suppliers in December 1992.
Other irregularities, including fraud involving travel and subsistence
claims, brought the total losses identified in 1992-93 to Pounds 589,000.
The report said a police investigation had indicated that the main fraud was
executed by 'a criminal team' operating with inside information on the
council's payment system. Four people had been arrested, but only Pounds
19,751 had been recovered. Police inquiries had failed to establish the
source of the leak of information on the payments system.
The committee said it was 'astonished' that the council's banking section
did not check payment vouchers, documentation and signatures before paying
suppliers. It said the council had changed its procedures to prevent further
frauds, but it was 'worrying' that the source of the gang's information had
not been identified.
It said: 'There is a risk of a further leakage of sensitive information. We
emphasise the need for the council's changed and strengthened financial
processes to be proof against any further irregularities.'

FT  02 APR 94 / Fuel groups 'recycle' VAT bonus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks and building societies that have the regional electricity companies
and British Gas as customers will be among the main beneficiaries from the
rush to meet the March 31 value added tax deadline. More than 1m
householders met the deadline for making advance payments to avoid VAT on
domestic fuel.
Most of the companies have decided to deposit the advance payments with
banks and buildings societies, although they also mentioned money market
funds as possible destinations. Manweb and Northern Electric were the only
regional electricity companies to say they were still considering what to do
with the extra cash.
There have been suggestions that the advance payments could total as much as
Pounds 1bn. This will not be known until next week because of the holiday
weekend.
The companies have collected more than Pounds 663m from householders trying
to avoid VAT, which was imposed at a rate of 8 per cent from yesterday,
rising to 17.5 per cent in April next year. The Pounds 663m figure does not
take into account the final rush as Thursday's deadline approached.
British Gas reported by noon on Thursday that 2 per cent to 3 per cent of
its 18m domestic customers had made advance payments totalling Pounds 230m.
Full returns from its national network of gas showrooms will not be
available until next week, however.
If the intentions to favour banks and building societies materialise, it
will mean that much of the money will be 'recycled'.
Most consumers withdrew funds from banks or building societies to make the
advance payments, which they hope will give them an effective yield greater
than the relatively low rates on offer for savings.
Seeboard noted that its decision to deposit in building societies the Pounds
64m it received from 115,000 customers by Wednesday night meant that it was
'effectively returning' the capital.
Most electricity companies say the extra interest earned will be used to
cover the administrative and data processing expenses associated with the
imposition of VAT.
Scottish Power will donate the extra interest it receives to groups 'who
have been disadvantaged by the introduction of VAT on fuel'.
Midlands Electricity is to donate Pounds 500,000 to Neighbourhood Energy
Action to fund energy-efficiency projects for low-income households in its
area.

Meanwhile, the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist
party, said he planned to visit the US this month to 'tell the truth' about
Northern Ireland. Mr Paisley is to address the National Committee on
American Foreign Policy, which caused controversy when it invited Mr Adams
to New York.

FT  02 APR 94 / All Change - Your guide to the new British Rail: The 'train
set' costs Pounds 10m, for starters - Want to move from a miniature railway
to the real thing? Charles Batchelor explains what you will pay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The closest most rail enthusiasts get to running a railway is a miniature
lay-out in the attic or the garage. A small minority achieves the greater
reality of operating one of Britain's growing number of preserved steam
railways.
The privatisation of British Rail provides the opportunity for the real
enthusiast to run his or her own proper railway. Most of the private rail
companies are expected to be run by management buy-out teams or companies
already in other fields of transport but there should be opportunities for
smaller operators to run trains under 'open access' agreements. These are
intended to increase competition. But how affordable would it be to own and
run a modern day railway train?
Take one of the stalwarts of BR's fleet, its InterCity 125 High Speed
Trains. These are diesel-powered trains which run on lines such as London
Paddington to Wales and the West Country route. Now 18 years in service,
after initial problems these trains are now running better and more reliably
than ever, according to Mr John Cronin, BR's area fleet manager in Bristol.
A complete train set - railway jargon for a locomotive and coaches - would
set you back Pounds 10m new - about Pounds 3m for the twin locos, one at the
front, another at the back, and eight coaches at about Pounds 750,000 each.
But buying a new train is not as simple as acquiring a new car. They are
built to order and then only in production runs which make manufacturing
economic. British railway manufacturing has been dogged by relatively
short-run orders which do not allow for the continuous modification and
improvement of successful designs, Mr Cronin says.
The High Speed Trains are powered by a marine engine, chosen because it was
relatively light, thus causing less wear and tear on the track. But marine
engines are designed to run for long periods at the same speed, unlike
trains which accelerate and decelerate rapidly, so modifications had to be
made in the first few years.
It is more likely that you will lease second-hand BR rolling stock.
Comparisons with cars are difficult because leasing rates depend on mileage
and depreciation usually over two to three years, while a typical train set
will last for 30 years or more. In addition the Treasury has still to agree
the details of the leasing regime with the train-operating companies. So
leave the leasing costs out of your calculations for the moment.
Before you can take a car on on the road you need to pay road tax, or in the
case of a train, your access charge to Railtrack, which took over BR's track
and signalling on April 1. Track charges vary but the Great Western Railway
is expected to pay Pounds 120m a year. Spread that over its 36 high speed
trains and you are paying Pounds 3.3m for each one.
Fuel costs are a significant charge to the motorist and the HSTs have a
1,100 gallon tank in each power unit. A large tank is needed because each
train set only does half a mile to the gallon. Great Western declines to
reveal what it pays for its diesel, but at the average rate charged to the
private motorist a full tank will cost you just over Pounds 2,500.
Maintenance, inevitably, is costly. You can expect your locomotives to go in
for a big overhaul every 2 1/2 to three years at a cost of Pounds 180,000
including Pounds 120,000 for the diesel engines.
The two-yearly overhaul of your carriages, mainly replacing the bogies -
sets of twin axles - will cost another Pounds 100,000.
But you will also be replacing the standard components which wear out on any
vehicle at regular smaller services. Brake pads will cost you Pounds 62 a
pair plus labour to replace. This may not appear a big item but your train
set will have 160 wheels. Great Western reckons to replace nearly 26,000
brake pads a year on its fleet of 36 high speed trains.
You might think that a vehicle with metal wheels would be spared the
inconvenience of punctures, but train wheels do suffer 'flats'. These result
when a train skids, a common occurence when leaves fall on the line. This
flattens a small section of the wheel causing a bumpy ride.
The introduction of an anti-skid mechanism on the trains, akin to the
anti-brake locking systems on cars, has cut the incidence of 'flats' but
they do still occur. Regrinding wheels will cost you Pounds 200 a time.
Few motorists respray their cars completely, but trains require a regular
repaint - by hand because the large number of windows make spraying
uneconomic - to retain their looks. Expect to shell out Pounds 2,000 to
Pounds 3,000 per coach once every four years and Pounds 4,000 for a
locomotive or power car.
Keeping your paintwork looking smart between resprays is also costly. Reckon
on Pounds 250 and 1,000 gallons of water each time you stop off at the
trainwash.
You might think that the opportunity for minor 'shunts' with a vehicle which
runs on a fixed line would be very small. But collisions with animals,
suicides and debris on the line are not uncommon. Apart from a dent in the
bonnet you are likely to suffer considerable damage to the pipework and
other bits of machinery under the train. Set aside Pounds 5,000 to Pounds
10,000 for a 'nose end' replacement.
Insurance is another significant item for the car driver though you can
reduce the charges by accepting a larger 'excess.' At present BR has
catastrophe insurance which starts at Pounds 15m, meeting its own costs for
claims below that level. You would have to shop around for insurance for
your train since this is not an established sector. The private companies
considering taking over BR's operations are apparently working on
catastrophe insurance starting at Pounds 5m.
With the proper training you should be able to drive your own train, but if
you go above 110mph you must have a second driver. Drivers' basic rates
start at Pounds 210 a week but the average earnings are more than Pounds 300
a week.
BR calculates that the cost of operating an InterCity train was Pounds 16 a
mile in 1992-93. Compare this with the 45p per mile paid by the average
private motorist and 18p to 20p per mile which Fleet Car magazine calculates
for the typical business motorist driving a mid-size car.
One consolation is that the government will help you to meet your bills. It
has promised to maintain subsidies after privatisation - though the managers
considering buy-outs wonder how long the Treasury will keep up its support.
Sailing has been described as the closest thing to standing in a cold shower
tearing up Pounds 10 notes. Running a train is rather similar though the
modern enclosed cabs will at least keep you dry.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1  TRAIN OPERATING COMPANIES
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Passenger trains will be run by 25 train operating companies. These
   will ultimately be franchised to the private sector for periods
   expected to range from five to 20 years. They will employ train
   drivers, inspectors and ticket office staff. They will not own many
   assets, renting the track they use and leasing both their trains and
   stations. Some companies, such as Gatwick Express, will run a single
   line; others such as ScotRail will operate a complete network.
   Employees on April 1: 49,000
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
2  RAILTRACK
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Takes over responsibility for track, signalling and its stations. It
   will charge the passenger train operators depending on how many
   trains they run. It will maintain track, bridges and stations and
   co-ordinate the timetables of operating companies. Responsible for
   the safety of the network under the eye of the Health and Safety
   Executive. Employees April 1: 12,000
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
3  STATIONS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Railtrack will own all of the nearly 2,500 stations but will lease
   most to train operating companies. They will take over routine
   maintenance such as fixing the station clock but Railtrack will
   remain responsible for structural repairs. About 13 of the larger
   stations, including Birmingham New Street, Londons Kings Cross and
   Manchester Piccadilly, where there are greater development
   opportunities, will be let on long leases to private companies,
   probably property developers. Whoever acquired the lease would let
   the retail outlets and provide day-to-day maintenance.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
4  ROLLING STOCK LEASING COMPANIES
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Three rolling stock leasing companies will take over ownership of
   11,000 locomotives, carriages and freight wagons. They will lease
   them out to the companies operating passenger and freight services.
   At first they will only have second-hand BR rolling stock but as
   train operating companies renew their fleets they are expected to
   order new rolling stock. The rolling stock companies will ultimately
   be privatised, probably by sale to existing leasing companies or
   financial institutions. Employees on April 1: 150.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
5  INFRASTRUCTURE COMPANIES
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Railtrack will contract out maintenance of track and signalling to 14
   infrastructure service units. These are the men you see alongside the
   track in bright orange safety jackets. They carry out 'heavy' work,
   such as renewing sections of track and putting in new ballast under
   the sleepers, and the lighter work of maintaining signalling and
   electrification equipment. Employees on April 1: 33,500
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
6  MAINTENANCE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Light maintenance, such as repairing train interiors and renewing
   damaged wheels, will be carried out in workshops run by the operating
   companies but leased from Railtrack. Major overhauls of locomotives
   will be carried out by one of six heavy maintenance depots. They are
   up for sale with bids expected from rolling stock manufacturers such
   as GEC Alsthom and ABB Transportation. Employees April 1: 3,500
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
7  FREIGHT
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Three new regional companies take over responsibility for heavy
   freight operations, involving complete trainloads of bulk products
   such as coal, steel and building aggregates. The domestic carrier
   business, Freightliner, which moves container wagons from seaports to
   inland terminals will be sold off as a single unit. Haulmark, the
   international container arm, will also be sold. All freight operators
   will pay Railtrack for the use of its track and signalling.
   Employees on April 1: 13,100
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
8  PARCELS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Red Star Parcels, the express parcels business, and Rail Express
   Systems, which carry the Post Office's mail, will be sold as soon as
   possible. Employees on April 1: 1,800
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
9  THE FRANCHISING DIRECTOR
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Mr Roger Salmon, a former merchant banker, is to arrange the sale of
   railway franchises. He will negotiate with potential franchisees
   including management buy-out teams or outside buyers such as bus
   companies, airlines and shipping groups. He will decide, depending on
   the bids he receives, the length and cost of the franchise. He also
   takes on responsibility for channelling any government subsidy to the
   operating companies.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
10 THE RAIL REGULATOR
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Mr John Swift QC has the twin roles of promoting competition and
   protecting consumer interests. Encouraging greater competition will
   tend to bring fares down and could bring him into conflict with the
   franchise director, who wants to charge as much as possible for each
   franchise. If a train operator has a monopoly in a particular market,
   commuter trains into London, for example, the regulator may impose
   maximum fare levels. He must also approve agreements between
   Railtrack and the train operators.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
11 GOVERNMENT
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   The transport secretary remains in charge of overall railway policy,
   negotiates with Treasury about subsidies and has the final say over
   the building of new lines or the closure of existing ones. He also
   appoints the franchise director, rail regulator and the chairman of
   Railtrack. The Treasury will decide on the level of subsidy.

FT  02 APR 94 / All Change - Your guide to the new British Rail: Is this any
way to run a railway?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Q. Will I notice any difference under the new regime which came into force
on April 1?
A. Not at first. Railway managers are determined that passengers do not
notice any immediate changes. Timetables will be the same, train liveries
will not be altered and level of service - good, bad or indifferent - should
be unchanged.
Q. So what is the point of privatisation?
A. The aim is that over the next two to three years the old British Rail
divisions are transformed into limited companies, still owned by BR, and
finally franchised out to private bidders or management buy-out teams. As
this process builds up, you will start to see new company logos and changes
to timetables. If more enterprising management teams have their way, you
should start to receive an improved service and new marketing initiatives to
encourage more people to travel by rail.
Q. Won't this push up ticket prices?
A. Critics believe so, but railway managers say competition from the private
car, coaches and airlines means they have very little leeway to raise fares.
It would also make good economic sense for train operators to fill empty
seats outside the rush hour, so expect new discount fares for off-peak
leisure travel. One company, South West Rail, is even thinking of free
travel to reintroduce people to the pleasures of rail. The regulator is
there to see that companies with effective monopolies do not misuse their
power. But the system is untested, so the honest answer is that nobody
knows.
Q. How will the railway be able to operate efficiently in future with so
many different parties involved? It all sounds very complicated.
A. It is, but no more so than the system you are accustomed to when
travelling by air. Airlines do not own airports, frequently lease their
aircraft and often contract out maintenance. The government believes
benefits of introducing competition will outweigh the 'transaction' costs.
Critics don't agree. Once the system beds down, it probably will be accepted
as quite normal.
Q. Does the new system mean the government will no longer need to subsidise
the railway?
A. Far from it. Subsidies will continue to most of the 25 train operating
companies. In fact, the government's desire for 'transparency', identifying
which parts of the rail network need which level of subsidy, has doubled the
sums involved. The train-operating companies are now being charged the full
rate for use of track, signalling and rolling stock. Under BR, some of these
costs were not fully accounted for.
Q. What is the purpose of this?
A. It allows the government to identify the most costly lines and question
whether further subsidy can be justified.
Q. So it can close them down and nobody will complain?
A. Ultimately, yes. But do not underestimate public support for particular
lines. The government has said it does not envisage shutting down parts of
the network in the foreseeable future. In the early stages at least, train
operators will be required to maintain existing service levels.
Q. Will the railway be safe with all those newcomers trying to run trains?
A. All the train operating companies as well as Railtrack must prove to the
safety authority, the Railways Inspectorate which is part of the Health and
Safety Executive, that their systems are safe. Many of the new companies
will be run by people with a railway background while operating staff will
be drawn from the old BR and will have to meet established training and
safety standards.
Q. Who draws up the timetables under the new regime?
A. Operating companies will make their own timetable proposals with the aim
of devising schedules which attract the most travellers. Overall
responsibility for knitting them together lies with Railtrack.
Q. If competing companies all run trains through my local station who do I
go to for timetable information and to buy my tickets?
A. The main company operating on any particular route will lease the
stations from Railtrack. It will then be obliged to provide all the normal
services for travellers, including providing unbiased information on
timetables and tickets. The first practical example of this is the Gatwick
Express, which is already running as a trial or 'shadow' franchise between
Gatwick airport and London Victoria.
It says it will be scaling down its own promotional material at Gatwick and
selling its own tickets and those of its two rivals, Thameslink and Network
South Central, from the same ticket office. Just how unbiased a service the
operators provide is still open to question, but competing companies will be
watching each other closely and the rail regulator is there to intervene if
necessary.
Q. If Grandma wants to come for the weekend she will cross the territory of
three operating companies. Can she buy a through ticket or must she buy
three separate ones?
A. This point is still undecided. The government has said train operators
must accept each other's full-fare and season tickets but this takes no
account of discounted Saver, Supersaver and Apex tickets which represent 80
per cent of all tickets. The franchising director and the operating
companies are still trying to devise a solution. If multiple tickets are
needed this would almost certainly push up fares.
Q. The clock on the platform at my station has been broken for several
months. Who is now responsible for fixing it?
A. The train operator who has the lease on your local station would be
responsible for minor repairs. Structural works, such as a new roof or
rebuilding a platform, are the job of Railtrack.
Q. Will the new train companies be any better at collecting fares than BR
and at putting staff on lonely stations? My local station is often unstaffed
and I never seem to see a ticket collector.
A. BR claims to have cut back on fares avoidance by using mobile teams of
inspectors and targeting particular lines at particular times of the day or
week rather than staffing every ticket barrier. They claim their losses are
less than the 'shrinkage' suffered by retailers. BR also claims that
staffing stations has no direct link to levels of crime. It is unlikely that
the private train operators will put staff back on stations.
Q. What happens if I have a complaint?
A. You can complain to your local train operating company. If the problem is
not its fault but results from, say, track or signalling, it will be able to
put pressure on Railtrack or any other supplier. If you are not satisfied,
you can also go to your regional Rail Users' Consultative Committee. The
committees can investigate complaints and bring them to the attention of the
rail regulator.

FT  02 APR 94 / Fuel prices to come down
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gas and electricity prices 'are coming down and will continue to come down,'
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday.
Mr Heseltine decided that as head of the department he, rather than Mr Tim
Eggar, the energy minister, should take the lead role in trying to limit the
political damage caused by the imposition of 8 per cent value added tax on
domestic fuel which took effect yesterday.
Mr Heseltine accused opposition parties of spreading 'scare stories' about
energy prices. He said that since 1986, when the gas industry was
privatised, domestic gas prices had fallen 23 per cent in real terms. In the
last year alone they had fallen 4 per cent in cash terms and 6.5 per cent in
real terms.
Domestic electricity prices had fallen 6 per cent in real terms in the past
two financial years.

FT  02 APR 94 / Workers' job anxieties reduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Full-time and part-time workers were equally anxious in March about losing
their jobs, the latest MORI/IRS survey for the Financial Times shows.
Forty six per cent of full-time and part-time workers were either very or
fairly concerned about losing their jobs in the next 12 months.
The trend since the monthly series started last April has been for full-time
workers to be more anxious than part-time workers. Last month, however,
anxiety fell slightly among full-time workers and rose among part-timers.
Workers as a whole expressed more optimism about their job prospects.
Manual workers continue to be the most pessimistic although the percentage
of professional and senior managers who feel concern has climbed steadily.
Pessimism about job prospects increased consistently until July, since when
there has been much volatility.
Mr David Martin, editorial director of IRS, the independent research
organisation, said: 'Unemployment appears to be coming down, even though a
number of the jobs that are being created are part-time. However, at the
same time people hear from day to day of large-scale redundancies. This may
explain the volatility in terms of perceptions about job prospects.'
MORI had face-to-face interviews with 1,022 people aged 18 or more who work
full or part-time.

FT  02 APR 94 / Tory backs call to return shipyard to public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local leaders on Merseyside of the three main political parties are to press
the government to take the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead into public
ownership.
They want Merseyside Development Corporation, a government agency, to use a
compulsory purchase order.
The move follows the failure of CSN, the ship repairer trying to buy part of
the yard, to conclude a deal by last Thursday. That deadline was imposed by
VSEL, the Barrow submarine builder which owns Cammell Laird.
Contributory factors were concerns about immunity from future compulsory
purchase and availability of a Pounds 2m government grant to help clean the
site. However, Mr John Hale, Tory group leader on Wirral Borough Council,
puts most blame on VSEL.
Mr Hale, who is also a member of Merseyside Development Corporation's board,
said VSEL had insisted that CSN also buy Cammell Laird's construction hall
when it wanted only its three dry docks and wet basin. VSEL's asking price
has not been disclosed, but he said it was a 'grossly exaggerated price'.
What has incensed Mr Hale - and Mr David Jackson and Mr Philip Gilchrist,
Wirral's Labour and Liberal Democrat leaders respectively - is that the
government sold Cammell Laird to VSEL in 1987 for Pounds 1 provided it took
over environmental liabilities. The leaders say at least Pounds 2m of
environmental work is needed. It includes repairing river defences, clearing
dereliction, digging out contaminated ground and demolishing old buildings.
Mr Jackson said: 'We want Cammell Laird out of VSEL's hands. We do not
believe they really want anyone to buy it.' Successful development of ship
repair there might challenge VSEL as it tries to diversify from defence
markets.
VSEL refused to comment, but said meetings with interested parties were
being arranged for the week beginning April 11. The development corporation
will meet the following week to consider making a compulsory purchase order.

FT  02 APR 94 / Insurer warns on endowment policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the UK's largest insurance companies has warned customers that they
may need to increase the amount they pay into endowment policies in order to
pay off their mortgages.
Royal Life, the life insurance arm of Royal Insurance, has written to about
24,000 of its 500,000 policyholders, triggering fears that other companies
may follow suit.
The warning follows cuts in the reversionary - or annual - bonus which Royal
has paid on its 'with profits' endowments in the past two years.
The policyholders affected are those who bought so-called 'low start' 22 to
30-year policies in 1991 and 1992. Premiums are set at a low rate during the
early years of the policy. Royal stressed yesterday that customers need take
no action this year. But if bonuses remained at current levels modest
additional premiums would be necessary.
Mr Icki Iqbal of Royal Life said that following falls in inflation and
interest rates the company was taking a more pessimistic view about future
investment returns.
Royal reduced its reversionary bonus from 3.75 per cent to 3.25 per cent -
an amount annually charged on and added to the basic sum insured - in
January last year. This year a so-called 'super reversionary bonus',
calculated as a percentage of the reversionary bonus, was reduced from 5.5
per cent to 5 per cent.

FT  02 APR 94 / Rush to beat VAT on fuel nets Pounds 230m for British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 1m householders met the deadline for making advance payments to
avoid value added tax on domestic fuel, which was imposed at a rate of 8 per
cent from yesterday, rising to 17.5 per cent in April next year.
British Gas said it received advance payments totalling Pounds 230m by noon
on Thursday from 2 per cent to 3 per cent of its 18m domestic customers.
Full returns from its national network of gas showrooms will not be
available until next week, however.
There have been suggestions that the electricity companies would receive
advance payments of as much as Pounds 1bn. This will not be known until next
week because of the holiday weekend.
The companies reported the collection of more than Pounds 663m from
householders. This figure does not take into account the final rush as
Thursday's deadline approached.
Banks and building societies that have the regional electricity companies
and British Gas as customers will be among the main beneficiaries from the
rush to meet the March 31 VAT deadline. Most of the companies have decided
to deposit the advance payments with banks and buildings societies, although
they also mentioned money market funds as possible destinations.
Manweb and Northern Electric were the only regional electricity companies to
say they were still considering what to do with the extra cash.
If the intentions to favour banks and building societies materialise, it
will mean that much of the money will be 'recycled'.
Most consumers withdrew funds from banks or building societies to make the
advance payments, which they hope will give them an effective yield greater
than the relatively low rates on offer for savings.
Most electricity companies say the extra interest earned will be used to
cover the administrative and data processing expenses associated with the
imposition of VAT. Seeboard said its decision to deposit in building
societies the Pounds 64m it received from 115,000 customers by Wednesday
night meant it was 'effectively returning' the capital.
Scottish Power will donate the extra interest it receives to groups 'who
have been disadvantaged by the introduction of VAT on fuel'.
Midlands Electricity is to donate Pounds 500,000 to Neighbourhood Energy
Action to fund energy-efficiency projects for low-income households.

FT  02 APR 94 / End to output decline seen in construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction output, after declining for three consecutive years, is
expected to rise by 1 per cent this year and by a further 2 per cent next
year, one of the industry's forecasting bodies is expected to announce
today.
Construction Forecasting and Research (CFR), which previously provided
output estimates for the National Economic Development Office, says new
construction orders rose 12 per cent last year, the first annual rise since
1988.
It warns, however, that increases in output will be only modest and could
easily be upset if private-sector investment fails to compensate for
public-spending cuts announced in last November's Budget. Sixty per cent of
last year's increase in orders was generated by the public sector.
Mrs Jacquie Cannon, CFR director, said that there was little room for
complacency even though the industry was beginning to climb out of
recession. 'Continued recovery does depend on the private sector's ability
to sustain the recovery as public-sector activity tails off,' she said.
Construction and building material companies have criticised the government
for the slow pace in encouraging private investment in roads and other
infrastructure, which they say is essential to offset lower public
investment in the mid and late 1990s.
CFR said that output next year would still be 10 per cent below the 1990
peak. Competitive pressures resulting in companies taking on contracts with
little or no margin for profit were unlikely to ease, with the industry
expected to continue to suffer from over-capacity.
The forecasting panel includes directors of large construction and building
material companies, institutional investors, trade associations and public
bodies.
It expects private housing to be among the stronger performers in the next
two years. The number of new private homes started by builders is expected
to rise from 143,000 last year to 160,000 this year, and 170,000 next year.
Social housing starts, mainly by housing associations, are expected to fall
from 43,000 to 40,000 this year and 36,000 next year, reflecting the squeeze
on public spending.
Construction of infrastructure after completion of the Channel tunnel is
expected to fall by 12 per cent this year and by a further 6 per cent next
year.

FT  02 APR 94 / Ford to lift Dagenham production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford, the US carmaker, is increasing production at its assembly plant at
Dagenham, east London, in response to stronger demand in the UK new car
market.
The plant, which was a byword for poor labour relations at the end of the
1980s, has also achieved a big improvement in productivity and quality,
according to Ford.
The group is raising Fiesta car output at Dagenham from 940 to 1,000 cars a
day from May or June. It has a capacity to produce 1,240 vehicles a day, but
output fell as low as 740 a day at the bottom of the recession in late 1992.
A month ago Ford announced that it was increasing production at its plants
at Halewood on Merseyside and at Southampton.
Mr Jacques Nasser, chairman of Ford of Europe, said the Dagenham plant,
which also produces the Courier light-van ranges, had reduced the time taken
to build a car (measured in hours per car) by 45 per cent between 1989 and
1993. During the same period the cost of manufacturing Fiestas there had
fallen by 23 per cent.
Ford's UK vehicle assembly plants at Dagenham, Halewood, and Southampton
were now performing marginally better than its assembly plants in Germany in
terms of total costs, having closed the damaging competitive gap that
existed at the end of the 1980s.
Mr Nasser said the Dagenham plant had 'made huge improvements in
productivity and cost effectiveness, and has become a competitive
manufacturer of top quality products'. The turnround in its fortunes has
been dramatic and follows warnings by Ford in 1990 that its survival was in
doubt.
In 1990-91 the group launched a recovery plan to improve quality and
productivity. The strategy included simplifying the Dagenham operation by
transferring all Sierra production to Belgium, reducing the UK plant to a
single model line.

FT  02 APR 94 / NUT attacks unions in tests row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The largest teachers' union yesterday strongly attacked the two other
classroom unions in the row over ending the boycott of national curriculum
tests.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the NUT, said at the union's annual
conference in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, that its executive was unanimous
that its boycott of tests should continue for a second year and predicted
that no delegates would oppose it.
In doing so he delivered a sharp rebuff to the government's hopes of setting
its national curriculum policy back on course.
Mr McAvoy attacked the ATL and NASUWT unions, both of which have advised
their members to stop the boycott. Baroness Blatch, the education minister,
will address both their conferences later next week.
He said: 'Speakers will urge other teacher organisations to review their
position on the boycott. There's a desire on the part of the other two
organisations to snuggle up, if not to Baroness Blatch, then to the
Conservative government.' The NUT, traditionally the most leftwing teachers'
union, will consider motions to boycott the government's plans for
school-based teacher training, and to consider strike action over pay,
growing class sizes and redundancies.
Mr McAvoy indicated that the union would oppose national tests for
11-year-olds which are due to be introduced next year, saying they would be
used to select pupils for secondary schools.
His views are unlikely to sway the other two unions, although the NUT takes
heart from the policy of head teachers' organisations not to ask any other
teachers to do work boycotted by the NUT.
Strategists for the other unions fear that if the boycott continues the
government could force them to do the tests next year, through the annual
pay and conditions settlement. They believe this would not require new
legislation.
The NASUWT, which meets in Blackpool from Monday, will be visited by a
government minister for the first time in eight years. Mr Nigel de Gruchy,
its general secretary, predicted that Baroness Blatch would receive a
courteous reception.
Mr Peter Smith, ATL general secretary, said his union would also favour
abandoning the boycott.
He acknowledged, however, that some delegates would oppose his decision not
to hold a ballot on the issue.
ATL members can still legally boycott the tests if they claim this creates
too much workload. Last year's ballot in favour of a boycott still protects
them.

FT  02 APR 94 / Scottish terminal nears completion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scotland's Eurocentral freight terminal for the Channel tunnel is virtually
complete at Mossend in Lanarkshire.
When the tunnel opens one freight train a day will leave Mossend with
Scottish exports. It will be split up and mixed with trains from other
terminals across the UK, to form new trains des-tined for continental
Europe.
The Mossend terminal, which is near the M8 motorway and the enterprise zone
that has been created to help Lanarkshire recover from the disappearance of
its steel industry, has received a strong level of inquiries from
prospective users.
Personal-computer manufacturers and whisky companies are expected to use it
for continental shipments.
The terminal is about 400 miles from the Channel tunnel, the distance at
which rail freight is thought to become economic compared with road. This
advantage increases the further the trains penetrate into continental
Europe.
The terminal has been built by the Lanarkshire Development Agency - the
local enterprise company - at a cost of Pounds 8.6m.
It will be handed over to Railfreight Distribution, which will operate it.
The terminal consists of four sidings running alongside a large tarmac
expanse where containers will be moved from trailers to trains by
mobile-lift equipment. The containers will pass through the administration
block and under a gantry for a security inspection before Customs clearance.
The site is surrounded by a high security fence.

FT  02 APR 94 / Binder partners in Scotland oppose Andersen merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish partnership in BDO Binder Hamlyn, the UK's eighth-largest
accountancy firm, is set to vote against a proposed merger with Arthur
Andersen, the fourth-largest.
Mr Ian Valentine, managing partner for the firm in Scotland, said: 'As
things are, we will not go ahead. We are unable to see any strategic basis.
We have a different client base, culture and fee level. It just doesn't add
up.'
He said that he spoke on behalf of the region's 18 partners, and added: 'I
am reasonably confident that we will not be the only region in the BDO
network taking this view.'
There are 11 regional partnerships that make up Binder, of which four appear
to have come out firmly in favour of merger. The partners are expected to
vote on formal proposals in the next few days.
Andersen has said that it would be willing to proceed with the merger even
if it was just with the single partnership covering London and Leeds, which
represents more than half of fee income.
The Scottish firm has one quoted client, Prestwick Holdings, and provides
services to the subsidiaries of English-based clients.
It is believed to have received a number of approaches from other
medium-size accountancy firms, and may decide to switch allegiance if the
merger with Andersen goes ahead.

FT  02 APR 94 / Central bank chief resigns in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jaffar Hussein, governor of Bank Negara, Malaysia's central bank,
resigned yesterday after taking responsibility for losses amounting to
billions of dollars due to trading in foreign exchange markets.
Presenting its 1993 annual report on Thursday, Bank Negara disclosed that it
lost more than MDollars 5.7bn (Pounds 1.43bn) through foreign currency
transactions last year. That followed a loss of nearly MDollars 10bn in
1992.
Mr Lim Kit Siang, a Malaysian opposition leader, said that Mr Anwar Ibrahim,
Malaysia's deputy prime minister and finance minister, should also resign
and that a royal commission should be appointed to investigate the latest
losses by the central bank.
'This is the greatest financial scandal in Malaysian history,' said Mr Lim.
Bank Negara has long been known as an aggressive player in foreign exchange
markets. Mr Jaafar said he took full responsibility for the loss.
'In the absence of perfect hindsight, mistakes will be made - indeed they
were made,' he said.
Mr Jaafar said there had been inadequate monitoring of the bank's foreign
exchange activities. 'The system is put right now  .. an unfortunate chapter
in the bank's history is now closed,' he added.
Bank Negara says that the 1993 losses were caused mainly through unwinding
forward positions taken up the year before.
The bank's losses in 1992 were mainly due to the bank's ill-fated foray into
sterling, in the days before the withdrawal by Britain from the European
Exchange Rate Mechanism and the subsequent devaluation of the pound. Losses
also came through trading in the German mark.
Mr Jaafar said that all forward trading positions had now been unwound. He
said that, in future, the bank would confine itself to spot trading in
managing its international reserves.
However, Bank Negara's 1993 accounts reveal further contingent liabilities
of MDollars 1.41bn. Banking analysts also point out that, but for a steep
depreciation in the ringgit (the Malaysian dollar) during the last days of
1993, foreign exchange losses in Bank Negara's accounts would have been up
to MDollars 3bn greater.
Analysts say Bank Negara forced the ringgit to fall by more than 5 per cent
against a basket of currencies at the end of 1993 by selling large amounts
of the Malaysian currency and buying in US dollars. The move improved the
1993 accounts by raising the value of foreign currency in Malaysian dollar
terms.
However, it also tempted speculators, who felt that the ringgit was
undervalued, to charge into extensive buying of the currency.
Over the last three months, Bank Negara has introduced a series of measures
to try to force the speculators out of the market.
Bank Negara also announced a net operating loss for 1993 of MDollars 712m,
the first in the bank's history. The bank said the loss was mainly due to
the 'phenomenal cost' of mopping up excess liquidity in the market caused by
the very large inflows of foreign funds attracted by Malaysia's strong
economic fundamentals and its rapidly growing stock market.
The bank said inflationary pressures had been succesfully contained.
News of the foreign exchange losses and the resignation of the bank's
governor have overshadowed the bank's upbeat message about the Malaysian
economy.
For the sixth successive year, the economy grew in 1993 by more than 8 per
cent. The bank said 1994 'promises to be yet another good year.' It added
that Malaysia's real gross domestic product was likely to grow by 8 to 8.4
per cent.

FT  02 APR 94 / Troops move into Natal: Fear of more violence overshadows
fragile truce
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South African troop reinforcements moved into Natal province yesterday to
enforce a state of emergency, while rival parties in the province seemed to
have declared an informal Good Friday truce.
Troop numbers were small, with only 150 soldiers arriving by yesterday and
about 300 more due by tomorrow. But security force chiefs made clear that
the South African Defence Force would take charge in the province, under the
emergency declared on Thursday, and that the KwaZulu police, headed by Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi as police minister, would take orders from the SADF.
This effectively deprives the chief of the police ministry and could be a
first step towards deposing him as chief minister of the KwaZulu homeland.
So far, he has reacted with restraint, indicating he is prepared to
co-operate with the military, no doubt calculating he cannot gain by
outright defiance.
Chief Buthelezi yesterday signalled his willingness to go ahead with a peace
summit despite the Natal clampdown. He said he expected the summit would be
held next week. It is due to bring together for the first time Chief
Buthelezi, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela and South African President F W de Klerk.
Much will depend on the outcome of a meeting last night of the heads of the
SADF, the South African Police and the KwaZulu police in Natal. The future
role of the KwaZulu force was to be decided at the meeting. Mr Mandela said
on Thursday the force would be confined to barracks, but there was no
provision for this in the emergency regulations published yesterday.
These gave security forces powers to detain people without charge for up to
30 days, to use 'necessary force' to keep order and to search people and
premises without a warrant. The rules bar unauthorised military training,
prohibit display of weapons or potentially dangerous objects (including
traditional Zulu spears and fighting sticks) and set strict conditions for
rallies.
On the first day of the emergency, police said only five people were killed.
This is not an unusual number in a province where at least 300 were killed
last month. This Easter, South Africa's roads are more dangerous than its
townships; nearly 50 people have already died in traffic accidents.
In Durban yesterday, however, few people seemed to believe the truce would
last, or that the emergency would bring peace. Many fear instead a rise in
violence.

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea yesterday rejected a relatively mild statement by the UN
Security Council urging it to accept international nuclear inspections.
Pyongyang instead insisted that the issue can only be resolved through
direct negotiations with the US, as part of an attempt to win diplomatic
recognition from Washington.
The US has refused to hold discussions with North Korea until it accepts
full inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency of its seven
declared nuclear sites.
The UN on Thursday adopted the statement. It lacks the threat of sanctions
that had been sought by the US if North Korea fails to comply.
The statement arose from a compromise to gain the support of China, which
opposes sanctions. Beijing had suggested that it would veto a tougher
resolution against North Korea.
Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korea foreign minister, suggested that China would
support tougher actions if North Korea does not heed the UN demand.
AP reports from Washington: The US and South Korea, after a meeting
yesterday of Mr Han and Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, deferred a
decision on resuming joint military exercises.

FT  02 APR 94 / Fines point to paranoia ahead: Kieran Cooke charts the
aftermath of Singapore's secrets trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government officials in many countries would be delighted at a disclosure of
economic growth running to more than 4 per cent - not so in Singapore.
In a case which has intrigued and alarmed Singapore's financial community,
two business journalists and three local economists were found guilty this
week of breaching Singapore's Official Secrets Act by having disclosed a 4.6
per cent growth figure for the second quarter of 1992 before it was
officially released. The five were fined a total of SDollars 21,000 (Pounds
9,000).
'Information in Singapore is already very tightly controlled,' said a senior
representative of a foreign securities house. 'This verdict is bound to make
analysts nervous over making any predictions about Singapore's economy.
Paranoia is going to be the order of the day.'
The saga that led to what became known as Singapore's secrets trial began on
June 29 1992, when the Business Times, the island republic's leading
financial daily, accurately forecast the preliminary second-quarter 4.6 per
cent growth figure. It was officially released more than a month later.
After the paper's report had appeared, Singapore's Internal Security
Department (ISD) swung into action. Officers raided the Business Times,
seizing reporters' notebooks and files. The local offices of two financial
securities houses also received visits by the ISD. Monetary officials,
securities analysts, economists and journalists were questioned.
The government suspected a conspiracy. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's elder
statesman, hinted that certain 'pressure groups' were trying to undermine
the government.
In 1990, Mr Goh Chok Tong had succeeded Mr Lee as prime minister. Mr Goh had
hinted he wanted to bring in a more liberal, consultative regime. Mr Lee
said he doubted that the Business Times would have dared to use 'illegally
obtained or leaked official figures' if he were still prime minister.
The trial began in October last year. The accused - described by defence and
prosecution as distinguished people who had excelled in their professions -
were Mr Patrick Daniel, editor of the Business Times, Mr Kenneth James, a
senior BT reporter, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, director of the economics
department at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore's de
facto central bank, Mr Manu Bhaskaran and Mr Raymond Foo, both economists
with Crosby Securities, the regional brokerage.
Mr Chan Sek Keong, Singapore's attorney-general, who headed the prosecution,
said an important principle was at stake. 'It is that persons who have been
entrusted with classified information, of whatever nature, in their official
duties, must keep it secret.'
The prosecution said all five had colluded in disclosing the official
preliminary growth estimate: the leak had begun with Mr Shanmugaratnam and
ended in the BT article.
At times during the 42-day trial, prosecution and defence argued over
whether or not the figure had been communicated inadvertently and, if so,
whether this was an offence. At one stage, the prosecution case seemed in
danger of collapse. with the judge ruling that there was no evidence to
support the charge that Mr Shanmugaratnam had communicated the growth figure
to the two brokers. However, the judge later suggested to the prosecution
that the trial could go ahead on an amended charge against Mr Shanmugaratnam
of having put classified information at risk.
The trial's outcome poses questions about press freedom and the handling of
information in Singapore, particularly in relation to the country's declared
aim of becoming a main global financial centre.
Singapore's Official Secrets Act lets the government classify almost any
piece of unreleased information as secret.
The attorney-general had said during the trial that communicating classified
information 'unintentionally, recklessly or in any other way' constituted a
crime. The defence argued that this gave the authorities carte blanche to
prosecute anyone - from senior officials who had unintentionally released
classified data to newspaper readers who saw such material. 'If documents
containing classified information are blown by the wind and land in
someone's else's hand, this could be seen as a crime,' said the defence.
Singapore's press is already tightly controlled and few doubt that the
convictions will make journalists more nervous, particularly about
investigating the workings of government.
Mr Daniel admitted during the trial that, by publishing the figure, he knew
he could possibly be breaching the Act. But he said that most analysts at
the time seemed to be overestimating economic growth and so to publish only
their figures would give the wrong impression. 'I wanted to give a correct
assessment of the economic performance up to June 1992,' said Mr Daniel.
The Singapore government takes a very different view. 'The government will
not allow anyone to use the excuse of 'aggressive reporting' or the needs of
'the information age' to divulge classified information,' said a senior
official.

FT  02 APR 94 / India takes further steps to liberalise trade policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
India has announced further liberalisation of its trade policy, including
the easing of rules on the import of second-hand capital goods and the
removal of import bans on certain electronic components to help the assembly
of finished goods in India.
Mr Pranab Mukherjee, commerce minister, announced the changes on Wednesday
and Thursday. He hoped exports in the 1994-95 year, starting this month,
would grow by more than the 21 per cent increase recorded in the first 11
months of 1993-94, the latest period for which figures are available.
The minister disclosed that exports in the 11 months to February soared to a
record Dollars 19.8bn (Pounds 13.4bn), whereas imports grew much more
slowly, by just 1.8 per cent to Dollars 20.3bn, leaving a trade deficit of a
mere Dollars 500m.
Agricultural exports grew particularly fast, boosted by liberalisations of
last March. The textiles and gems and jewellery industries also performed
strongly, said Mr Mukherjee.
This week's liberalisation measures were less radical than expected.
Ministers had discussed a limited lifting of India's long-standing ban on
the import of most kinds of consumer goods.
But the government has backed away from this move, apparently out of concern
that such a large gesture might fuel opposition campaigns against further
liberalisation.
The ruling Congress (I) party has been under attack for having accepted the
outcome of the Uruguay Round talks of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
In a parliamentary debate this week, opposition MPs accused the government
of having caved in to pressure from developed countries which, they said,
stood to gain more from the proposed agreement than does the developing
world.
The measures announced include the removal of a maximum age for imported
second-hand capital goods. The rules on duty-free export-processing zones
are being relaxed to permit activities including trade repair and
reconditioning, as well as manufacturing. This could, for example, enable
Indian companies to establish workshops for repairing goods from abroad.
The list of banned import items is being pruned, though less heavily than
last year. As well as certain electronic components, imports of samples for
product development are to be allowed, as are imports of outboard motors for
fishing vessels.
Schemes by which exporters can import components and other goods to be put
into exports are to be simplified. The government is establishing a new
category of 'super star trading houses' - companies whose exports are so
large that they will qualify for further exemptions from the rules.
The new measures are incorporated into the government's five-year trade
policy plan for 1992-97.
Despite all the liberalisation of the last three years, this still runs to
two volumes and 1,182 pages in all.

<TEXT>
Thailand's government suffered a humiliating defeat in parliament yesterday
when right-wing opposition parties and the military-dominated senate threw
out its plans to reform the constitution and make the political system more
democratic.
The defeat raised questions about the ability of Mr Chuan Leekpai, the prime
minister, to hold together his five-party coalition. The government was
elected in 1992 with a mandate to strengthen democracy, after 50 people were
killed in an uprising that overthrew a pro-military government.
Among those who voted against Mr Chuan's government, in a joint session of
the lower house and senate, were Gen Wimol Wongwanich, army
commander-in-chief, and Mr Vijit Sookmark, defence minister.
A government spokesman described the defeat as 'a bad situation'. Dealers on
the Thai stock exchange marked down share prices for the third day running.
The SET index fell 7.46 points yesterday to close at 1,232.53.
But Mr Chuan insisted that parliament would not be dissolved. 'There have
been attempts to topple my government by the group of people who want to
return to power,' he told reporters.
The senators, who were appointed by a military junta after a coup d'etat in
1991, joined with opposition members of parliament to push through their
own, hastily prepared, batch of constitutional amendments while blocking the
government's version.
Senators were particularly incensed by the government's plan to make the
senate more accountable and reduce the number of its members to 120 from
270. The government wanted - among its other, less controversial, amendments
 -to lower the national voting age from 20 to 18.
The counter-proposals drawn up by the opposition alliance are regarded by
most Thais as a way to undermine the government rather than a serious
attempt to reform the constitution.
Pro-democracy activists who joined the uprising against the armed forces in
1992 are now in confusion. They oppose attempts by the armed forces and
their allies to increase their influence but are also frustrated by Mr
Chuan's slow progress. He is accused, among other shortcomings, of failing
to solve Bangkok's traffic problems.
During 1992, the Thai media divided Thai politicians into pro-democracy
'angels', such as Mr Chuan, and pro-military 'Satans'. But Mr Sukhumbhand
Paribatra, a prominent academic and political commentator, said after the
government's defeat this week that parliament should be dissolved and new
elections held. He remarked: 'Now all MPs are Satans.'

Russian coal miners threatened yesterday to stage an all-out strike from

government. About 500 miners' representatives from across the country
adopted a resolution calling for an indefinite strike unless the government
honoured a promise to pay money owed for salaries. Deputy Prime Minister
Alexander Shokhin had promised to grant the coal mining industry 1,200bn
roubles (Pounds 465m) this month to cover salaries.

Singapore yesterday expressed regret that the US embassy had again
questioned the judgment of local courts in the case of an American teenager
sentenced to be lashed for vandalism. After an appeal against the youth's
sentence failed on Thursday, the acting US ambassador described the penalty
as excessive 'for a youthful non-violent offender who pleaded guilty'.
In dismissing the appeal Chief Justice Yong Pung How said that 18-year-old
Michael P. Fay committed acts of vandalism 'relentlessly and wilfully'. He
pleaded guilty on March 3 to two charges of vandalism, which involved
spraying paint and tossing eggs at private cars last September. Three
strokes of a bamboo cane across the bare buttocks are mandatory under
Singapore law for each vandalism charge.

Mr Maurice Doyle, the governor of Ireland's central bank, is to step down at
the end of this month having completed a seven-year term of office. The
Department of Finance said yesterday that Mr Doyle was not seeking
reappointment for a second term, but gave no indication of who might replace
him. Mr Doyle, 62, has built a reputation of being a strong and forthright
governor, quick to assert the bank's independence.
He had also spent 30 years working in the Department of Finance, and was its
top civil servant for six years. He has been one of the key figures behind
Ireland's 'strong punt' policy, pursued by successive governments since the
late 1980s, which together with sharp cutbacks in government borrowing over
the same period has helped bring Ireland's inflation rate (1.6 per cent in
1993) down to one of the lowest in the EU. The next governor will oversee
the separation of the London and Dublin stock exchanges, tentatively
scheduled for later this year.

Any US move to strip China of its Most Favoured Nation trading status, due
to human rights concerns, could have 'disastrous' consequences for both
nations, a World Bank study warned. It said Chinese exports to the US could
be cut by 42-96 per cent if President Bill Clinton decided not to renew MFN
status for China in June. American consumers could also pay Dollars 14bn
(Pounds 9.5bn) a year more for costlier substitutes for Chinese products. Mr
Clinton last year demanded significant progress from China on human rights
as a condition for renewing trade benefits this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday detained its most prominent dissident for the second time in
a month, thus risking further inflaming international criticism of its human
rights behaviour. Police seized Wei Jingsheng, the pro-democracy activist,
as he was travelling by car from the port city of Tianjin to Beijing. He was
'exiled' to Tianjin last month during the visit to China of Mr Warren
Christopher, the US secretary of state.
Mr Wei, 44, was held for 30 hours last month on the eve of Mr Christopher's
arrival in Beijing before being sent to Tianjin. China's crackdown on
political dissent in the past month, including the arrests of more than a
dozen activists, has been condemned internationally. The arrests coincided
with indications of growing official nervousness over dissident activity and
signs of industrial unrest.
In a mildly worded reaction, the US said it had asked its embassy in Beijing
to check reports of Mr Wei's detention. 'If true, we regret that the Chinese
government has taken this further step to harass Wei and urge that he be
released,' the State Department said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The influential Greek lobby in the US appears to have had some success in
slowing down the Clinton administration's announced plan to proceed to full
diplomatic relations with the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.
While the State Department has continued to insist this week that an embassy
would eventually be established in Skopje following the decision to
recognise Macedonia despite Greek objections, it declined substantive
comment on an apparently well-sourced column by Mr Jim Hoagland in the
Washington Post. This pointed to a critical White House meeting on March 9,
which brought together President Bill Clinton, Vice-President Al Gore, and
national security adviser Tony Lake with a Greek-American delegation, led by
Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland.
Mr Hoagland quoted a satisfied member of the delegation as asserting that Mr
Clinton said he had already decided not to go ahead and open an embassy
until progress was made in the Greece-Macedonia dispute. The president's
thinking was reported to be in accord with that of the Greek government.
The State Department, which has been critical of Greece's behaviour towards
Macedonia, was not represented at the meeting. But Mr George Stephanopoulos,
the senior adviser who is the son of a Greek Orthodox priest, was. Mr
Hoagland also saw the influential hand of Ms Nancy Soderberg, a member of Mr
Lake's staff, in the president's reported decision.
Mr Victor Comras, the diplomat reportedly in line to be ambassador to
Macedonia, may be despatched, but only as head of a diplomatic liaison
office.

FT  02 APR 94 / Japanese score a victory for consumers' rights: But there
are still doubts about the impact of a planned new product liability law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The legal victory this week of a small construction company over Matsushita,
the electronics giant, in a unprecedented product liability case has raised
hopes in Japan that consumers have finally won their day. The Osaka district
court ruled Matsushita was responsible for a fire that started in a
Matsushita-made television set at the construction company's office.
But in Japan, where corporate interests generally prevail over the rights of
individuals, any celebration of consumer victory is tempered with caution.
'We welcome the ruling but are worried it could send the wrong message to
consumers that the law will help them more than will actually be the case,'
says Ms Yoko Tomiyama, head of the Consumers' Union.
The same goes for a new product liability bill being drawn up by the
government and expected to be enacted in 1995. The legislation, which
follows nearly two decades of debate, is to give consumer legal protection.
But it has been undermined by pressure by industry and the previous
government.
The draft bill to be presented to the Diet this month has been criticised as
weak and full of loopholes. Critics say it could be worse than present
legislation. Currently, consumers have to negotiate directly with a
manufacturer or launch negligence actions.
But Mr Hideki Sugiura, a lawyer specialising in product liability cases,
says that in Japan, courts gives people little room for doubt in proving
they were hurt by a product defect. 'The Matsushita case was an exception
among exceptions.'
Under Japanese law it has been difficult for consumers to win product
liability cases because they have to prove not only that the defective
product caused damage, but also that the manufacturer produced the defective
product intentionally or accidentally.
There have been only 127 product liability cases between 1949 and 1991,
according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
The draft bill is based on a report of the prime minister's Social Policy
Council, which largely reflects the views of ministries, industry and
academics. It has drawn criticism from consumer groups and lawyers.
Critics say that, as it stands, it favours industry over consumers. It would
let manufacturers plead innocence on the grounds that danger could not be
predicted in the light of technical standards at the time. This provision
was included to answer concerns that strict liability rules would hamper
manufacturers' drive to develop new products.
At the same time, while access to crucial corporate information would still
be severely restricted, the draft bill requires the party seeking damages to
pinpoint where exactly the defect is located. The bill further exempts a
number of products, such as buildings and certain vaccines from liability.
Critics also charge that the rule holding manufacturers liable for only 10
years after a product is put on the market, restricts consumers' ability to
win cases, particularly where drugs are concerned.
Mr Sugiura believes that the worst of the proposals is the requirement that
the term 'defect' be strictly defined. This, he argues, helps manufacturers
to prepare for the possibility of liability. 'If that is included, it would
be worse than not having a PL law at all,' he warns.
Critics also say the proposals fall short of legislation protecting
consumers in the US. 'At first we were worried that the Japanese law would
be as diluted as that in parts of the European Union, but now we are worried
that it will be worse,' says Ms Tomiyama of the Consumers' Union.
If the proposed bill goes through as it stands, it will be firm testimony to
the strength of industry's voice in the government.
But Mr Sugiura is still hopeful. The governing coalition has set up a
product liability project team which has mainly lawyers as its members. This
group is trying to get the Social Policy Council's proposals reviewed,
particularly on the definition of defects, and will have a significant
influence over the final form of the bill. 'That is something different from
the previous government and offers hope for the bill,' he says.

<TEXT>
Israel has agreed to allow a first contingent of 300 to 400 Palestinian
policemen to be deployed in the Gaza Strip early next week in the first
vestige of Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories.
Israeli and PLO officials will resume intensive negotiations in Cairo
tomorrow on the final aspects of the much-delayed 'Gaza-and-Jericho-first'
Palestinian self-rule deal, with a view to reaching agreement within two
weeks.
The intensified activity follows Thursday's breakthrough when Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organisation concluded a deal for the deployment of a
160-strong international observer force in Hebron, to serve as protection
for the Palestinians there in the wake of February's Hebron mosque massacre.
The force will comprise 90 Norwegians, 35 Danes and 35 Italians - 60 of them
lightly armed for their 'personal protection.' The mandate is for three
months but can be extended if both sides agree.
In Tunis, PLO officials said they hoped Israel could complete its
militarywithdrawal from Gaza and Jericho by April 13, as originally
scheduled in the declaration of principles the two sides signed last
September in Washington.
'The Israelis know how important this date is and we will insist on it very
hard,' said Mr Marwan Kanafani, an adviser to Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO
chairman.
PLO Officials in Cairo said they believed the two sides were close to
announcing the date for an Israeli withdrawal. But they would not confirm
remarks by a PLO official in Jordan that Israel had already agreed to begin
withdrawal on April 12 and complete the pullout by April 30.
Mr Nabil Shaath, the chief PLO negotiator, said after the Cairo deal was
reached that it marked 'a renewed commitment to finish by the target dates'.
PLO and Israeli officials have emphasised during last week's talks that the
Hebron massacre and events since have heightened the need to speed
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho deal.

<TEXT>
For the first time in 12 years Germany recorded a trade surplus of DM1.8bn
(Pounds 700m) with Latin America during the first nine months of 1993,
helped by a 56 per cent increase in exports to Brazil and a 17 per cent drop
in imports. Prospects for the continent improved dramatically with a net
capital inflow of about Dollars 50bn last year, of which Dollars 17.5bn
comprised direct foreign investments, according to figures from the
Deutsch-Sudamerikanische Bank, a part of Dresdner Bank.
German exports to Latin America rose by just over 6 per cent to DM11.2bn
while its exports worldwide fell almost 13 per cent. Weak prices for coffee,
copper and other commodities caused the sharp fall in imports. Plant and
machinery made up about a third of exports to Brazil where a surge of almost
5 per cent in GDP wiped out a traditional German trade deficit with Latin
America. Exports to Colombia and Paraguay also rose, while shipments to to
Mexico dropped 6 per cent.

The United Nations is considering the despatch of 800 Ukrainian peacekeepers
to Gorazde, the besieged Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, a UN official
said yesterday.
The move comes as Serb attacks on Gorazde, a UN-designated safe area, have
left 30 people dead and 132 wounded since Monday. By contrast, Serbian media
reported that an all-out Moslem offensive was under way as the two sides
fought pitched battles in the fiercest clashes since the war began in April
1992. UN officials said some of the Serb attacks may have been in response
to Bosnian government 'infantry probes'.
The UN was also considering the deployment of reinforcements for the French
peacekeeping contingent in Bihac, in Bosnia's north-western Moslem area,
where Serb and Bosnian forces yesterday signed a ceasefire, said a senior UN
official. The plans for bolstering the peacekeeping forces in Bosnia follows
approval by the UN Security Council on Thursday of an extra 3,700 troops and
advisers.

FT  02 APR 94 / Hosokawa comes under mounting fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A group of parliamentarians travelled in pouring rain yesterday to the home
town of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, to inspect his
ancient mansion in Kumamoto, southern Japan.
The opposition Liberal Democratic Party members were trying to disprove Mr
Hosokawa's claim that he used a Y100m (Pounds 653,000) loan from the Sagawa
Kyubin trucking company to mend his gate and walls.
They allege the prime minister instead used the money to secure his
candidacy for gubernatorial elections in 1983.
Revelations that Sagawa bribed politicians for favours helped to bring down
the long-ruling LDP last year, enabling Mr Hosokawa to take power.
In the latest offensive, LDP and communist parliamentarians are blocking Mr
Hosokawa's Y73,080bn (Pounds 477.4bn) budget for the business year which
started yesterday.
They are refusing to allow deliberations on the budget until the prime
minister brings in his former secretary to testify before parliament and
proves that he repaid the loan to Sagawa.
The situation is beginning to resemble that of 1989, when Mr Noboru
Takeshita was forced to resign as prime minister over links with the Recruit
stocks-for-favours scandal in exchange for passage of the annual budget
bill.
The wrangling is getting more public attention than Mr Hosokawa's handling
of trade tensions with the US or the faltering domestic economy.
Economic implications of the budget boycott are severe. A provisional budget
for the first 50 days passed through the upper house last night, but lack of
a full budget jeopardises planned tax cuts that are the centrepiece of Mr
Hosokawa's package aimed at reviving the economy.
Some members of Mr Hosokawa's coalition are even suggesting that the prime
minister give in to the opposition demands, since they believe LDP scrutiny
can only damage his credibility.
The purchase of 300 Nippon Telegraph and Telephone shares by the prime
minister's father-in-law in 1986 is also being questioned by the LDP.
Mr Hosokawa supplied the collateral for loans to buy the shares, but he has
denied any involvement in the purchase.
While stock purchases by politicians are not illegal, Mr Hosokawa's
continued denials, in spite of claims by a stock consultant that he had
arranged the deal for the prime minister, has made the issue an ideal target
for the opposition parties.
Some political analysts believe that, as much as they would like to, the LDP
does not have the clout to force Mr Hosokawa to resign. 'They can only drag
him through the mud,' says Mr Jeff Young, political analyst at brokers
Salomon Brothers in Tokyo.
But Mr Hosokawa's image as a clean politician dedicated to reform has been
tarnished and his popular support is declining. Until now, his high ratings
in the opinion polls have provided bargaining power and helped bolster his
political position. Already, the prime minister's opponents are taking
advantage of that dwindling support.

FT  02 APR 94 / Kantor presses Gatt over workers' rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US has given its strongest warning to date that continuing refusal by
other countries to discuss workers' rights will undermine US support for the
Uruguay Round trade accords due to be signed in Marrakesh on April 12-15.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, has written to Mr Peter
Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
warning: 'Failure to address the labour standards issue at Marrakesh will
severely undermine the broad political support that has developed for the
Uruguay round results in the US.'
The US wants ministers to examine the link between workers' rights and the
world trading system when they meet to sign the Uruguay Round agreements.
It is backed strongly by France and Canada, and with reservations by the
European Union. Opponents argue that the workers' rights issue is either a
form of disguised protectionism by developed countries or that it is
inappropriate to link the issue with trade.
But Mr Kantor, a former union lawyer, has a personal commitment to the
issue, as does President Bill Clinton. Mr Mark Anderson, an official of the
AFL-CIO union organisation, said: 'Congress would take it very seriously if
we come back from Marrakesh empty-handed.'

FT  02 APR 94 / German interest rate cuts urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German economy is so weak that further interest rate cuts are essential,
and the government must also act to encourage job creation and prevent
further contraction in domestic demand, a top Deutsche Bank executive has
warned.
The Bundesbank, the central bank, need have no fear of prompting a rise in
the US dollar and thus fuelling imported inflation, Mr Ulrich Cartellieri
told the bank's annual press conference.
Nor need it worry about disturbing European exchange rates to the
disadvantage of German exporters.
Mr Cartellieri, the main board director responsible for foreign exchange and
the economics department at Germany's biggest private sector bank, said the
weakening dollar was virtually an 'invitation' to rate cuts.
Every German rate reduction would be fully followed by European neighbours,
he added.
Other conditions were also favourable. Inflation was falling, and the recent
annual pay round had resulted in the lowest wage increases since
introduction of the D-Mark in 1948.
Meanwhile, the economy remained weak. Unemployment would increase by around
500,000 to 4.5m this year. Exports might increase 5 per cent, but that would
not compensate for last year's 10 per cent drop.
Nor was there any chance of internal improvements, Mr Cartellieri claimed.
Private consumption would fall at least 1 per cent this year and drop again
in 1995 on the introduction of a 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge and new
nursing care insurance contributions.
Stating his case against a background of rising optimism in industry, he
said false conclusions should not be drawn from the apparent improvement in
company profits.
This was due to reduced one-off costs for restructuring rather than a real
upswing, he claimed.
No one should count on increased investment. 'Even stagnation at last year's
extremely low level could be counted as a success in 1994.'
Expectations of 1 per cent economic growth in western Germany this year were
based entirely on improved exports and special factors prompting a boom in
house building.
Government forecasts of 1.5 per cent pan-German growth were based on 'rather
optimistic' assumptions, he said.

FT  02 APR 94 / Air France to canvass support from workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Christian Blanc, chairman of Air France, is to seek a vote of support
from the company's 40,000 staff in an attempt to push through a recovery
plan which he says is vital for the airline's survival.
Mr Blanc's decision to launch a referendum on his recovery package follows
his failure to win the backing of trade unions for the plan. By Thursday's
deadline, only six of the airline's 14 unions had signed the restructuring
programme, which aims to increase productivity by 30 per cent over the next
three years through 5,000 job cuts, a wage freeze and promotions, and other
efficiency measures.
Mr Blanc, who has threatened to resign if the plan is rejected, called for a
'clear and massive' response to help save the state-owned carrier, which
suffered an estimated loss of FFr7.5bn (Pounds 880m) last year and has debts
of almost FFr40bn. A capital injection of FFr20bn from the state is
conditional on staff support for the plan.
Results of the referendum will be announced on April 11.
Mr Blanc's chances of success in the poll have been boosted by the support
of Force Ouvriere, the largest of the airline's unions, which played a key
role in the wave of strikes which scuppered a previous rescue plan last
October.
The failure of the plan prompted the resignation of Mr Bernard Attali, then
chairman of the airline, and represented a serious setback for Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur's centre-right government.
Force Ouvriere said a ballot of its members had resulted in 90 per cent
support for the restructuring package.
The second and third largest unions at Air France, however, refused to
accept the restructuring package. Mr Raymond Besco, general secretary of the
communist Confederation Generale du Travail, said the referendum 'does not
respond to the fundamental problems of the airline'. But he added that the
union was not advising members how to vote.
The Confederation Francaise Democratique du Travail, the third largest
union, also rejected the plan. 'The measures represent, in a different form,
those which were massively rejected during the conflict last October,' said
Mr Francois Cabrera, a union official.

FT  02 APR 94 / Belgian drive to sweeten chocolate sales: How hopes are
being pinned on exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One company is so secretive that it refuses to reveal how many Easter-eggs
it makes. Another recently sent out spies to test the quality of a
competitors' truffles. A third is quietly plotting to usurp a rival's royal
seal.
As Europe prepares to embark on its annual Easter-egg binge, Belgium's
luxury chocolate sector is bubbling with some serious business battles.
Faced with a domestic market that is almost saturated, after a decade in
which total domestic chocolate production has more than doubled to some
300,000 tonnes, its luxury chocolate makers are now gearing up for an export
drive.
It is a battle, however, that is provoking soul searching, particularly
among the small - and highly secretive - band of traditional chocolate
makers, who have been the source of Belgian's luxury chocolate fame.
Although most recognise that their best hope of expansion will be through
export, some fear this could eventually cost them their independence.
'It is a difficult situation. We want to export. But if we lose the quality
we are in danger of losing our name,' explains Mrs Miriam Wittamer, a
third-generation traditional chocolate shop owner - a business where
white-robed workers still dip chocolate rabbit moulds by hand before filling
them with pralines made to a closely guarded recipe.
Their fears have been fuelled by change. Belgium's largest mass market
chocolate producer, Cote D'Or, has been gobbled up by the Swiss company
Jacobs Suchard, and Godiva - Neuhaus's main rival in the mass-produced
luxury market - is now part of the US group Campbell Soup.
These changes have spurred the luxury end of the market into action. Godiva,
which started as a family business in 1927, now splits its production
between the US and Belgium and records a turnover of about BFr1bn (Pounds
19m) a year, with more than 50 per cent of its sales now export-driven.
'Export is where the main growth is now. The Belgians already eat a lot of
chocolate - it's hard to get them to eat any more,' says Mr David Johnston,
European manager of Godiva. Although Belgian chocolate has enjoyed a higher
prominence in the Anglo-Saxon world - exemplified by Haagen-Dazs' recent
decision to use its name in the luxury ice-cream brand - the main challenge
now, he says, is boosting recognition among German and French consumers.
Neuhaus, the oldest chocolate house and one of the few large ones still
entirely Belgian-owned, saw its profits rise by 10 per cent last year, to
reach a turnover of BFr1.1bn, after a period of stagnation in the 1980s. It
has recently opened 120 foreign outlets and conducts 30 per cent of its
business outside Belgium.
Meanwhile, the secretive Leonidas group, which is controlled by a Greek
family, is estimated to have a turnover of about Dollars 86m (Pounds 58.9m),
controlling half the luxury 'praline' chocolate market in Belgium with a
network of some 1,600 independent overseas distributors.
But most of the tiny, traditional chocolate makers, who continue to produce
the most exclusive Belgian chocolates, are still struggling to find their
own export networks, hampered by their small levels of production and
problems of distributing a product whose shelf-life is rarely longer than a
few weeks.
Some believe their best hope would be through the duty free or mail order
business. Meanwhile, others admit they have already had bigger players
sniffing at their doors.
'There is a danger that some artisans could be taken over,' explains Mrs
Sanne Lamberty, owner of Mary, a traditional Brussels chocolate maker, who
enjoys the coveted right to supply to the Belgian royal court. 'But the fact
is we do not want that at all.'

FT  02 APR 94 / Hungary wary of debt swap deal: Russia aims to cut Dollars
900m arrears with innovative package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Moscow yesterday agreed to offer stakes in Russian ventures as part of an
innovative settlement of the country's Dollars 900m (Pounds 616.4m) trade
debt with Hungary, the former Soviet satellite.
In Budapest this week a Russian delegation, led by Prime Minister Victor
Chernomyrdin, presented a list of 80 privatisation projects in which
Hungarian participation was invited.
Mr Bela Kadar, Hungarian minister of international economic relations, said
Hungarian companies were pressing for shareholdings in the Russian energy,
vehicle manufacturing and pharmaceutical sectors.
The minister calculated that Hungary's proposals implied a debt-for-equity
deal worth up to Dollars 500m but cautioned: 'We have to harmonise Hungarian
demand and Russian supply.'
Budapest will be aware of the limited success so far of debt-for-equity
swaps with Russia. Skoda Plsen, the Czech engineering company, last year
pressed for shareholdings in Russian rolling stock companies in exchange for
trade debt, without success.
Nevertheless Hungary said it had little choice. A Foreign Ministry spokesman
said: 'If there is this debt, we have to use it.'
The Russian deal with Hungary is the mirror image of the situation in the
former Soviet Union, where Russia is the creditor, attempting to retrieve
debts from other former Soviet republics.
Russia last month pushed for ownership in Ukrainian underground gas storage
tanks and gas transit pipelines as part of a debt settlement with Kiev. In
the former Soviet Union, Russian demands for equity in the energy industry
are also seen as an effort to regain economic influence.
To pay off the remainder of the arrears to Hungary by the agreed deadline of
1996, Russian enterprises may also assist in the construction of Budapest's
fourth metro line as well as supplying military equipment.
Any arms sales would be in addition to the deal last year whereby Hungary
acquired 28 Mig-29 fighter aircraft, spare parts and ammunition worth
Dollars 800m from Russia.
When east European countries closed the books on their trade under the
Comecon system in 1992, Russia carried over a debt of Dollars 1.7bn with
Hungary. Nearly half of that outstanding balance was cleared last year and
yesterday's deal settled much of the remainder, at least in principle.
Claims carried over from the previous trading system have proved a constant
factor, and often irritant, in relations between Moscow and the former
Soviet satellites.
Russia paid off some of its debt to Slovakia last year by delivering five
Mig-29 aircraft. Moscow and the Czech Republic have not come to terms.

FT  02 APR 94 / Balladur's rocky road to the Elysee: The PM's presidential
hopes have been undermined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's latest climbdown, over youth wage cuts,
has triggered a period of political instability that will probably last
until next May's presidential election.
Supporters of Mr Jacques Chirac, Mr Balladur's rival for the Elysee, now
smell blood. The triumphant students and the revived left-wing opposition
have been crowing their victory over the prime minister, but more dangerous
have been the calls for ministerial resignations coming from within the RPR
Gaullist party to which Mr Balladur belongs, but which Mr Chirac heads.
Most of the fire is directed at Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister, who
only a few days ago was claiming the government would stand as solidly in
defence of its youth wage law as the French army did against the Germans at
Verdun. But as the 'Chiraquiens' know well, Mr Giraud's successive
tergiversations on employment policy are also those of his prime minister,
and therefore the latter cannot decently sacrifice him without jeopardising
further his own credibility.
In terms of social unrest, the worst may be past for Mr Balladur.
Calm may now return to the streets, though this is not certain if Air France
staff take a page out of the students' exercise book and reject the
government-supported restructuring for the ailing airline. As far as the
economy is concerned, the worst is probably past too.
Economic activity is continuing its very slow, but progressive, recovery
from last year's trough. But the sight of a dejected Mr Balladur marking his
first anniversary at the Matignon with a humiliating retreat has reinforced
the feeling of many in the RPR party machine that they should stick with
their founder-president, Mr Chirac, for 1995.
So, whatever happened to Mr Balladur, the self-styled reformer riding so
high in the polls? In a document designed to vaunt the achievements of his
first year, the prime minister himself identifies his three problems.
'Public opinion which both desires and recoils from reform.' Mr Balladur had
little problem with some reforms, notably giving the Bank of France
independence in setting monetary policy and in launching his privatisation
programme, though he has made the task of preparing more state companies for
sale harder this week by extending until the end of the year his freeze on
public sector redundancies.
But on educational and labour reform, he has hit nothing but trouble, even
though some reform is long overdue; parts of the employment law, which was
passed last autumn but which has taken such a battering since, are designed
to overhaul labour legislation dating back to the Popular Front in 1936-7.
The upshot has been to reinforce Mr Balladur's natural caution, with the
inevitable result that the pace of reform will be slowed in endless
consultations.
'The economic situation, even if it improves, deprives us of the necessary
budgetary and social room for manoeuvre.' Latterly, Mr Balladur has seemed
to be paying scant attention to his budgetary constraint as he has
successively bought off French farmers, state school teachers, fishermen,
and now - in a manner of speaking - students. His FFr1,000-FFr2,000 (Pounds
117-Pounds 235) a month subsidy to employers giving young people their first
job may cost FFr6bn this year.
At the same time Mr Balladur has pledged to rein in steadily public spending
in order to fit France for the future disciplines of European monetary
union. This task is rendered more difficult by his decision, with an eye to
running in 1995 on a strong defence platform, to raise slightly military
equipment spending.
Where is his political 'hush' money to come from? Privatisation is the
obvious, but not inexhaustible, source now that Mr Balladur has postponed
the sale of Renault.
Mr Balladur is known to be frustrated at the Bank of France's cautious
policy on interest rates, and must therefore have been pleased when the
central bank on Thursday sliced another 0.1 point off its intervention rate
to bring it down to 5.9 per cent. Though he would never say so publicly, he
is almost certainly in agreement with the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development's recent call for French rates to come down
further and faster.
'The presidential election campaign is weighing too early on people's
minds.' Mr Balladur could, of course, deal with this problem simply by
announcing that he is not a candidate for the Elysee, leaving the pundits
only the minor pleasure of speculating about which Socialist candidate
(probably Mr Michel Rocard) gets to be beaten by Mr Chirac.
No one who saw Mr Balladur look so demoralised this week would rule such an
announcement out. But next week he is visiting China.
All his forays, unusual for a French prime minister, into foreign and
defence policy indicate his persistent interest in the ultimate prize in
French politics.
No one knows how the Balladur-Chirac rivalry will play out, in the probable
absence of any clean-cut mechanism like a US-style primary election taking
place in France. One theory has it that only by climbing back in the opinion
polls to where he was last year - which now seems improbable - can Mr
Balladur displace Mr Chirac's natural hold over the RPR.
But Mr Balladur has one ace - the centre-right UDF party among which he is
more popular than among his own Gaullist ranks. If the UDF were to tell the
RPR that the French right must field a single candidate, so as to avoid past
divisions, and that that candidate must be Mr Balladur, this prime minister
might still recover to go on to higher things next year.

FT  02 APR 94 / Bossi plays rough game of political poker: Fiery leader of
Northern League campaigns for concessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Umberto Bossi, the fiery leader of the populist Northern League, has
begun a high stakes game of bluff and threat to wring out the maximum amount
of concessions for joining the next Italian government, writes Robert Graham
in Rome.
This means that over the next few days there will be some confusing and
belligerent noises coming from the Bossi camp as media magnate Silvio
Berlusconi tries to hammer out a consensus on a government programme.
However, Mr Bossi appears to have accepted the principle that the League be
part of the government in the wake of the overwhelming election victory by
the right-wing Freedom Alliance.
He also appears to have dropped his resistance - again in principle - to the
presence in government of members of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance
of Mr Gianfranco Fini, the third main component of the Freedom Alliance.
Thus the discussions now taking place are over the nature of the government
programme and the role the League should play in government.
Yesterday Mr Berlusconi met for the second time in three days with League
representatives. Whereas Mr Bossi was present at the first encounter,
yesterday he deliberately delegated his most trusted aide, Mr Roberto
Marone, to meet Mr Berlusconi, and so distanced himself from the
negotiations.
'We will put together a government and it will be a strong one,' Mr Marone
said afterwards. But neither he nor a statement from Mr Berlusconi's Forza
Italia movement gave any idea whether their differences were being narrowed.
Mr Berlusconi refused to be tied to a timetable for forming the government.
'Parliament reassembles on April 15. But this is not necessarily the date
for the formation of the government,' he said.
In the past Mr Bossi and Mr Marone have proved a highly effective duet. Mr
Bossi makes the tough uncompromising public statements: in private Mr Marone
softens them and acts as the go-between. They are likely to repeat this
tactic now with Mr Bossi threatening not to join the government and Mr
Marone then making light of such threats.
It is also a way of Mr Bossi trying to impose his demand that Mr Marone be
the next prime minister, instead of Mr Berlusconi. Mr Bossi argues that with
118 seats in the Chamber of Deputies compared with the MSI's 105 and Forza
Italia's 101, the premier should come from the largest represented party.
Having bad-mouthed his allies and associates in the Freedom Alliance
throughout the election, it was too much to expect the voluble League leader
to soften his language immediately. He also has to placate unease among his
rank and file over doing a deal with the MSI. Nevertheless, Mr Bossi's tone
and emphasis has changed.
Instead of attacking the MSI as being 'reactionary fascists,' he is
insisting the next government be built around acceptance of a new federalist
approach to Italy's constitution. This has long been a League platform and a
major point of difference with the MSI which believes in the opposite - a
strong centralised state.
Mr Berlusconi stands somewhere near the middle in this argument. As a
northerner, he understands the frustrations of the League at seeing the
hard-working north underwriting the inefficiency and waste of Rome and the
south. His free-market instincts also attract him to the idea of greater
administrative and fiscal devolution in Italy, the most centralised state in
the EU.
One way round the impasse between the federalist League and the centralist
MSI is an agreement to introduce direct elections for the president of the
republic, giving the presidency almost French-style powers.
Only when these issues are resolved will the parties move on to finding
common ground on measures to deal with the economy, another key area of
potential disagreement. The economic programmes of the three parties,
hurriedly put together prior to the elections, have few points in common.
Although the Italian media have been full of lists of potential ministers
during the past few days, Mr Berlusconi yesterday insisted no appointments
had been decided. He is determined to cut the number of ministries by up to
one third and is considering carrying out the much-studied amalgamation of
the Treasury with the budget and finance ministries.
He would also prefer to have the cabinet predominantly composed of
politicians, and not technocrats.

The Dutch economy is poised to enjoy substantially stronger growth in 1995,
putting two years of more sluggish performance behind it, according to new
official forecasts.
The Central Planning Bureau, a government-run agency which produces
independent economic assessments, said that gross domestic product should
rise to 2.5 per cent next year from a projected 1.0 per cent this year and
0.3 per cent in 1993.
But, in a cautionary note, it said the increase would be due mainly to
higher exports, with domestic consumption expected to remain relatively
weak.
Inflation, which was virtually non-existent in the Netherlands in the late
1980s, is forecast to pick up slightly, reaching 2.75 per cent this year and
next year compared with 2.6 per cent last year.
However, in spite of the stronger performance of the economy as a whole,
unemployment is expected to continue rising, with the number of jobless
people forecast to rise to 630,000 in 1995 compared with 550,000 last year.
The upturn in the Netherlands is likely to be part of a wider upward trend
in Europe, the CPB said in its annual spring report. 'The lowest point of
the recession in Europe has been passed, in our opinion,' Mr Gerrit Zalm,
the CPB's director, said.
Dutch exports, excluding energy products, are projected to recover from
their 0.1 per cent dip in 1993 to increase by 3.75 per cent in 1994 and then
rise to 5.75 per cent in 1995, reflecting expectations of more buoyant world
trade. The Netherlands generates around half of its gross national product
through the export of goods and services.
The Dutch economy which has traditionally been tied to that of Germany, its
biggest trading partner, has avoided the recession that has plagued its
eastern neighbour in the early 1990s.

FT  02 APR 94 / Berlusconi woos election ally in effort to form government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Italian media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi intensified his efforts yesterday
to persuade the populist Northern League to form part of the country's next
government.
The reservations of the League and its leader, Mr Umberto Bossi, are the
main hurdle facing Mr Berlusconi in putting together a government after this
week's landslide victory by the right-wing Freedom Alliance.
Mr Berlusconi has already received broad backing from the neo-fascist
MSI/National Alliance. The MSI, together with Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia
movement and the League, fought the elections under the banner of the
Freedom Alliance, even though their electoral platforms were separate and
often divergent.
Yesterday, Mr Berlusconi held his second meeting in three days with League
representatives. It was convened against the background of statements by Mr
Bossi damping hopes of an agreement. Mr Bossi himself declined to attend and
delegated his closest aide, Mr Roberto Maroni, to conduct the negotiations.
Afterwards, Mr Berlusconi refused to be drawn on the talks and said he was
operating to no precise timetable. However, he has let it be known that he
is anxious to put together a government based round his four-month-old Forza
Italia movement, the League and the MSI, headed by Mr Gianfranco Fini. Mr
Maroni said: 'We will be able to put together a government and it will be a
strong one.' His remarks confirmed the impression that the League is
bargaining hard to ensure that if it enters government, the party does not
become submerged by Mr Berlusconi and Forza Italia.
In the election, Forza Italia took votes from the League in the north, but
it helped the League nationally to gain 118 seats in the chamber by backing
it during the campaign.
The prospect of forming a government with a clear parliamentary majority -
despite serious divisions in the Freedom Alliance - has prompted heavy
buying of stocks on the Milan bourse this week and a strengthening of the
lira against the D-mark. The lira was yesterday being traded at L960 against
the D-mark compared with over L990 in the run-up to the elections. The lira
has long been considered under-valued, and the market has been waiting to
see the outcome of the elections. The currency has also firmed because of
tentative signs that the recession has bottomed and a recovery, albeit
timid, is on the way.
The financial markets appeared to shrug off yesterday's events, and added to
gains made on Thursday as traders predicted that a government could soon be
formed. A Milan broker said: 'It is all part of the negotiating game. Of
course, they are going to sell their support for the highest price they
can.' Shares on the Milan stock exchange rose by 1.6 per cent yesterday,
taking the BCI index to a close of 735.11.

FT  02 APR 94 / US economy set for robust growth: Non-farm employment rises
456,000 - Expansion may force interest rate increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The US economy looks set for a period of strong expansion after a range of
economic statistics yesterday all pointed to a robust recovery.
But the prospects of further strong growth also increased the probability of
a further increase in short-term interest rates.
The most eye-catching statistic was that non-farm employment in March jumped
by 456,000, far in excess of market expectations and the largest single
monthly increase since the Wall Street collapse of October 1987.
The New York equity markets were closed yesterday for Good Friday, but
prices of long-dated bonds sank. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell
more than 1 1/2 points, sending the yield up to 7.26 per cent, although
trading was light. One trader described the market reaction as 'swift,
violent and unforgiving'.
On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied towards the close to
finish up 9.21 points at 3,635.96, having fallen 67 points earlier in the
day. But most broader market measurements were down, and the Dow ended the
shortened week off 138.77 points.
The market slide, which has cut share prices by about 9 per cent in two
months, was enough to persuade President Bill Clinton, on holiday in
California, to state that 'corrections' in the market were normal and to
warn against 'skittishness'. Economic fundamentals were sufficiently sound
that comparisons with 1987 were invalid, he said.
Other economic indicators published yesterday, both for February, showed
personal income up 1.3 per cent, reversing the decline of 0.3 per cent in
January, and personal spending up 1 per cent, after an increase of only 0.1
per cent the previous month.
Final revised gross domestic product figures for the last quarter of 1993,
released on Thursday, showed real annual growth at 7 per cent, down from the
earlier estimate of 7.5 per cent, but still the strongest three months since
the first quarter of 1984.
Ms Laura Tyson, head of the president's council of economic advisers, said
there was no reason yet to change two of the administration's annual
forecasts - of 3 per cent real growth and 2m new jobs. She said there was
'an upside risk on both numbers', though higher interest rates might have a
damping effect.
Reaction to the data by economic analysts was uniform. Merrill Lynch said
first-quarter real growth 'may be closer to 4 per cent than 3.5 per cent',
its previous prediction. S G Warburg said it 'may equal or exceed 4 per
cent'. All noted no evidence of rising inflationary pressures.
Ms Katherine Abraham, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, told
Congress that more than half the growth in employment in March reflected a
rebound from the weather-ravaged previous two months, exacerbated by the Los
Angeles earthquake in January.
However, the jobless rate remained unchanged at 6.5 per cent. The bureau
explained that whereas a reduction of 100,000 in the official unemployment
rolls could produce a 0.1 percentage point drop in the unemployment rate, it
could take as many as 700,000 new jobs to produce the same result, because
most openings went to those not registered in the labour force.
In fact, in March 349,000 of the 456,000 new jobs were part time.
Manufacturing employment only rose by 12,000.

FT  02 APR 94 / Soccer clubs may win reprieve for stadium terraces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers may drop the requirement for Britain's leading football clubs to
have all-seater stadiums by August in a move that could mean a reprieve for
terrace culture.
They are considering whether to extend this summer's deadline - which in
England includes Premiership and First Division clubs - on a case-by-case
basis, and whether to combine this with a law change to remove the
all-seater requirement.
This would be part of a reform of the three acts governing sports grounds,
which ministers would like rationalised into one under wider deregulation
moves.
If the proposed reform makes it on to the 1994-95 legislative timetable, as
the Department of National Heritage is understood to have requested, this
could mean a permanent reprieve for some terraces - with their tradition of
songs and chants and cheaper admission prices.
But the department said last night that the fact that the three acts might
be rationalised should not lead people to assume the government was
necessarily going to change its policy.
Although several clubs are struggling to meet the August deadline, such a
policy reversal would probably be viewed dimly by those that have already
spent heavily to upgrade their grounds. The apparent softening of the
government's stance stems from two main factors:
A growing feeling that the Taylor report into the 1989 Hillsborough
disaster, which led to the all-seater requirement, took an understandably
but unnecessarily rigid line. Some 95 fans were crushed to death on the
terraces at the Sheffield ground.
Improvements in ground safety technology. Mr Iain Sproat, national heritage
minister, is understood to have been impressed by a system that monitors
pressure around a stadium.
Mr Tom Pendry, a Labour national heritage spokesman, recently referred to
this system, saying: 'I firmly believe that, in the light of new
developments, supporters should be given the opportunity to stand in new,
safer areas.'
One club which will apply for an extension to the August deadline is
Barnsley, according to Mr Michael Spinks, general manager. The club has
planning consent for a 4,500-seater stand lifting its seating capacity to
more than 14,000, but the earliest this will open is 1995.

FT  02 APR 94 / Rail companies may have to honour most tickets of rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A potentially significant barrier to the smooth operation of ticket sales on
Britain's newly-privatised railways could be lifted under proposals being
considered by the railway franchising director, Mr Roger Salmon.
One option being studied would oblige the private train-operating companies
which take over British Rail franchises to accept most of the tickets issued
by other train companies.
Under the original rules governing rail privatisation, the new train
operators would have only had to accept other full-fare and season tickets.
These would account for just 20 per cent of all tickets issued.
Many travellers could have been forced to buy more than one ticket if their
journeys involved services operated by more than one train company.
On routes with services provided by competing companies, travellers might
not have been able to use the most convenient onward or return train.
The 'interavailability' of tickets threatened to become a significant
barrier to the smooth operation of the network after privatisation.
But Mr Salmon, who has responsibility for selling off BR's operations, is
now considering ways of increasing interavailability. One would be to make
rail companies accept each other's tickets for most journeys.
This would avert possible disruption to travellers if tickets were not
accepted across the new network. Mr Salmon has faced complaints from
passenger groups concerned about inconvenience to travellers.
He wants train operators to accept most of each other's tickets. However,
they could opt out if they proved that by not accepting the tickets of a
rival, competition would be increased and the traveller would get a better
deal.
Mr Salmon is understood to want to extend 'interavailability' to cover Saver
and Supersaver discount fares. Season and full-fare tickets would be valid
across the network under the original rules.
But the cheapest fares, Apex tickets which must be bought at least seven
days in advance and which apply to a particular train, would not be covered
by the new arrangement. However, Mr Salmon estimates that more than 80 per
cent of journeys would now be included.
Fears about this issue were fanned earlier this year with the publication of
an internal BR memo by a senior manager. The document described the
government's promise that rail companies would honour each other's tickets
as 'a bit of a con' because discounted fares were excluded.

TWA, the US airline which emerged from bankruptcy last November, narrowed
its operating losses to Dollars 281.3m last year, from Dollars 404.6m in
1992, as it cut back the scale of its operations.
However, a Dollars 342m pension fund charge, offset by some items resulting
from the company's reorganisation, led it to report a pre-tax loss (before
extraordinary items) of Dollars 450.8m, compared with Dollars 342m in 1992.

FT  02 APR 94 / Arts: Riding on a wave of change - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Criticised since its inception in 1990 as a station without an identity, BBC
Radio 5 re-launched on Monday after undergoing major surgery.
Gone was the eccentric, eclectic brew of chat, sports coverage, youth music
and high-grade children's drama. In came a more integrated but thinner soup
of rolling news and sport, thickened with middlebrow magazine-format items.
It seems safe to say that Radio 5 has shucked off the 'Radio bloke' tag
afforded its remit of sport and user-friendly news. But the repeated,
exclamation mark laden reminders that 'you're listening to FIVE LIVE]' only
underscore the sense of a station still desperately seeking an identity.
With sport, 5 Live is on solid ground: the sports news and features are
impressively diverse and confidently presented. This week, there have been
reports that the rights for high-profile sporting events may become
prohibitively expensive for BBC Radio, as Premier League football became for
BBC Television in the face of bidding from BSkyB.
For now, though, 5 Live sport looks safe, although it's unfortunate that the
station should relaunch during the third cricket Test against the West
Indies. With comprehensive coverage firmly ensconced on Radio 4, only token
reports are left for 5 Live, a cruel reminder that Radio 5 was always a poor
relation. It was Radio 5, remember, that was sacrificed to save Radio 4's
Long Wave from becoming a rolling news network.
The revamped station, however, may have its revenge. 5 Live reportedly has
first refusal on any news items or exclusives that come to its sister
stations: in short, it can poach Radio 4's scoops. In the first days of the
new station, though, there seemed to be precious few scoops around.
Long touted, the term rolling news proves misleading, implying as it does
something progressive or cumulative. Rolling news gathers little: listen to
5 Live for more than an hour and you'll hear the same reports, the same
soundbites, the same chunks of actuality endlessly repeated, until you begin
to doubt their validity as 'news'. While never becoming actually bloke-ish,
it's during the news that 5 Live becomes distinctly matey.
The station's Controller, Jenny Abramsky, has strenuously denied that 5
Live's news coverage will be downmarket, so it might have been an aberration
when the trailer for one bulletin on Wednesday promised coverage of the
aftermath of the Hall Garth School stabbings, John Major's alleged
leadership crisis . . . and the fact that The Mousetrap was still running in
London. Generally the regular bulletins are relaxed and clear in content,
covering the main stories chattily but in depth. They seem perfectly gauged
to meet the terms of John Birt's mission to explain. The only difference
from your average report on Radio 3 or 4 is in tone.
It's not just the surging theme tune that heralds the appearance of another
report, nor the urgent pace of the headlines, nor the constant emphasis on
reporters' names. The tone of the news is eager, snappy, almost frantic at
times. It's probably what Abramsky was referring to when she promised 5 Live
would be 'younger, vibrant and slightly rough'.
What this means in practice is that 5 Live sounds rather like a commercial
radio station, without the music or advertisements. The air of pep and pace
is fostered by the constant trailers for amusing items later in the day (odd
things from the BBC Sound Archives, people who want to export birdwatching
to Ethiopia). Of the presenters, old Radio 5 hand John Inverdale
accomplishes the balancing act of making sport, news and wacky items sound
equally important and enticing.
Elsehwere, the blend goes wrong. 'Coming up, Prime Minister's Question Time
with JOHN MAJOR]' said Sybil Ruscoe in her Tuesday programme, giving the PM
the kind of build-up usually reserved for the likes of Cilla Black. The
subsequent report had an intrusive commentary ('John Smith there, having
another go') which made it sound uncomfortably like a football match.
The same breathless excitement characterised the trailers for 5 Live's
flagship programmes. Frances Edmond's anti-bloke sports programme Women on
Top, John Diamond's newspaper review Stop Press, the first national gay news
programme Out This Week and the heavy-duty weekend sports coverage are all
yet to come. They will play a big part in establishing the identity of a
station which at present makes for easy listening 24 hours a day. And once
established, maybe they'll drop the exclamation marks.
