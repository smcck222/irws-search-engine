FT  23 JUN 94 / DTI takes tougher line over regional aid requests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is taking a tougher line on applications for regional aid
from foreign investors, who are considering England as a location, and
indigenous companies wanting to expand.
The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday confirmed that it was
scrutinising applications for Regional Selective Assistance in England more
stringently, as part of the constraints on public spending.
The tightening of allocation of RSA grants has not been publicly announced
but its effect is arousing concern among many of those dealing with inward
investment in England by UK and overseas companies.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, has been lobbied by development
agencies and local authorities worried that the tougher approach will hinder
the English regions in their pursuit of economic regeneration, as mobile
inward investors shop around internationally. 'If you aren't in the shop
window, they won't come in and talk,' one agency chief said yesterday.
Mr Sainsbury's response to the complaints has been that, since the recession
is lifting, more projects are bidding for funding and that more areas of
England are competing, following last summer's redrawing of the Assisted
Areas map.
The DTI said yesterday this year's RSA budget for England - which includes
an undisclosed number of commitments made in previous years - is Pounds
101m, compared with Pounds 89.2m in 1993-94. 'There's no less money
available overall, but we're being increasingly careful about who gets the
money,' it said.
But some economic development bodies are fearful the government's belief
that the UK is now a highly attractive location for inward investment -
thanks to de-regulation, labour market flexibility and low inflation - is
lessening ministers' commitment to a grant regime about which some may be
ideologically lukewarm.
Their worries have been heightened by the government's decision, unveiled in
last month's Competitiveness White Paper, to lay greater stress in granting
RSA on the quality of jobs created. This policy may make it more difficult
to win grants for projects offering the kind of less skilled work attractive
to the jobless in high unemployment areas.
The DTI said the move to greater stringency had been introduced gradually.
Development agency staff say it has become increasingly pronounced in recent
months.
Because the RSA system is totally discretionary, and most applications are
confidential, agencies in the field are reluctant to cite examples of
projects adversely affected.
Mr Bryn Sidaway, leader of Sunderland council, is known to have written to
the prime minister complaining that the level of RSA offered to Lucas SEI
Wiring Systems, automotive components manufacturer, for a proposed Wearside
plant, was lower than expected. However, the company recently announced that
the project, which will create 650 jobs in its Pounds 10m first phase, will
go ahead.
In the 40 years to 1991, the UK secured 36 per cent of US direct investment
into the European Community and, between 1951 and March 1992, 40.9 per cent
of Japanese EC direct investment.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Monklands Labour candidate slams council spending 'bias'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Helen Liddell, the Labour candidate in the Monklands East by-election
caused by the death of John Smith, said yesterday she would fight to rectify
the bias in the allocation of spending by the district council towards one
part of the district.
She confronted the most explosive issue of the campaign for Labour - the
long-standing allegation that Labour-controlled Monklands district council
favours the town of Coatbridge at the expense of next-door Airdrie in its
capital spending. Airdrie is at the centre of Monklands East constituency,
near Glasgow, where polling takes place next Thursday.
The issue, sometimes known as Monklandsgate, has been simmering since late
1992. Newspapers and dissident Labour councillors allege that a clique on
the council - the 'Monklands Mafia' - favours predominantly Roman Catholic
Coatbridge over Protestant Airdrie.
It is also alleged that over several years a dominant group of Labour
councillors, who are mainly Catholic, allocated 40 council jobs to their
relatives.
Mrs Liddell, having initially tried to stay aloof from the issue, wrote to
the council on Tuesday asking for a breakdown of capital spending between
Coatbridge and Airdrie, which are of similar size. After receiving the
figures she said they proved that spending was concentrated on Coatbridge.
They showed that between 1982 and 1992 Coatbridge received Pounds 18.8m on
'strategic projects', while Airdrie received nothing. Other capital spending
was Pounds 49.8m on Airdrie and Pounds 51m on Coatbridge. Strategic projects
include a leisure centre, country park, heritage park and council offices,
all located in Coatbridge.
Mrs Liddell said yesterday she wanted an explanation of the discrepancy
between the council's figures and those collected by four dissident Labour
councillors for the years 1989 to 1992, which showed 'a more marked
difference' between the two towns in non-strategic spending. On this
analysis Airdrie received Pounds 2.2m and Coatbridge Pounds 3.7m.
She said: 'I'm determined to make sure that Airdrie, the outlying villages
and the Coatbridge parts of the constituency are receiving their fair share
of spending.'
The acknowledgement by Mrs Liddell, who is a former secretary of the
Scottish Labour party and was a close associate of John Smith, of
shortcomings in the local council was seized on by the other candidates.
Mrs Kay Ullrich, the Scottish National party candidate, said the electorate
would not be duped by Mrs Liddell's 'amazing conversion'.
Mrs Susan Bell, the Conservative candidate, said Mrs Liddell's words
vindicated what the Tories had been saying.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Colombia's president-elect Mr Ernesto Samper yesterday vehemently denied
accusations that his election campaign had benefited from contributions by
the country's Cali cocaine cartel.
A tape containing conversations allegedly detailing possible contributions
was released in Bogota yesterday, only three days after the the election
success of Mr Samper, a member of the ruling Liberal party.
The tape was released by Mr Samper's defeated opponent, the Conservative Mr
Andres Pastrana. The prosecutor general is investigating the case.
Mr Samper said his campaign treasury had not received any money 'of doubtful
origin' and offered his accounts to the prosecutor general for examination.
Mr Pastrana played the tape and said it could not in any way be interpreted
as involving his own campaign. He asked Mr Samper to issue a statement
saying he would resign as president-elect if it was shown the Liberal
treasury had received money from drug traffickers.
Diplomats have said they would be surprised if some drug money had not
entered the campaign of both the run-off candidates, though they stressed
this could have occurred without the candidates' knowledge.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Greenspan seeks to allay inflation fear: US Federal Reserve
chairman aims to bolster confidence in the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, yesterday sought to bolster
international confidence in the dollar by arguing that many investors were
too pessimistic about the outlook for US inflation.
He said an increase in US long-term bond yields this year was to be expected
given faster economic growth and an increase in global demand for capital.
But long-term rates were higher than they needed to be, because they
embodied an excessive 'inflation premium'.
'I think that the inflation premium is too high, that nominal long-term
rates. . . are higher than they should be' and would decline if the Fed held
'inflation increasingly to a path of stable prices'.
This situation was partly a lingering consequence of high US inflation in
the 1970s which undermined confidence in US monetary policy. The inflation
premium in long rates reflected a 'still sceptical world financial market
view that American fiscal and monetary policies retain some inflation bias'.
Speaking before the House budget committee, Mr Greenspan did not comment
directly on the dollar but instead tried to address fears underlying heavy
recent selling.
There had been some 'recent firming of prices of some products and raw
materials'. However, 'owing to constrained increases in unit labour costs,
broad measures of producer prices for final goods have not generally
reflected the increases in those input costs. In addition, monetary and
credit growth remains quite muted.'
The outlook for inflation was thus 'quite reasonable' and monetary policy
was 'dedicated to ensuring it remains that way'. Mr Greenspan gave no sign
that present inflationary pressures were sufficiently intense to require
another increase in short-term interest rates in the near future. He seemed,
instead, inclined to wait and see what effect the rate increases already
announced would have on prices and output.
Questioned about deficiencies in the consumer price index, he agreed it
overstated the underlying rate of inflation for various technical reasons.
The upward bias probably lay in the range of 0.5-1.5 percentage points, he
said.
This would imply that the 'true' rate of inflation was closer to 2 per cent
than nearly 3 per cent, as indicated by the official index. It would also
imply that real short-term rates were higher than generally assumed.
Mr Greenspan cautioned against assuming certain levels of unemployment or
industrial capacity utilisation would automatically trigger upward pressure
on inflation.
He said manufacturing capacity utilisation, at a shade under 83 per cent,
was well above its historical norm. However, 'there is no clear-cut trigger
point for capacity utilisation as a signal for emerging inflationary
pressures'.
He also reacted sceptically to claims by some economists that the US jobless
rate, now 6 per cent, was at or below the 'natural rate' of unemployment - a
national threshold below which inflation is assumed to begin accelerating.
The 'enormous complexity and dynamism of our labour markets' made such
calculations impractical.
He would watch carefully for signs of resource pressures in the labour
market. 'I do not think that any one estimate of the natural rate is useful
in the formulation of monetary policy,' he said.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Democrats hit at 'religious right': Risky strategy to fend
off Republican challenge in elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Democratic party organisers, searching for ways of heading off a possible
landslide of defeats in November's congressional elections, have embarked on
a strategy of attacking the rival Republican party as a captive of radical,
religious right-wingers.
The plan is a risky one that could backfire in areas of the US such as the
south and west, where conservatives and Christian evangelicals dominate the
electorate.
Many Democratic strategists, however, believe religious extremism could
become a 'wedge issue' they can use to peel voters away from their opponents
 -just what they need at a time when some of them fear their party could
lose as many as 45 or 50 of its 256 seats in the 435-seat House of
Representatives, throwing control to the Republicans.
Mr Vic Fazio, the California congressman who chairs the Democratic
congressional campaign committee, sketched his party's line of attack in a
speech in Washington this week in which he said the Republican party was now
dominated by a radical and intolerant fringe group.
'The Republicans accept the religious right and their tactics at their own
peril, for these activists are demanding their rightful seat at the table,
and that is what the American people fear most,' Mr Fazio said.
Democratic candidates in Penn-sylvania, California, Oregon, Missouri and
Idaho have already launched attacks in a similar vein on their Republican
opponents, calling them extremists and 'mouthpieces for the radical right.'
The attacks have been fuelled in recent weeks by Virginia Republicans'
choice of Mr Oliver North, the controversial Iran-Contra figure, to run for
a Senate seat, by the Texas party's choice of a new chairman backed by
religious groups, and by Minnesota Republicans' selection of a Christian
right candidate for governor in preference to the sitting Republican
governor.
Republican party officials and the Christian Coalition, a right-wing
religious organisation that has worked to get Republicans elected in many
states, hit back by accusing the Democrats of 'Christian bashing' and
religious bigotry.
And some Democratic campaign managers cautioned that their party had to be
very careful to focus its attacks on its opponents' positions on issues such
as abortion, school syllabuses and the position of women, and to avoid being
seen as attacking people for their religious beliefs.
The charge of religious extremism could prove effective in reducing the
electability of Republican candidates in suburban areas.
But it is likely to be counterproductive in rural districts, especially in
the south, where as many as half of the voters may count themselves as
born-again Christians.
Mr Fazio said the 1990 redrawing of district boundaries had made many more
districts competitive and reduced the Democrats' incumbency advantage. In
addition, of the 49 seats left open by a sitting member's retirement, 30 are
currently held by Democrats.
'Of those 30 seats held by the Democrats, we classify only two 'likely
Democratic'. The other 28 are extremely marginal and could go to either
party on election day,' Mr Fazio said.
Dissatisfaction with President Bill Clinton and continuing dis-trust of
Washington incumbents also make the Democrats' task more difficult.
But while Republican party strategists are confident of being able to build
on this to fashion a substantial victory in November's congressional
elections, some warn that they will need to develop a much more positive
message if they want to win back the White House in 1996.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Hopes rise over Clinton healthcare bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan yesterday promised that the US Senate
finance committee he chairs would start detailed drafting work on a
healthcare reform bill next Monday, possibly signalling that President Bill
Clinton's deadlocked reform initiative may at last be starting to move
forward again.
The finance committee has been regarded as the key to the healthcare bill.
Because its membership of nine Republicans and 11 Democrats, including
several centrist swing voters, closely mirrors the political balance of the
full Senate, any bill that can't win the committee's backing is reckoned to
have little chance of final passage.
Mr Clinton and Mr Moynihan have engaged in a tug-of-war over the last few
days. The bookish New York senator has repeatedly insisted that legislation
guaranteeing universal health insurance coverage cannot pass Congress this
year, while Mr Clinton has refused to back down on what he calls his single
non-negotiable demand.
Mr Clinton this week begged business leaders not to walk away from the
healthcare debate, and castigated rival reform plans that might end up
covering only 91 per cent of the population.
'Unless we can provide coverage for every American in a reformed system
which focuses on both quality and control of costs, the deficit will grow,
your costs will continue to grow and undermine productivity, and more and
more Americans will lose their coverage or be at risk,' Mr Clinton told the
Business Roundtable, a gathering of heads of some of the US's largest
companies.
By scheduling a committee 'mark-up' on Monday, Mr Moynihan seems to have
blinked. Some officials said Senator George Mitchell, Senate Democratic
leader, had appeared ready to bypass the finance committee and take a bill
passed by Senator Edward Kennedy's labour and human resources committee to
the Senate floor if Mr Moynihan would not move.
But even if a mark-up takes place, many members of the Senate finance
committee remain hostile to the idea of making employers pay 80 per cent of
the cost of health insurance for workers, a mandate at the core of Mr
Clinton's plan.

Colombia's president-elect Mr Ernesto Samper yesterday vehemently denied
accusations that his election campaign had benefited from contributions by
the country's Cali cocaine cartel.
A tape containing conversations allegedly detailing possible contributions
was released in Bogota yesterday, only three days after the the election
success of Mr Samper, a member of the ruling Liberal party.
The tape was released by Mr Samper's defeated opponent, the Conservative Mr
Andres Pastrana. He was given the tape in Cali just before the election and
passed it on to outgoing President Cesar Gaviria. The prosecutor general is
investigating the case.
Mr Samper said his campaign treasury had not received any money 'of doubtful

Mr Pastrana played the tape and said it could not in any way be interpreted
as involving his own campaign. He asked Mr Samper to issue a statement
saying he would resign as president-elect if it was shown the Liberal
treasury had received money from drug traffickers.
Three conversations are recorded on the tape, the first two allegedly
between a journalist and a senior member of the Cali cartel. The third is
between the same journalist and a man considered to be leader of the Cali
group.
Nicknames and elliptical references are used in the conversations as well as
some direct mention of figures in the presidential campaign. At one point
the journalist says multi-million dollar contributions are needed and the
answer is: 'Those are there. That is defined.'
The context suggests this refers to the Samper campaign. However,
transcripts of the tape released in the Bogota press also refer to a meeting
with a member of Mr Pastrana's campaign, and to contacts with independent
law-and-order candidate Mr Miguel Maza Marquez, who later backed Mr Samper
after defeat in the first round.
Diplomats have said they would be surprised if some drug money had not
entered the campaign of both the run-off candidates, though they stressed
this could have occurred without the candidates' knowledge.

FT  23 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Norway braced for Italian backlash
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Erland Johnsen and the rest of Norway's defence are bracing themselves for
an Italian backlash in their World Cup Group E clash in New Jersey today.
'E' is considered the toughest of the six first-round groups. Qualifying
matches for the second round continue for another week.
'The Irish did us a favour by showing us that it is possible to play our way
in this heat but they didn't do us a favour by beating Italy,' said the
Chelsea defender. Ireland beat Italy 1-0 last weekend.
The Italians are seeking more than the three points that will put than back
into group contention and restore their battered reputation. 'We have to
play like we're convinced we'll win,' said Italian midfielder Demetrio
Albertini. 'We let Ireland dictate the game to us when it should have been
the other way round.'
Ireland remain favourites to win the group. Johnsen said: 'I'm sure Ireland
will beat Mexico on Friday. They are very similar to us and Mexico will find
it hard to play against that style. They don't like the muscular defensive
play.'

FT  23 JUN 94 / World beyond the US judged to have little to fear from new
high-nicotine tobacco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anti-smoking campaigners, health officials and industry experts in the UK
were yesterday in broad agreement that the world beyond the US had little to
fear from the Y-1 high-nicotine tobacco, the commercial use of which was
revealed this week by Mr David Kessler, head of the US Food and Drug
Administration, reports Jimmy Burns.
Mr Stephen Woodward, deputy director of ASH, the anti-smoking lobby said:
'Our experience of tobacco companies is that any new product that is judged
to give a competitive advantage, very quickly spreads throughout the
industry'.
However, ASH said that it had no evidence to contradict the assertion by BAT
Industries, parent of Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco of the US which developed
cigarettes containing the Y-1 strain, that these had been largely withdrawn
after proving unpopular with consumers.
Mr Woodward said he did not believe that Y-1 has been widely used on
unsuspecting guinea pigs in the Third World. Tobacco companies, he pointed
out, have no problems in the Third World marketing high-nicotine high-tar
cigarettes without having to resort to new technologies.
His views were echoed by Mr Nicholas Wall, a professor in environmental
protective medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London.
'I can't see who would want to go through all the trouble and expense (in
the Third World where) there is less reason to use high-nicotine strains of
tobacco because there has been less public pressure to reduce tar yields,'
he said.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Addiction or taste in battle for smokers' allegiance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Are US tobacco companies deliberately manipulating the amount of nicotine in
cigarettes to keep the nation's 46m smokers addicted? Damning evidence
presented to Congress this week seemed to suggest as much.
On Tuesday, a House of Representatives sub-committee heard allegations that
Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco, a US subsidiary of Britain's BAT Industries, had
secretly developed a genetically engineered tobacco called Y-1 that
contained more than twice the amount of nicotine found in normal tobacco
plants.
Mr David Kessler, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, told
the committee that B&amp;W had earlier denied breeding tobacco plants for high
or low nicotine levels: yet the company had several million pounds of Y-1
tobacco stored in US warehouses and had been using it in five domestic
brands of cigarettes.
Mr Kessler's purpose in presenting the evidence was to bolster his case for
bringing cigarettes under his agency's control. Previously he has threatened
to regulate cigarettes as drugs if it could be shown that manufacturers
intend people to buy them to satisfy a nicotine addiction. At the hearing on
Tuesday he said there was no longer any doubt that the tobacco industry was
manipulating and controlling nicotine levels in its products.
B&amp;W will reply to the allegations at a further hearing today, but it has
already accused Mr Kessler of blowing the issue out of proportion. There was
nothing secret about Y-1, it said: it was just one of a variety of domestic
and foreign tobaccos used by the company to provide the unique 'recipe' of
ingredients that went into each brand.
In reality, the history of Y-1 is almost an irrelevance. At issue are two
questions: first, whether cigarettes are addictive, and second, whether
manufacturers intend them to be addictive. If the answer to both questions
is yes, the FDA may be able to bring them under its jurisdiction as a drug.
That manufacturers control the levels of nicotine in their cigarettes is not
in doubt. In the 1940s, nicotine and tar occurred in cigarettes at more than
three times today's levels, but manufacturers gradually reduced them through
refinements in the processing technique to satisfy demand for smoother and
lighter cigarettes.
So why not eliminate nicotine altogether? Because, say manufacturers, it is
an essential contributor to cigarette flavour. When nicotine levels in
cigarettes fall below a certain point, smokers no longer enjoy them. So
companies adjust the nicotine level and other flavour-enhancing ingredients
of each particular brand by using blends of tobacco leaves. 'Y-1 was a
blending tool for flavour,' B&amp;W said.
Mr Walker Merriman, vice president of the Tobacco Institute, the industry's
trade association, said yesterday that consumer preference was the specific
reason for having a particular level of tar and nicotine in any particular
cigarette. One or two US brands had almost insignificant levels of nicotine,
he said, but commanded very low market share, and earlier no-nicotine brands
had failed through lack of demand.
Mr Kessler has recently backed off from earlier suggestions that tobacco
manufacturers deliberately 'spike' their products to keep smokers addicted,
but has more recently said it is sufficient to show that cigarette
manufacturers have the ability to control the level of nicotine in their
products and have allowed it to remain at addictive levels.
The industry position is that cigarettes are not a drug as defined in the
1938 Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act because they 'do not intend to
affect the structure or any function of the body'. In any event,
manufacturers say, smoking cannot be addictive because more than half of US
citizens today who have ever smoked have quit - more than 90 per cent of
them without professional help.
Mr Kessler's ultimate objective appears to be to bring the tobacco industry
under his agency's control so that he can force manufacturers gradually to
reduce levels of nicotine in their products and so wean smokers away from
the habit.
Critics say a possible risk in such a policy is that it could lead smokers
to smoke more cigarettes to compensate for the loss of nicotine intake, so
increasing their exposure to the carcinogenic ingredients of cigarettes
without hurting industry profits.
On past form, however, it will be a long time before things get this far. If
the FDA moved to take control of the industry, the tobacco manufacturers
would undoubtedly take the agency to court. Armed with vast resources of
cash and extremely experienced lawyers, they would stand a good chance of
emerging unscathed.
Until now, US courts have taken the view that the hazards associated with
smoking are so well known that anybody taking up the habit assumes all the
risks involved. In the eyes of the courts, the industry, it seems, is
blameless: it has never lost a case yet.

FT  23 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Testing time for middle men - The role of the
referees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tucked away in the corners of US bookshops is a depressing collection of
World Cup titles. There are shelves piled with beginners' guides that
explain the world's game in the language of John and Janet.
One of the better publications is by Pete Davies, a British author, called
Twenty-Two Foreigners in Funny Shorts. Any American who has taken an
interest in the matches so far will know that Davies gave his book the wrong
title. This is a game for 25 foreigners in funny shorts.
Fifa, world soccer's governing body, has changed the officials' uniforms
from dull black to eye-catching patterns in yellow and red. Fifa wants lots
of red and yellow from the referees, and has given instructions that were
bound to increase the attention focused on them.
Joao Havelange, Fifa's president, announced before the competition that any
referee who did not show a red card - and thus expel a player from the game
 -for a tackle from behind would find himself on the first flight home.
There have been enough nasty tackles from behind to fill a segment which
ESPN, the US sports network, has been showing at half-time during matches,
but, after the first five days, only Miguel Nadal of Spain had been sent off
for such an offence, and no referees had been spotted at the airport.
One Fifa official told me that Havelange had been speaking figuratively. But
this did not mean that the threat lacked bite. Referees who did not follow
Fifa directives would not be selected to referee matches in the later
rounds.
It was even possible that a referee who especially upset the referees'
committee might be pulled from a first-round match he had already been
assigned to. In other words, referees who are seen to make mistakes cannot
expect support from Fifa; instead, they will get a public humiliation
designed to make clear that they, not Fifa, are at fault.
In truth, Fifa wants black and white (and yellow and red) where there is
often only grey. When top athletes tangle at high speed, with arms and legs
all over the place, it is often impossible, even with slow-motion replays,
to determine whether the tackler touched the ball or the opponent first.
And players exploit that doubt. Defenders often try to make sure they
connect with ball and opponent; the attacker's first reaction is often to
fall to the ground as if shot. Understandably, referees have been
inconsistent.
American newspapers, which bow to no-one in the art of second-guessing
referees, ran pictures showing that Thomas Dooley of the US played the ball
in the crucial tackle from behind in the US-Switzerland game. The referee
gave a free kick but did not send Dooley off. From the kick, Switzerland's
Georges Bregy scored.
Unsurprisingly, Fifa offered a clarification. Sepp Blatter, Fifa's
general-secretary, said: 'If the tackling player does not touch the ball
then he should be sent off. If he takes the ball away then obviously he has
played the ball.'
Nevertheless, waving a red card is still a drastic action from which
referees flinch. Khalil Azmi, the Moroccan goalkeeper, escaped unpunished
after a frontal assault on Belgium's Josip Weber which saved a certain goal.
Azmi had the presence of mind to stay down injured and have himself carried
from the field. It takes a degree of courage to wave a red card at a man on
a stretcher.
In general, referees have appreciated a little help. Marco Etcheverry of
Bolivia barely poked Lothar Matthaus in the bottom with the toe of his boot.
But the German captain, always willing to guide the referee, turned on
Etcheverry in indignant fury. Result: a red card. The Russians pushed and
wrestled the Brazilians all afternoon; it was only when they sent their
opponents flying through the air that the referee, An Lan Kim Lee Chong of
Mauritius, reacted.
Referees have been inconsistent in handling the tackle from behind, and have
largely refused to interfere when attackers back into defenders and
defenders shove back. But they have been refreshingly steady on a couple of
modern soccer's nastier fouls.
A glimpse of raised studs when the ball is on the ground, or raised elbows
when the ball is in the air, inevitably attract a penalty. The latter has
not been a problem so far: unlike their British counterparts, most players
at the finals do not seem to believe that they must raise and lower their
elbows vigorously to jump for headers.
Referees have also responded with a will to Fifa's demand for increased
productivity. By Tuesday evening, 47 yellow cards and two red cards had been
waved at players in the first 13 matches, up from 30 yellow and four red
four years ago.
And yet the soccer has been far superior. There have been a few cynical
fouls, but games have not been dominated by foul-minded defenders. On the
other hand, it is not clear yet whether the blizzard of yellow cards has
helped produce the sparkling play, or resulted from over-reaction to what
fouling there has been.
Blatter is in no doubt where the credit belongs: 'It is such a pleasure,
after what we have done to improve refereeing over the past three years, to
see how good the refereeing is here.'
However, nearly 20 per cent of first-choice players are one mis-step away
from a suspension. If Fifa's decision to ban Etcheverry and Nadal for two
matches, instead of the more usual one, is a sign of intent, many teams
could find themselves with gaps in their line-ups in the knock-out stages.
Since most of the missing players will be defenders, that will tip the
balance even more towards attackers. No doubt that is what Fifa and the
watching billions want.

FT  23 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Singapore Airlines in Dollars 10.3bn order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore Airlines (SIA) yesterday placed one of the world's biggest
aircraft orders - for 52 Boeing and Airbus large wide-body airliners, worth
Dollars 10.3bn (Pounds 6.68bn).
The order surpasses the Dollars 8.6bn order SIA placed in 1990 and covers 22
Boeing 747-400 jumbos worth Dollars 4.9bn and 30 Airbus A340-300E long-range
airliners worth Dollars 5.4bn.
Both the US manufacturer and its European rival competed fiercely for the
SIA order in view of the reluctance of airlines to commit themselves to
significant new aircraft purchases.
Earlier this year SIA told the bidders it planned to buy a combination of
Boeing and Airbus wide-body airliners, but it also suggested it would
consider opting for just one aircraft type if it got a sufficiently
attractive proposal, further intensifying the competition.
However, SIA finally opted for a mix of 399-seat Boeing 747s and 271-seat
A340s, which it will deploy on long-haul routes that do not require the
capacity of a 747.
All three leading engine manufacturers, Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric
of the US and Rolls-Royce of the UK, were competing to supply power
equipment for the new SIA aircraft.
SIA selected Pratt &amp; Whitney engines for its new 747s and CFM engines
jointly developed by GE and Snecma of France for the A340s.
Although Rolls-Royce was regarded as an outsider in the SIA competition, the
decision is a disappointment for the UK aero-engine manufacturer.
Of the 22 Boeing 747 airliners, 11 are on firm order and the rest on option.
Of the 30 A340s 10 are on firm order and 20 on option. The total value of
the firm orders placed by SIA is Dollars 4.25bn.
SIA said it had the flexibility to convert the options to other aircraft
types. The Boeing 747-400s can be converted to any of the three models of
the new Boeing 777 twin-engine wide-body aircraft, while the A340-300E
options can be converted to the twin-engine A330 or another version of the
A340.
SIA, one of the world's most profitable airlines, expects to finance the
orders from its cash flow, but if necessary it will resort to borrowing or
leasing.
The new aircraft, to be delivered from 1996 to 2003, will expand SIA's fleet
as well as replace older aircraft. SIA at present operates 63 aircraft and
expects to see its fleet grow to 111 aircraft by 2003.
'The latest order is an expression of our faith in the long-term health of
the aviation industry and the promising future of SIA,' said Dr Cheong
Choong Kong, the airline's managing director.

FT  23 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Quotas for EU TV programmes come under
fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Television quotas in European Union countries are damaging development of
Europe's audio-visual sector and work against the interests of the film
producers, rights holders, artists and technicians they are supposed to
protect, according to a report published today.
Prepared by consultants London Economics on behalf of Sony Europe, the
report argues that quotas are anti-competitive, harmful to the promotion of
European television production, a drag on the creation of jobs and
culturally ineffective.
Its findings come amid indications from the European Commission that it is
willing to consider changes to the existing broadcasting directive. This
directive recommends that EU-based TV channels allot at least half their
broadcasting time to European-made programmes 'wherever practicable',
excluding time allotted to news, sports, games, advertising and teletext
services. It also says at least 10 per cent of programming budgets should be
devoted to European works from independent producers.
Earlier this week Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, commissioner responsible for the
audio-visual sector, said proposed changes to the directive would not be
anti-American and quotas would not be tightened.
The existing quotas are intended to nurture Europe's broadcasting industry,
and protect social and cultural values from the strong competition of cheap
US imports.
But the report - based on studies of TV in France, Germany and the UK - says
quotas are anti-competitive as they do not affect the programme output of
well established channels such as the BBC, ZDF and TF1 (which already exceed
quota requirements), but that of new entrants.
'Quotas make it more difficult for new entrants to compete, either by
reducing the attractiveness of their schedules as a result of switching out
of imported programming, or by forcing up their programming costs,' says the
report.

FT  23 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Salinas joins race to head WTO - Political
jostling could lead to bruising transatlantic row

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The race to head the World Trade Organisation, the successor to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has entered a new phase with the decision by
President Carlos Salinas of Mexico formally to put his name forward.
His nomination was confirmed as it emerged that South Korea plans to become
the first Asian country to propose a candidate for the WTO. The name,
believed to be that of an experienced trade policymaker, will be announced
in Seoul today.
Meanwhile, a note of uncertainty was injected into the European Union's
plans to back Mr Renato Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister, for the
post, when officials in Brussels said he might not be formally endorsed by
EU leaders at their Corfu summit this weekend.
The officials said that though Mr Ruggiero remained the only declared
European entrant, EU leaders were expected only to discuss his candidacy
informally in Corfu. They would probably leave it to their foreign ministers
to deal with the question next month.
Mr Salinas' decision to enter the race comes earlier than expected, and
almost two months before the election in August which will choose his
successor as president when he steps down after a six-year term in December.
His nomination follows his broad endorsement at last week's Ibero-American
summit by the heads of all Latin American states except Brazil, which has
proposed Mr Rubens Ricupero, its finance minister, for the post. 'My
personal feeling is that the US, as well as Canada and most Asian countries,
will support the Salinas candidacy,' Mr Manuel Tello, Mexico's foreign
minister, who is running President Salinas' WTO campaign, said.
Mr Salinas is the best known of three candidates to have declared so far. A
committed free-trader, he was the driving force behind agreement on the
North American Free Trade Area embracing the US, Canada and Mexico. While he
is widely considered to have outstanding political credentials for the WTO
post, his nomination could further complicate a decision on a candidate.
That likelihood would increase if he were actively supported by Washington,
while the EU promoted Mr Ruggiero.
In that event, some international trade officials believe, the outcome could
be a bruising transatlantic confrontation, into which other countries could
be drawn, or a stalemate which could open the way for a compromise
candidate. Furthermore, Mr Salinas' candidacy threatens to divide Latin
America if Brazil stands by its nomination of Mr Ricupero. Mr Tello has
written to Mr Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister, asking him to
withdraw Mr Ricupero's name.
He said Mr Amorim told him on May 30 that Brazil would reconsider its
position if Mr Salinas chose to run, and had assured Mr Salinas Brazil would
look favourably on the candidacy of the Mexican president. Since then,
Brazil appears to have persuaded Argentina to retreat from the backing it
gave Mr Salinas at the Ibero-American summit in favour of Mr Ricupero.
Mexico says it has not been informed of any change in Argentina's stance.

Taiwan is renewing its efforts to enter the commercial aerospace business,
after earlier partnership negotiations, first with McDonnell Douglas of the
US, then with British Aerospace, collapsed, writes Paul Betts, Aerospace
Correspondent.
A Taiwan aircraft company, Aero Industry Development Centre, said it was
considering producing aircraft components for a new McDonnell Douglas
100-seater twin engine aircraft, the MD95.
AIDC officials have held talks with the US company, which two years ago
failed to forge a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) commercial aerospace alliance
with Taiwan. McDonnell Douglas was proposing to invite 10 partners jointly
to produce the new aircraft.

a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) power project in southern China involving
GEC-Alsthom and Chinese partners, Tony Walker reports from Beijing.
Lord Prior, GEC chairman, said in Beijing yesterday Mr Li had left no doubt
he was anxious for the project to move ahead quickly because of electricity
supply problems.
Lord Prior, who met Mr Li on Tuesday, said he expected negotiations on the
coal-fired Jiaxing plant in Zhejiang province to finish next year, but
financial discussions were proving complex.
This will be GEC's first power project in which it will take an equity stake
through a build-operate-transfer (BOT) funding arrangement.

Pakistan's largest organisation of trade associations and business chambers
last night threatened to strike from Sunday if the government did not
withdraw its plan to widen an existing net of a VAT-style general sales tax.
The government said it was extending GST to include up to 277 items in last
week's budget.
Businesses are opposing the measure on the grounds it would fuel corruption
by giving extra powers to government inspectors to clamp down on various
factories unless they were paid an illegal 'gratification'.
'This budget will ruin the economy. It's no good,' said Mr SM Muneer,
chairman of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry,
which represents 120 associations and 30 business chambers, after the first
round of discussions with government ministers and officials.
'They (businesses) want to pay more taxes but not the GST because it will
only give birth to corruption,' Mr Muneer added.
Mr Ahmed Mukhtar, commerce minister, said some of the objections from
businesses were being considered by officials for possible changes, but the
government would not consider any of the demands 'under pressure'.
Such confrontation between the government and business leaders is not unique
in the days after the budget. In previous years businesses have resisted
various budgetary measures, eventually forcing governments to back off or
partly tone down some of their proposals.
However, it was not clear last night if the two sides could reach a
compromise without one of them backing off on an important issue.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Hata starts talks on coalition with Social Democrats

<TEXT>
The minority government of Mr Tsutomu Hata, yesterday started talks with the
opposition Social Democratic party to save the ruling coalition from
imminent defeat.
Government officials will this morning meet the SDP for a second time, in an
attempt to persuade it to rejoin the coalition, so restoring its
parliamentary majority. This would ensure the failure of a no-confidence
vote by the largest opposition group, the Liberal Democratic party, which
could be launched as early as today.
The markets will watch the talks closely because the latest bout of
political instability has been a factor in exchange rate turmoil. It has
fuelled fears that the government will be unable to produce a convincing
package of deregulation and tax reform measures, due next week, so stoking
US frustration and putting more pressure on the yen.
If the SDP refuses to join forces with Mr Hata, and sides with the LDP, the
no-confidence vote will probably succeed, forcing Mr Hata and his cabinet to
resign. Mr Hata has said that he would not call an election, because that
would delay completion of a new electoral system, but leave it to other
parties to form a coalition.
SDP leaders yesterday indicated they are interested in rejoining Mr Hata's
camp. The party has agreed, in a document presented to the government, to a
rise in indirect taxation, the most controversial part of the coalition's
economic policy.
The SDP party also wants promises it will be more closely involved in
decision making, a sensitive point because formation of a centre right
grouping within the coalition, but excluding the SDP, prompted it to walk
out of the government in April.

FT  23 JUN 94 / UN backs French troop deployment in Rwanda: Security Council
reluctantly approves deployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France will begin sending troops into Rwanda today after the United Nations
Security Council last night agreed on their deployment to protect civilians
until an adequate UN force can be mobilised for the task.
The council acted with some reluctance on the plan for independent
deployment of French-led troops. The resolution did not mention France by
name, speaking only of a temporary multinational operation 'under national
command and control'. Ten of the 15 members voted for the plan. Brazil,
China, New Zealand, Nigeria and Pakistan abstained.
Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, said in Paris that France would
deploy 2,000 to 2,500 troops, 1,500 of them flown from bases in Africa.
He said Senegal had agreed to send troops along with France, and Italy was
considering sending up to 500 soldiers.
The mission, according to the UN resolution, will be strictly humanitarian
and 'conducted in an impartial and neutral fashion'. The troops will 'not
constitute an inter-position force' between the warring parties.
But Mr Claude Dusaidi, UN representative of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic
Front, was unconvinced. Shortly before the vote, he accused France of trying
to block an insurgent victory in the civil war: 'We shall resist French
intervention with all the means at our disposal.'
The rebels' opposition was a factor cited by members who abstained on the
French proposal. French officials said their troops would seek to protect
pockets of Tutsis in the western part of Rwanda held by the mainly Hutu
government forces. Mr Leotard said he had given his troops 'very precise
instructions to avoid any confrontation with the (rebel) forces'.
Mr Eduard Balladur, the prime minister, told the National Assembly France
could count on the military participation of Senegal and hoped for at least
logistic help from several European countries.
He said he had been in contact with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of
Italy, who has made Italian military participation conditional on the
agreement of both sides in the Rwanda conflict. France also had the 'active
political and logistic support' of the US, Mr Balladur said.
The operation is mandated for two months. It could be less if Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, manages to bring the small UN force in
Rwanda up to strength sooner than that.
His strong backing for the French initiative was critical to its success in
the council. Members were also influenced by his warning that it could take
up to three months for the projected 5,500-man all-African UN force to be
fully deployed. Lack of equipment and logistic support, as well as training
needs, are largely responsible for the delay.
The Russian delegate said before the vote that a multinational humanitarian
mission now was imperative and the representative of Djibouti said:
'Anything would be better that what exists.'

FT  23 JUN 94 / Beijing plans to double spending on telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China plans to spend Yuan450bn (Pounds 34bn) on its telecommunications
network to the year 2000, double previous estimates and including Pounds
4.6bn in funds from abroad.
Western experts in Beijing said the jump in projected spending reflected a
recognition by the government of a need to accelerate provision of
telecommunications services to match China's commercial aspirations.
Mr Wu Jichuan, minister of posts and telecommunications, said the funds
would be used to instal sophisticated switching equipment; provide 20,000km
of optical cables and 15,000km of digital microwave lines; build land
satellite stations and purchase sophisticated letter sorting equipment.
Investment in telecommunications has been rising rapidly in the past few
years with expenditures increasing from Yn40.4bn in 1993 to this year's
budget of Yn53.6bn.
Mr Wu said a 'small amount' of the telecommunications' funding requirements
would be covered by capital grants from the state. The bulk would come from
domestic and overseas loans.
China plans to have 110m lines installed by 2000. This would be sufficient,
according to telecommunications experts, to service 30 per cent of urban
dwellers and 5 per cent of those living in rural areas.
Mr Wu said China would be the world's largest telecommunications market next
century. 'Foreign investment is encouraged in all areas except the direct
management of telecommunications businesses or gaining control of a company
through buying stock,' Mr Wu told the official China Daily.
China is making determined effort to source most of its telecommunications
requirements locally by 2000. It has entered a number of joint ventures to
satisfy requirements.
Western experts say China will be 'pretty well self-sufficient' in switching
gear by the year 2000. They also expect the Chinese will seek more
sophisticated items from the international market to build its electronic
'super highway'.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Scientific press takes up detergent wars: Omo and Persil
under analysis as Unilever and Procter differ over triazacyclononanes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The soap war between detergents giants Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble has
bubbled over into a new arena: the scientific press. Today's issue of the
leading science journal Nature carries a highly technical analysis by 13
Unilever scientists of Persil Power and Omo Power, the detergent recently
launched by Unilever across Europe.
Procter has claimed the new powder, which was developed at a cost of several
hundred million pounds, damages clothes.
The paper gives a wealth of technical detail on the manganese-based catalyst
 -known as the Accelerator - which allows the new powder to wash at much
lower temperatures. However, it does not address the two main charges
levelled by Procter: that the Accelerator harms fabric, and that the
manganese builds up in clothes over repeated washings.
The magic ingredient in the new powder turns out to be a complex of
manganese metal with a series of organic chemicals known as
triazacyclononanes. It acts by speeding up the bleaching process which
removes stains.
The traditional bleach in detergents is hydrogen peroxide, which is slow to
act at temperatures below 600C. According to Unilever's researchers, powder
containing the Accelerator is two to three times more effective at removing
tea stains from cloth at 400C than the current generation of European
powders.
Unilever said the article had been written before the row with Procter had
erupted. 'We felt it was not an article on the general use of detergents,
but on the chemistry of manganese catalysts,' the company said.
Ronald van de Krol adds from Amsterdam: Unilever said sales of Omo Power in
the Netherlands fell in late April after Procter's claims were publicised.
Sales have partly recovered after widespread newspaper advertising, but
remain below the 'excellent' results when the product was first launched.
The company has asked Dutch shops to put stickers on Omo Power recommending
it be used at 400C or 600C. Test results have shown that damage to clothing
is highest when the detergent, designed for low temperatures, is used at
900C.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Keys budget confirms fiscal caution: New South Africa's
spending plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN and TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any fears that South Africa's business community might have had that
spending on righting the wrongs of apartheid would dent the new government's
commitment to fiscal discipline proved unfounded yesterday when the finance
minister, Mr Derek Keys, presented the African National Congress-led
government's first budget to parliament.
Indeed, initial reaction in markets both at home and abroad was favourable,
with business welcoming the budget's pro-investment thrust.
At the same time, an ANC election promise to abolish VAT on basic foodstuffs
and drugs was ditched because the fiscal implications would have been
'significant'.
In the words of one economist, 'it comes as a surprise to see an ANC
government handing out goodies to the corporate sector but not to the
masses'.
Mr Keys managed to keep the projected budget deficit close to the 6 per cent
of gross domestic product limit agreed with the International Monetary Fund.
He is forecasting a deficit of 6.6 per cent of GDP for the financial year
March 1995 on 3 per cent growth, or 6.4 per cent when the full collection of
a temporary income tax levy is taken into account. This compares with 6.9
per cent last year and, with some analysts arguing that the revenue
forecasts are conservative, the actual deficit could well be lower.
'The deficit's still a little high, but the emphasis is on investment rather
than consumption, which will help sustainable growth,' notes Mr Nick
Barnardt, economist at broker Ed Hern Rudolph,
Increases in social spending will be focused on the new government's
Reconstruction and Development Programme which, as previously announced,
will amount to R2.5bn (Pounds 458m) for the current financial year. Expected
future allocations come to R37.5bn over five years, although this figure is
subject to change. depending on future economic growth and political
pressures.
Ministers defended the decision not to abolish VAT on basic foods saying
that targeted spending programmes such as free health care for infants and a
school feeding scheme would do more to achieve poverty reduction than tax
cuts.
Particularly striking was the size of the costs of the transition at nearly
R4bn. This was largely due to greater than expected costs from the election
and the incorporation of former guerrillas into the army. To help finance
this, revenue will increase 11.2 per cent in the current year, thanks
primarily to a R2.6bn transition levy on individuals and companies.
Individuals will pay a 5 per cent surcharge on that portion of their income
in excess of R50,000 a year. Companies will pay a similar 5 per cent
surcharge on their profits.
Mr Keys and his deputy Mr Alec Erwin stressed that the transition surcharge
would be temporary and that the government would not seek excuses to
maintain it into the next financial year as a 'wealth tax'. Mr Keys's also
announced the appointment of an independent Tax Commission to restructure
the tax system.
A cut to 35 per cent from 40 per cent in the corporate tax rate is partly
compensated by the increase to 25 per cent from 15 per cent in the so-called
secondary tax payable on dividends.
The net effect will be an increase of R2bn in direct taxes, partly offset by
a R800m reduction in the import surcharge on capital and intermediate goods.
Mr Keys will also raise an extra R350m from increased 'sin taxes' on alcohol
and tobacco.
At 23.6 per cent of GDP, the tax take will be virtually the same as last
year, reflecting an anticipated 3 per cent growth in output this year.
Government spending at just more than 30 per cent of GDP, is forecast to be
slightly lower than last year.
After taking account of loan repayments, Pretoria faces a borrowing
requirement of R36.5bn (R33bn last year) almost all of which (R34.5bn) is to
be funded from domestic borrowing, with R1.8bn raised offshore. Mr Keys said
the breakdown between domestic and foreign borrowing would depend on market
conditions and the outcome of South Africa's quest for an international
credit rating, expected by the end of the year.
Social spending will absorb 45 per cent of the budget, up from 44 per cent
last year, with education accounting for 22 per cent, health 10.2 and social
security 9.3 per cent. Within health, 25 per cent of the budget will now be
diverted to primary health care, which has become a focus of President
Nelson Mandela's government.
Also notable has been the increase in the defence budget which the ANC
before the election had repeatedly identified as a sector from which much
money could be diverted to development. However, this year's allocation,
which has been swollen by transitional costs of incorporating former ANC
guerrillas into the army, rose to R12.1bn from R10.6bn. The total share of
defence has actually increased to 8.7 per cent of the budget from last
year's 8.1 per cent, but remains well down from 13.7 per cent in 1990/91.
Mr Keys' announcement that there would be no change to the current exchange
control regulations, despite widespread speculation in business circles that
some liberalisation was imminent, did not affect the markets and the rand
remained steady.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Anxious Japanese fearful of yen's strength: Worried
industrialists and financiers - and contented consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unthinkable suddenly became thinkable yesterday after the yen briefly
voyaged, for the first time, through the psychologically emotive barrier of
Y100 to the dollar.
This historic trip into unknown territory has reawakened corporate Japan's
fears that the unexpected strength of the currency might stifle the
country's fragile economic recovery, just as an unscheduled rise in the yen
did this time last year.
An anxious Tokyo government yesterday said it would step up efforts to reach
a trade agreement with the US, suspense over which has contributed to the
yen's rise, and seek co-ordinated currency market intervention with other
members of the Group of Seven. The yen hit a new closing high of Y100.65 to
the dollar in Tokyo yesterday, 12.6 per cent above its level at the turn of
the year.
'Rapid fluctuations would do harm not only to the Japanese economy but to
the world economy,' warned Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, after an
emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the yen's break through Y100 in New
York the previous night. He would not comment on why, by yesterday evening,
central banks had not jointly intervened, as they did last time the dollar
fell sharply against the yen, in May.
'There is a scream arising from Japanese industry,' added Mr Eijiro Hata,
minister of international trade and industry. The rise could not have come
at a worse time, in European and US markets after the Japanese government
had gone to bed, celebrating the day's announcement of a 3.9 per cent
annualised increase in gross domestic product in the first quarter, the best
performance for three years.
A satisfied Mr Tsutomu Tanaka, vice minister of the government's economic
planning agency, had at the time announced that - barring a yen shock -
Japan had now turned the corner, from its 37-month long economic slowdown,
the longest post-war decline.
The currency turmoil prompted the third consecutive daily fall in share
prices yesterday, leaving the Nikkei 225 index down 231.8 points at 20,581.
The Bank of Japan bought dollars heavily. But officials said there was no
change in monetary policy, on the grounds that the yen's rise was more of a
function of the dollar's weakness against the D-Mark, even if this could be
'negative for the economy'.
Most Japanese companies based forecasts of a recovery this year from four
years of profits decline on an exchange rate of about Y105 to the dollar.
They may therefore have to reduce their forecasts if the yen sticks at the
present level.
The impact, however, will be uneven. Export dependent sectors, such as
electronics lose 6.7 percentage points from annual pre-tax profits with each
one yen rise of the Japanese currency against the dollar, estimates Nikko
Research Institute. Car manufacturers lose 10 per cent of their profits for
every yen rise, estimates Miti's Mr Hata.
Car importers, by contrast, have been achieving record sales recently - 8.6
per cent of the Japanese market in May - thanks to the yen's strength.
Japanese consumers have seen prices of imported goods fall accordingly.
Unsurprisingly, they find it hard to understand the routine cries of alarm
from government and companies at every time the yen rises through a
psychological barrier.
This invites the question of whether the Finance Ministry is right to be as
worried as it is. The currency rise is not enough to choke the general
economic recovery, as happened last year, believes Mr Yusuke Kashiwagi,
senior adviser to the Bank of Tokyo and former vice minister of finance for
international affairs.
'I don't think this will hit recovery prospects. This recovery is consumer
led and not export led, so the exchange rate will affect the minds of
business rather than consumers,' he said. However, he admitted that the
volatile jumps in the yen's value were getting 'more and more unbearable' in
casting uncertainty over Japan's economic performance.
Mr Jun Saito, senior economist at the government's Economic Planning Agency,
believes managers are getting more worried by the yen's appreciation, rather
than learning to to live with exchange rate volatility: 'They are having to
make hard decisions on how to adjust.'
So far, corporate Japan has avoided the toughest decisions. It has avoided
making redundancies to reduce its high-yen inflated costs in line with
international competitors, so that consumers have been partly insulated.
However, companies have started to cut recruitment and have increased the
pace at which they move production out of Japan to cheaper locations.
According to a recent survey by the Yomiuri Shimbun daily, 70 per cent of
Japanese companies will recruit fewer new people this year. In the meantime,
the proportion of overseas production will rise from 7 per cent of the total
now to 12 per cent in the next two to three years, forecasts the Tokyo
office of Morgan Stanley. The latest yen shock can only reinforce those
trends, suggesting that Japan is unlikely in this decade to recover to the
fast economic growth of the 1980s. The yen's strength makes for a weak
economic dawn.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Seoul officials optimistic over talks with North: Summit may
be held as early as mid-July
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
South Korean officials yesterday expressed optimism that an unprecedented
summit meeting with North Korea will take place, after Pyongyang agreed to
discuss arrangements.
'The North Koreans' sincerity seems higher than at any other time in the
past,' said Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korea's foreign minister.
He described as 'encouraging' the North's quick approval of a proposal from
Seoul to hold a preparatory meeting for the summit on June 28, to be
attended by each side's deputy prime minister.
Previous attempts to arrange inter-Korean talks have been plagued by
procedural disputes, but this does not appear to be case so far this time,
Mr Han said.
North Korea suggested the summit last week when former US President Jimmy
Carter visited Pyongyang in attempt to mediate in a dispute over
international inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities.
Officials in Seoul believe the summit could be held as early as mid-July and
coincide with a new round of high-level talks between North Korea and the US
to discuss possible diplomatic ties. South Korea has no objection to the
normalisation of US-North Korean relations as long as Pyongyang 'is willing
to fulfil its international obligations and start behaving as normal and
law-abiding nation,' Mr Han said.
The US has suggested it will recognise North Korea if Pyongyang allows the
International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct full inspections of its
nuclear facilities.
In Brussels yesterday, the US and Russia agreed on a common approach towards
a possible United Nations Security Council resolution on sanctions to be
imposed on North Korea over the refusal to allow inspections.
The agreement between Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, and Mr
Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, appeared designed to exert
pressure on Pyongyang to make good its assurances to Mr Carter that it was
willing to freeze its nuclear programme.
'We have developed a common approach towards a sanctions resolution which
will integrate a possible international conference as well,' Mr Christopher
said.
Mr Kozyrev said: 'Right now, we should show quite clearly that sanctions
would be inevitable if North Korea does not take any positive steps.'
Mr Christopher said on Tuesday that the US was ready to put the campaign for
UN sanctions in abeyance if North Korea confirmed the assurances it gave to
Mr Carter.
A senior US official said the proposal agreed with Mr Kozyrev meant an
initial phase of sanctions against North Korea would take effect 30 days
after a resolution was enacted by the Security Council. Mr Kozyrev said:
'These 30 days should be used for the international conference, to avoid the
sanctions which of course are an extreme measure.'
The conference would include representatives of the UN, IAEA, South Korea,
North Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the US, American officials said.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Moscow warns Nato on allies from E Europe

Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, yesterday urged Nato not to
risk provoking public opinion in his country by rushing to welcome east
European countries as members of the alliance.
The appeal was made during a visit to Brussels for a Nato meeting hailed as
a landmark in Russia's links with the west. Representatives of Nato's 16
member states were gathered to honour Russia as the 21st, and most
important, member of Partnership for Peace, the military co-operation
programme.
The partnership is intended to broaden military links in Europe and the
former Soviet republics, setting up programmes for joint peacekeeping
exercises and grooming countries for Nato membership.
Mr Kozyrev told Nato many Russians needed convincing that the alliance was
not intent on a 'triumphant march eastwards'. He said a 'major psychological
adjustment' would be necessary before his fellow citizens could accept the
idea of countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic joining the
alliance.
In welcoming the Russian participation, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary
of state, said that 'by widening the reach of the great post-war security
and economic institutions, we can help ensure that war, poverty and
oppression never again engulf this continent'.
Mr Kozyrev shelved demands that Nato be subsumed by the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe, a loose club of 53 nations whose
current brief is more diplomatic than military, and said time would tell
which was the most important institution.
As well as signing up to the partnership, Mr Kozyrev and his hosts approved
a separate document that will usher in a broader relationship between Russia
and Nato, including a dialogue on European security issues.
But allowing Russia to negotiate this side agreement before joining the
partnership has dismayed central and east European states, who were told
they must adhere to PFP first and then refine their links with Nato.
Nato said it was satisfied that the document's final text did not give
Moscow any automatic right to sit in on their private discussions. Diplomats
said that in four days of haggling over the text, Russia showed goodwill by
agreeing to work from a western draft but it won some important concessions.
One was the exclusion of a phrase that would pledge Russia and Nato not to
interfere in each other's decision-making process. Another was the inclusion
of a reference to Russia's importance as a nuclear power.
David Gardner adds from Luxembourg: The last obstacle to concluding a
wide-ranging partnership agreement between Russia and the European Union,
leading to a free-trade zone by the end of the century, was removed
yesterday when the Netherlands endorsed the deal.
President Boris Yeltsin is to sign the accord tomorrow morning in Corfu, at
the summit of EU heads of government. The EU reached a similar deal with the
Ukraine in Luxembourg last week.

<TEXT>
Russia's lower house of parliament yesterday failed to pass the 1994 budget
at a third reading and came out strongly against President Boris Yeltsin's
decree against crime as it 'seriously limits the constitutional rights and
liberties of Russian citizens', writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
The votes, together with a swell of protest against proposals from Mr
Vladimir Shumeiko, leader of the upper house and an ally of Mr Yeltsin, to
prolong the terms of both the parliament and the president by two years
without election, marks a sudden militancy in a body which has been
relatively restrained in its six-month life.
The ground on which it is preparing to fight - that of the constitution - is
similar to that on which Mr Yeltsin and the previous parliament divided and
ultimately fought. The difference this time is that the constitution is Mr
Yeltsin's creation.
The vote on the budget, which had been expected to go through after two
lower house readings in which it gained large majorities, followed its
rejection by the upper house earlier this week. The upper house had demanded
an increase in military spending.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Ukraine's economy not on poll agenda: But links with Russia
are
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk appears to be defying the rule that
incumbents stand little chance of re-election in a recession. Despite the
record of his 30-month tenure - which has included a 40 per cent drop in
gross domestic product over the first four months of this year alone - Mr
Kravchuk is gaining in the opinion polls against his main challenger on
Sunday, the former prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma.
Indeed, repairing the economy, the main challenge facing Ukraine's next
president - is barely on the campaign agenda.
Instead, campaigning has focused on the shape of a proposed new
constitution, the status of the Russian language in a country with an
11m-strong ethnic Russian minority and the extent of alignment with Russia
itself.
Though Ukraine's leaders succeeded in creating an independent state from the
disintegration of the Soviet Union, they have failed to make it economically
sustainable, leaving its statehood fragile and beholden to Russia.
Ukraine is kept afloat by a large Russian subsidy (Dollars 1bn-Dollars 2bn
annually in unpaid oil and gas debts) while Kiev props up its
energy-wasteful heavy industries and subsidises its state farms with money
it does not have.
While the west has woken up belatedly to the fact that Ukraine's stability
is important for Europe, Ukraine has yet to face up to the fundamental
economic choice of whether to remain dependent on Russia or restructure its
energy-intensive industries and diversify its markets.
Asked why no one is talking about economics, Mr Mykola Mikhailchenko, the
president's chief domestic adviser, says: 'The majority of Ukrainians are
satisfied with the current path of reform.'
In fact economic dissatisfaction is widespread, but Ukraine's main power
brokers - the collective farm bosses, industrial directors and Soviet-era
bureaucrats - have so far had more success maintaining their positions than
reforming the economy.
The slow pace of privatisation - only 150 enterprises in the first wave of
the sell-off programme - has also meant the lack of a class of independent
owners with an interest in reform. Many private entrepreneurs have gone
underground to form a black economy which probably equals the official
economy because it is the only way to survive in Kiev's thicket of
restrictions and high taxes.
The only presidential candidate running on an economic reform platform, Mr
Volodymyr Lanoviy, is trailing with less than 10 per cent support in the
opinion polls. Even Ukraine's nationalist west has abandoned him,
unconvinced this 'Ukrainian Gaidar' could beat their main foe, Mr Kuchma.
The two main contenders offer populist promises. Mr Kuchma, a Soviet-era
missile plant manager who resigned as prime minister last September after a
power struggle with the president, says he will resurrect Ukraine's economy
by 're-establishing ties with Russia'. But he does not say whether he means
economic union, whereby part of Ukraine's sovereignty would be sacrificed to
Russia, or freer trade, which would require Ukraine to lift subsidies and
price controls as Russia itself has done.
The largely Russian-speaking eastern Ukrainians, particularly communists and
factory bosses, seek a return to pre-independence relations where orders
from Russian plants flowed in. They are strongly criticised by Mr
Mikhailchenko for not understanding 'that Russia is just not the same it was
two years ago - you can't just recreate the old connections now'.
President Kravchuk offers an even vaguer platform of simply 'developing
Ukraine's socially-oriented economy', but observers do not regard his record
as encouraging. Only last week he called for the indexation of savings, a
move which would cost Ukraine about Dollars 22bn, and parliament approved a
new wave of pre-election credits costing the state the equivalent of another
Dollars 444m.
Last winter the government tightened monetary policy and managed to reduce
inflation from 90 per cent monthly last December to only 5.2 per cent last
month. But the political fallout from the credit squeeze was too much to
bear and Kiev loosened the monetary screws in early spring. In April alone
the money supply grew 60 per cent.
With the desire to bail out ailing state enterprises winning out over the
battle against inflation, most observers believe that the next president is
likely to inherit a resurgence of inflation by the end of the summer and a
host of other problems which the campaign has not addressed.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Spain faces recession aftershocks: First-quarter growth
figures confirm central bank's optimism over recovery
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spain's recession is now over but its consequences will be felt for a
considerable time, the Bank of Spain said in its annual report published
yesterday.
Its optimism about the turnaround was confirmed by figures from the National
Statistics Institute showing economic growth of 0.8 per cent in the first
quarter against the same period last year. This was the first positive
growth in year-on-year figures for Spanish GDP since the third quarter of
1992, and exceeded the central bank's earlier estimate of 0.5 per cent.
The figure compared with a 0.2 per cent decline in the last quarter of 1993
and a 1 per cent reduction for last year as a whole. It reflected a 19.1 per
cent growth in exports in the quarter. Imports also rose by 4.5 per cent,
the first increase since 1992.
Internal demand continued to fall but at a reduced rate of 2.1 per cent
compared with 3.3 per cent in the previous period. The fall in gross fixed
capital formation, meanwhile, slowed to 5.8 per cent from 8.9 per cent.
The Bank of Spain report said recovery had begun to affect internal demand,
which could soon show 'moderately positive' growth. However, Spain faced
'enormous difficulty' absorbing its high level of unemployment, now running
at almost 25 per cent, and the effect that this would in turn have on the
country's economic growth potential.
Prospects for sustained growth and economic convergence with the richer
countries of the European Union were conditional on 'more balanced
macro-economic policies' and on greater success in reducing inflation and
tackling the high public sector deficit, the bank said. The inflation
differential between Spain and the three best-performing EU members remained
at about three percentage points.
Mr Luis Angel Rojo, Bank of Spain governor, said there was little room for
further reductions in short-term interest rates, after a succession of cuts
earlier this year. He said there would be 'great cautiousness' about
interest rate levels in Europe generally, and there would only be room for
further cuts in Spain if they reduced inflation and the public deficit.
'Any relaxation of monetary policy not justified by these factors would only
help to increase the risk of an unbalanced recovery,' he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary's Socialists, after their overwhelming victory in last month's
elections, have calmed fears of one-party rule by former communists by
agreeing yesterday to share power with liberals. Socialist party leader and
premier designate Mr Gyula Horn yesterday announced the concession of three
of 12 ministries to the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats. Mr Gabor Kuncze,
the central figure of the Free Democrats' campaign, is set to take the
powerful Interior Ministry, as well as the position of deputy prime
minister.
The Free Democrats have also won a right to consultation which comes close
to that of veto over government policies and appointments. But the
Socialists controversially take the Defence Ministry and the national
security office, two sensitive institutions which their communist
predecessors used to maintain their hold on power.
The Socialists won 209 of 386 seats and a majority in May's elections but
they and the Free Democrats have come under pressure to form a coalition.
Although the Socialists adhere to free-market and west-oriented policies,
the Free Democrats are widely seen as a guarantee that the former
communists' conversion will not be reversed.

<TEXT>
Turkey's prime minister Mrs Tansu Ciller went on the record yesterday to
deny allegations of official impropriety in her business dealings after
newspaper claims that she had used her office to acquire property in the US.
Mrs Ciller is under pressure to clear her name after a whispering campaign
about her business dealings and those of her husband, who publicly gave up
his licence as franchisee of the US fast food chain 7-Eleven when she became
prime minister last year. Mrs Ciller told the official Anatolia news agency
she had not declared the assets when she became an MP in 1991 because the
properties were owned by Marsan, a Turkish-registered company in which she
and her husband are shareholders. Moreover they were acquired before she
became a minister. Milliyet, a Turkish newspaper cited documentation
alleging the prime minister and Mr Ozer Ciller were the owners of a hotel,
shopping centre and villa near Salem in Oregon, properties acquired since
she was appointed to the cabinet in 1991.

A strike by French rail workers against planned job cuts badly disrupted
train services yesterday, and fewer than half the trains were running in
many areas of the country, according to SNCF, the state railway company. The
strike, which is due to last until this morning, forced the cancellation of
most of the trains on the high-speed TGV network between Paris and the
southeast, SNCF said. TGV traffic between Paris and the southwest was cut in
half, while service to the north was normal. Commuter services into Paris
were cut in half except from the eastern suburbs, where they were only
slightly disrupted. The communist-led CGT union called the 34-hour strike.
Another drivers' union, the FGAAC, backed the strike to demand talks on
working conditions on the Channel tunnel line.

Electrolux, the world's leading household appliance maker, said yesterday it
had received approval from the European Commission for its DM730m (Pounds
294.3m) acquisition of AEG Hausgerate, the white goods arm of Germany's AEG
industrial group. The takeover, which will now take effect from October 1,
will bring Electrolux alongside Whirlpool of the US in global white goods
sales, extend its lead in total appliance sales and give the Swedish group a
commanding position in Europe's white goods markets. Together, Electrolux
and AEG Hausgerate have annual appliance sales of more than Dollars 9bn.
Combined with AEG, Electrolux will have a white goods market share in
western Europe of at least 25 per cent, against 15-19 per cent for
Bosch-Siemens of Germany and 11-15 per cent for Whirlpool Europe.
The Commission issued its approval of the takeover after a one-month review.
Electrolux said the Commission's main concern had been over its position in
Scandinavian markets, where its share is now set to rise significantly above
its share in other European markets.

The Czech Republic is to begin a big sell-off in the next two months of
stakes in several hundred companies where the state remains a majority
shareholder, Mr Roman Ceska, deputy privatisation minister and chairman of
the National Property Fund, the state holding company, said yesterday. It is
expected that up to a third of the Kc150bn (Pounds 3.5bn) worth of assets,
involving mainly commercial and industrial companies in which the NPF
retains a majority stake, will be offered for sale to domestic and foreign
buyers by the end of this year. Some of the offers will be advertised
internationally. Companies to be included in the sell-off include Chemicke
Zavody Sokolov, one of the country's biggest chemical companies, in which
the US company Dow Chemical attempted to buy a stake two years ago. The deal
fell through after the two companies failed to agree a price, and the NPF
has remained as the company's majority shareholder. Mr Ceska, who took over
from Mr Tomas Jezek as NPF chairman 13 days ago, said the state intended to
offer each stake in its entirety to a single buyer and sell to the highest
bidder.
The move is likely to be the last big sell-off by the government. Its
voucher privatisation system, in which an estimated 6m Czechs bought
vouchers enabling them to bid for shares in two tranches of companies being
privatised, has so far resulted in the partial or complete privatisation of
nearly 2,000 Czech enterprises, representing over 80 per cent of the
country's economic activity.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Kohl wants early decision on Delors successor

<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany last night threatened to call a special
European summit as early as next month to settle the succession to Mr
Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission.
Mr Kohl's move turned up the pressure on Mr Ruud Lubbers, outgoing Dutch
prime minister, to withdraw his candidacy either during the two-day summit
in Corfu starting tomorrow or soon after. This would clear the way for Mr
Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier, who is backed by France and Germany.
Mr Kohl was attending a meeting of Christian Democrat leaders in Brussels,
which included Mr Lubbers and Mr Dehaene. The deadlock at the meeting
appears to increase the risks of an embarrassing stalemate in Corfu at the
weekend, though hints of a future compromise emerged.
Mr Wilfried Martens, president of the EPP, the umbrella group for Christian
Democrats in the EU, said he was 'convinced' that the Belgian or Dutch
governments would drop their respective candidates if one or the other was
in a 'clear minority'.
Belgian officials estimate that they have eight or nine firm votes in favour
of Mr Dehaene. The Netherlands and the UK, which supports Sir Leon Brittan,
chief EU trade negotiator, are opposed to Mr Dehaene. Spain declared for Mr
Lubbers yesterday. Portugal and Italy appear uncommitted.
Mr Kohl urged EU leaders to resolve the dispute to avoid a confrontation
with the new European parliament, which intends to scrutinise the new
Commission president.
British Conservative rightwingers last night stepped up pressure on the UK
to veto the appointment of Mr Dehaene. The Bruges Group - whose honorary
president is Baroness Thatcher, the former premier - said Britain 'must' use
its veto to send a message the 'federalist Franco-German axis will not
irredeemably dictate the future of Europe'.
Meanwhile the row over the way Italy exceeds its EU milk production quota
also threatens to disrupt the Corfu summit and jeopardise the agreement
reached at the 1992 summit to increase the revenue base from next year.
After three days meeting in Luxembourg, agriculture ministers of the 12
looked unable to resolve the controversy. Ministers at the meeting said
Italy's delegation appeared to be under instructions from prime minister
Silvio Berlusconi to stick to its guns.
Two years ago Rome agreed to cut its excess output in exchange for a quota
increase tonnes. But in March, Brussels said Italy had not cut enough. Italy
then produced new figures saying its output had all along been
overestimated.
The UK meanwhile had taken the Commission to the European Court, because it
had reduced the fine for excess output by Italy. Mr Berlusconi wants the
case dropped, and the new quota arrangements made retroactive to take
account of the revised output figures. This would wipe out a large part of
the fine, a move Germany opposes, saying it would cost its taxpayers
Ecu800m.
But Italy says that unless it gets satisfaction, it will not ratify the
Edinburgh agreement on revenue, necessary to increase flows of regional aid
from next year.

Mr Rudolf Scharping, the embattled leader of Germany's opposition Social
Democrats, lost his cool with his party comrades yesterday, and they loved
it.
In an angry and even passionate speech to the pre-election conference of the
SPD, he demanded party discipline, denounced his detractors, and sought
above all to galvanise the delegates out of a mood of mid-election blues.
They responded with a resounding vote to back him as the party candidate to
challenge Mr Helmut Kohl for the chancellor's office in next October's
general elections - with 479 votes out of 502 in his favour, or more than 95
per cent.
For a man who has made his name as super-cool and massively self-controlled,
to the point of being dull and wooden, it was a remarkable performance. It
was also an essential one for the party and its leader, to revive their
hopes of defeating Mr Kohl.
The venue was the giant indoor ice rink on the outskirts of Halle, in the
east German state of Saxony-Anhalt. On Sunday, the local electors vote in
another critical poll for a state parliament, which the SPD must hope to win
to recover momentum in the current election marathon.
Yesterday's conference came just 10 days after the party suffered a severe
reverse in the European elections, losing five percentage points to score
just 32 per cent - its worst result since direct European elections began in
1979.
When Mr Scharping rose to speak yesterday, it was against a background of
bitter recriminations in party ranks and widespread blame for his lacklustre
leadership and failure to challenge Mr Kohl head-on for the chancellorship.
'He is absolutely colourless, much too bland. No wonder the PDS are stealing
our votes,' said Mrs Edith Braun, mayor of Stendal in Saxony-Anhalt, before
he started to speak.
And yet he was preaching to the converted, for they were longing to hear
good news.
'There is a majority for change in this country,' he said. 'A party which
believes in itself, in itself and its goals, can win the confidence of
Germany, and a majority.'
He flatly rejected any suggestion the SPD should commit itself to a future
coalition with the Greens, as its left wing wants to do. 'We are not for
spelling out our alliances,' he said. 'We are involved in an election
campaign, and every other party is our competitor. Anyone who suggests
otherwise damages the chances of the SPD to win a majority.'
He admitted he was accused of being too dry and emotionless, but he was
capable of being angry, too. 'Anyone who wants to defeat me wants to defeat
the SPD. That is what is behind it,' he said. The applause rolled in.
He safely won a five-minute standing ovation.
But much still depends on the outcome of Sunday's state poll. The SPD was
still 1.5 points behind the CDU in the state, according to last week's local
council elections. Mr Scharping needs a clear win to launch his campaign for
the chancellor's office.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: French consumption down
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French household consumption of manufactured goods fell 0.9 per cent in May,
compared with April, but the trend for the current quarter is still upwards,
the Economics Ministry said yesterday. The ministry said decline in
household consumption reflected the sharp increase in spending in April.
Household consumption in April grew by a revised 1.8 per cent, partly
reflecting government incentives for car buyers. Economists in Paris said
spending in May was still 0.6 per cent higher than March and 1.1 per cent
higher than the average for the first quarter. Even with flat consumption in
June, they said second-quarter consumption should still show an increase of
1.5 per cent over the first three months. John Ridding, Paris
Dutch seasonally adjusted manufacturing production fell 2.0 per cent in
April compared with March, but non-seasonally adjusted manufacturing
production was up 1.9 per cent year-on-year, the Central Bureau of
Statistics said.
Swedish gross domestic product rose by 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of
1994 from the fourth quarter of 1993 and by 1.4 per cent compared with the
first quarter of 1993, the Central Bureau of Statistics said. Industrial
production rose 2.1 per cent in April against March and 10.6 per cent
year-on-year.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Flexibility on state aid wins support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A majority of EU industry ministers yesterday threw their weight behind a
commission proposal to allow a flexible interpretation of state aid rules,
in order to secure crucial capacity cuts in Europe's battered steel
industry.
At a meeting in Luxembourg ministers were persuaded by Mr Karel Van Miert,
competition commissioner, that this was the only way to resurrect the steel
rescue plan, which now - after weeks of uncertainty - looks set to survive.
Only the UK and Denmark had reservations. They were worried that the
commission would set a bad precedent by allowing state aid to be paid to
steel mills in northern Italy in return for only partial closures of the
enterprises.
Under EU law, state aid is not supposed to be used to fund partial closures,
but because of complex cross-ownership links among the Brescia mills, not
all companies linked to steelmaking will close under the terms of the rescue
plan.
'I am not entirely happy with what the commission proposes to do,' said Mr
Tim Sainsbury, UK industry minister. 'That part of the plan that does not
involve closure of full enterprises is not justified. I have reservations
about how effectively the closures can be monitored and whether or not they
will result in real reductions in capacity.'
But Mr Van Miert said the commission intended to improve monitoring of the
capacity cuts. It has agreed to take action against enterprises that do not
meet the conditions for state aid payments, possibly by asking them to repay
the aid.
Mr Van Miert believes the reductions at Brescia will secure a further 5m
tonnes of capacity cuts, taking total production reduction under the plan to
around 16m, still short of the envisaged minimum capacity cuts of 19m
tonnes.
Although the commission did not need council assent on the steel plan, which
falls under the competence of the commission, it was eager to get the
political support of the member states.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Italian milk row could disrupt Corfu summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The row over the way Italy exceeds its EU milk production quota threatens to
disrupt the Corfu summit of EU leaders which begins tomorrow and jeopardise
the agreement reached at the 1992 Edinburgh summit to increase the EU
revenue base from next year.
After three days meeting in Luxembourg, agriculture ministers of the 12
looked unable to resolve the controversy.
'I can't see that it's going to be done except at Corfu,' a European
Commission official said. Ministers at the meeting said Italy's delegation
appeared to be under instructions from prime minister Silvio Berlusconi to
stick to its guns. The ramifications of the conflict are wide.
After former prime minister Giulio Andreotti startled his partners by
forcing milk on to the Lisbon summit agenda two years ago, Rome agreed to
cut its excess output in exchange for a quota increase tonnes. But in March,
Brussels said Italy had not cut enough. Italy then produced new figures
saying its output had all along been overestimated.
The UK meanwhile had taken the Commission to the European Court, because it
had reduced the fine for excess output by Italy, and to a lesser extent
Greece and Spain, from Ecu3.2bn to Ecu1.3bn (Pounds 1bn). Mr Berlusconi
wants the case dropped, and the new quota arrangements made retroactive to
take account of the revised output figures. This would wipe out a large part
of the fine, a move Germany opposes, saying it would cost its taxpayers
Ecu800m.
But Italy says that unless it gets satisfaction, it will not ratify the
Edinburgh agreement on revenue, necessary to increase flows of regional aid
from next year.
Senior officials from Germany and the UK - the two largest contributors to
the EU budget - hint that this would not make them unhappy. But it would be
'a bit of a mess', as a British official understated it. The EU would be
unable to agree a budget for 1995.
The row could also affect ratification in other countries, notably the
Netherlands, set to become the largest net contributor to the EU budget on a
per capita basis.
Officials in Brussels and at Luxembourg are speculating that Mr Berlusconi
may have reached a deal with Chancellor Helmut Kohl at their recent meeting.
This would include milk, Italian backing for Belgian prime minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as Commission president, and German
efforts to mobilise the EU behind an Italian candidate - former trade
minister Renato Ruggiero - to head the new World Trade Organisation.
That would still leave the British court case to be resolved. But senior EU
diplomats note that the UK is anxious to cement an alliance with the more
Eurosceptical Berlusconi government.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Guinness cashes in on Irish glory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ireland's success in the World Cup is creating a windfall for Guinness, the
brewer, which has seen stout sales surge on both sides of the Atlantic.
Some pub landlords in Britain have ordered 'emergency supplies' of Guinness
after the Irish footballers' triumph over Italy lifted sales to five times
their normal level.
In Britain, where Guinness generally sells about 1m pints a day, pubs and
Irish clubs - particularly those in areas such as north-west London,
Coventry and Merseyside which have large Irish populations - report strong
sales.
'The Irish have a knack for turning a sports event into a party,' said
Guinness.
But English, Scottish and Welsh football fans, bereft of their own teams to
support in the World Cup, are also jumping on the Irish bandwagon and
ordering pints of Guinness - promoted on television by Jack Charlton, the
Irish team manager.
Guinness, which is sponsoring the Irish team, readily admits that much of
the evidence for the sales surge in Britain is anecdotal, since it has yet
to compile figures.
Nevertheless, one pub landlord in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, said his
customers downed more than 1,000 pints of Guinness as they watched Ireland's
1-0 victory over Italy - more than four times normal sales.
In the Irish Republic, where 420m pints of stout are bought every year and
Guinness is estimated to have 90 per cent of the market, the company said
its sales have risen 15 per cent in the week since the World Cup started,
compared with the same period last year.
This was in spite of a strike by Dublin bar staff last Saturday, timed to
coincide with Ireland's opening match against Italy, which closed half the
pubs in the Irish capital. Happily, the dispute has been resolved.
In the US, where Guinness sales were already growing strongly, Irish bars in
New York and Orlando, Florida, where the Irish team is now staying, are
doing brisk business quenching the thirst of the estimated 18,000 Irish
supporters.
Sales in Orlando are twice the 1993 level while in New York, where Ireland's
first match was played, the Guinness sales representative believes 50,000
pints of Guinness will be sold this month - up between 70 per cent and 80
per cent on the same period last year: 'It's like a month-long St Patrick's
day,' she said.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Telegraph cuts price to 30p in fight with Times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Conrad Black declared war in Britain's broadsheet newspaper market last
night by cutting the weekday cover price of the Daily Telegraph from 48p to
30p. The move brings the price of the newspaper down to that of The Times,
which was reduced to 30p in September.
'This is war and no one goes to war in other than a sober mood but we are
market leader and we will protect our position,' said Mr Black, the
Telegraph's chairman.
Last night, The Independent reacted by cutting the price of the newspaper
from 50p to 20p - but for today only. It said it would review pricing
policy.
The Telegraph's retaliation came after 10 months of insisting it would not
match the price of The Times. But in April the Telegraph's circulation
dipped below 1m for the first time in more than 40 years. There was a
further fall in May to 993,395 as The Times reached record sales of 515,000.
Mr Black said Telegraph sales were now above 1m but he was not 'going to sit
like a suet pudding' and allow any competitor to attack his share of the
market.
The move will cost the Daily Telegraph Pounds 40m in a full year, and Mr
Black admitted there would be an effect on profits 'for some years',
although much of the cost would be offset by cost-cutting and tax relief.
The board said it intended to maintain current dividend levels.
Less than two weeks ago, Mr Black told the annual meeting of Hollinger,
whose interests include 57 per cent of the Telegraph group, that circulation
of the Daily and Sunday Telegraph was 'quite satisfactory' in spite of
cut-price competition.
But he said he would consider 'remedial action' if The Times' circulation
rose to more than half that of the Telegraph.
The price of the Saturday edition and the Sunday Telegraph will remain at
70p each, although the group has a weekend offer of the two for Pounds 1.
Mr Max Hastings, editor-in-chief of the Telegraph said: 'The Daily Telegraph
readers have remained extremely loyal, with 96 per cent continuing to
purchase the paper despite the dramatic price cutting activities elsewhere.'
Mr Black said last night that when Hollinger sold Telegraph shares worth
Pounds 73m on May 20 he had no intention of cutting the paper's price, but
May circulation figures had changed his mind.

FT  23 JUN 94 / S Africa imposes wealth tax and curbs spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's new government yesterday presented its first budget, a
cautious document demonstrating a commitment to fiscal and financial
discipline while attempting to meet the needs of the poor.
The budget was the first real test of the economic policy of the multi-party
government of national unity which took power just six weeks ago. It was
widely welcomed by investors, who approved of its restraint on spending.
Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, who presented the budget to parliament in
Cape Town, said his aim was to have 'the best of both worlds . . . social
justice and aggressive growth'.
It was a difficult balancing act, achieved in part by imposing what amounts
to a wealth tax to cover the costs of transition - in particular, the
expense of integrating guerrilla armies into the South African Defence Force
and of excess spending on April's all-race elections.
The one-off tax will primarily affect white taxpayers and white-owned
companies and is levied at 5 per cent on annual incomes above R50,000
(Pounds 8,920).
If white taxpayers received a shock, poorer blacks will be no better
pleased. Excise on cigarettes was raised by 25 per cent, and that on some
beer types by as much as 33 per cent.
The extra revenue will make it possible to reduce last year's budget deficit
of 6.9 per cent of gross domestic product to 6.6 per cent in the year to
March 1995.
Government spending will rise only marginally in real terms, in spite of
R2.5bn spending on President Nelson Mandela's 'reconstruction and
development' programme, a plan to build houses and provide health care and
education denied to blacks under apartheid.
That spending will be funded entirely from savings in other budgetary areas.
Government spending on reconstruction is due to rise to R5bn next year,
R7.5bn the following year, R10bn and R12.5bn in subsequent years.
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party and a
cabinet member of the government of national unity, said the budget 'could
not have been better'. Johannesburg financial markets closed little changed.
Mr Keys defended the wealth tax, which is likely to be the most

FT  23 JUN 94 / Clinton defiant over dollar's fall: US currency steady -
Investors urged to concentrate on 'strong fundamentals'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton responded defiantly yesterday to downward pressure on
the dollar in global financial markets, urging investors to pay more
attention to strong US economic fundamentals.
'This is the first time in 30 years that we have had growth in the economy
with no inflation led by investment that will create jobs,' he said.
Mr Clinton's remarks were reinforced by upbeat comments on the US economy by
Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US
Treasury secretary. Their concerted remarks followed overnight intervention
by the Bank of Japan and combined to help the dollar and stock and bond
markets.
But in Tokyo, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, Japan's finance minister, warned that
'rapid fluctuations' in exchange rates 'would do harm not only to the
Japanese economy but to the world economy'. The Japanese government had
called an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the yen's renewed strength.
Early today in Tokyo the dollar, which had dipped below Y100 on Tuesday, was
quoted at Y101.5, as bankers reported renewed intervention by the Japanese
central bank immediately after the opening.
The dollar's bright start in Tokyo this morning continued a firmer trend
begun yesterday in London, where it closed at Y100.695. In New York it
finished at Y100.95.
The US currency also steadied against the D-Mark, finishing at DM1.6006 in
London and DM1.60535 in New York after dropping below DM1.59 in the previous
session.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day 16.8 up at
3,724.77, its first advance in three sessions.
The benchmark US long bond was trading up  29/32 by early afternoon at 86
3/32 . It closed at 86 9/32 , pushing the yield down to 7.397.
Mr Clinton gave no sign of wanting to change domestic policies in response
to external financial pressures.
'We'll just have to keep working on our fundamentals and know that in the
end the markets will have to respond to the economic realities,' he said.
The US is in its fourth year of a steady economic expansion. The
unemployment rate has fallen to 6 per cent and the annual inflation rate is
less than 3 per cent. Most countries are still struggling to emerge from
recession.
Behind Mr Clinton's words is the confidence that the US economy is less
vulnerable to damage from currency volatility than most countries because
the share of trade in gross domestic product remains low.
Mr Clinton's claim that US economic achievements were being undervalued was
echoed both by Mr Greenspan and Mr Bentsen. The Treasury secretary said he
was 'concerned by recent movements in the exchange markets'. The US and its
Group of Seven partners would 'continue to be prepared to act as
appropriate' - a veiled reference to possible concerted intervention by
central banks in support of the dollar.
Speaking on Capitol Hill, Mr Greenspan said the economic outlook was 'as
bright as it has been in decades. Economic activity has strengthened,
unemployment is down, and price trends have remained subdued.'
Mr Greenspan said many investors were too pessimistic about the outlook for
US inflation. Long bond yields were 'higher than they should be' because
they embodied an excessive 'inflation premium'.
European bond and stock markets took some comfort from the more stable
dollar and from Mr Greenspan's testimony.
In Frankfurt, the Dax stock market index rose 11.15 in normal trading hours
to 1,994.42. After hours, it added another 10 to 2,004.93. In Paris, the CAC
Index jumped 26.26 to 1917.04. In London, markets were also given a boost by
the publication of the minutes of the May meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke,
chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England.
The minutes indicated that the authorities saw no immediate need to increase
UK interest rates. The FT-SE 100 Index recovered some of its recent losses,
rising 20.2 to 2,960.4, while the September long gilt future gained nearly
two points.

Christiania Bank, Norway's second largest bank, yesterday unveiled its offer
to acquire Vestenfjeldske Bykreditt, a domestic mortgage institution, which
values the company NKr255m (Dollars 36.69m) higher than its market level on
June 9, the last day its shares were traded on the Oslo bourse.
Christiania has offered NKr575m for Vestenfjeldske, or NKr195 a preference
share and NKr85 an ordinary share. Only the preference shares are listed on
the Oslo bourse. They last traded at NKr133.
The Bergen-based mortgage institution has assets of NKr7.4bn. 'The bid
reflects the view of Christiania's board that Vestenfjeldske's range of
products complements Christiania Bank's loan products in strategic terms and
that the market for fixed rate interest loans secured by mortgages on real
estate will continue to be attractive in the coming years,' the bank said.

PepsiCo, the US soft drinks company under pressure along with its rival,
Coca-Cola, from own-brand colas in western markets, yesterday launched its
latest thrust into post-communist eastern Europe when it opened a
manufacturing and distribution facility in Prague, its largest to date in
central and eastern Europe.
The plant, located in a building originally designed as a munitions factory,
is the result of an Dollars 85m investment in the Czech Republic, and is
expected to produce up to 150m litres of Pepsi products a year. PepsiCo has
also opened seven sales and distribution centres around the country.
Mr Wayne Mailloux, president and chief executive of Pepsi-Cola European
Beverages, said the company expected sales of Pepsi products in the Czech
Republic to rise to Dollars 100m annually by the end of the decade.
Sales in the past year had grown four-fold and should double in two years,
Mr Mailloux said, though he declined to give figures.
PepsiCo estimates that the Czech Republic has the highest soft drinks
consumption rate of any country in central and eastern Europe. Per capita
consumption is low, however. Czechs drink an average 220 8oz servings a
year, compared with 770 in the US. The company also claimed that sales of
Pepsi now equal those of its fierce rival, Coca-Cola, in Prague.
Mr David Jones, president of Pepsi-Cola International's eastern Europe and
central Asia division, said Pepsi and Coca- Cola between them account for
just 40 per cent of the soft drinks market in the Czech Republic, compared
with 90 per cent in the United States. 'There is plenty of room for
everybody to compete,' he said. 'There are enormous opportunities for soft
drink companies.'

Colonia, Germany's third largest insurance group, yesterday reported a sharp
increase in pre-tax profits for last year and predicted that earnings in the
current year would again be satisfactory.
Mr Claas Kleyboldt, chairman of the German insurer, which is a subsidiary of
UAP, the largest insurance group in France, said the group had improved
pre-tax profits to DM308.9m (Dollars 189.5m) up from DM248m in the previous
year. Earnings per share climbed to DM55 from DM37.50.
The improvement reflected a combination of reduced claims and increased
premium income, a trend which had continued in the current year to date, Mr
Kleyboldt said.
In 1993, the gross premium for what is to be known as the CKAG group rose by
11.4 per cent to DM13.6bn, while the ratio of money paid to settle insurance
claims to premium income in mainstream insurance business fell by 2.3
percentage points.
In the life insurance sector, payments to policyholders increased by 9.3 per
cent compared with an 11 per cent rise in premium income.
In the first four months of the year, premium income at the group's two
non-life insurers - Colonia Versicherung and Nordstern Allgemeine
Versicherungs - increased by 9.6 and 7.9 per cent respectively, while claims
expenditure decreased. Premium income at Colonia Lebensversicherung and
Nordstern Lebensversicherung, the two life subsidiaries, rose by 8.7 and
13.3 per cent respectively.
Income from investments rose 37.1 per cent to DM128.3m. The group is
rationalising its domestic operations to make Colonia a more efficient
competitor to Allianz, the biggest insurer in Europe, and Aachener und
Munchener Beteiligungen, the second biggest German insurer.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Berlin poll call as link to far right revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Berlin's coalition government, or Senate, was last night thrown into turmoil
after party officials said they would call new elections failing any
agreement on the future status of the interior senator.
The Social Democrats, who are in coalition with the Christian Democrats,
have insisted that Mr Dieter Heckelmann, the senator responsible for
interior affairs, should resign after it was disclosed that his press
spokesman had ties to a far right-wing group of intellectuals known as the
'Tuesday Circle'.
Mr Heckelmann, CDU, has already survived two votes of no confidence by the
SPD. But yesterday, the Party for Democratic Socialism, the successor to the
former east German communist party, and the Greens/Bundnis 90, which groups
together environmentalists and independent movements, called for another
no-confidence vote.
Mr Eberhard Diepgen, the CDU mayor of Berlin, and Mr Ditmar Staffald, head
of the Social Democrats, said they would be forced to call elections if they
could not resolve the dispute.
Last night, Mr Diepgen said the elections would probably take place in
October, when the federal, and other state elections are held. The coalition
has been in power since 1992. He said a confidence vote would be a 'hostile'
gesture that would destabilise the coalition. 'If it comes to a
destabilisation of the coalition - and a vote of no confidence is
destabilising - then I would prefer calling new elections,' Mr Diepgen said
at a news conference.
The coalition's existence hinges on the SPD, which last night said they
would decide soon if they would hold another confidence vote.
They are likely to face pressure to call for another formal vote since its
support in Berlin, particularly east Berlin, is drifting increasingly to the
PDS.
During the elections for the European Parliament, the PDS received more than
44 per cent of the votes in Berlin-Mitte, the heart of Berlin before the
second world war, and over 40 per cent in east Berlin as a whole.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK vows to back Brittan at Corfu summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British government insisted yesterday it would maintain its backing at
the European Union summit in Corfu this week for Sir Leon Brittan as the
next president of the European Commission.
Hinting that Mr John Major, the British prime minister was prepared to see
the decision on the successor to Mr Jacques Delors deferred until a special
summit in the autumn, senior officials refused to discuss the candidacy of
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister. Instead they said the prime
minister would insist that Sir Leon would make an 'excellent president'.
But the officials pointedly side stepped the question of whether Mr Major
would use Britain's national veto, stressing instead that the 12 heads of
government were obliged to reach a 'consensus'.
In Rome, the Italian government made clear yesterday it was prepared to
bargain hard over the choice of a successor to Mr Delors.
Mr Antonio Martino, the Italian foreign minister, told parliament it was
vital to link the choice on the succession to the broader issue of obtaining
a strong Italian presence in running international organisations.
'All the current candidates have the qualities to make excellent
presidents,' Mr Martino told the foreign affairs commission of the chamber
of deputies. 'But the issue is of the utmost importance and cannot be
resolved in a hurry.'
In weighing up the various candidates, it was important 'to take account of
the balance among member countries in the allocation of senior posts in
other international organisations which are shortly due to be filled'.

FT  22 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar stocks hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weakness in the US dollar, which fell to a 50-year low against the Japanese
yen, hit companies with a big US presence. Among the main victims were
leading oil issues, which are big dollar earners and consequently failed to
benefit from the rising price of Brent crude. Near-month Brent prices hung
just below Dollars 18 a barrel, but Shell Transport, which is hosting a
meeting for analysts in the US this week, ticked back 13 1/2 to 682 1/2 ,
while BP dipped 5 1/2 to 398 1/2 p.
Bowater, the printing and packaging group, shed 15 to 435p ahead of a visit
by analysts to one of its US plants. Elsewhere, internationally traded
stocks RTZ and Reuter International moved back 18 to 832p and 10 1/2 to 446
1/2 p and Carlton Communications fell 11 to 830p. And BAT Industries lost
the benefit of a recommendation from one leading securities house, turning
round from an early 10p rise to close 9 1/2 off at 391 1/2 p.
Barclays was one of the big casualties in the FT-SE 100 as marketmakers
chopped prices in disappointment that the bank had finally lost its tax
battle with the state of California. Although the news is not expected to
make a material difference to the bank's profits the shares fell 14 1/2 to
531 1/2 p.
TSB shed 2 1/2 to 222 1/2 p ahead of tomorrow's first-half figures as Lehman
Brothers reiterated its cautious stance on profits from the pick-up in the
housing market. Lehman forecasts profits of Pounds 215m, against a wide
range of between Pounds 195m and Pounds 235m. It acknowledges that there is
mortgage volume growth but says this has been undermined by increased
competition from companies such as Direct Line, subsidiary of Royal Bank of
Scotland, which outperformed its rivals with a fall of only 3 1/2 to 428 1/2
p.
Lehman adds that Abbey National, which fell 9 1/2 to 405 1/2p, and Bank of
Scotland, down 3 at 183p, also face tighter margins.
Food manufacturer Hazlewood Foods lost ground after warning that trading in
the first months of this year was 'significantly below' expectations. The
shares closed 21 weaker at 122p with a hefty 4.7m shares traded.
Profits came in at the lower end of market forecasts at Pounds 48.1m - a
fall of 7 per cent from the previous year - mostly due to a Pounds 3m
exceptional charge. Sales rose 5 per cent to Pounds 800m. The dividend also
rose 5 per cent, to 6.7p.
Shares in building group Tarmac closed at 144p, a rise of 7, which dealers
put down to a technical bounce after recent weakness. There was also talk of
one broker, believed to be NatWest Securities, moving the stock from a sell
to a hold.
Thorn EMI held relatively steady in a waek leisure sector. The shares fell
only 5 to 1034p following the defeat of rock star George Michael in his
legal battle with Sony.
There were fears that if Michael was able to break his contract with Sony,
other record companies would suffer a musical brain drain.
Manweb continued the regional electricity companies' (recs) results season,
delivering a 16 per cent rise in the dividend to 24.35p, while profits were
increased from Pounds 111.2m to Pounds 126.3m. The shares firmed 2 to 681p.
In a brighter day for the recs, East Midlands put on 11 at 579p and
Yorkshire added 8 1/2 at 559p.
Some cautious comment on British Steel's figures released on Monday,
together with general profit-taking, left the shares trailing 3 to 136p
after trade of 7.2m.
New FT-SE 100 constituent GKN relinquished 13 to 581p as Monday's buying by
index funds faded. 'Lively demand' is how one trader described the day's
business in engineering group FKI. The shares improved 2 to 170p, with
turnover standing at 4m by the close.
Shares in freight group NFC shrugged off recent weakness to close 5 ahead at
187p after James Capel published a buy recommendation.
The agency broker said the decline in the shares implied that the recent
concerns over the pension credits 'are discounted and we are beginning to
see signs of the new management strategy producing results'.
Dealers in Eurotunnel continued to suggest that the take-up of the Channel
tunnel Pounds 858m rights issue, which closes today, would be poor. The
shares eased a further 7 to 276p.
A big seller and news that Rentokil had made five acquisitions worth Pounds
4.3m saw the shares fall 7 1/2 to 199 1/2 p.
Bank note manufacturer De La Rue stood out against the trend as a shortage
of stock saw the share price squeezed 14 higher to 882p. Buying was prompted
by talk of a recommendation and forecast upgrade from agency broker
Henderson Crosthwaite, as well as encouraging news over the growth of
'smart' cards, manufactured by De La Rue.

FT  22 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tussle in Arjo Wiggins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A tussle developed over Arjo Wiggins Appleton's share price yesterday
between two of the City's blue chip investment firms - SG Warburg and
Cazenove. The struggle prompted unusually high turnover of 4.1m shares on an
otherwise quiet day.
In the pessimist's corner, Warburg was arguing that the recent rise in paper
prices had been discounted in the share price of the paper manufacturer and
distributor. The securities house told clients that on the basis of the
Warburg current-year profits forecast of Pounds 170m, Arjo was on an
expensive p/e ratio of 21 times earnings. For this reason, Warburg has
turned seller.
In the optimist's corner, Cazenove, which never comments on market reports,
was believed to have raised its 1994 profits prediction by Pounds 10m to
Pounds 175m.
On balance, Warburg appeared to be victor in the market skirmish as Arjo
Wiggins shares underperformed a falling market to end the session 6 cheaper
at 258p.

FT  22 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar uncertainty weakens share
prices again - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An attempt to rally from Monday's setback in the UK equity market was
thwarted yesterday afternoon when renewed selling of the dollar undermined
both shares and government bonds in London. Trading volume increased sharply
from the low level of the previous session.
At the day's low, the FT-SE 100 Index was barely 5 points above the closing
low for the year of 2,931.9, recorded at the beginning of this month. A very
modest rally left the index finally at 2,940.2 yesterday, a loss of 30.9 on
the session.
Once again, domestic factors took a back seat in a market now thoroughly
unnerved by the focus on the US currency and bond markets. There was little
response to the announcement of an unexpectedly high deficit of Pounds 767m
on UK non-European Union trade in May.
UK stocks opened higher behind a better tone at the close of the New York
bond market. Some modest bargain hunting was reported but share prices soon
drifted off as London awaited the opening of the new Wall Street session in
bonds and equities.
The blow to confidence was delivered by the gilt-edged sector, which
followed other European bonds in reacting sharply to news that the US
current account deficit for the first quarter was the worst figure for five
years. As long-dated gilts, steady in early trade, plunged by around a full
point, the equity market turned off. An early premium on the September
future on the Footsie futures contract quickly turned to a discount, and the
Footsie fell away steadily to show a net loss of 34.4.
The broader market followed the blue chip sector downwards, although the
focus on futures-related stocks took some of the pressure off the second
liners. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 16.8 off at 3,461.9.
Trading volume was very slow to gather speed, and Seaq volume was still
under 300m shares at midday. But increased selling in the afternoon took the
final Seaq figure to 544.5m shares. On Monday, Seaq volume of 460.1m shares
reflected genuine retail, or customer, business worth only Pounds 856.5m.
This placed Monday's turnover among the lowest daily totals for the year and
bore out indications that fund managers had simply stayed out of the market
as the Footsie Index crumbled by nearly 52 points.
Several leading commentators on the UK stock market repeated earlier advice
that shares are cheap and should be bought at these levels. Clear signs of
bargain hunting brought a few share gains but the buyers were highly
selective and soon vanished when the market came under pressure again.
There were widespread falls across the leading sectors of the London market.
Weakness on Wall Street overnight, carried through into a fall of 13 points
on the Dow during London hours yesterday, brought further losses in the blue
chip oil stocks whose strength sustained the market last week. Nervousness
over the dollar was heightened by reports that the US press had quoted an
unnamed Federal Reserve official as confirming the Fed's worries over the
dollar and readiness to raise interest rates to protect it.
UK strategists could see no reason why the bearish mood in European bond
markets should change overnight. Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve, will today address US House Budget Committee.

FT  22 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures traded at a discount to cash for most of the session and
pulled the cash market lower, with dealers concerned by the weak dollar and
falls in bonds, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September contract on the FT-SE 100 Index started trading at 2,972 and
briefly moved ahead to 2,982, a small premium to cash, as some dealers
adjusted their books.
There after the direction was downward for the rest of the day, with trading
influenced by currency factors and declining bonds. The uncertain near term
outlook for interest rates and inflation was also cited as a factor for the
poor business in the morning.
September tumbled heavily in the afternoon after Wall Street opened lower,
and dragged the cash market below the 2,950 level.
The future finished at 2,938, down 35 from its previous close and at a
14-point discount to its fair value premium of about 13 points.
Volume fell to 14,339 contracts, highlighting the decision of many
institutions to remain on the sidelines.
It was also a poor day in the traded options, where turnover eased back to
29,929 contracts, of which 13,743 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option.
A seller of the August 180 calls in Rolls-Royce made it the most active
stock option with a closing total of 2,567 lots transacted.

FT  22 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow tumbles as dollar hits
yen low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US equities tumbled yesterday after the dollar briefly hit a post-war low
against the yen and a pivotal technology company issued a profits warning,
writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 33.93 weaker at 3,707.97. The
index fought back from a 55-point deficit after the New York SE imposed its
'uptick' restrictions on program-guided sales in the final hours of trading.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 4.14 at 451.34, while
the American SE composite receded 4.32 to 431.87. NYSE turnover was a fairly
heavy 298.7m shares.
Among the leading indices, the Nasdaq composite suffered the sharpest
setback. It came on the heels of Lotus Development's announcement that its
second-quarter results would disappoint Wall Street. After opening the week
with a 1.2 per cent decline, the index dropped a further 10.06, or 1.4 per
cent, to close at 708.79.
The pessimistic mood in equities refused to budge yesterday after two
previous sell-offs. But early on, the damage was mostly confined to a few
issues.
The most notable was Lotus. The software company plunged Dollars 14 3/8 , or
about 28 per cent, to Dollars 37. At least one Wall Street securities house,
Merrill Lynch, lowered its rating on the stock after the company's
announcement.
For most of the morning, the broad range of equities drifted lower in
lacklustre activity as the day's economic news elicited little reaction. The
Commerce Department said the US trade deficit had widened in April to
Dollars 8.4bn, from a revised March figure of Dollars 6.87bn.
Instead, investors were focused on developments in the foreign exchange
markets. After drifting lower in early activity, the dollar suddenly lurched
below Y100 just after midday. The action triggered a fresh decline in bond
prices, and a wave of program-guided selling in equities.
Among the Dow industrials, the cyclicals were the chief culprits.
Caterpillar, which was facing a strike by 14,000 employees represented by
the United Auto Workers Union, was marked down Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 102
1/8 . General Motors lost Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 51 7/8 .
Mascotech, a supplier of motor vehicle components, dropped Dollars 2 3/4 to
Dollars 14 3/4 . Mr Jack Kirnan, the Salomon Brothers analyst, had lowered
his rating on the issue after the company indicated that earnings were
likely to come in at the low end of forecasts.
Takeover news, or rather the lack of it, also had an impact on share prices.
Quaker Oats plunged Dollars 8 3/4 to Dollars 73 1/4 after Nestle denied
speculation that it had plans to acquire the US food group.
US Healthcare fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 40 1/2 , giving back more than
it had gained in the previous session on expectations that a merger
agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson was imminent.
On the Nasdaq, many technology issues followed Lotus in a downward spiral,
with some analysts identifying the profits warning as another sign of
flagging demand in the industry. Apple dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 26
and Applied Materials lost Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 38 7/8 .
The selling spilled over into Big Board issues as well. Texas Instruments
retreated Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 74 1/4 and Micron Technology Dollars 1
1/8 to Dollars 31 1/8.
Canada
Stocks in Toronto fell sharply again in moderate trading, in line with other
major world stock markets.
The TSE 300 composite index finished 40.9, or 1.0 per cent, lower at
4,047.5. On Monday the index dropped 1.64 per cent. Yesterday was the sixth
straight day of decline for the index. Losing issues outpaced winners by 664
to 184, while volume came to 65.3m shares, compared with Monday's light
47.2m. Trading value amounted to CDollars 839m.
All but one of the 14 stock groups lost ground, led by industrial products
and real estate, which were off 2.05 and 1.78 per cent respectively.
Consumer products declined 1.68 per cent, energy stocks fell 1.30 per cent
and banking slipped 1.0 per cent. The golds sector gained about 1 per cent.

FT  22 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil dips 3.4 per cent after revised
inflation forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equities in Sao Paulo ended 3.4 per cent down in weak volume following the
drop in foreign markets, but some traders predicted bargain hunting for
today.
The Bovespa index fell 1,102 to close at 31,276, after scraping 30,922
earlier in the afternoon and having edged as high as 32,885 at the opening.
Turnover was Cr493.2bn (Dollars 205m).
One negative influence on trading was an upward revision of inflation
forecasts, to 50 per cent from 48 per cent.
In spite of yesterday's performance, some brokers said they expected the
market to improve today due to optimism ahead of the government's plan to
cut inflation and introduce a new currency, the real, on July 1.
Mexico
Shares finished weaker for the third straight session, as slack trade
exacerbated the effect on the market of the drop in the Dow Industrial
Average on Wall Street.
The IPC index of 37 leading shares fell 25.92 points, or 1.14 per cent, to
2,257.69. Turnover was an anaemic 39.3m shares. In the broader market,
declining issues outnumbered rises by 59 to 9.

FT  22 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: S African industrials drop as investors
await budget details
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial stocks fell sharply amid continuing uncertainty in the world's
financial markets and ahead of today's South African budget announcement.
Brokers noted that a midsession recovery in industrials had proved
unsustainable in line with weakness among European equities.
Gold shares were more active as they tracked the move in the price of
bullion, which rose above Dollars 390 an ounce. The overall index ended 9 up
at 5,721, industrials fell 26 to 6,594 and the golds index added 18 at
2,245.
De Beers and Anglos rebounded after early losses, reflecting an improvement
of sentiment in mining-related stocks. De Beers gained R2.25 at R115 and
Anglos closed R4 ahead at R238. Gencor slipped 15 cents to R11.95.

FT  22 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Scant comfort from strategists
as bourses fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strategists who had picked on the potential ills of European bourses in
recent months had little comfort to offer after yesterday's showing, writes
Our Markets Staff.
Mr Sushil Wadhwani of Goldman Sachs, who recommended commodities as an
investment last October, said bourses could go higher on a six-month
horizon, but that significant near-term risks remained.
Mr Albert Edwards of Kleinwort Benson, who has made commodity price rises,
and their effect on inflation, one plank in his argument against global
equities in general and Continental bourses in particular, was still bearish
last night.
Mr Edwards's keynote yesterday was dollar weakness, pushing US bonds still
lower and European bonds and equities down after them. He expected this to
continue, especially since gold bullion seemed to be pushing towards Dollars
400 an ounce. 'This impacts directly on to US inflationary worries,' he
said. 'In addition, the US Federal Reserve has said that it is monitoring
the gold price ahead of its next decision on short-term interest rates.'
FRANKFURT did not trust Monday afternoon's partial recovery, but it
incorporated most of it during the official session, the Dax index closing
14.45 higher at 1,983.27. However, as analysts forecast on Monday, the Dax
went on to test the support level of 1,950 again, closing yesterday's
post-bourse at 1,957.08.
Turnover eased from DM8.9bn to DM8.3bn. Mr Edgar Benischek, head of trading
at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, said that equities, again, were driven by
weakness in US bonds and their effect on the German bund future which, at
worst, was another 35 basis points lower late yesterday afternoon.
The big three banks put in a weak or relatively weak showing, especially
Commerzbank, which fell DM7 to DM305 on the session and another DM5.40 to
DM299.60 in the post-bourse. Rumours have been moving around the sector
about involvement with derivatives losses at the flooring company, Balsam,
Germany's latest corporate disaster, and yesterday it was apparently
Commerzbank's turn to be linked with the story.
PARIS resisted the downtrend until the afternoon when signals from London
that US bonds were weakening, and liable to slip back further provided the
incentive for investors to sell. The CAC-40 index dipped 12.26 to 1,890.78,
in turnover of some FFr4bn.
Brokers said that there had been relative calm in the morning, with few
institutional investors wanting to deal until indications emerged on the
direction of the US. But when the Matif began to slide equities were soon to
follow, although the CAC pulled back from a session low of 1,878.
The equity market has fallen more than 10 per cent in this current account
period which ends tomorrow.
There were few corporate features on a day heavily influenced by outside
events, although Eurotunnel lost a further FFr1.35 to FFr23.85 ahead of the
close of its rights issue.
MILAN staged a technical bounce, the Comit index rising 7.0 to 678.63
although continuing worries on the economic outlook restricted trading
mostly to domestic investors.
The market drew some comfort from data suggesting that June inflation would
ease to 3.7 per cent from 4.1 per cent in May, and comments from the prime
minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, that he saw no reason for higher interest
rates.
Mediobanca picked up L239 to L14,650 after Monday's 4.9 per cent fall. The
postponement of its planned rights issue was expected to help the market
digest other current cash calls.
Luxury hotel group Ciga rose L35 to L1,105 amid renewed speculation that
Sheraton, currently the largest shareholder, will raise its stake.
AMSTERDAM retreated 1.6 per cent as the AEX index fell through the 380
technical support level to close the session off 6.15 at 376.69. Turnover
was reported to have been low.
Equities took their cue from options again; brokers also noted that negative
sentiment took hold in the absence of any major corporate news. The Dutch
brokers, MeesPierson, hoped that the publication of second quarter company
results later this summer would provide a stimulus for the market's
recovery.
The chemical and publishing sectors bore the brunt of the day's weakness
with Akzo, for example, off Fl 3.10 at Fl 196.70 and Elsevier slipping Fl
1.60 to Fl 153.40.
Polygram provided a rare chink of light, rising 30 cents to Fl 74.20, as it
benefited from a court judgement in London which found that the singer,
George Michael, could not break his contract with Japanese company, Sony.
MADRID offered an early and tentative recovery but wilted in the afternoon
on the weakness of the dollar.
The general index finished 5.62, or 1.9 per cent, weaker at a new 1994
closing low of 296.98.
Turnover stayed high at around Pta54bn, but this time a third of that total
was attributed to block trades in Bankinter, linked to plans to cancel the
bank's holdings of its own stock.
Severe weakness was seen in the construction group, FCC, strong recently
after an initally unenthusiastic response to the company's capital raising
plans; FCC fell Pta790 to Pta13,760, and Gas Natural by Pta470 to Pta9,900.
ZURICH gave up an early, 37 point gain to finish flat on futures-led
selling, with the weak dollar and Wall Street's early performance
undermining the mood. The SMI index lost 0.8 at 2,544.2.
Banks, under pressure in recent days on the uncertain outlook for interest
rates, put in a steadier performance. SBC rose SFr10 to SFr373.
Elektrowatt gave up SFr8 to SFr346 in response to first half figures that
were below expectations, and as James Capel revised down estimates for 1994
and 1995 earnings.
WARSAW plunged to its lowest level since last October in shrinking volume,
brokers said, with no institutional demand being seen from either domestic
or foreign investors.
The all-share Wig index fell 483.2 or 6.1 per cent to 7,410.6 as turnover
fell nearly 30 per cent.

The sharp fall in international stock and bond prices dampened confidence,
and the Nikkei 225 average dropped 1.6 per cent to below the 21,000 level
for the first time since June 6, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index surrendered 338.87 at 20,813.16 on profit-taking and arbitrage
selling, having opened at the day's high of 21,076.22 before falling through
21,000 in early trading. It hit a low of 20,759.45 just before the close.
The Topix index of all first section stocks plunged 20.50 to 1,663.97, while
the Nikkei 300 shed 4.12 to 301.52. Declines led gainers by 948 to 130, with
118 issues unchanged.
Volume dipped to 380m shares from 416m as most investors remained inactive
as the yen strengthened against the dollar. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index eased 0.83 to 1,354.17.
Dealers and arbitrageurs liquidated index-linked positions, while some
domestic institutions and foreigners were seen bargain hunting around the
day's lows.
A Japanese broker said the Nikkei 225 appeared to have found technical
support around 20,900, but he added that the next support level was around
the 75-day average of 20,260.
High-technology issues continued to face selling on worries over the yen's
appreciation. NEC declined Y30 to Y1,240 and Sony Y120 to Y6,160. Automobile
stocks were also weak, with Toyota Motor receding Y30 to Y2,170 and Honda
Motor Y40 to Y1,890.
Mitsubishi Oil, the day's most active issue, bucked the trend by rising Y50
to Y1,050. Reports that it had discovered oil off the coast of Vietnam
prompted active buying.
The rise in long bond yields hurt interest rate-sensitive utility shares.
Electric power companies were among stocks hitting lows for the year, with
Chubu Electric Power down Y30 to Y2,580 and Kansai Electric Power off Y20 at
Y2,570.
Large-capital issues were down on profit-taking, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
slipping Y11 to Y771.
The rise in gold and other metal prices supported Hitachi Metals, which
gained Y20 at Y1,210. But Sumitomo Metal Mining, which has been rallying on
the same theme, lost Y10 at Y988 on profit-taking.
In Osaka, the OSE average retreated 343.69 to 23,217.22 in volume of 131.5m
shares.
Roundup
Weakness in bonds around the world depressed most of the equity markets in
the region. Bombay and Karachi were closed for public holidays.
HONG KONG fell for the second straight day on rising US long bond yields and
news that Hongkong and Shanghai Banking was considering a further tightening
of its mortgage lending rules. The Hang Seng index ended 140.40, or 1.6 per
cent, lower at 8,857.78 in thin turnover of HKDollars 2.6bn.
The property sector led the losses, its sub-index dropping 2.4 per cent.
Cheung Kong shed 50 cents to HKDollars 34.75 and Sun Hung Kai Properties
HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 46.
HSBC Holdings finished the day unchanged at HKDollars 85.
SYDNEY fell through the 2,000 level to end with the All Ordinaries index
30.8 lower at 1,993.6. Brokers blamed the dramatic drop on the bond market,
amid inflationary fears.
Commonwealth bonds moved down to their lowest levels in 27 months yesterday.
The September 2004 T-bond was yielding 9.81 per cent late in the afternoon,
up from 9.61 per cent previously.
Equity turnover amounted to ADollars 664m. Bridge Oil topped the activity
charts with 13.37m shares changing hands. The takeover target closed steady
at 85 cents.
SINGAPORE and KUALA LUMPUR reflected overnight falls in US and European
markets. The Straits Times Industrial index relinquished 22.63 to 2,261.87
and the KLSE composite index slid 24.00, or 2.3 per cent, to 1,011.46. In
Singapore, a trader said speculators sold out. In Kuala Lumpur, dealers said
some institutions were trimming their portfolios to avoid over-exposure.
TAIPEI dropped below the 6,000 support level on a weak financial sector and
bearish international markets, the weighted index losing 89.44, or 1.5 per
cent, at 5,948.97. Turnover shrank from TDollars 57.7bn to TDollars 46.7bn.
In financials, which led last week's gains and were hit by heavy
profit-taking, China Trust shed TDollars 2 to TDollars 65.50.
MANILA bemoaned Philippine Long Distance Telephone's weakness in New York as
the composite index receded 40.09 to 2,814.59. Turnover rose from 507.2m to
895.4m pesos.
PLDT, the market heavyweight, following a Dollars 1 7/8 fall to Dollars 61
5/8 on Wall Street, closed slightly over one per cent lower at 1,675 pesos.
BANGKOK added domestic politics to more general concerns, worries about
rifts in the ruling coalition helping the SET index fall 23.96, or 1.8 per
cent, to 1,329.32.
COLOMBO bucked the trend, its all-share index making its first double-digit
gain in five weeks to close 18.34 higher at 927.76, but brokers said the
rise was not sustainable.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar dips below Y100
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US currency plunged through its post-war low against the yen in late
European trading yesterday as markets attempted to tease out central bank
action in its support, writes Motoko Rich.
After closing in London at Y101.225, down from Y101.970, the dollar crashed
through the psychological barrier of Y100 and hovered below the post-1945
low of Y100.35. In New York it finished at Y100.335 and DM1.5942, having
earlier ended in London at DM1.6009.
Analysts were puzzled by the dollar's fall as it defied economic
fundamentals, namely a narrowing of the US trade gap with Japan. As central
banks remained silent, economists warned of a crisis of confidence in the US
currency if concerted intervention did not occur.
The Australian dollar reached its highest level against the US dollar since
August 1992, around Dollars 0.744, after reports from the Australian reserve
bank suggested that interest rates would rise sooner rather than later.
A narrowing of the US's trade gap with Japan was set in a context of a wider
than expected US April trade gap and the highest current account gap in five
years.
The US's trade gap rose 22.1 per cent to Dollars 8.40bn, from March's
downward revised figure of Dollars 6.87bn. The trade gap with Japan narrowed
by 5.6 per cent to Dollars 5.48bn.
The markets ignored the Japan figure, and chose to focus on the overall
trade number, as well as the US's first-quarter current account gap of
Dollars 31.90bn, cited at its highest for five years.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economist at Bank of America, said all of these figures
were sufficiently close to market expectations and therefore were treated as
excuses rather than specific triggers for the dollar's fall against the yen.
Shaky political conditions in Japan made the dollar vulnerable, with markets
expecting an imminent vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's
government. 'Anything that brings forward the collapse of the Hata
government is probably bad for the resolution of the trade dispute' with the
US, said Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW.
The bearish market, which was wary of central bank intervention earlier in
the day, battered the dollar in late trading to test the resolve of the
banks.
'The bottom line is that the central banks must come through with aggressive
intervention,' said Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at
UBS. 'They must go in together and stay in to push the dollar to higher
technical levels.'
Without such action, Mr Chertkow warned that the dollar would test new lows
against the yen and the D-Mark. 'The dollar will continue to slide and will
move as low as Y90 or even Y80.'
A report was circulating in the late afternoon that a senior official at the
US Fed had said it was unlikely to raise interest rates merely in response
to the dollar's weakness.
Reports from the Australian reserve bank saying it would lift interest rates
sooner rather than later, and rising commodity prices, buoyed the Australian
dollar to its highest level against the US dollar since August 1992.
The Australian dollar was trading against the US unit at Dollars
0.743-0.744. 'Most economists had expected no change in rates until the
fourth quarter of this year,' said Mr Turner. 'But now there is speculation
that it is imminent.'
The D-Mark remained strong on the crosses, showing little reaction to news
that the German M3 money supply data for May rose a smaller than expected
13.7 per cent, from 15.4 per cent in April.
'The response to the M3 was muted,' said Mr Hawkins. 'The headline figure
was below expectations but some of the components were still high, which
suggests that any movements downward in the money supply are going to come
about quite slowly, so the market impact was quite limited.'
Against the French and Belgian francs, the D-Mark ended in London at
FFr3.418 from FFr3.417 and at BFr20.59 from BFr20.61, and it also closed at
L987.4 from L989.4.
The Bundesbank announced that it was setting a tender for 14-day variable
repos to replace DM64.2bn in funds which expire today. Analysts are
expecting another cut of five basis points today from last week's 5.05 per
cent.
German call money was little changed at 5.00/5.10 per cent.
Sterling followed the dollar's trend against the D-Mark for most of the day,
pushed downwards by a disappointing non-EU trade deficit. But the pound
finished in London at DM2.4612, from DM2.4606, and it was little changed
against the dollar, closing in London at Dollars 1.5374 from a previous
Dollars 1.5393.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided assistance of Pounds
515m at established interest rates after it forecast a shortage of around
Pounds 500m. The overnight lending rate traded between 5 and 3 1/2 per cent.
The short term sterling contract for December settled at 93.68 from 93.70.
The December Euromark contract closed unchanged at 94.78.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: High freight costs floor
Russian coal exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD MCCLOSKEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russian coal producers and exporters are waiting despondently for the first
anniversary of a bizarre government measure that has catastrophically
damaged the whole industry's export efforts. Without warning, last August
the transport ministry lifted the charge for carrying coal to levels that
virtually brought exports to Europe to a standstill.
Although some higher grade coals have managed to find their way on to house
coal markets, a year later the damage to exports is profound, with a Dollars
30 rail charge in place for movements from the Kuzbass, Russia's biggest
coal producing region, to the Baltic. With fob prices on the Baltic of
around Dollars 2,600 for steam coal, the effect on the export business has
been total.
Pressure for the producers to get the rail rates reduced to levels at which
they can undertake their business profitably has brought little response
from the authorities, save for the setting up of a coal transport company,
Transugol, whose activities most of the producers puzzle over, 'They've done
nothing; they have been invisible,' one of the producer representatives said
last week.
The benefits to the rest of the world's coal producers, particularly for
those who supply the spot steam coal market, has been immediate, with a
steady recovery in spot prices since August last year.
At that time, some South African business was being conducted at about
Dollars 19 fob Richards Bay, a price that has risen to Dollars 28 this month
and that most traders and producers predict will recover throughout the
year.
If the Russian transport authorities relent and return rail charges to
levels at which their exporters can once again compete, the risk is that
much of the additional tonnage will be restricted to the spot steam coal
market once again.
So large is the potential tonnage that could become available that it might
once more overwhelm the capacity of the market and drive down prices.
At a time when the world is becoming extremely short of coal and demand is
growing in Asia the potential of the Russian exporters to capitalise on the
situation should be substantial.
But they can only achieve this with some show of goodwill and assistance
from the government. And this, so far, is not forthcoming.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Minister warns of Caspian oil
risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yuri Shafranik, the Russian energy minister, has warned international oil
companies that investment in the huge oil and gas reserves in the Caspian
Sea is fraught with risk.
In an interview in the Petroleum Argus newsletter, he says that 'because so
far there is no legal division of the Caspian (between Russia, Kazakhstan,
Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, which all border it). . . I would advise you at
the least, be careful'.
Mr Shafranik refers to a letter sent by the Russian foreign ministry to the
British Embassy in February, with special reference to a treaty signed
between Azerbaijan and the UK regulating talks on a deal to exploit the
large oil reserves off Baku, the Azeri capital. The talks have been going on
for over three years between successive Azeri governments and a consortium
of major oil companies led by BP.
The letter says that the Caspian is 'an object of joint use, within whose
boundaries all issues of activities, including resource development, have to
be resolved with the participation of all the Caspian countries. . . any
steps by whatever Caspian state, aimed at acquiring any kind of advantages
with regard to the areas and resources of the Caspian Sea, run counter to
the interests of the other Caspian states and cannot be recognised'.
None of the companies involved has made any direct comments on the
situation. But most appear to accept that Russian involvement in Caspian
projects would be acceptable as long as it did not undermine the commercial
viability of projects.
The minister says that the investment climate for western oil companies has
improved with the adoption of new laws. An agreement to prospect for oil on
the Sakhalin shelf will be signed this month, he says, and 'a whole series
of agreements will follow'.

Continued concerns about supply tightness in the US Midwest kept the OIL
price rally going yesterday, defying forecasts of a 'correction' following
the Dollars 2 - a - barrel gain over the past week.
COFFEE futures showed resilience, meanwhile, with Monday's shake-out being
recovered with interest.
At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices tended slightly lower as the
market tried to consolidate recent gains and build a base for a further
advance.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Upgrade will extend life of NZ
smelter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL

<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Comalco and its Japanese partner Sumitomo are to invest NZDollars 400m
(Pounds 155m) in upgrading the Bluff aluminium smelter to extend its life
well into the next century.
Mr Kerry McDonald, chief executive of Comalco NZ, said that the
modernisation programme was essential; without it the smelter, New Zealand's
biggest producer of manufactured exports, would have had to be closed,
possibly within five years. The upgrade is linked with the granting of
controversial new concessional electricity supply agreements to the year
2012 with the government-owned Electricorp. The low tariff has drawn
criticism from other manufactuers and consumers.
Mr McDonald said that the agreement removed a major area of uncertainty and
laid the foundations for the future development and operation of the
smelter. He said recent output performance justified the investment. Studies
showed the upgrade, which will improve the smelter's technical capability
and competitiveness, would contribute net benefits of NZDollars 500m to the
economy.
Production will rise from 270,000 to 313,000 tonnes a year and further
improvements will be allowed for. The third potline will be given additional
cells, which will use electricity more efficiently.
About NZDollars 100m will be spent on upgrading the air discharge systems to
reduce gaseous fluoride and particle emissions. The work is expected to be
completed in 1996.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian bureau forecasts 7%
increase for commodity basket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
World commodity prices are expected to rise by 7 per cent overall in 1994-5,
although the picture for individual commodities is extremely mixed,
according to latest forecasts from the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and
Resource Economics.
The predicted overall rise is attributed to the steady pick-up in economies
worldwide, and would compare with a fall of 3 per cent in Abare's total
commodity index in 1993-94, despite the fact that commodity prices generally
bottomed out in the September and December quarters of that year. In 1992-93
the index fell by 8 per cent.
The government-owned forecasting unit said that prices of wool, aluminium
and base metals were all expected to be higher in year-average terms but
that 'given the rapidity with which these prices rose in the June quarter
1994, some downward corrections may occur in early 1994-95'. The wool market
indicator price is forecast to average 585 cents a kilogram in 1994-95,
compared with 508 cents in the current year; prices for primary aluminium
are predicted to rise by one-fifth to average USDollars 1,430 a tonne; gold
prices are forecast to average USDollars 383 a troy ounce in 1994, and
USDollars 390 in 1995.
Meanwhile, sugar and cotton should also 'remain buoyant' in year-average
terms, but prices could begin to fall in the latter half of 1994-95 as world
production recovers strongly. Australian beef prices are also set for a
'substantial' rise, says Abare, predicting that the sale yard indicator
price for cattle will increase by over 19 per cent, to 280 cents a kilogram
in 1994-95.
The darker spots are the Australian dairy industry, affected by adverse
trade developments (including a suspension of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade minimum price for butter), and the coal and iron ore
sectors. The annual round of negotiations with the Japanese steel-mills and
power industry buyers have already ensured that prices of coking and thermal
coal and iron ore will fall in the current year.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Organic EU farm policy proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Soil Association, the body that promotes organic farming in the UK, has
called on the European Commission to adopt a system of farm management
agreements as a way of further reforming the Common Agricultural Policy. The
system would ensure that farmers stick to environmental guidelines.
Mr Patrick Holden, director of the Soil Association, believes the Commission
should establish a set of guidelines for farmers to follow as a minimum to
qualify for income support under the CAP. This whole farm management
agreement could then form the basis for other bolt-on environmental measures
according to region, soil type and farmer preferences.
'Everyone agrees that the CAP is fiendishly expensive and highly unpopular.
. . we also know it has wreaked havoc and untold destruction on the
environment,' he said.
He points to the urgent need to rationalise existing environmental schemes
which 'remain underfunded, overlap considerably and urgently require
rationalisation within a single policy mechanism'.
The Soil Association's suggestions are contained in a policy statement
titled 'Subsidies Without Set-aside', which highlights the fundamental
difficulty of attracting farmers to organic methods - the problem of
recovering the higher cost of production in the market place.
It says: 'Since the market place offers relatively few rewards for farmers
who voluntarily modify their production methods to benefit the countryside,
additional policy mechanisms are needed to encourage farmers to change their
ways'.
In addition, sustainable agriculture, which has become the latest buzzword
in Brussels is interpreted in a number of ways by different producers. 'Some
of these low-input, low-output systems can mean almost anything the farmer
wants them to,' says Mr Holden.
He maintains that the management agreements could set out specific
guidelines for cutting the use of artificial inputs which would be easier to
police than some of the vaguer concepts currently in use.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wood pulp producers announce
more rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Several North American wood pulp producers have announced their fourth price
increases this year amid growing fears of a strike later this summer by
pulp-mill workers in British Columbia.
The latest rises, which are due to be implemented in July and August, will
bring the price for northern bleached softwood kraft pulp, the industry's
staple product, up to about USDollars 620 a tonne, from the current level of
Dollars 560. Prices sank as low as Dollars 390 a tonne a year ago.
Mr Rodney Young, president of Resource Information Systems, a US
consultancy, linked the proposed price increase mainly to forthcoming
negotiations on a new labour contract in British Columbia. But he also
pointed to 'booming' markets in south-east Asia, and a pick-up in European
and Japanese demand.
Canada's pulp industry, which makes up more than a quarter of world pulp
shipments, is currently operating at full capacity, up from 80 per cent a
year ago.
Many paper mills are cushioned from rising pulp prices by having access to
their own raw-material supplies. But a trader at Trebor, a New Jersey-based
paper broker, said that the surge in pulp prices had squeezed some
producers, especially of tissue, who are struggling to pass the increases on
to their customers.
Uncertainty about shipments from British Columbia has been heightened by a
dispute that has broken out in advance of the actual contract negotiations.
Two unions representing 12,000 BC pulp mill workers have so far rejected
management efforts to move from an industry-wide agreement to mill-by-mill
bargaining. The BC Labour Relations Board is expected to rule on the dispute
within the next few days.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Climate improving for foreign
investors in Russian oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The investment climate in Russia for western oil companies is slowly
improving, according to the head of Magma Oil, one of the first Russian oil
companies to be privatised, writes Robert Corzine.
Mr Sergey Shafranik, director general of Magma Oil and brother of Mr Yuri
Shafranik, Russian energy minister, said he expected production to expand
with the lifting of export quotas and the lowering next month of export
levies.
Magma last year brought into production the Yuzhnoye field in the Tyumen
region of western Siberia. It was the only new field to be brought on stream
in Russia last year.
The company is controlled by Australian-listed Vanguard Oil through a 50.3
per cent holding by its Eurosov subsidiary. The remainder is held by the
main Russian oil production, refining and transportation companies.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fall as dollar hits low
against yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds tumbled yesterday morning as the dollar briefly hit a
record low against the yen, but prices improved in the afternoon in spite of
a lacklustre auction.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 11/32 at
85 5/16 . The yield was hovering at 7.49 per cent, after breaking through
the important psychological barrier of 7.50 per cent earlier in the day and
then receding. At the short end, the two-year note was off  5/32 at 99 25/32
, to yield 5.976 per cent.
With the dollar giving up more ground against the yen and D-Mark, the
travails of the US currency provided a gloomy guide for bonds. At noon, it
dipped below Y100 for the first time and bonds plunged. Later, it inched
back over and bonds improved. The pattern was repeated a few times during
the afternoon.
The fear is that the Federal Reserve will soon be forced to support the
currency by lifting short-term interest rates for the fifth time this year.
Traders are now concerned that a move could come in early July.
Such speculation brought selling pressure to the entire maturity range, but
activity intensified at the short end as traders adjusted their positions
ahead of the Treasury's sale of Dollars 17bn in two-year notes. In the
event, the auction was mildly disappointing, but the market was able to hold
steady.
Meanwhile, traders were on high alert for more inflationary signals from the
commodity markets. Fortunately there was a softer tone in prices for the
second day in a row, easing one source of pressure on bonds.
With concerns over the dollar, supply and commodities piling up, the day's
economic news passed largely unnoticed. The Commerce Department said the
trade deficit had widened in April to Dollars 8.4bn, from a revised March
deficit of Dollars 6.87bn. Economists were expecting last month's figure to
be about Dollars 7.68bn.
After Monday's sharp declines, European government bonds ended yesterday's
calmer session unchanged to slightly weaker.
Early on, bonds clawed back some of the previous day's losses, helped partly
by lower-than-expected German M3 money supply data. However, as investors
continued their buyers' strike, markets drifted sideways until weaker US
Treasuries dragged them lower in the afternoon.
Europe is likely to continue to track the US in coming days. 'Until
Treasuries stabilise, volatility and bearishness in Europe will continue,'
said a trader in London. 'Our markets are very fragile and there's no cash
activity to speak of - if US yields lurch higher again, we're in for another
rough ride,' he added.
In Germany, news that M3 money supply had grown at an annualised 13.7 per
cent rate in the five months to May gave bunds a brief lift. Although the
rate is well above the Bundesbank's 4 to 6 per cent target range, it was
below market expectations of around 14.5 per cent.
However, it was not enough to lend solid support to the market. 'People will
need some convincing that it's really heading back towards the official
target range,' said a German dealer.
Preliminary June inflation data, expected to be released this week, are also
unlikely to give the market a sustainable boost. Even if the year-on-year
number falls below the psychologically important 3 per cent level, 'it
probably won't prompt more than a brief uptick in the futures,' said the
dealer. 'Fundamentals aren't driving the markets these days.'
At today's repo allocation by the Bundesbank, German money market traders
surveyed by MMS International expect the minimum repo rate to fall by five
basis points to 5 per cent.
UK gilts ended slightly weaker, dragged down by other markets. Traders
reported scant cash activity, with prices led mainly by the futures market.
The Bank of England announced that it would auction Pounds 2bn of gilts on
June 29. It said the auction would be of a further tranche of Floating-Rate
Treasury stock due 1999, fungible with the existing issue. The stock will be
fully paid.
Today, traders will study the release of the minutes of the May 4 meeting
between Bank of England governor Eddie George and chancellor Kenneth Clarke
for any hints on the direction of UK interest rates.
Italian bonds derived some cheer from favourable inflation data, but
continuing worries over the budget deficit and weakness in other markets
dragged them lower towards the close.
The 10-year bond contract on the Italian futures exchange closed at 101.73,
down 0.11 points and off its 102.66 high.

Asahi Securities will be capitalised at Y35bn and Yasuda Trust Securities at
Y20bn, the two banks said.
Japan's financial reforms enable banks and brokerages to engage in each
other's businesses. Five banks have established such divisions in the past
year. Several more are expected to follow suit in the next 12 months.
Philippine National Bank plans to raise its authorised capital by 150 per
cent to consolidate its position as the country's biggest commercial bank,
agencies report.
The state-controlled bank is to lift authorised capital to 25bn pesos from

FT  22 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Generale des Eaux taps the 10-year
sector for FFr1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Issuers took advantage of the temporary recovery in European government bond
markets yesterday to tap the eurobond market before renewed volatility set
in.
Generale des Eaux, the French industrial group which has significant media
interests as well as its core construction and utility activities, raised
FFr1bn through an offering of 10-year eurobonds. The proceeds were swapped
into floating-rate francs at an all-in cost to the borrower of 24 basis
points over three-month Pibor.
Lead manager BNP said most of the bonds were sold to French investors,
although there was also demand from Switzerland and the Benelux region.
By the end of the day, BNP had sold more than half its allocation and only
had to buy back a small quantity of bonds from syndicate members.
The bonds were priced to yield 38 basis points over 10-year French
government bonds and when they were freed to trade, the spread widened out
marginally.
Several French corporates are said to be looking at the French franc sector
and could tap the market if favourable swap conditions persist.
Indian Development Bank raised Dollars 100m through an issue of five-year
floating-rate notes which lead manager JP Morgan said was the first
conventional eurobond offering by an Indian borrower since 1990. The issue,
callable and puttable at par in 1997, is designed to act as a benchmark off
which future offerings by other Indian issuers will be priced.
The bonds were bought mainly by Middle Eastern and Asian accounts, although
the 144a tranche also brought in US investors. The discounted margin on the
bonds to the put was 110 basis points over three-month Libor and the bonds
are expected to be freed to trade this morning.
JP Morgan also put the final touches to the first global bond offering from
Fannie Mae. The Dollars 1.5bn issue of 10-year bonds is expected to be
formally launched and priced today.
Elsewhere, the World Bank brought its widely-expected zero-coupon euroyen
offering. The Y100bn issue of five-year eurobonds was targeted mainly at
Japanese retail investors, who can get tax breaks on such investments.
The World Bank is also believed to be considering a yen global offering.
Quebec has filed a shelf offering for up to Dollars 2.2bn in debt securities
and warrants with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Together with
previous offerings, the Canadian province may now issue as much as Dollars
3.5bn of debt, according to the shelf registration.

FT  22 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: BNP doubles its options
business with US purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banque Nationale de Paris, the French bank which was privatised last autumn,
plans to become a leading player in the international options business
through the purchase of most of the operations of Cooper Neff, the options
trading and research firm based in Radnor, Pennsylvania.
BNP's decision to buy a ready-made derivatives business follows a similar,
successful move by Swiss Bank Corporation which bought O'Connor Securities,
a specialist options firm based in Chicago, in 1992.
Market observers said BNP's acquisition made financial sense since
developing a similar standard of technology in-house would probably have
involved a much greater investment. 'BNP is also buying expertise and a
modern financial culture,' said one derivatives expert.
Mr Philippe Bordenave, head of BNP Global Markets, said the purchase of
Cooper Neff would double the bank's presence in the options business - both
firms have more than 100 traders and market-makers - and would raise BNP's
profile in the US to the same level which it has achieved in Europe and
Asia.
'We have complementary teams,' said Mr Bordenave, 'Cooper Neff has advanced
technology and 13 years of experience of trading in options. We bring name,
credit rating, customer base and global coverage.'
Mr Bordenave declined to give any financial details of the deal, which will
be completed at the end of this year.
However, Cooper Neff's partners, including the firm's founders Richard
Cooper and Roy Neff, have been 'heavily incentivised' to help BNP build a
successful operation and to stay with the bank well into the next century.
'I hope to be very wealthy at the end of this period,' said Mr Cooper.
BNP will buy some 80 per cent of Cooper Neff's operations at this stage and
its equity index market-making operation in Chicago later when US
regulations are met.
BNP is also acquiring the US exchange-based currency options business of
Mitsui T&amp;B Options, which Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking bought from Cooper Neff
four years ago.

The National Stock Exchange of India plans to launch a screen-based
secondary debt market from June 30, Reuter reports from Bombay.
The NSE said securities totalling Dollars 44.2bn could be traded on the new
exchange. The order-driven market will trade in government securities,
treasury bills, public-sector company bonds and floating-rate bonds. It will
link large Indian cities though a satellite link enabling real time trading.
Creation of the debt market is the first step in a government plan to
establish a fully-computerised national stock market. At present there are
22 stock exchanges in India.
The NSE is expected to begin trading later this year or next year. India's
equity markets are capitalised at Dollars 120bn.
The government and financial institutions backed the launch of the NSE
following the 1992 securities scandal, in which banks and brokers were
accused of siphoning money from the inter-bank securities market to invest
on the-then booming Bombay Stock Exchange.
Brokers see the NSE as part of pressure on the regional stock markets to
reform trading activities.
Mr R. H. Patil, NSE managing director, said it will completely transform
secondary debt trading, bringing full transparency to a market previously
dogged by secrecy.

float
</HEADLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Macquarie Bank, the Sydney-based investment bank, expects to circulate
flotation plans among shareholders in 'the early part of next year',
allowing them to decide whether the bank should become a listed company.
Macquarie is owned by more than 40 institutions, with Hill Samuel Bank of
the UK holding the largest single stake, at 14.4 per cent. Management and
staff also own a sizeable minority interest.
The update on the flotation possibility was provided yesterday by Mr David
Clarke, chairman, as he unveiled profits of ADollars 73.9m (USDollars 54.5m)
after tax for the year ended March, up 24 per cent on the previous year.
Operating revenue was ADollars 570.5m, up from ADollars 530.7m. Interest
paid and accrued on deposits dipped to ADollars 231.9m from ADollars 249.7m,
while operating expenses rose to ADollars 245.4m from ADollars 202.8m. This
left operating profits before tax 19.2 per cent higher, at ADollars 93.2m.
Mr Allan Moss, Macquarie's managing director, said that gains had come from
all the main business groups, although the equities business had fared
particularly well with brokerage income 'surging'.
As a result, the break-down of Macquarie's earnings changed last year, with
fee income accounting for about 40 per cent, and trading and lending
margins, 30 per cent apiece. In the past, these three areas have accounted
for about one-third each.
Mr Moss added that the bank had a number of overseas expansionary moves in
sight - including the opening of equity-related operations in Hong Kong and
New York - and was 'discussing the possibility of branch status in the UK'.
He added that Macquarie was optimistic about domestic economic prospects for
the current year.
Macquarie's shareholder funds at the year-end were ADollars 339.6m, up 17.6
per cent. Total capital, including subordinated debt, was ADollars 520.9m,
and the capital adequacy ratio was 13.77 per cent.

fixed-interest 'gold bond'

<TEXT>
Poseidon Gold, which is part of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy
Poseidon group, has launched an innovative ADollars 200m (USDollars 147m)
fixed-interest 'gold bond' issue, where both principal and interest payments
are denominated in the metal.
The issue overall will represent 400,000oz of gold, and each note 25oz. The
10-year bonds will carry an interest rate of 2.65 per cent for the first
five years, and 3.8 per cent there-after.
Investors will be able to redeem their bonds after five years, although
PosGold said that it expected that the terms of the issue 'would ensure that
investors retain the bonds to maturity in 2004'.
The redemption or maturity values will depend on the price of gold at that
stage.
PosGold said it believed the issue, which was lead-managed by Merrill Lynch,
was the first of its type in international capital markets - adding that it
knew of one other issue, by Freeport-McMoran of the US, which was 'remotely
similar'.
PosGold, which is believed to be one of Australia's largest gold producers,
said that the aim of the issue was to refinance existing bank debt.
The bonds have been rated BBB- by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency.

Malaysian cents.
The Proton is manufactured in co-operation with Mitsubishi Motors of Japan.
Proton said that the decline in pre-tax profit was mainly due to a drop in
investment income and the rise of the Japanese yen.

FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Energy arm powers Veba turnover
 -Sales at PreussenElektra have surged 28%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Veba, the German energy-based conglomerate, began a roadshow in the US on
Monday - its second in two years - and will travel to Canada later this week
as speculation mounts that it might be about to follow Daimler-Benz on to
the New York Stock Exchange.
Its arrival in the US coincides with a 14.6 per cent increase in turnover
for the first quarter of 1994, to DM17.49bn (Dollars 10.9bn).
The biggest contributor to the overall result came from the group's energy
sector, led by the PreussenElektra subsidiary. PreussenElektra's turnover
for the quarter jumped 27.8 per cent to DM4.3bn.
Mr Hans-Dieter Harig, chairman of PreussenElektra, exudes a quiet confidence
about the sales gains. Significantly, he is confident that PreussenElektra,
the second-largest force in the German energy market behind RWE Energie, can
respond to growing pressure from both Brussels and Bonn for deregulation and
liberalisation of the industry.
'I support these plans for deregulation. But Germany should not go it alone.
We should have reciprocity for third-party access,' said Mr Harig.
Mr Harig believes that PreussenElektra is well placed to defend its position
when the German energy sector opens to outside competition, partly because
of geographical location. It enjoys a dominance in energy distribution from
Frankfurt to Kiel, and across the northern swathe of eastern Germany.
'This means we do not share a border with France, so we do not have to worry
about competition from Electricite de France, the state-owned utility,' he
says.
PreussenElektra earlier this year concluded a deal with the Treuhand
privatisation agency to acquire five units in eastern Germany, cementing its
regional monopoly.
The company, which last year made profits of DM968m on turnover of DM12.4bn,
is keen to defend its position against future competition by tapping
Scandinavian markets. In 1991, it set up Baltic Cable, a joint venture with
Sydkraft and Vattenfall, the Swedish utilities.
The venture will build and operate a 250km undersea cable between Germany
and Sweden. The link, costing DM500m, is due to be completed in 1994 and
will allow direct exchange of electricity between the two networks.
Under the deal, Preussen-Elektra will import hydro-electric power during the
day and deliver power back to Sweden at night. PreussenElektra believes it
will benefit from the ability to import low-cost hydro and nuclear power,
while the Swedish side will have have access to nuclear and coal-fired
generation power in times of low rainfall.
PreussenElektra has been working with Norwegian utilities since last year to
build another undersea cable across the North Sea.
These cable links play two roles: apart from increased co-operation with
Scandinavia, they open up the possibility for PreussenElektra to expand in
Poland and the Baltic States. 'We are not rushing in there. We have to
consider economic viability. But we are very interested.'
Closer to home, the company faces problems: opposition to nuclear power and
falling energy consumption in eastern Germany.
Of the electricity generated by public utilities in western Germany, about
37 per cent is sourced by nuclear power. PreussenElektra's share of nuclear
power accounts for 47 per cent of that. Yet due to local opposition in Lower
Saxony, the company has not been able to recommission its two nuclear power
stations at Brunsbuttel, off-line since late 1992, and Krummel, at a
standstill since mid-1993. These two units are costing Preussen-Elektra
DM10m a month.
'I really see no end in sight to these problems,' says Mr Harig. However, Mr
Harig adds that its five other nuclear power stations last year operated
with an average availability of nearly 90 per cent, well above the average
for the past 10 years.
The other problem is that PreussenElektra's 51 per cent stakes in five
regional utilities in eastern Germany coincide with a continuing fall in
energy consumption in the east, and an increasing use of gas.
PreussenElektra paid DM800m for its stakes and will invest DM8bn upgrading
the region's power stations over the next several years. Energy consumption
in the east fell by 45 per cent between 1989 and 1993.
'Our investments will pay off in the long term,' says Mr Harig. But he does
not expect electricity sales to grow by more than 1 per cent a year,
implying that no new power station capacity will be needed until 2005. For
the moment, the period of expansion has ended.
However, PreussenElektra will continue its research into electric vehicles.
It has already set up a station on the island of Rugen.
'We are in the very early stages,' said Mr Harig. And like PreussenElektra's
investments in Scandinavia and eastern Germany, he believes it is a
long-term project.
'This industry is based on the long term.'

FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Hoyts plans to spin off its
cinema operations

<TEXT>
Hoyts Group, the Australia-based cinema and radio-station operator, plans to
raise up to ADollars 400m (USDollars 296m) by spinning off its cinema
operations in Australia, New Zealand and the US, AP-DJ reports from Sydney.
Hoyts operates 112 cinemas with a total of 707 screens in the three
countries. It has been controlled by the Fink family since 1985.
Shares in the new company - to be called Hoyts Cinemas - will be sold
through an initial public offering to investors in Australia and elsewhere.
However, Hoyts Cinemas will only be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange.
The company expects the offering to be completed before the end of this year
'if all runs smoothly'.
The Fink family will buy a 'small minority' stake in Hoyts Cinemas through
the IPO.
In the US, Hoyts operates 79 cinemas, most of them in the suburbs of several
north-eastern cities. It plans to expand in this region by adding 158
screens over five years. The company said there were also also significant
opportunities in Mexico. Hoyts Cinemas plans to add a further 100 screens to
its Australian operations as part of its expansion strategy.
The Fink family formerly controlled a large radio, cinema and advertising
group with two listed companies, Hoyts Media and Hoyts Entertainment.
However, a growing debt burden, shrinking revenues and a sharp fall in the
value of its radio licenses during the late 1980s forced the family to
restructure its operations, selling its radio stations to the listed Village
Roadshow.
The outdoor and cinema advertising activities, under Hoyts Entertainment,
were restructured and renamed Television &amp; Media Services. They continue to
trade on the Australian Stock Exchange.
The Fink family wants to use the majority of funds raised through the
planned IPO of Hoyts Cinemas to repay bank debt.

FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: CBOE to trade options on Mexican
companies index
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Chicago Board Options Exchange plans to create an equity derivatives
product to mirror the performance of the Mexican economy.
It is to trade options on an index of 10 Mexican companies. Pending
regulatory approval, the launch date is set for later this summer.
The CBOE already offers options on the American depositary receipts of nine
of the 10 stocks in the index. All of the shares trade as ADRs or American
depositary shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr Alger Chapman, CBOE chairman, said: 'No proxy for the performance of the
Mexican economy is currently available in the US derivative markets, and
options on the index will provide investors with a low-cost means to
participate in the performance of Mexico or to hedge against the risk of
investing in the economy.'
After a strong performance late last year following US approval of the North
American Free Trade Agreement, Mexican share values have fallen back this
year.
However, recent US trade figures show that foreign investment in Mexico is
growing, theoretically creating a positive environment for the CBOE's
options.
The CBOE has been in the forefront in attracting derivatives business on
Latin American ADRs. The exchange launched options on the ADRs of Telefonos
de Mexico, the telephone company, in 1991. They have since become the most
actively traded equity options in the US.
The 10 companies in the Mexico index are truck maker Dina; three
construction concerns; Telefonos de Mexico; media company Grupo Televisa;
Coca-Cola's Mexican division; the cigarette company Empresas La Moderna;
banking company Grupo Financiero Serfin, and shipbuilder Transportacion
Maritima Mexicana.

FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kmart fails to resolve impasse
on restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Kmart, the troubled US discount store group, yesterday met for
the first time since shareholders threw out the company's restructuring
plan. However, it took no decisions about what to do next.
Earlier this month, a powerful group of institutional investors rebelled
over Kmart's plan to sell minority stakes in its specialty retailing
subsidiaries.
They wanted the company to dispose of them completely, and concentrate on
putting its poorly-performing dis-count store operations in order.
Yesterday, Kmart's board met for four-and-a-half hours to discuss the next
step without reaching a conclusion.
Afterwards, the company said: 'The board of directors and management are
reviewing the total strategy of Kmart Corp, including the core business and
the status of the specialty retail businesses. As soon as decisions are
made, they will be announced.'
The company said that yesterday's meeting was designed to present the board
of directors with a range of options, and it had gone out of its way to
discourage the idea that any decisions would be taken at such an early
stage.
The next board meeting is scheduled to take place on July 19.
Under the original plan, Kmart's management had hoped to create classes of
Kmart shares tied to the performance of the four specialty retailing
subsidiaries.
It planned to sell between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of each block of
shares to raise money for the refurbishment of the core discount stores.
Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman and chief executive, is believed to favour a
revised version of the plan that would involve floating off the subsidiaries
but retaining majority stakes in them.
This plan would not require shareholder approval because it does not involve
the creation of Kmart shares. However, it would still anger institutional
shareholders, who want the subsidiaries sold completely.

FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Exxon credit outlook reviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, put a further question mark over
the top credit rating of Exxon after last week's jury verdict that the
company had acted recklessly in the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in
1989.
The agency affirmed Exxon's triple-A rating, but changed the outlook to
negative. This echoed an earlier move by Moody's, the other leading US
rating agency.
The jury verdict leaves Exxon open to an assessment for punitive damages of
up to Dollars 15bn, in addition to actual damages claimed of Dollars 1.5bn.
The company has argued it should not pay any punitive damages.
Alongside Royal Dutch/Shell, Exxon has long been seen as one of the
strongest credits in the international energy industry. S&amp;P also accords its
top triple-A rating to Amoco.
Exxon had total debt outstanding of Dollars 12.6bn at the end of last year.
With cashflow of Dollars 10bn, it has a strong financial structure, said Mr
Bob Weiss, an analyst at S&amp;P.
Even if the jury applied a large damages award against the company, it would
not lose its triple-A rating immediately. The case would probably take
another two years in the appeals court, and could then find its way to the
US supreme court, giving Exxon plenty of time to build up its cash reserves
to pay any penalty, said Mr Weiss. However, the uncertainty could add to the
company's costs, he said.

FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Microsoft and Stac settle
dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software company, is taking
an equity stake in Stac Electronics, a small Californian software house. The
purchase is part of an agreement designed to put an end to a conflict
between the two companies which had become deeply embarrassing for
Microsoft.
In February, a jury decided that a key Microsoft software product infringed
two Stac patents and ordered the company to pay Dollars 120m in damages.
The patents concern a technique for compressing computer data, so that
double the amount of information can be stored on a computer's hard disk.
This month, a US federal judge ordered Microsoft to recall versions of the
offending software - its flagship operating system MS-Dos - of which close
to 100m copies have been sold.
Under yesterday's agreement, Microsoft and Stac will cross-license all their
existing disk compression patents, as well as any other compression patents
either of them receives over the next five years.
The agreement calls for Microsoft to pay Stac royalties of Dollars 1m a
month over 43 months.
It will also buy Dollars 39.9m of 4 per cent non-voting convertible
preferred stock maturing in 2004. Converted into common stock, Microsoft
would own 15 per cent of Stac.
Mr Gary Clow, Stac chairman, said the agreement put an end to legal fees,
created a royalty stream, put money in the bank and ushered in a new era of
co-operation between the companies.
Microsoft will no longer have to pay Stac the Dollars 120m awarded in
February, while Stac will not have to pay Microsoft Dollars 13.8m awarded
for misappropriation of trade secrets.
Both companies pointed out yesterday that they believed the deal was in the
best interests of their customers and shareholders.
Dealers, personal computer manufacturers and customers would be able to
continue to use Microsoft products containing Stac technology without fear
of legal repercussions.

<TEXT>
Isuzu, the Japanese truck and bus maker, yesterday announced a Y6.3bn
(Dollars 61.8m) pre-tax loss at the parent level for the half-year ended
April. It passed its interim dividend.
The loss compares with a deficit of Y8.4bn in the same six-month period a
year ago, and was made on sales 6 per cent lower at Y541.5bn.
Isuzu, which is 37 per cent owned by General Motors, the biggest US
carmaker, blamed the disappointing performance on weak markets and the
strength of the yen.
Domestic sales, battered by the slump in the Japanese market, fell 6.4 per
cent. Overseas sales plunged 25 per cent, largely as a result of weak demand
and the decision by Isuzu to terminate passenger car production outside
Japan. Total unit sales declined as a result, by 19.5 per cent.
Isuzu has been cutting costs through increased procurement overseas,
improved productivity and restructuring.
On the brighter side, sales of components for overseas production rose
during the period.

FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Eli Lilly details plan for
non-core sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eli Lilly has given details of plans to shed its non-pharmaceuticals
businesses, including an initial public offering later this year for a new
medical devices company with sales of Dollars 800m.
In January, the US drugs company indicated it planned to group six of its
devices businesses into a single company for sale.
Under the plan announced yesterday, one of these six businesses, Ivac, would
be sold separately.
Lilly said this was because the company operated in a different market to
the others, and would benefit more from being bought by another company.
It said it was in talks for the sale of the business, but refused to name a
potential buyer.
The remaining five businesses, all of which operate in the area of
cardiovascular or minimally invasive systems, will be floated in the fourth
quarter of this year, Lilly said.
The aim is to sell 20 per cent of the shares in this new company, to be
known as Guidant, with the remain-ing shares being distributed to Lilly
shareholders within the following six months.
This would either be done by issuing shares in the new company to existing
Lilly shareholders, or allowing Lilly shareholders to exchange some of their
shares for shares in the new company.

FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: US backs Russian project to link
equity clearing centres

<TEXT>
A US-funded project for Russian equities will soon link clearing centres in
Moscow and St Petersburg. The link-up may be followed by the creation of a
Nasdaq-style trading system, banking sources said, Reuter reports from
Moscow.
Chase Manhattan Bank of the US is acting as an adviser to the project,
undertaken by consultants Deloitte and Touche for Russia's privatisation
committee, said the bankers.
The US computer company SunGard Data Systems is providing the software for
the project, which is funded by USAID (the US Agency for International
Development).
Under the plan, two clearing centres for share trading have been set up in
Moscow and Yekaterinburg. A third is being considered for Novosibirsk.
The Moscow centre is already in operation, with about 10 Russian banks and
brokerages as members. Settlement, so far on a manual basis, is trading day
plus five days.
The Moscow clearing centre is handling settlements in the shares of
newly-privatised Russian enterprises, ranging from the big Kosmos Hotel to
the Krasny Oktyabr sweet factory.
It will be computerised by September.
Separately, the consultants KPMG Peat Marwick are involved in the creation
of another share-clearing centre in St Petersburg, which bankers say will be
linked to Moscow electronically by December.
'Eventually, all these regional clearing centres will be linked to each
other,' one banker said.
This will be followed by the creation of a US Nasdaq-style share-trading
system in Russia, banking sources added.
'The intention at the end of the day is to develop share trading in Russia
on an inter-regional basis,' a consultant with Deloitte said.

FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Poland targeted for satellite TV
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new selection of subscription satellite television channels is to be
established in Poland by autumn, through a joint venture which includes Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
The new company, MultiChoice Poland, which will supply the channels, is a
joint venture between News Datacom, a News Corporation subsidiary, and
Nethold, the parent company of European pay-TV operator FilmNet.
Poland has been targeted because it is already the third largest satellite
television market in Europe, after the UK and Germany.
There are an estimated 1.5m satellite dish owners in Poland and 1m cable
television households. This will be the first time a package of subscription
channels will be legally available in Poland.
Nethold has already set up MultiChoice subsidiaries or offices in several
European countries, including the Benelux and Nordic regions, Hungary, the
Czech Republic and Slovenia.
Channels already using the News Datacom subscription technology, VideoCrypt
II, include FilmNet's Complete Movie Channel; The Discovery Channel, which
concentrates on factual programmes; The Children's Channel; Country Music
Television Europe; the Adult Channel; and QVC, the shopping channel.

FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Goodyear spells out five-year
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Goodyear chairman Mr Stanley Gault has spelt out a new five-year plan for
the US tyre company, including a dividend policy allowing a payout of
between one-fifth and one-quarter of the previous year's earnings.
Mr Gault, who recently agreed to stay with the company until the end of 1995
rather than retire at the end of this year, has overseen a strong recovery
since joining Goodyear three years ago.
Goodyear has lifted its dividend from 5 cents a quarter in 1991 to 15 cents
now, after a share split last year. At the current level, it will pay out
Dollars 120m in dividends this year - close to a third of last year's net
income of Dollars 388m, and ahead of the new dividend rate.
With the US automotive industry performing strongly, Goodyear's after-tax
earnings are widely expected to rise to between Dollars 560m and Dollars
570m this year.
Targets set this week include a reduction in the company's gearing from 40
per cent to between 25 and 30 per cent by the end of 1998. Goodyear's debt
has already come down to Dollars 1.4bn, from Dollars 3.7bn in 1991.
Sales are expected to grow at between 4.5 and 5 per cent a year until the
end of 1998, twice the projected rate of growth in the tyre industry as a
whole, Mr Gault said.

FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank maintains
provisions below budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank's budget for provisioning requirements against bad and
doubtful debts will not have to be increased this year, according to
chairman Mr Hilmar Kopper. He stressed that provision for problem cases such
as Jurgen Schneider, the collapsed property company, and Balsam, the
sport-floorings manufacturer, had come in under budget, as of the end of
May.
Mr Kopper said this was in spite of having to set aside DM500m (Dollars
314.5m) for the Schneider case, 40 per cent of the bank's total DM1.2bn
exposure to the property group.
He said he hoped to maintain the provisions at below budget throughout the
rest of the year.
Mr Kopper said the bank - the biggest credit institution in Germany - was
still 'well ahead' on its own-account securities trading activities this
year. This was in spite of the need for increased write-offs because of poor
conditions in the bund market this year.
Mr Kopper refused to give any more details pending publication of the bank's
half-year figures.
In May, he told shareholders at the bank's annual meeting in Dusseldorf that
provisions would fall during 1994, from the DM3.3bn set aside last year, in
spite of Schneider. The fall would reflect the German economic recovery.
The provision charge last year was more than doubled, from DM1.4bn in 1992.
Mr Kopper said the bank's total operating profits were down by more than 10
per cent in the first four months of the year, and he cautioned that the
record profits made by the bank in 1993 would not be matched in the current
year.
He pointed to pressure on the interest margin on mainstream lending
business, and poor market conditions for own-account trading activities.

FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Lotus remains confident despite
fall in share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Lotus Development plunged by more than a quarter in New York
yesterday morning following the US software group's gloomy sales and profits
projections the night before.
The heavy selling came in the wake of growing disenchantment in the
investment community in recent months, prompted by slowing sales of the
company's applications software products, which account for 70 per cent of
revenues. At the close of trading the shares were Dollars 37, down Dollars
14 3/8 . This capitalised the shares at less than half the level reached at
their peak in mid-March, when it they were valued at Dollars 3.9bn.
Lotus continued to maintain yesterday that its long-term prospects remained
unaffected by the profits warning. It blamed the share price fall on its
failure to meet market expectations for one quarter. 'We've sinned in that
regard,' said Mr Robert Schechter, senior vice-president for international
business. 'But over the long run, we feel very, very confident.' He said
that the company's fast-growing communications software products, which
already account for 30 per cent of sales, continued to experience growth
which was 'at or ahead of expectations'.
The Massachusetts-based company had warned that sales in the second quarter,
to the end of June, would be Dollars 230m-Dollars 240m, roughly level with
the previous year, and that earnings per share would be 20-25 cents. Most
analysts had been expecting close to 50 cents a share. It revised its
earnings per share projection for the year as a whole to Dollars
1.80-Dollars 2, down from its earlier forecast of Dollars 2-Dollars 2.15.
The company said the sales fall-off was due to delays in the release of a
number of upgrades to its biggest applications software products, including
1-2-3, a spreadsheet package, and Approach, a database product. This was
caused by development delays, related to difficulties in integrating the
various products and integrating them with the company's popular Notes
communications software.
Lotus' shares are now back at the level last seen at the end of last summer.
Their run-up through to March was based on optimism over the company's
communications software, one field where it is regarded as being ahead of
arch-rival Microsoft.

FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Colonia ahead sharply at DM309m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Colonia yesterday reported a sharp increase in pre-tax profits for last
year, and the insurer predicted that earnings in the current year would
again be satisfactory, writes David Waller.
Mr Claas Kleyboldt, chairman of the German group, which is a subsidiary of
UAP, the French insurer, said the group had improved pre-tax profits to
DM308.9m (Dollars 189.5m) up from DM248m in the previous year.
Earnings per share climbed to DM55 from DM37.50.
The improvement reflected a combination of reduced claims and increased
premium income, a trend which had continued in the early months of the
current year, Mr Kleyboldt said.
In 1993, the gross premium for what is to be known as the CKAG group rose by
11.4 per cent to DM13.6bn, while the ratio of money paid to settle insurance
claims to premium income in mainstream insurance business fell by 2.3
percentage points.

FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Share flood dampens Milan's
enthusiasm - Mediobanca's rights withdrawal was response to strains at the
bourse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mediobanca is the merchant bank at the centre of many of the industrial and
financial deals which feed the Milan stock market. So it was perhaps
appropriate that its L1,500bn (Dollars 948m) planned rights issue should be
the first to be sacrificed to Monday's 4 per cent decline in Italian equity
prices.
Late on Monday night, the bank announced it was postponing the operation,
after its shares fell by 5 per cent in a day, dropping to below the
floor-price it had set for the issue.
It was a cruel blow for a bank which prides itself on its Italian market
expertise. Indeed, Mediobanca had itself provided support and advice for a
number of the dozen or so share or bond issues which have been launched or
are due to be launched on to the Milan market in June and July.
The decision probably marks at least a temporary halt to Italian companies'
unseemly rush for stockmarket funding which has characterised a buoyant
Milan market since Mr Silvio Berlusconi's election victory. But the bank's
withdrawal still leaves more than L10,000bn of share and convertible bond
issues, from companies as diverse as Finanza &amp; Futuro, Mr Carlo De
Benedetti's financial services operation, and Pirelli, the tyres and cables
group, fighting for investors' attention.
Taking into account forthcoming privatisations, Actinvest, a small
investment firm based in London and Milan, estimates the amount required of
the market over the next six months at about L25,000bn.
For Mr Fabio Basagni, Actinvest's head, the follow-my-leader attitude of
many Italian companies to capital-raising 'tells you a lot about the
immaturity of the Italian financial institutions: they create bottlenecks
any time the market performs well'.
Significantly, Monday also marked the moment when the Milan equity indices
slipped back below the level at which they stood before the March general
election.
So what now happens to the small wave of paper about to break over a
weakened market, in particular the imminent privatisation of Ina, the
state-owned insurer, which is to be priced this weekend and launched on
Monday?
Analysts caution against too much pessimism, although they admit the
overhanging weight of rights and bond issues was one factor in the
correction, and may affect the market for some weeks to come. However, Mr
Enrico Ponzone of Kleinwort Benson believes that the rally of the past two
months was based on strong fundamentals, in particular the likely decline in
interest rates, and that the Italian market will continue to outperform its
European counterparts. Yesterday morning, as if to underline the point,
equities bounced back more strongly in Milan than in other European bourses.
Moreover, most of the companies seeking to raise capital are not in
immediate need of funding, but are taking advantage of the opportunity
offered by a rising market. Mediobanca, for example, intends to use the
funds to continue its programme of investments, perhaps with a particular
eye on the privatisation of Stet, the telecoms holding company. But that
sell-off will not happen before the autumn, giving plenty of time for the
bank to return to the market.
What is more, there is clearly still a buyer, as the market cliche goes, for
the right product at the right price. Only last Friday, for example,
Mediobanca announced that the L990bn issue of shares in Mondadori, the
publishing company belonging to Mr Berlusconi, was four times oversubscribed
only a day after the offer opened.
As for Ina, the mood among advisers was calm yesterday. Although the
L4,500bn-L5,500bn sale is the largest of the issues planned in the next six
weeks, its special characteristics should make it impervious to all but the
worst type of market collapse.
A priority tranche of shares intended for policyholders is already
attracting strong interest, and bank branches up and down the country are
fielding regular inquiries from the public. According to analysts, the most
important factor is that even if Ina shares are sold at the higher end of
the promised price-range, they still look like a cheap alternative to
Italy's quoted insurers like Generali and Ras.
But such bullishness, and yesterday's small recovery in Milan equity prices
has not quite eradicated the sense of unease in the market about what really
triggered for the last week's 10 per cent fall: that is, new doubts about
the way in which the new right-wing government is handling the economy.
The real hope of many investors lies in the fact that this is the first
Italian government for many decades which cannot afford to alienate the bond
and equity markets.
Under the circumstances, however, Mediobanca's unprecedented decision to
suspend its rights issue seems not only a logical decision by a market
expert, but a strong signal to Mr Berlusconi to stop dithering.

FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Partner sought for Cologne Re
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Colonia, Germany's third biggest insurance group, confirmed yesterday that
it was holding talks which could lead to an international strategic alliance
for Cologne Re, its reinsurance subsidiary.
Mr Claas Kleyboldt, Colonia's chairman, said that the talks were taking
place with a number of companies but that as yet there was no preferred
partner for the match. He was speaking in Cologne as Colonia - now a
subsidiary of the French Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) - reported
pre-tax profits up by nearly a quarter for 1993.
He stressed that under no circumstances would Colonia sell its 75 per cent
direct and indirect holding in Cologne Re, nor would it contemplate a full
merger with another party. The only requirement was that the partner pursued
a similar strategy to that of the German company, Kleyboldt said.
He refused to comment on reports that the company, the fourth largest
reinsurance group in the world with gross income of DM4.5bn (Dollars 2.8bn)
in 1992, would forge links with either General Corp Re or Employers
Reinsurance Corp, two US reinsurance companies.
Although the talks are apparently at an early stage, they highlight the move
towards co-operation and consolidation in the global reinsurance industry.
Last week, for example, Suez, the French holding company, agreed to sell
Abeille Re, its French reinsurer, to Scor, France's largest reinsurance
group, as part of the disposal of the Victoire group of insurance
businesses. The deal valued the reinsurer at more than FFr2bn (Dollars
366m).
UAP confirmed that in principle it would not be opposed to Cologne Re
forming a strategic alliance with an international partner in the
reinsurance field.
Neither General Re nor Employers Reinsurance could be contacted immediately
for comment yesterday.

FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Philip Morris chiefs committed
to change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The new bosses of Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, yesterday
promised a sharp change in management style in an effort to restore growth
to the company's flagging share price.
Mr William Murray, who took over from Mr Michael Miles as chairman at the
weekend, said: 'I want to say categorically that we are not committed to
doing things in the way they were done in the past. I want to emphasise that
point.'
Mr Murray and Mr Geoffrey Bible, who took over Mr Miles's role as chief
executive, were speaking in New York just three days after their promotion
to the top two jobs at Philip Morris following Mr Miles's sudden
resignation.
Mr Murray said their overriding priority would be to produce rates of
earnings growth that compared 'very favourably' with the rest of corporate
America.
All the group's businesses were performing well, and the domestic and
international tobacco businesses 'had never been stronger,' he said.
Superior earnings growth would produce superior cash flow, and this is turn
would give Philip Morris the flexibility to consider a wide range of options
for improving shareholder value. These could include a bigger share buy-back
programme, bigger dividends, strategic acquisitions or debt reduction.
Mr Murray confirmed that an earlier plan to demerge the tobacco businesses -
seen by some as having brought about Mr Miles's demise - was off the table.
He said structural changes to the company would always be considered if they
enhanced shareholder value, 'but I do not think we will be making any
announcements soon regarding separation or other forms of structure'.
Mr Murray Green, Philip Morris's general counsel, said a demerger of the
tobacco business had been abandoned because of the danger that it would be
challenged in the courts as a fraudulent conveyance by those seeking damages
from the group over smoking-related diseases.
Mr Bible sought to play down the legal and political challenges facing
Philip Morris over its tobacco operations in the US. 'We are confident that
all of these remain manageable,' he said.
'On the litigation front the good news is that there is really no new news
there. There are some new and experienced plaintiff lawyers, there are some
novel approaches, but we also have extremely talented and experienced
counsel working for us,' he said. 'And you must remember that we have never
lost a case.'
On the Washington front, Mr Bible played down challenges to the tobacco
industry as the rhetoric of 'a handful of anti-tobacco legislators'.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Kingfisher to cut 400 jobs at Comet after
sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kingfisher is planning to cut the equivalent of 400 full-time jobs from the
workforce of its Comet electrical retailing chain following the introduction
of new technology and a reduction in opening hours.
Comet staff were told yesterday of the plans to cut total working hours by
10 per cent and to move the weekday opening time from 9am to 10am.
The changes, which follow a six-month review of Comet's store operations,
come against a background of difficult trading conditions. Comet's sales
fell by 2.1 per cent in the first quarter, although gross margins improved.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, Kingfisher's corporate affairs director, said: 'The
object of the changes is to enhance service and therefore sales and to
reduce costs so that we can operate profitably and successfully in a very
competitive market.'
Of the time freed by the shorter opening hours about 15 per cent will be
used for additional staff training to improve product knowledge.
Comet is investing Pounds 10m on the latest generation of electronic point
of sale equipment which is currently installed in 50 stores and will be in
all 233 outlets by the end of the year. This should reduce the time staff
spend on stock taking, processing credit agreements and reading reports from
head office.
Comet is also adopting some techniques developed at Darty, Kingfisher's
French electricals chain, including the focus on 'key performance
indicators' such as sales per full-time equivalent and customer conversion
rates.
It is thought that the changes will cost Kingfisher less than Pounds 3m, of
which the bulk are one-off redundancy costs. But the moves could save an
estimated Pounds 4m a year.
The total number of jobs lost will depend on how many full-time posts are
involved and how many staff are redeployed elsewhere in the group.
Last week Dixons announced plans to sell off 100 of Currys' remaining high
street shops to concentrate on superstores. Comet has already completed this
shift.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Phoenix Timber reduces losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 561,000, against a restated Pounds 4.19m,
were announced by Phoenix Timber Group for the year to March 31.
The outcome for the property care and flooring group follows a fall in
administration and financing costs in the second half together with a Pounds
125,000 surplus from land sales.
Turnover fell to Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 21.6m) with Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 4.64m)
from discontinued operations. Losses per share were cut to 2.1p (23.8p).
The current year had started slowly in both principal trading companies, Mr
Hugh Try, chairman, said. The level of orders at Durabella was encouraging,
although pressure on margins remained. Protim needed a continued upturn in
the housing market to exploit its potential, he added.
Bank borrowings had been cut by Pounds 3.38m to Pounds 2.2m during the year
and Mr Try said the realisation of assets from discontinued operations
continued.

Industries to Pounds 4.74m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling Industries, the engineering group which has a 9.7 per cent stake in
Caledonia Investments, reported a 26 per cent advance in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 3.74m to Pounds 4.71m for the year ended March 31.
Turnover for the company, of which Cayzer Trust holds 48.8 per cent and
Caledonia has a stake of 21.05 per cent, expanded to Pounds 47m, compared
with Pounds 38.9m, with Pounds 2.23m coming from acquisitions, directors
stated.
Mr Peter Buckley, chairman, said that after a slow start to the year the
second half had improved with a particularly strong performance from the
thermal process division with GCD in Australia being the main contributor.
The thermal process division contributed Pounds 1.93m to operating profits,
against a previous Pounds 881,000, from turnover ahead from Pounds 27.1m to
Pounds 34.1m.
Hydraulics achieved Pounds 1.03m (Pounds 995,000) from turnover of Pounds
13m (Pounds 11.8m).
Earnings per share rose from 8.6p to 12.06p while a recommended final
dividend of 4.5p is proposed for a total distribution of 6.3p (5.6p).

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Dawson in US restructure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dawson International, the Edinburgh-based textiles group, yesterday said it
was restructuring Dawson Home Fashions, its US shower curtain and bathroom
accessories business, to return it to profitability.
On March 1 the company announced that, following a review of part of the US
activities, it was considering the sale of DHF. However, because
satisfactory terms have not been agreed, discussions with possible
purchasers have ended.
A provision of Pounds 12m in the group accounts for the year to March 26
1994 was sufficient, the company said, to meet potential restructuring costs
and provisions.
DHF's sales in the current year were ahead of budget.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Philip Harris declines to Pounds 1.26m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite an increase in sales from Pounds 85.3m to Pounds 90.5m, pre-tax
profits of Philip Harris, the supplier of equipment and materials to the
education, scientific, medical and industrial markets, fell from Pounds
2.02m to Pounds 1.26m.
The directors said that the recession had hit margins in the education and
scientific division, while the export business had operated at significantly
lower levels than in the previous year and had ended the year in loss.
Recently, however, a number of substantial overseas orders had been received
which would benefit the current year, they added.
The pre-tax figure was struck after a fall in interest payable from Pounds
570,000 to Pounds 184,000. Borrowings were significantly reduced as a result
of a Pounds 5m rights issue in March last year.
Gearing at the year end stood at 14 per cent, against a pre-rights issue
level at the previous year end of 65 per cent and a post rights figure of 17
per cent at end-September 1993.
Earnings per share fell from 16.47p to 8.1p. The final dividend, however, is
held at 4.65p maintaining the total for the year at 6.85p.

advance at IWP
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IWP, the Irish industrial holding group, reported a 27 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits to IPounds 15m (Pounds 14.7m) for the year to March 31, on
turnover up 28 per cent to IPounds 121m.
The result included a five month contribution from Levendaal Beheer, the
Dutch toiletries and household products group which IWP acquired last
October for IPounds 51.2m.
Levendaal contributed IPounds 3.4m to the pre-tax line, which according to
Mr Joe Moran, group chief executive, was ahead of expectations.
Excluding the acquisition, the rest of the business suffered squeezed
margins. Operating profits slipped 2.5 per cent to IPounds 12.7m on turnover
up 9.5 per cent to IPounds 104m, although Mr Moran said that this was due
exclusively to increased competition in the firelighters business, resulting
from new entrants to the market. This was still making a good return on
capital, however, and would not be disposed of, he said.
The rest of the business - embracing personal care, household products and
packaging - performed well, Mr Moran said.
Gearing was 67 per cent (64 per cent) at the year end, but is expected to
fall to 35 per cent by end-March 1995.
Strategic priorities are on bedding in the Levendaal acquisition in the
current year, before embarking on further substantial acquisitions, although
Mr Moran said that modest bolt-on purchases in the UK and in Europe were
under consideration for the core businesses.
In the longer term, 'organic growth is limited' he said, and to achieve an
ambition of doubling pre-tax profits over the next five years further
acquisitions will be required which will financed out of cash flow and
borrowings.
Earnings per share were 34.5p (31.9p) and a final dividend of 4.75p is
recommended, making a total of 8p (7.25p) for the year.
Analysts forecast pre-tax profits in the region of IPounds 19m for the
current year.

The Guardian Media Group, which owns a 20 per cent in Trans World
Communications, the leading UK commercial radio group, confirmed yesterday
that it plans to ask for a judicial review of the Radio Authority's decision
not to object to Emap's proposed acquistion of TWC.
Mr Harry Roche, chairman of Guardian Media, which publishes the Guardian,
said 'we do not believe that the Radio Authority's agreement with Emap
should go unchallenged.'
Emap, which already owns nearly 30 per cent of Trans World, had been seeking
a recommended offer at 181p which would value the group at Pounds 70m.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;G legal battle back in high court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The legal battle over the terms of the Lloyds Bank Pounds 1.8bn cash bid for
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society returns to the high court today, in
the final stage of the initial challenge to the bid by the Building
Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator.
The judgment earlier this month from Sir Donald Nicholls, the
vice-chancellor, that C&amp;G could not pay cash to investors who had been
members for less than two years will be formally issued as a declaration of
the court.
The precise terms of the ruling are critically important for C&amp;G as it looks
at how the offer could be restructured in a way which would bring it inside
the law.
The society will want to be sure that there is no prospect that a revised
offer could meet a legal obstacle.
Restructuring the offer to investing members may prove an easier task than
to devising an alternative to the planned offer of Pounds 500 in cash to
borrowing members of the society, who must also vote for the deal if it is
to go ahead.
If C&amp;G decides to appeal against the judgment, it will do so swiftly, in
order to reduce the risk of threatening the timetable already set out for
the Lloyds' takeover.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Quality Care static at Pounds 1.52m - Fall
in occupancy rates blamed on Community Care Act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Quality Care Homes fell 23p to 290p yesterday after the nursing
homes group announced flat profits in the six months to April 30 and failed
to increase its interim dividend.
The slowdown was blamed partly on increased competition and on a fall in
occupancy rates following the implementation of the Community Care Act last
year.
Pre-tax profits rose just 2.3 per cent to Pounds 1.52m (Pounds 1.49m)
despite a 30 per cent rise in turnover from Pounds 4.12m to Pounds 5.34m.
The company had warned that profits growth would slow this year due to the
opening of several new homes which take some months to become profitable.
But the impact has been greater than the market expected because of lower
occupancy rates.
Mr Duncan Bannatyne, chairman and chief executive, said: 'New homes are
taking longer to fill and profits from existing homes were down.'
At the end of April the group had 699 'established' beds - in homes open for
more than eight months - with an occupancy level of 91.7 per cent, down from
96.2 per cent a year earlier. It had a further 242 new beds, of which 162
were filled, giving a total occupancy rate of only 85 per cent.
In the established homes costs increased faster than fees with the group
reacting to greater competition by, for example, abolishing charges for
physiotherapy and chiropody. However, a 3.5 per cent fee increase in April
would improve the second half performance, the company said.
Operating profits rose to Pounds 1.65m (Pounds 1.49m) but the net interest
bill jumped to Pounds 128,000 (Pounds 54,000). Although earnings per share
rose to 7.99p (7.67p), Mr Bannatyne said that given the slowing cash flow
from operations, which fell slightly to Pounds 1.61m, it would be wrong to
increase the interim dividend. It is held at 1.5p.
The group now has 1,250 beds in operation or under construction and has
agreement in principle for bank facilities of over Pounds 20m which would
allow it to develop up to 2,000 beds.
Gearing, which was 29 per cent at the end of the first half, is expected to
rise to about 45 per cent at the year end.
Mr Bannatyne said he expected the Community Care changes to lead to
permanent reduction in occupancy rates of 1 to 2 per cent.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Reorganising the organiser producer -
Caroline Southey looks at the changes that have put Filofax back on its
growth path
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Filofax has enjoyed a remarkable reversal in fortunes from an all-time low
in 1990 when it appeared to be a casualty of the decline in brand mania.
Yet Mr Robin Field, who has turned the company around since joining it at
its nadir, believed all along that the difficulties were with Filofax the
company, not with its ring binder personal organisers or the market.
From record pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.72m for the year to December 1988 on
turnover of Pounds 14.7m, Filofax went rapidly downhill as it crumbled under
the pressure of extraordinary growth which saw turnover double year on year
from 1980. It slumped to pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.55m in 1990 and its
share price crashed to 13p.
Mr Field, now 42, was brought in as a management consultant, but stayed to
become chief executive in 1990. He saw that the company had stagnated. Its
products were over-priced and poorly distributed with a limited presence in
foreign markets.
Among his first steps, he shed jobs, cut prices and reduced the marketing
budget. He then changed management and began concentrating on the two planks
of his longer-term strategy - expanding sales abroad and reducing reliance
on the traditional Filofax product.
Both have been achieved through an aggressive acquisition strategy, buying
both distributors and makers of new related products.
None of the changes he introduced brought instant relief. Profits were
depressed in the first two years after his arrival and the credibility
problem remained. 'It has taken four years for the stock market to accept
that changes have been made and that they will prove effective,' said Mr
Field.
But he remained confident in his analysis. Worldwide he estimates there is a
potential annual market for 10m new organisers. In 1987 Filofax sold 300,000
personal organisers a year. In the year to end-March 1994 it sold 800,000.
The acquisition trail was first struck in 1992 when Filofax bought Lefax, a
luxury organiser company in the US. This was followed by the acquisition of
a French distributor in October 1992. During the past 12 months it has
scooped up three companies in continental Europe and one in the UK.
Through its British acquisition, Drakes, which controls 90 per cent of the
UK market in carbonless duplicate message books, Filofax has added a range
of new products to its portfolio.
Under Mr Field's leadership the company has worked hard at debunking the
myth that the Filofax was the plaything of the rich, upwardly mobile young
adults prevalent in the 1980s. Although the Filofax can still cost between
15 and 20 per cent more than unbranded competitors - the most popular model
retails for Pounds 34 today, compared with Pounds 60 for an average Filofax
in 1988-89.
The product has also been modified and improved in the past four years and a
cheaper range, starting at Pounds 9.95, has proved popular with students.
Acquisitions have generated substantial increases in sales, particularly
abroad, and have allowed Filofax to build its own distribution network. In
1987, at the height of its fortunes, foreign sales accounted for 38 per cent
of total turnover. In the year to March 1994 they accounted for 65 per cent.
Although the company holds between 55 and 60 per cent of the UK market,
worldwide it has managed to capture just 15 per cent of the market, leaving
plenty of room for growth, it believes.
The expansion has also meant that non-organiser products are expected to
contribute more than 10 per cent of total sales in the coming financial
year. In 1987 their contribution was negligible.
Mr Field remains enthusiastic about the appeal of the original organisers.
He points out that more than 65 per cent of sales are to women, mostly
housewives. Army officers and clergymen are also strong Filofax fans, a
pattern established shortly after the first Filofax was sold by mail order
in 1921 and when a Church of England store provided the first retail outlet.
The common theme among Filofax users is that they organise their lives
without secretarial help.
Mr Field is sanguine about competition from electronic personal information
managers and personal digital assistants. 'We watch their development very
closely, but we are not in the same market.' He says those products are
business tools, aimed at business people. 'We are aimed at the domestic
market.'
With a secure order base and new markets to explore, Mr Field believes the
company can sustain its profit growth. This week it reported pre-tax profits
of Pounds 3.26m on turnover of Pounds 17.1m. Yesterday its share price was
trading at 206p, off this year's all time high of 228p but up 10 fold in
four years.
Filofax, he says, 'remains alert to further acquisitions'. With net cash of
Pounds 2.41m (Pounds 3.35m) to the March year-end it is a strategy it can
well afford to pursue.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Acquisition lifts Watson &amp; Philip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watson &amp; Philip, the convenience store and food supplier, yesterday
announced a return to interim profits growth after two years of decline with
a 26 per cent jump at the pre-tax level to Pounds 5.06m.
The acquisition of the Circle K convenience store chain in 1993 was largely
behind the profits rise during the six months to May 1, which contrasted
with an 18 per cent fall in sales to Pounds 218m. Sales were depressed by
the group's decision to withdraw from the Spar/VG supply business.
Mr David Bremner, chief executive, said the results vindicated W&amp;P's
decision to focus on the convenience store format and move away from
lower-margin, fast food supply.
The interim dividend is increased by 7 per cent to 4.7p (4.4p), while
earnings per share rose by 25 per cent from 8.1p to 10.1p.
Mr Bremner said dividend increases were expected to lag earnings growth
until W&amp;P could rebuild cover of about two times.
The convenience store division showed underlying sales growth of about 2 per
cent, while margins had improved from 2.3 per cent to 2.8 per cent.
This was the result of introducing higher margin goods such as newspapers
and chilled foods, as well as better purchasing practices.
Mr Bremner said W&amp;P intended to accelerate the introduction of electronic
point of sales equipment in the convenience stores. In the longer-term, this
would bring considerable cost savings. W&amp;P aimed to double the margins in
this business over the next five years to about 5 per cent.
The group opened 24 new stores in the first half for a total of 331. A
further 24 are planned for the second six months.
The food services division, which provides supplies to hotels, pubs and
clubs, showed a 42 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 300,000
on a 4.2 per cent rise in sales to Pounds 42m. Operating margins rose by 36
per cent to 0.8 per cent.
The cash and carry business suffered a 5.4 per cent drop in sales to Pounds
83m, leaving profits 7 per cent lower at Pounds 860,000. Mr Bremner said the
business continued to generate cash which could be invested in the two core
divisions.
Interest payments rose by Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 1m, with net debt of
Pounds 23m. This represented some 48 per cent of shareholders' funds,
against 40 per cent last year.
Mr Bremner said gearing was expected to fall back to 40 per cent by the
year-end.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: City Site net assets 16% ahead at Pounds
26.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City Site Estates, property investment and development group, announced a 16
per cent increase in net assets to Pounds 26.6m at the interim stage.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to March 31 were marginally improved at
Pounds 312,000 against Pounds 170,000.
The company was almost dragged down by the property slump but has been
trading actively in an improving market.
Rental income declined from Pounds 5.63m to Pounds 4.85m, reflecting
property sales. The company sold Pounds 2.3m of properties during the
period, but purchased a total of Pounds 7.4m. Property trading contributed
Pounds 137,000.
The portfolio currently has voids representing 6.5 per cent of the total.
The company is confident this will be reduced through active management and
improving tenant demand. It is also marketing a number of other properties
for sale, which are expected to result in a substantial increase in profits
for the full year.
The company is applying to the courts to eliminate a deficit on its profit
and loss account, which would enable it to renew dividend payments.
City Site accrued a further Pounds 564,000 of preference share dividends
during the period, resulting in losses per share of 1.64p (2.56p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Trio Holdings, the international money and securities
broker, fell by almost Pounds 1m - from Pounds 2.39m to Pounds 1.45m - over
the six months to end-March, despite turnover almost doubled from Pounds
24.8m to Pounds 48.4m.
The company said the outcome reflected costs involved in rapid organic
growth and subdued activity in its traditional core dollar/D-Mark market,
particularly in Asia and Europe.
Earnings per share fell to 0.69p (1.59p) and in view of this the directors
said they felt it would be imprudent to pay an interim dividend - 1p was
paid last time.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Problem plants cut Hazlewood down to Pounds
48m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hazlewood Foods raised its dividend by 5 per cent despite losses at four
problem plants which were behind a fall from Pounds 55m to Pounds 48.1m
pre-tax for the year to end March.
Mr Chris Ball resigned as chief executive of UK operations as Mr Peter Barr,
chairman, warned that the situation at the problem plants had deteriorated
in the opening months of this year.
The latest profit was struck after Pounds 3m of exceptional costs relating
to the disposal of two snack and confectionery businesses.
Underlying earnings per share fell from 17.51p to 16p. A final dividend of
4.3p is proposed, taking the total for the year to 6.7p (6.4p).
The group's business is split two thirds in the UK and one third in the
Netherlands. It has been refocusing its activities on added value prepared
food products, where it sees good long term growth prospects.
The grocery and non foods division reported operating profits of Pounds
15.4m on sales of Pounds 156m, down from Pounds 15.8m on sales of Pounds
170m previously. The fall in turnover reflected disposals which formerly
contributed Pounds 25m of sales.
Mr John Simons, finance director, said the grocery side of the business had
improved operating profits from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 12.9m, helped by the
new Selby bottling plant for pickles and sauces. The non food side, had
retreated from Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 2.5m.
In the frozen division, which includes fish, shellfish and ready meals,
operating profits fell from Pounds 27.1m to Pounds 24.6m. The fish side was
hit by both the higher cost of Dutch flatfish and exchange losses.
The fresh foods business, which includes three of the four lossmaking
plants, reported operating profits down from Pounds 22m to Pounds 19.7m.
COMMENT
While Chris Ball has fallen on his sword, the UK strategy must have been
endorsed by the board. They are likely to find it hard to boost the group's
declining margins. Hazlewood now finds itself with a lot of expensive assets
which are not generating cash. There are no signs that the markets it is
aiming for will get any easier. While the fall in the share price could
leave it vulnerable to a predator, it is by no means clear that a new owner
could do better. The group's recent history has been disappointing. In 1989,
when it made Pounds 46.5m on sales of Pounds 454m, the dividend was more
than four times covered - this time it is just over twice covered. Pencilled
in profits of Pounds 45m look like leaving little room for any further
increase.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: An offer that's all but dead and buried -
SCI has made a hostile bid for Great Southern. Simon Davies reports on why
it is unlikely to succeed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most intriguing fact regarding Service Corporation International's offer
document for Great Southern Group, which was released yesterday, is that its
'premium offer by a premier company' has no apparent chance of success.
However, the UK's first hostile takeover for a funeral business looks set to
develop into a lengthy saga of power and possibly greed within the hither-to
quiet traditional family-oriented world of undertak-ing.
The US funeral giant's bid for a slice of Britain's funeral market got off
to an inauspicious start, when JD Field &amp; Sons, which controls 56.1 per cent
of Great Southern, spurned the offer within minutes of its arrival.
Great Southern's own board, which comprises four Field family members,
yesterday followed up its earlier rebutt-al.
Mr James Smillie, chairman, said: 'The offer document contains no new
information which would cause the board to change its view that SCI UK's
unsolicited and unwelcome offers are totally inadequate.'
Many might have considered the game was over, but Mr Bill Heiligbrodt, the
former marine and unabashed Texan cowboy who is chairman of the company, has
set himself the task of roping in Great Southern, and he is in no mood to
give up.
The stock market is giving him some credence. The share price closed
unchanged yesterday at 614p, compared with a 600p bid, indicating the
expectation that there is more to come.
Mr Heiligbrodt, who arrived on May 30 hoping to line up a deal with the
Field family, said yesterday: 'I'm happy to discuss my value with them, and
if there is something I've missed, I'll talk about it. But if they just
don't want to sell out, then they should say so.'
He can afford some degree of confidence. His employers buried 205,000 people
last year, and boast a 9 per cent share of the US market along with a large
chunk of the Australian and Canadian markets. The UK is a logical extention.
SCI has a market capitalisation of about Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.44bn) but
it is faced with a mature market and enormous cash flow.
In the past three years it has used this to increase its number of funeral
homes by 54 per cent, and its cemeteries by 32 per cent, to consolidate its
position as the world's largest private funeral operator.
It has no interest in diversification - 'what other business has no
inventory, a low asset base and no need for technology', says Mr Heiligbrodt
 -but it wants to break into new markets with similar traditions.
Mr Heiligbrodt says SCI has coped with the enormous cultural range of the US
and has no fears of upsetting British traditions. It wants to use Great
Southern as a base to expand into the fragmented UK market.
SCI's document focuses on the slowdown in Great Southern's projected
earnings per share growth, and sets this out against the fact that it made
20 acquisitions between 1988 and 1990, but only one in the past three years.
'If JD Field is to maintain its control of Great Southern, the potential to
make acquisitions is limited in the future,' claims the document.
Brokers have not been convinced. They claim the offer ignores Great
Southern's expansion into crematoria, and its build up of Chosen Heritage,
the pre-paid funeral business which has become a main money spinner.
'There is not much more opportunity for consolidation in the conurbations',
said one analyst.
However, at this stage JD Field &amp; Sons, the Field family's holding company
for Great Southern, is the real issue, and it is proving an awkward
adversary.
The Field family have apparently been in the burial business since 1690,
putting SCI's founding Waltrip family to shame - their initial Houston
funeral home was not set up until 1928.
Great Southern was listed in 1986, but the Field family have scarcely
lightened their grip. JD Field is 26 per cent owned by patriarch Mr Edward
Field and three sons, with a further 70 per cent owned by five family
trusts.
It is these trusts that have been targeted by SCI for a Pounds 458 per share
offer, which compares extremely favourably with the last transaction in the
shares, eight months ago, at Pounds 55.
However, all of the trusts have a Field family member as trustee, and Mr
Peter Wills, a family friend and company secretary of JD Field, is the other
trustee for most of them.
Since the JD Field board is unanimous in its opposition to the offer, there
seems little hope, regardless of its merits.
Mr Heiligbrodt remains optimistic that he is paying a generous premium and
its value will shine through. But he may have to offer a lot more value.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals leave Dairy Crest at Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exceptional items totalling Pounds 35.5m almost wiped out profits at Dairy
Crest, the milk processing and dairy products arm of the Milk Marketing
Board which earlier this month announced the loss of 600 jobs.
The group, which is to be spun off in the changes planned for the milk
market, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.8m, against Pounds 28.2m,
struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 19m.
Mr John Houliston, chief executive, said that operating profits from
continuing operations, before allowing an Pounds 8m provision for the
recently announced restructuring, had risen 7 per cent, from Pounds 38.6m to
Pounds 41.4m. However, he warned of 'extremely tough' market conditions
which would be reflected in the interim results.
Turnover fell from Pounds 1.16bn to Pounds 997.7m, including Pounds 167.1m
(Pounds 336.4m) from discontinued operations, resulting in sales from
continuing operations being flat at Pounds 830.6m (Pounds 819.4m). On the
same basis operating margins were slightly higher at 5 per cent.
'Dairy Crest continues to make sound progress and is well positioned for the
free market in milk,' he said.
He did not rule out floating part of Dairy Crest before November 1, when the
new milk marketing plans take effect. However, details were not likely for
some weeks.
Exceptional items included losses of Pounds 20.8m on disposals, mainly
reflecting goodwill written back on the sale of five bottling dairies. A 12
per cent in the decline of doorstep milk deliveries led to a provision of
Pounds 9.8m against the book value of the group's diary in Chadwell Heath,
Essex.
The fall in doorstep sales was the main reason for the decline in operating
profits at the food services division from Pounds 23.4m on sales of Pounds
544.2m to Pounds 21.3m on sales of Pounds 505.9m.
Operating profits in consumer foods, which includes liquid milk sales to
supermarkets, rose from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 20.1m on sales of Pounds
324.7m (Pounds 275.2m).
The disposals helped the group to end the year with net cash of Pounds 23m
compared with net borrowings of Pounds 69.5m previously. Net interest
payable fell from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 1.5m.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Wessex Water rises 20% and meets
expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that a false market in water shares would be created by leaks of
forthcoming price increases appeared unfounded as Wessex Water ended the
industry's results season yesterday.
Wessex met expectations with a 20 per cent increase in annual pre-tax
profits to Pounds 103.3m and a 9.3 per cent dividend rise to 23.5p.
This included a final pay-out of 15.5p, up by 9 per cent. Sales increased by
6 per cent to Pounds 217.2m for the year to March 31.
Analysts expressed relief that there had been no leaks of the discussions
water companies are having with the industry regulator Ofwat on price
increases for the next five years.
The companies had received draft increases at the end of May, but the
figures will not be published until July 28.
This had prompted complaints to Ofwat and the Stock Exchange that
speculation could have led to a false market.
The season showed water companies concerned above all with cost-cutting and
treasury management. This will be increasingly important under the stricter
pricing regime promised by the regulator. Companies will have to live with
lower price increases, while facing increased capital commitments because of
regulation and environmental concerns.
On average, analysts said, costs rose by about 2 per cent against almost 6
per cent a year between 1990 and 1993.
Wessex scored highly on cost control yesterday, showing a 2 per cent decline
at the operational level. After allowing for higher depreciation, costs were
held at Pounds 125m.
The group's profits were boosted by a doubled contribution from the joint
venture with Waste Management International.
Wessex intended to continue pursuing acquisitions in the waste management
division, having completed eight last year. Some Pounds 65m remained to fund
expansion.
The core utility increased operating profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 92.2m.
Wessex ended the year with net cash of Pounds 39m.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose to 60.4p from 60.1p. The shares closed
down 17p at 586p.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Lower expenses boost Eurotherm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotherm, the industrial process control equipment supplier, reported a 32
per cent increase in pre-tax profits in the six months to the end of April,
despite flat sales.
Profits were Pounds 12.1m, against Pounds 9.2m on turnover little changed at
Pounds 81.9m (Pounds 81m). However Mr Jack Leonard, chairman, said the order
book 'is a last beginning to move ahead'.
The increase mainly reflected a reduction in administrative expenses to
Pounds 28.6m, against Pounds 31.8m which included Pounds 500,000 of
redundancy costs. The average number of employees fell by 5 per cent from
2,124 to 2,029.
Earnings per share increased by 31 per cent to 8.9p (6.8p) and the interim
dividend is raised by 14 per cent to 2p (1.75p). Despite this the shares
closed 28p lower at 369p.
The geographic revenue pattern was only moderately changed from last year.
Sales in the US were flat at Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 23.7m), but there was some
improvement in UK sales to Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 17.2m). And the group said
most parts of continental Europe, with the exception of Germany, showed
signs of economic recovery. Adjusted for currency movements, shipments grew
by 2.5 per cent.
Mr Claes Hultman, chief executive, emphasised that order book growth had
begun to accelerate helped by the steady introduction of new products. The
new order rate was now running at about 5 per cent ahead of last year.
Operating profits in the first half advanced to Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 9.3m)
fuelled by the reduction in the wage bill. Pre-tax profits were also helped
by a swing from net interest costs of Pounds 100,000 to net receipts of
Pounds 200,000 as the group used its strong cash flow to reduce borrowings.
The group ended the period with net cash of Pounds 11.9m after repurchasing
certain minority holdings in subsidiaries for Pounds 1.6m in cash.
COMMENT
Once again Eurotherm has proved it can keep profits moving ahead by
improving efficiency and squeezing out more productivity. As a result most
of its key ratios have been transformed over the past three years. Despite
optimistic forecasts, the management has yet to prove it can engineer a
long-awaited resumption of sales growth. That may now be in sight. If order
book improvements are translated into higher sales, full year pre-tax
profits of Pounds 26m look possible, producing earnings of about 19.2p.
Although the shares took a tumble in a jumpy market yesterday, they still
deserve their premium rating.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Advance to Pounds 126m at Manweb - Policy
of concentrating on core businesses set to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manweb, the Cheshire-based electricity distributor and supplier, re-affirmed
its policy of concentrating on core businesses yesterday as it announced a
13.6 per cent rise in annual profits.
The company proposes to pay a final dividend of 17.35p, taking the total to
24.35p, a 16 per cent increase.
'Our view is if we focus on the core we can best add value for
shareholders,' said Mr John Roberts, chief executive.
In the four years since privatisation, Manweb has been less keen than other
recs to diversify into other businesses and is the only one which has not
taken a stake in a combined cycle gas power plant.
Mr Roberts saw no reason to change the policy of caution on diversification,
even though Manweb had cash deposits of Pounds 58.2m at the year-end and is
therefore seen by some analysts as being likely to be tempted into making
acquisitions.
In the year to March 31, Manweb increased profits from Pounds 111m to Pounds
126m pre-tax on turnover up from Pounds 920m to Pounds 930m. Earnings per
share growth of 20.6 per cent to 83.6p was helped by a lower than expected
tax charge of 21.4 per cent.
The tax charge reflects higher capital spending, higher capital allowances,
and resolution of long-standing issues with the Inland Revenue. The company
expects a tax charge of about 23 per cent in future years.
Although supply profits rose to Pounds 27.3m (Pounds 6.9m), profits in the
main distribution business fell 9.4 per cent to Pounds 91.9m as a result of
increased insurance and depreciation charges and investment in customer
services.
Unusually for a power company, job numbers rose - from 4,346 to 4,428.
Manweb said it had taken out more costs than most other companies since
privatisation and had shed 23 per cent of jobs in the core businesses, but
last year had concentrated on improving customer services.
'We expect to bring in further efficiencies in future years,' said Mr
Roberts. Analysts expect a further round of job cuts after completion of the
regulator's distribution review.
Retail profits rose by Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 600,000, in spite of a 4 per
cent fall in turnover to Pounds 28.3m, and contracting showed a Pounds
100,000 profit against a Pounds 1.1m loss in 1992-93. The company made
Pounds 700,000 from wind farms and continued to make a profit from supplying
gas to more than 1,000 sites. Expenditure on the distribution network and
business infrastructure rose 20 per cent to Pounds 103m.
Manweb is seeking shareholders' approval at the annual meeting to buy back
10 per cent of its shares.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Jackson criticises its
restructuring bankers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The directors of Brown &amp; Jackson, the Poundstretcher retail group rescued
recently by Pepkor, the South African group, are poised to launch an
unusually outspoken attack on their bankers.
The company's annual report, which is posted to shareholders today, includes
a report saying its banks 'unnecessarily placed at risk the future of the
group and the interests of shareholders, other creditors and employees'.
The lead bank during three years of restructuring was Midland. Arthur
Andersen was appointed as investigating accountants to the company.
The latest attack follows a letter in the Financial Times from Mr John
Jackson, the company's chairman, last Thursday criticising the existing
rules which allow investigating accountants to a company in financial
difficulties to be appointed as receivers.
Mr Jackson yesterday criticised the banks for charging Pounds 1.5m in
'success fees' contingent on injections of fresh equity over three years
during which he said their loans fell from Pounds 27m to Pounds 7m.
The company's negotiating position was made more difficult by its protracted
discussions with the banks, he added. 'I found the whole experience
frustrating and baffling. There was a lack of people (at the banks) with
sufficient experience outside banking to enter into a meaningful dialogue
with the directors.'
'It's time these sort of things were discussed. There are not many companies
that have been through this and lived to tell the tale.'
Some observers of the Brown &amp; Jackson restructuring, however, pointed out
that the company's problems were deep and complex. It was saved by an equity
injection and new banking lines brought by Pepkor.
Midland said last night that banking confidentiality precluded it from
commenting on its relationship with a customer.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Silentnight shares fall on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Silentnight Holdings fell by more than 10 per cent after Europe's
biggest manufacturer of beds announced that the results seen in the first
four months in the core UK bed division had been 'disappointing'.
Yesterday the shares closed down 24p at 219p, having at one point fallen as
low as 209p.
Mr Bill Davies, executive chairman, said that the UK bed businesses remained
'under significant margin pressure'. Not counting closure costs, which would
be taken in the accounts for the current year, he expected 'results for the
first half to be lower than the first half last year', when profits grew 27
per cent to Pounds 5.2m.
He explained there had been little change in the condition of the UK
furniture market in the last couple of months.
However, not all the news was bad: there had been an upturn in the US
operation; the German bed business had been performing satisfactorily; and
there had been continued healthy growth in the UK cabinet businesses.
In March the group's shares tumbled 18p to 355p following a warning that
profits for the year to January would be 'slightly below average market
expectations'. The result, announced in May, was 3 per cent ahead at Pounds
12.4m.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Kingfisher to cut 400 jobs at Comet after
sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kingfisher is planning to cut the equivalent of 400 full-time jobs from the
workforce of its Comet electrical retailing chain following the introduction
of new technology and a reduction in opening hours.
Comet staff were told yesterday of the plans to cut total working hours by
10 per cent and to move the weekday opening time from 9am to 10am.
The changes, which follow a six-month review of Comet's store operations,
come against a background of difficult trading conditions. Comet's sales
fell by 2.1 per cent in the first quarter, although gross margins improved.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, Kingfisher's corporate affairs director, said: 'The
object of the changes is to enhance service and therefore sales and to
reduce costs so that we can operate profitably and successfully in a very
competitive market.'
Of the time freed by the shorter opening hours about 15 per cent will be
used for additional staff training to improve product knowledge.
Comet is investing Pounds 10m on the latest generation of electronic point
of sale equipment which is currently installed in 50 stores and will be in
all 233 outlets by the end of the year. This should reduce the time staff
spend on stock taking, processing credit agreements and reading reports from
head office.
Comet is also adopting some techniques developed at Darty, Kingfisher's
French electricals chain, including the focus on 'key performance
indicators' such as sales per full-time equivalent and customer conversion
rates.
It is thought that the changes will cost Kingfisher less than Pounds 3m, of
which the bulk are one-off redundancy costs. But the moves could save an
estimated Pounds 4m a year.
The total number of jobs lost will depend on how many full-time posts are
involved and how many staff are redeployed elsewhere in the group.
The change in opening hours, which will be introduced before the end of
July, follows research which shows that sales between 9am and 10am are
minimal.
Last week Dixons announced plans to sell off 100 of Currys' remaining high
street shops to concentrate on superstores. Comet has already completed this
shift.

FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Templeton Emerging net assets up 40%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust, the largest in its sector,
announced growth in net asset value per share of 40 per cent to 346.2p over
the year to end-April.
Investment income and interest increased from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 9.9m,
but expenses rose from Pounds 2.49m to Pounds 5.98m. Earnings declined from
2.75p to 2.73p per share, while the proposed dividend of 2.1p marks an
increase of 23.5 per cent on the previous year. But Templeton warned that
its primary focus was capital growth, and it could not indicate future
dividend levels.
Higher dividends tend to result from large temporary cash and bond holdings
after raising new funds, as yields on emerging markets are low. This year's
dividend was also boosted by new rules on tax treatment of foreign income
dividends.
At end-April, the geographic split of the trust's investments was central
and south America (25.6 per cent), Asia (35.9 per cent), Europe (19.8 per
cent), Africa (0.3 per cent), and 18.4 per cent in cash.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Renault may be partially sold off by end of year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government is considering a partial privatisation of Renault, the
state-owned automobile group, by the end of this year, according to Mr
Philippe Auberger, a senior member of the National Assembly's finance
committee.
Mr Auberger's comments yesterday follow speculation in business circles that
the government will seek to implement a progressive or partial privatisation
of the automobile company, following the collapse of merger plans with Volvo
of Sweden at the end of last year.
During the negotiations with Volvo, the French government had said it aimed
to sell its controlling stake in Renault this year. But the merger's
failure, the political sensitivity involved in privatising one of the
flagship companies of the French public sector and the possibility of trade
union opposition prompted a delay in the timetable. Officials have since
indicated that a sale of the government's 80 per cent stake in the
automobile group is unlikely before next spring's presidential elections.
According to Mr Auberger, the idea of a partial privatisation is being
studied by the office of Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, and by Mr
Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, who has pushed for the company's
privatisation. Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman, is also eager for
the company to be transferred to the private sector.
Mr Auberger said that no decision had been taken and the operation, if
implemented, would be unlikely before October or November. He hinted that it
could take the form of a sale of shares to industrial or financial partners
rather than through a public offer for sale.
Government officials declined to discuss the mechanisms of a partial
privatisation. But industry observers in Paris suggested that it could
involve the sale of between 15 and 25 per cent of Renault's shares and the
formation of a so-called 'noyau dur' - a core of long-term shareholders.
This could include Lagardere Group, which co-operates with Renault on the
design and production of its Espace vehicles, and Elf-Aquitaine, the oil
group.
A partial privatisation would confirm the government's commitment to
privatise the automobile group, and could facilitate the reduction of
Volvo's 20 per cent holding in the company.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Eurodollar latest to delay issue as shares fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's fall in share prices has created further turmoil in the new
issue market, with Eurodollar postponing its Pounds 100m flotation and a
number of smaller issues being pulled.
Eurodollar, the UK's second-largest car rental company, had planned to issue
its prospectus and pricing details today.
But the group, the subject of a management buy-out from TSB last year, said
that 'in the light of market conditions, it would be appropriate to delay
impact day for a short period'.
The company emphasised that the flotation had been postponed rather than
abandoned and said that book-building with institutional investors was
continuing.
Eurodollar follows British Printing Company, which recently postponed its
Pounds 250m stock market debut. Other casualties include property group
London Capital Holdings and three cable companies.
But it is smaller companies that have proved most vulnerable to the market
downturn. Yesterday the planned Pounds 13.5m flotation of bingo halls group
Jasmine was called off.
The float, which was being handled by Greig Middleton, was already falling
behind schedule and the company said that Monday's stock market slump had
'put the kibosh' on its plans.
The company was a management buy-out from Rank and hoped to raise money to
pay off the buy-out debt.
Pegson, a construction equipment maker, has also postponed its plans for a
placing through Granville Davies, which would have valued it at around
Pounds 12m.
Advisers to Universal Ceramic Materials, whose flotation price was due to be
announced on Thursday, were in meetings last night.
But, apart from Eurodollar, the larger companies that are in the final
run-up to flotation are sticking to their schedules. Exco, the money broker
hoping to float with a Pounds 220m valuation, is still looking to price its
shares next week.
Mr Simon Linnett of sponsors N M Rothschild said: 'We are reasonably
confident that everything will proceed according to plan. The reception from
institutions has been very good and, as 3i has shown, there is still an
appetite for quality new issues.'
Pillar Property Investment also confirmed the timetable for its Pounds 175m
flotation.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Thorn EMI music chief gets Pounds 13.5m package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jim Fifield, who heads Thorn EMI's music business, has trebled his salary
package to about Pounds 13.5m - a figure more than 23 times higher than the
sum paid to the company's chairman, Sir Colin Southgate.
The package includes his Pounds 2.105m basic salary and a Pounds 5.046m
performance-related bonus, of which Pounds 1.5m is in ordinary shares. This
was partly an annual bonus awarded by the board for achieving internal group
targets, and partly from the music division's incentive scheme.
In addition, Mr Fifield received 619,592 ordinary shares free of charge as
compensation for changes to his terms of contract. Thorn refused to comment
on the changes.
At yesterday's closing price of 1034p, Mr Fifield's bonus shares were worth
Pounds 6.4m. However, under the terms of his remuneration agreement, the
shares cannot be sold until March 31 1998.
Mr Fifield's remuneration is revealed in the latest report and accounts. Sir
Colin's package includes a salary of Pounds 474,347 and a Pounds 110,630
bonus, which he took in shares. In the previous year, he received a total of
Pounds 702,759.
Thorn EMI directors' pay and bonuses are decided by a board compensation
committee which is chaired by the group's non-executive deputy chairman, Sir
Peter Walters, formerly head of BP. The committee consists of all the
non-executive directors, including Sir Michael Angus, chairman of Whitbread
and former president of the CBI, Mr David Barnes, chief executive of Zeneca,
and Sir Graham Day, former chairman of Cadbury Schweppes and British
Aerospace.
Leisure analysts expressed surprise at the payments to Mr Fifield, who
earned Pounds 4.7m the previous year. 'Even though the music division has
shown remarkable growth, Fifield's salary has gone a bit overboard,' said
one. However, given the success of the music business and possible
shareholder gains through a demerger, few thought shareholder dissent would
be a serious problem.
Thorn's profits grew from Pounds 273.5m to Pounds 326.5m last year, with the
music division increasing from Pounds 196.9m to Pounds 246.1m.
Thorn is renaming its rental business Thorn Group to differentiate it from
EMI Music, which is based in New York.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Pensions point to clash in capital market styles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Last week's formal abandonment of the moribund draft EU directive on
cross-border pension fund investment emphasises the continuing gulf between
the capital market styles of the UK and most of the rest of the EU. The
single market in investment and financial services seems as far away as
ever.
The directive was the less ambitious of a pair introduced two years ago to
open up pension schemes. The first, aimed at facilitating cross-border
membership, collapsed because it challenged the tax sovereignty of EU
states. Northern countries feared they would hand out tax relief on lifetime
earnings only for the workers to disappear to the Costa del Sol, where a
grateful but undeserving Spain would gather income tax on the pensions.
The second directive aimed to harmonise investment rules and open the way
for investment management firms to compete throughout the EU. But few member
states have been willing to relax their grip on institutional investment
strategies when captive domestic investors are urgently needed to help
absorb EU governments' borrowing, recently running at an annual rate of
Dollars 400bn. Hence the 'prudential' rules which require heavy investment
in bonds and domestic currency assets.
Germany and France, holders of the next two EU presidencies, have no
interest in opening up the scope for international funding of pensions. They
are strongholds of unfunded schemes, with German companies generally
retaining their liabilities on their balance sheets and France relying on
pay-as-you-go systems (although these are increasingly threatened with
insolvency).
German companies are regaining their nerve as the economy begins to recover
after what was, in the event, not all that deep a recession. There have been
shocks, such as last year's decision by Daimler-Benz to adopt US accounting
principles and seek a New York listing, and the crisis at
Metallgesellschaft. On the other hand, BMW has absorbed Rover and
Jungheinrich has grabbed control of the forklift truck businesses of the
collapsed British group Lancer Boss.
German executives are quick to criticise the short-termism of British
companies, with high dividend payments - also criticised by Mr Stephen
Dorrell, the British Treasury minister investigating savings and investment
flows - low fixed investment and short payback horizons. But these high
dividends are the other side of the coin of the enviably strong British
occupational pension schemes, which own more than 30 per cent of the shares
of British companies.
Continental observers also find it hard to understand the success of the
London Stock Exchange in attracting new company listings at a recent rate of
more than 200 a year. New listings on continental bourses are tiny by
comparison; for cultural and tax reasons most continental businesses prefer
to stay (very) private. But executives at the London exchange are wondering
whether it might be possible to market the attractions of a UK flotation
more widely on the continent.
Is this just another aspect of British short-termism? In the late 1980s the
City's financial vultures made money through corporate raids and takeovers.
Now they are luring quite small and often young companies to early flotation
through a get-rich-quick promise. The obsession, continentals feel, is with
'exit' rather than long-term commitment.
On the other hand, the stream of flotations and dividends also promotes a
dynamic recycling of wealth. Money piles up less readily in big, dull
businesses, but is diverted through contributions and dividends into their
own and other companies' pension schemes. Growth is achieved through the
development of smaller, focused companies rather than the sideways expansion
of big, rambling groups.
The British government's reluctance to promote the UK's capital market style
is disappointing and puzzling; indeed, there has recently appeared to be a
hankering after the German approach. The failure to open up a Europe-wide
investment market is also very damaging to British interests. No wonder the
British business community is becoming disillusioned with continental
Europe. The UK is a global centre of excellence for portfolio management,
but more business is to be had in the US than in the remainder of the EU.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Hazlewood hit by losses at four plants: Profits fall by more
than 12 per cent - UK chief executive resigns / Shares down 21p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at four of Hazlewood Foods' big UK plants have led to the resignation
of Mr Chris Ball as chief executive of the group's UK operations.
Mr Peter Barr, chairman, yesterday warned that the situation at the four
problem plants, in which the group has invested more than Pounds 20m, had
continued to deteriorate in the first few months of this year.
Hazlewood announced yesterday that profits fell by more than 12 per cent,
from Pounds 55m to Pounds 48.1m, in the year to March 31. The shares closed
21p down at 122p.
The biggest problem has been the Hilliers plant in Plymouth, which was
acquired from Northern Foods in April last year and converted from making
frozen foods to chilled foods. It has been running at an annualised loss of
around Pounds 4m.
'It has taken a lot longer and proved a lot more costly than we thought,'
said Mr John Simons, finance director, yesterday.
The group is losing a further Pounds 3m a year at three other sites. It
spent Pounds 6.1m at Rowan Foods in Wrexham, which makes ready meals, to
double capacity in the expectation of rapid sales growth. The plant, which
had been making money, went into the red.
A new sausage factory in Sheffield, in which Pounds 3.6m was invested, and a
salad processor in Waltham Abbey, where Pounds 1.7m was spent, have also
failed to make any returns.
Mr Barr said that the expectations for all four projects had not been
fulfilled. The non-executive directors had felt that Mr Ball could not get
the return the group was looking for.
He admitted that the group's problems did not reflect pressure from
supermarket price cutting or rising raw material prices.
'I would love to blame someone else - but it's entirely our own fault,' he
said.
The group was committed to turning Hilliers round, he said, adding that the
problems centred on productivity. 'We know what to do and we will be
tackling it energetically - but it's a six-month job.'
Mr Ball is not being replaced. UK operations will be co-ordinated by a
management committee of senior directors chaired by Mr Barr.
Overall group turnover grew by 5 per cent from Pounds 761.8m to Pounds 800m.
Mr Simons said that the group had achieved 6 per cent growth over the last
three or four years.

FT  22 JUN 94 / EU unable to provide ministers' voting record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Council of Ministers, the most powerful European Union institution where
ministers of the 12 member states decide on hundreds of European laws that
are later put on national statute books, is unable to provide records of how
members have voted.
In a letter to the Financial Times turning down a request for voting
records, the general secretariat of the Council says it cannot provide such
records because it does not compile them.
However, the rejection of the request has been contested by the Netherlands
and Denmark, and reservations about the decision have been expressed by the
UK. Ministers' votes are recorded in the minutes of Council meetings. The
Council has refused to release these.
The EU system of qualified majority voting (QMV) brought the UK and Spain
into dispute with their partners this spring in the worst row since the
crisis over ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
However, the often tendentious claims made during that dispute could not be
tested against a public record of how majority voting worked in practice.
Such a record would show that the EU culture of consensus means very few
legislative proposals are put to a vote, in order to avoid isolating member
states. When a vote is taken, Germany, the largest member state, is the
country most often outvoted.
After the spring row, and because the votes dispute will resurface before
the 1996 constitutional review of Maastricht, the Financial Times sought
information on the workings of QMV in decisions made by the Council of
Ministers for foreign affairs, the internal market, social affairs, and
agriculture, dating back to 1989. Under the single-market programme alone,
ministers agreed over 200 Euro-laws during that period, most under the QMV
system.
The FT request was made under the code of conduct on public access to
information, which was established after five successive summits of EU
leaders called for more open government to 'bring Europe closer to the
people'. Most votes taken since the code was passed last December are now
made public.
In reply, on May 31, the general secretariat of the Council said it did 'not
compile voting records' and was unable to supply the information requested.
On June 6, the FT exercised its right to have the rejected request pass from
the Council secretariat to member states.
The member states received the correspondence on June 17, when the low-level
General Affairs Group of the Council tried to push through a second
rejection. That was vetoed by the Dutch and Danes, while the UK sought more
time to consider a change in the appeal procedure.
The draft of the second rejection, obtained by the FT, restated that 'the
general secretariat does not compile lists of voting records and the Council
is not in possession of any such statistics'.

FT  22 JUN 94 / George Michael loses court fight over contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
George Michael, the pop singer, yesterday lost his legal battle with Sony,
the Japanese electronics and entertainment group, to have his recording
contract ruled unenforceable.
In a case which attracted small armies of media and dewy-eyed fans to the
High Court, Mr Michael argued he should be allowed greater freedom to pursue
his career as a creative artist.
The pop star had claimed his contract with Sony to produce eight albums
should be declared void because it amounted to unreasonable restraint of
trade and was contrary to competition provisions of the Treaty of Rome.
Mr Justice Jonathan Parker yesterday rejected the singer's claims - ruling
his contract with the record company was 'reasonable and fair'. The singer
had access to expert legal advice when he signed the contract, the judge
said.
A disappointed Mr Michael said it was likely he would appeal against the
judgment which, he claimed, in effect upheld 'professional slavery'.
But the ruling was widely welcomed by members of the recording industry.
Some have argued, that had the judgment gone the other way, it would have
led to the renegotiation of many performers' contracts and to companies
being discouraged from investing in new and untried talent.
Mr Rupert Perry, UK chief executive of EMI Music and chairman of the British
Phonographic Industry trade body, said: 'As an industry, we invest
substantial amounts of money in this country. If the judgment stands, we
will be able to continue to do so.'
Sony appeared to offer an olive branch to the vanquished superstar. 'We have
great respect for George Michael and his artistry and look forward to
continuing our relationship with him,' it said.
Mr Michael, however, told a press conference he was confident the court's
decision could be overturned.
He said that under the terms of his contract with Sony, he had no control
over how his work was exploited and no guarantee it would even be released.
The court has yet to decide how much of the bill for the action should be
picked up by Mr Michael. One unofficial estimate put the cost of bringing
the case at Pounds 3m.
Mr Michael was formerly in the group Wham] which had a string of hits in the
early 1980s. His first solo LP Faith, released in 1987, sold 14m copies
worldwide.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Japanese recovery stronger than expected in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's economy recovered more strongly than expected in the first three
months of this year, with a 3.9 per cent annualised increase in gross
domestic product.
The rise of 1 per cent over the previous three months, the best for three
years, shows that the 'worst period is over', said Mr Tsutomu Tanaka,
vice-minister of the economic planning agency.
However, the stagnation of the economy was reflected in the meagre 0.03 per
cent growth in the fiscal year to March, the worst performance since zero
growth in 1974, in the aftermath of the first oil price shock.
Most private sector economists are slightly more cautious in their forecasts
than the EPA, and believe the economy might contract slightly in the second
quarter, as it did after first-quarter growth in the past two years.
Market consensus is for 0.7 per cent growth in GDP in the current calender
year, below the government's target of 2.4 per cent, which even officials
privately admit is high.
But Mr Kazuaki Harada, chief economist at Sanwa Bank Research Institute,
said: 'The economy passed the bottom in the third quarter of 1993.'
The first quarter's stronger than expected rise featured a 0.8 per cent
quarter-on-quarter increase in personal spending and 3.7 per cent rise in
exports. Those are unsustainable, but that does not threaten an overall
gentle upturn, analysts said.
Private sector demand recovered by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter and
public sector demand expanded by 0.6 per cent, indicating that the economy
is still being propped up by the effect of previous governments' four
pump-priming packages, worth Y45,000bn (Pounds 286bn), over the past 18
months. Among the uncertainties is the value of the yen, which yesterday
rose sharply against the dollar, to close in New York at Y100.335, up from
Y101.9. It opened in Tokyo at Y100.35. An unexpected jump in the Japanese
currency, to nearly Y100 to the dollar last August, helped to choke recovery
last year.
Long-term interest rates have also risen in the past few days. Another
imponderable is the impact of a Y5,850bn income tax rebate due this month.
That represents 1.2 per cent of this year's GDP, the EPA estimates, but
Japanese consumers may save rather than spend the money.
The EPA announced that its leading index of economic indicators rose from
76.9 in March to 80 in April, the fourth consecutive month above 50, the
dividing line between growth and contraction. The index, while sometimes
erratic, is designed as a barometer of economic conditions three to six
months ahead.

FT  22 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Manweb
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Manweb shows the virtues of a utility sticking to its knitting. Out of the
12 regional electricity companies, Manweb stands out as the one which has
diversified the least since privatisation. It has duly been rewarded with
the highest stock market rating, with its yield on a 10 per cent discount to
the sector.
The most obvious reason is that Manweb has avoided the foolish acquisitions
of its peers. It has not wasted money on contracting in the way that East
Midlands and, to a lesser extent, Swalec have. Nor has it piled into
retailing, a business to which it is hard to see recs adding much value. Nor
even has it invested in generation, a move that has so far been profitable
for most recs but where again it is not clear they possess any competitive
advantages.
But the avoidance of foolish investments is only one reason why sticking to
the knitting pays off. Even more important is that Manweb's senior
management has not been distracted from improving efficiency in its core
distribution business. Manweb has done more than other recs, with the
possible exception of Eastern, to reduce costs.
In theory, that should leave it well placed to survive the tighter price
caps due to be unveiled in August by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the
industry regulator. The idea is that those which have made the biggest
strides to improve efficiency will be rewarded by being allowed to keep a
share of the benefits. Those that have done the least will be spurred on
with a tougher challenge.

FT  22 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Wessex Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even after yesterday's 3 per cent fall in its shares, Wessex remains one of
the two best performing water companies since privatisation. Since it again
delivered the largest dividend increase in the sector, some outperformance
is not surprising. As well as having merits as a utility - operating costs
on the water side have fallen two years running in real terms - the joint
venture with Waste Management International appears to be delivering the
promised growth. Earnings per share rose fractionally even after adjusting
for the rights issue made 18 months ago to fund diversification.
Wessex will have to drive the waste side hard if it is to avoid diluting
earnings in the years to come. By 1998 there could be 160m shares in issue,
against little over 100m at privatisation. With Pounds 65m rights money
still in the kitty - and more to come as other classes of capital convert
into ordinary shares - Wessex and its partner do not have to rely on organic
growth. Yet little more than Pounds 10m was spent on waste acquisitions last
year, which underlines that attractive assets are thin on the ground.
If Wessex does manage to spend its money wisely, the stock market will have
to decide how to value a combined water and waste group. Putting this year's
likely waste earnings on an average market multiple makes Wessex's interest
in the venture worth about Pounds 1 a share. Floating a portion of the
venture would be the best way of putting such valuations to the test, as
well as lifting the veil a little more on exactly where the growth is coming
from.

FT  22 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Sony
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The music industry will be relieved at Sony's court victory over pop star
George Michael. Defeat could have led other grumpy pop stars to break their
contracts. The rot could even have spread to other industries based on
intellectual property such as book publishing or film production. Even so,
Sony's victory is something of a hollow one. The Japanese electronics giant
will not be able to force George Michael to produce a stream of smash hits
between now and 2003. Sony's hard line may even deter other artists from
signing up with its music arm.
It is, of course, easy to understand how Sony got into a no-win situation.
When music companies promote a particular album, they are marketing not just
the particular songs but the artist. So it is natural to try to recoup their
investment over a series of albums by signing long-term contracts. A similar
phenomenon is increasingly apparent in the book world where some novelists
receive multi-million dollar contracts for committing themselves to write a
series of pot boilers for a single publisher. But the George Michael case
shows that such contracts on their own contain little value. The lesson for
all companies dealing in intellectual property is that a legally solid
contract is a poor substitute for a good relationship.

FT  22 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Dollar under fire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Naples summit of industrial leaders in two weeks will look a sorry sight
if these market conditions continue. A weak dollar is dragging down the US
bond market. Other bond markets - illogically in view of its strong currency
including Germany - are sliding in its wake. That in turn is upsetting
equities. Against that background the summit leaders cannot credibly
congratulate themselves about economic recovery. Pressure on central banks
to calm the dollar with intervention will grow, now that the currency has
tested levels below Y100. Yet apart from the Bank of Japan, which obviously
has most at stake, it is hard to see them showing much enthusiasm.
Intervention may calm the market temporarily but without accompanying policy
action it is unlikely to have much lasting effect. The Federal Reserve would
need to signal its determination with another sharp rise in interest rates.
Yet the US economy is showing signs of cooling and the Fed has indicated it
would prefer to wait. Fear of another rate rise has clearly spooked the
equity market, but it stands to lose both ways. Bond market nervousness and
higher long-term interest rates are hardly a recipe for sustained recovery.
Similarly the Bundesbank is in a bind. With M3 money supply still growing at
a 13.7 per cent annual rate and economic recovery in the air, it cannot
relish the thought either of intervening or of cutting official rates again.
The last rate cut, explicitly designed to curb M3 by encouraging investors
to move out along the yield curve, does not seem to be working yet even
though 10-year bonds yield 200 basis points more than three-month money.
With markets in such a state, investors' natural inclination is to stick
with cash.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Guilt trip to Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The slaughter in Rwanda began well over two months ago, after the death of
President Juvenal Habyarimana in an air crash on April 6. It quickly became
clear that the death toll was running into hundreds of thousands. The UN's
first reaction was to pull out most of the 2,500 troops it then had in the
country. By May 16 the Security Council felt sufficient collective shame to
decide that a larger force of 5,500 men should be sent in. After a certain
amount of arm-twisting, African countries from Senegal to Zimbabwe came up
with offers of troops. But the logistics, weapons and specialised units were
to come from industrialised countries. For most of those the UN is still
waiting.
Suddenly last week, as if waking from a deep sleep, the French government
informed the world that what was happening in Rwanda was intolerable, that
something should be done to stop it, and that France was ready to send
troops. Why? The usual explanation applies. The massacres had become
unpleasantly visible on French television, aided by a visit from the
ever-telegenic Dr Bernard Kouchner, minister for humanitarian affairs in the
previous French government.
Western conscience
Better late than never, perhaps; and conscience is still conscience even
when pricked by television. But the French conscience in this case, like the
western conscience in the case of the Iraqi Kurds three years ago, is
pricked not only by solidarity but also by guilt. The Rwandan government and
army, instigators of the current genocide, were bolstered until very
recently with French military and financial support.
France's desire to halt the unintended consequences of its past policies is
no doubt laudable. But understandably the guerrillas of the rebel Rwandan
Patriotic Front distrust French motives, believing the real object of the
planned intervention is to deny them an outright victory in the civil war.
They have rejected the plan, warning that they will treat any French
soldiers in Rwanda as hostile. Yesterday they rejected an invitation to
Paris for talks.
The French plan also appears to lack any clear objective beyond the
immediate emotional imperative of rescuing civilians trapped in the
conflict. But as the Somali imbroglio made clear, rushing into a
humanitarian intervention without a political masterplan carries the risk of
trapping soldiers in a military operation without clear goals or a defined
exit.
It is somewhat naive to believe that French forces will be able to protect
civilians without getting caught up in the conflict. Liberating civilians
from government concentration camps would involve taking on unruly militias
enlisted by the army to halt the rebel advance. Nor is it clear how public
opinion will react in France if the intervention force begins to suffer
casualties.
UN plan
In short, France would do much better to throw its weight behind the
existing UN plan, with a view to beefing and speeding it up, than to
proclaim a brand new French initiative and charge in at the head of an ad
hoc force. It could also play a useful diplomatic role, by exercising
leverage on its former proteges in the Rwandan government. On the RPF side
(which certainly needs to show moderation if genocide is not to be avenged
by the imposition of minority rule) leverage could best come from President
Yoweri Museveni of Uganda. Ethnic ties being stronger than state frontiers,
many RPF fighters owe weapons and training to previous service under his
command.
But many more questions need to be addressed by the UN membership as a
whole, and especially by the permanent members of the Security Council.
Perhaps these two are the most urgent:
Should they be sending troops to Rwanda, in the probably vain hope of
stopping a massacre when so many thousands are already dead; or would they
do better to deploy a force in neighbouring Burundi, where genocide between
the same two ethnic groups might yet be prevented?
If they really want the UN to be able to intervene effectively and in good
time when such horrific conflict breaks out, should they not endow it with a
properly trained and equipped standing force, ready to leave at a moment's
notice?

FT  22 JUN 94 / Minds over matter: Common perceptions about how wealth is
created are misleading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Collectors of dotty opinions may have noticed a fine example in The
Guardian's letter columns a few weeks back. It came in response to a
thoughtful and informative article in that paper on the subject of New Age
travellers, squatters, crusties and the like. The writer, Jo-Ann Goodwin,
had ventured the rash thought that some of those she talked to made 'no
connection between Income Support and the work and taxes of others'.
This was too much for Mr David Richardson, of Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex. Did
Ms Goodwin, he asked, ever wonder about her own income? Did it not come,
like the giro cheques of the New Agers, 'out of the general pool of
available resources?'
As a journalist, the letter continued, Ms Goodwin was no more productive
than those she wrote about. If only the obviously productive were to be
rewarded, 'it would be miners and their families featuring in the gossip
columns'.
The striking thing about this argument is not so much its absurdity as the
assumptions which underly it. Along with many of Britain's captains of
industry and not a few Tory ministers, Mr Richardson evidently believes that
wealth is created exclusively by producing physical goods that you can bark
your shin on. The rest of us, whether journalists, New Agers or piano
teachers, feed on the wealth thus created.
As a journalist myself, I am tempted to stand this nonsense on its head. The
newspaper industry involves quite a lot of physical production: the growing
and cutting of trees, the manufacture of newsprint, the printing and
production of the newspapers themselves. But all of it depends on the
ability of us journalists to inform and entertain. No readers, no papers. No
papers, no jobs.
Even upside down, the argument is still nonsense. It is partly based on what
might be called the Desert Island fallacy. In a state of nature, such as a
desert island, certain things such as food, warmth and shelter are essential
to survival, and thus take legitimate priority over other things. But the
modern developed world is not a desert island. Everything connects, and
everything depends on everything else.
In such a world, primary goods may or may not be of primary importance. If
Britain's farms were to vanish in a puff of smoke, life would go on: food
would simply be imported through existing distribution systems. If, on the
other hand, the nation's computer software and telecommunications were to
vanish, the result would be instant chaos and mayhem.
Behind this lies a deeper confusion: the notion that services - anything
from rock concerts to dentistry - are somehow luxuries to be paid for,
rather than a source of wealth in themselves. But in crude terms, the wealth
of a society - however that latter term is defined - consists of the sum of
its outputs. The more productive the members of that society are, the more
outputs there are to go round: and the more highly my output is valued by
others, the more of their outputs I can get in exchange.
As to the importance of tangible outputs in a society, one simple indication
is how people choose to spend their wages: that is, what kind of outputs
they seek out in exchange for their own. If we take household consumption in
the UK, as measured for the purposes of compiling the retail price index, we
find that about a third of expenditure goes on non-physical things such as
holidays, insurance or telephone charges.
That is only part of the story. About 35 per cent of people's gross income
in the UK is paid in taxes. Most of the things bought with that money are
non-physical: education, health, social security - which is chiefly another
form of insurance - and even defence. On the perhaps slightly dicey
assumption that the pattern of government expenditure ultimately reflects
society's wishes, that means that the average UK inhabitant chooses to spend
around half of his or her resources on intangible rather than tangible
goods.
The trouble about the New Agers, of course, is that they produce nothing
which the rest of us would willingly swap for the results of our own
labours. Thus, while they dip into the pool of available resources, they do
nothing to top it up again.
But Mr Richardson should not be disheartened. The dispelling of the
manufacturing fallacy, after all, cuts both ways. If the New Agers could
find a way of transmitting inner peace and harmony to the rest of us, they
would be doing quite as productive a job as any other worker by hand or
brain.

If the mafia didn't get you, the rats and cockroaches surely would. But no
longer. The hotel Rossiya, the world's largest and least attractive hotel,
occupying a prime site next to the Kremlin, is closing.
The overwhelming presence of scuttling vermin has prompted Moscow's
sanitation department to shut down the Rossiya, pending fumigation. A 1960s
architectural monstrosity, the hotel stands on a site which had been densely
populated with churches. Its present plight is thus something of a revenge
by Moscow's underlife.
In the past few years a home-from-home for provincial Soviet and then
Russian parliamentarians, the Rossiya has suffered the familiar miseries of
rising prices and falling incomes. Its many restaurants are rarely ablaze
with carefree deputies carousing on government expense accounts.
The final blow came with the abolition of the Congress of People's Deputies,
the full Russian parliament which met several times a year and which brought
more than 1,000 legislators to town and to the Rossiya.
Can the hotel be saved? It has neither the splendour of the
pre-revolutionary Muscovite palaces, now home to some new western-built
hotels, nor even the Stalin wedding-cake kitsch coming into vogue. The
Rossiya must await a revival of interest in glass-and-concrete boxes.
By then, the rats and the cockroaches may be firmly ensconced.

Britain's greatest living film-maker, Peter Greenaway, will tonight be
musing on how ultimately life imitates art.
His 1987 movie The Belly of an Architect was about an artist who visits Rome
to mount an exhibition, but who is hopelessly thwarted.
Greenaway's plan to stage a son et lumiere in one of Rome's loveliest
squares, the Piazza del Popolo, designed by Pope Sixtus V, has just been
scotched by contemporary Roman bureaucracy. His 'Cosmology of Piazza del
Popolo' was to have been the climax of a British Council programme of
British art and theatre.
The idea was to compress a 24-hour day into 10 minutes of pyrotechnics,
accompanied by music. But he has run foul of the local authorities; despite
having performed all the rituals required by the municipality, last-minute
objections have dimmed Greenaway's lights.
But maybe he's just fallen foul of Italy's new arts minister, the
neo-Fascist Domenico Fisichella: 'We accord the status of 'art' only to
aesthetic works several centuries old.'
So, that takes care of Pasolini, Modigliani, Fellini, Primo Levi . . .

After last week's Euro-election debacle, it might be thought the remnants of
the Tory MEPs would hunker down and pull together. Instead, they are now
squabbling about who is to be the chairman of their ever-dwindling group.
Will it be Edward McMillan-Scott, ex-PR man and former adviser to the
Falkland Islands? Or perhaps the bearded MEP for Surrey, who caught
Observer's eye by signing off his election literature with an endearing
'love, Tom Spencer'? And they are not the only ones bidding for the chair.
Given that the 18 Tory MEPs have already anointed dear old Lord Plumb as
their leader, why on earth do they need a chairman as well?
Are we talking power politics here or jobs for the boys?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So much for the breath of fresh air supposedly sweeping through the
corridors of the BBC as it adjusts to the competitive world marketplace.
When John Tusa, a former senior executive and current BBC TV presenter,
delivered the annual James Cameron memorial lecture at the City University
last week, it was widely reported in the outside world.
Tusa had some unflattering things to say about the regime of John Birt, who
beat Tusa to the BBC director-general's job. However, Ariel, the BBC's staff
magazine, chose to ignore the speech.
Was it only last year that Birt denounced the old-style BBC as a
Soviet-style command economy with arcane structures? Perhaps he should start
by introducing some producer choice into Ariel, the BBC's answer to Pravda.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Observer: Pound of flesh for IOC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Olympic Committee, in Paris tonight for its centennial
birthday party, will be attending closely to Dick Pound, IOC marketing boss
and odds-on favourite to succeed Juan Samaranch as IOC president.
Pound, a Canadian lawyer, has warned US attorneys to stay out of the 1996
Atlanta Games. 'Some means must be found to keep the Olympics in Atlanta
free of litigation,' says Pound.
His anxiety stems from a recent kerfuffle between the International Amateur
Athletics Federation and its multi-million dollar sponsor, Coca-Cola. They
were involved in a Dollars 27m damages claim - just overruled - against the
IAAF by Butch Reynolds, an athlete banned after dope tests.
If sponsors like Coca-Cola dispense huge wads to sporting associations,
perhaps only to see them disappear into the wallets of lawyers, they might
think twice in future. Such boat-rocking is bad news for the IOC, hoping for
at least Dollars 2bn in sponsorship at Atlanta.
There might even be fewer celebratory dinners.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Elbows out at the starting blocks: The race for the French
presidency is heating up now the European elections are over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French presidential election campaign is suddenly under way, even though
the final round of voting is 11 months away. Yesterday saw Mr Jacques
Chirac, leader of the Gaullist RPR party, publish his campaign manifesto,
masquerading as a book under the title of Une Nouvelle France. The French
media found this so exciting that yesterday they were out in force to film
people buying the book.
The race for the Elysee palace always transfixes France's attention. It is
the ultimate prize of French politics. It can confer on the winner more
relative power - when he also has a parliamentary majority - than a US
president can wield, and for a term of seven years that is nearly twice the
four-year term allowed under the US constitution.
It was always evident that the election for members of the European
Parliament on July 12 would mark the effective beginning of the presidential
campaign. But until the Socialist party dumped Mr Michel Rocard a week
later, it was not clear how dramatic the start would be.
On the face of it, the implosion of the Socialist party after its dismal
showing in the Euro-election seems to confirm the swing to the right that
gave French conservatives 80 per cent of the seats in the 1993 parliamentary
elections, and to reinforce the likelihood that the right will take the
Elysee next year. But into the Socialist vacuum may eventually be drawn Mr
Jacques Delors, the outgoing European Commission president, to carry the
party's presidential colours against a possibly divided centre-right.
The Socialists' present abject weakness is encouraging among conservatives a
similar sort of rivalry to that which helped elect Socialist President
Mitterrand in 1981 and 1988. The Euro-election, in which mainstream parties
of left and right gained only 40 per cent of the vote, has helped splinter
an already fragile party structure.
In replacing Mr Rocard as its first secretary with Mr Henri Emmmanuelli, the
Socialists have chosen a capable caretaker. With his stated dislike of the
party's recent elitism, Mr Emmanuelli will try to recapture some of the
working-class support that has poured away to Mr Bernard Tapie. The latter
quipped that he and Mr Emmanuelli had in common the fact that they have both
been under judicial investigation; Mr Emmanuelli's case concerned
allegations of impropriety in party finances when he was party treasurer; Mr
Tapie's current problems revolve around his business affairs. But Mr
Emmanuelli has openly criticised Mr Tapie's call for youth unemployment to
be made illegal as pure demagoguery - a stance that will make a Socialist
rapprochement with the Marseille politician no easier.
The task of resurrecting the Socialist party will be hard. To distinguish
itself from the Communist practice of suppressing dissent, the party
invented a system of proportional representation which means that each of
its various ideological 'courants' are always present in its executive. Over
time, these courants have become warring clans grouped around individual
chieftains. Last Sunday Mr Rocard proposed abolishing the system, and was
voted down and out; so the system goes on.
Nor does France's governing Gaullism, particularly in the generally cautious
hands of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, give the Socialists much to kick
against. True, they have been able to exploit Mr Balladur's slip-ups when he
tried to permit some public financing of private schools and when he tried
to reduce the minimum wage for young apprentices. . But the prime minister
is, for instance, pursuing privatisation too gently for the Socialists to
object plausibly.
If Mr Delors could be persuaded to run, he might conceivably prove equal to
the Herculean task of keeping a Socialist in the Elysee. According to a CSA
institute opinion poll this week, 47 per cent of those questioned said they
would have confidence in Mr Delors as president, one point behind Mr
Balladur at 48 per cent but well ahead of Mr Chirac at 37 per cent. This is
highly encouraging for the Socialists, whose real fear about Mr Rocard was
that he might not have made it into the final two-candidate run-off for the
presidency.
Mr Delors knows his poll standing is a bit illusory, including a 'prime
d'eloignement' (a distance premium) that would disappear if he were actually
to re-enter French politics and have all of the country's complaints about
Europe heaped on him. His candidacy would confront the right with its own
divisions over Europe. But it is questionable whether the cerebral Mr Delors
could, or would want to, boil 10 years knowledge about European integration
down into the simplistic terms of 'what's in it for France?' that a national
electorate would demand.
However, the greater the chance of Mr Delors staging a 'second coming' to
French politics, the shorter the odds on Mr Balladur prevailing over Mr
Chirac to be the right's presidential candidate next May. For the prime
minister has long portrayed himself as the only leading member of his own
Gaullist RPR party who can also carry the centre-right UDF federation with
him to beat off any serious left-wing threat. This threat was once posed by
Mr Mitterrand, might be by Mr Delors, but patently cannot be by Mr Rocard.
Immediately after Mr Chirac and Mr Raymond Barre, the former prime minister,
split the conservative vote in 1988, Mr Balladur started campaigning for a
single RPR-UDF candidate in 1995. Others took up the idea. By 1991 Mr Chirac
and Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, president of the UDF, agreed on a formal
'charter' under which a single candidate would emerge from a series of
regional primaries held a week apart and modelled on the American system.
This charter is championed nowadays only by Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior
minister. It has remained a dead letter perhaps because it is not the French
way - and not incidentally in Mr Balladur's Byzantine style - to resolve
internal conflict in public. However, Mr Balladur has since pursued the same
goal by other means. After the 1993 elections in which the RPR won more
seats than the UDF, he named no fewer than 16 UDF ministers and only 13 RPR
ministers to his government.
The UDF, or key parts of it, has since rewarded him by discreetly giving him
their backing for the Elysee. A key part is the Republican party (RP), which
accounts for 40 per cent of the UDF's 213 parliamentary seats and is much
the largest of the UDF's components.
It was perhaps inevitable ideologically that the Republicans would be most
susceptible to the wooing of a Gaullist of Mr Balladur's stamp. They
represent liberal free-market thinking - always relative in French terms -
that is on the right of a federation whose leader, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, has
drifted more towards the centre, where the Christian Democrats better
reflect his pro-Europeanism.
Indeed, within the Republicans there is now an ABG (Anyone But Giscard)
element which regards the former president as a patrician has-been.
Twenty-seven of them threatened last week to break away from the UDF
parliamentary group in order to prevent being coralled into endorsing a UDF
presidential candidacy for fear, possibly founded, that Mr Giscard d'Estaing
might have another go at the Elysee. They were temporarily dissuaded by the
convening of a RP convention this coming weekend to discuss the issue of a
single candidacy. The RP's honorary president, Mr Francois Leotard, the
defence minister, has indicated that he might run for the presidency, if Mr
Giscard d'Estaing does.
By the opposite logic, Mr Chirac gives every sign of wanting the UDF to
field a candidate because it could not then back Mr Balladur. His RPR
loyalists now openly question the need for a single RPR-UDF candidate. These
loyalists are led by Mr Alain Juppe, who is the RPR secretary-general as
well as foreign minister.
Mr Juppe took time off from pressing business on Rwanda to publish in
yesterday's Le Monde newspaper a review of Mr Chirac's book, praising the
RPR leader's 'energy and contagious enthusiasm'. These are indeed the
qualities, coupled with a certain generous lack of calculation, that endear
Mr Chirac to the Gaullist machine.
He certainly miscalculated with Mr Balladur whom he has regarded more as a
sort of sage chamberlain than a top-flight political rival, it was Mr Chirac
who wooed Mr Balladur back into politics in the late 1970s, made him finance
minister in 1986 and backed him for prime minister last year. It is ironic
that Mr Chirac, one of the most experienced of French politicians in terms
of offices held, should take so long to learn that in politics favours are
rarely returned.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Britain's labour laws
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour law could be on the point of re-emerging as a central issue in
British political debate. The immediate images of a rail strike, flickers of
militancy in pay bargaining, and the sight of Labour leadership candidates
jousting over how much of Conservative trade union legislation to abolish,
suggest that such a re-emergence may not be on terms that British business
would welcome. Most business leaders, after all, like most Conservative
politicians, are happy enough with the current regulatory mix. Strikes
remain rare, unemployment is falling, why tamper with the system?
This is unlikely to be a sustainable approach. A Labour party led by Tony
Blair is almost certainly electable, and if elected it will owe a big debt
to the trade unions. In any case, labour market changes have raised new
questions about the appropriate balance between employee rights and employer
flexibility. Moreover, Britain's system of labour law is becoming
over-complex. It combines traditional contract law, in which collective
trade union rights are expressed as immunities, with both domestic and
European positive rights legislation. Rationalisation of this hybrid is
required.
The subject is best sub-divided into the issue of individual employment
rights and the overlapping issue of the framework within which unions should
operate. Contrary to much rhetoric, union decline has not left employees
unprotected before the whims of bad employers. The last two decades have
seen a mushrooming of workplace rights, from protection against unfair
dismissal to all the fields now covered by Brussels directives. It is true,
however, that thanks to the complexity of the law and the slow operation of
the industrial tribunal system, many employees feel less protected than they
should, while many businesses complain of an excessive regulatory burden.
Employee rights
One answer, which could appeal to either a Conservative or Labour
administration, is to make greater use of the formal contract of employment.
Written into that contract could be a Citizen's Charter for the workplace,
outlining employee rights. Such a clarification of rights (and obligations)
could reduce uncertainty for both employers and employees, especially in
smaller companies. It might be supplemented by a code of practice, drawn up
the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress, on
those matters not covered by the law.
Union role
Where do unions fit into this? Many union officials say, with justice, that
individual rights are most meaningful when unions enforce them. That might
make a case for a right to union representation. But a full-blooded right to
bargain collectively is more problematic. A law to this effect did not work
effectively in the late 1970's - remember Grunwick? - and many companies
which have effective communication and participation without unions might
find themselves hussled into unsuitable arrangements. Similarly, although
contract law means that the right to strike has to be expressed,
anachronistically, in terms of immunity from damages, a positive right to
strike might - in a British context - shift the balance too far in favour of
strikers. Most continental European countries do have a positive right to
strike, or not to be dismissed while on strike, but these derive from far
more legalistic systems where unions often have to jump through many more
legal hoops than in Britain.
A Blair-led government would probably only tinker with Conservative union
legislation. It might also steal a march on the Conservatives by making
available to all employees the rights to consultation, in fields such as
health and safety, which still remain linked to union recognition. But
Labour is currently also commited to a right to bargain collectively and a
right to strike. Even more worrying from the point of view of job creation
and effective management is the party's pledge to abolish the probationary
employment period by insisting on full protection from unfair dismissal from
the first day of employment.
Mr Blair himself is no doubt aware of the dangers of hefty re-regulation of
the labour market for a party committed to rapid job creation. But whatever
the colour of the government, there will be a need for continued
modernisation of Britain's labour laws.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Designer stubble that got burnt: George Michael lost his
court battle - but have music companies won
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watching George Michael giving evidence in the High Court in London last
October, it was difficult not to like him. He was confident and personable,
and Mr Justice Jonathan Parker, the presiding judge, was clearly not immune
to his charms.
In his 273-page judgment yesterday on the singer's dispute with Sony, the
music company, the judge described George Michael as 'intelligent and
articulate' and 'refreshingly candid' and said that his evidence had been
given 'fairly and honestly'.
The judgment contained no other good news for the singer. Mr Justice Parker
dismissed Michael's claim that his contract with Sony should be declared an
unreasonable restraint of trade and therefore unenforceable.
The judge said that Sony had behaved fairly towards the singer. He rejected
Michael's claim that the company had tried to 'kill' his last album as a
punishment for his refusal to appear in a promotional video.
The judgment comes as a relief to the music industry which feared that, had
George Michael succeeded, dozens of other artists would have demanded
changes to their recording contracts.
The relief has been tempered, however, by the news that Michael is
considering an appeal. Music companies recognise, too, that the George
Michael judgment was based on a specific set of circumstances, which might
not apply to other artists and contracts.
In addition, sympathy for Sony among music companies has been limited
throughout the case. Senior executives at rival companies believe Sony
should never have allowed its relationship with one of its leading artists
to deteriorate to the point where he decided to go to court.
In his judgment, Mr Justice Parker said that one of the problems appeared to
be the singer's over-sensitivity. He referred to a concert Michael gave in
Toronto in 1991, which the singer described as one of the low points in his
relationship with Sony.
Two senior Sony executives arrived at the concert by private jet. When the
singer looked for them after the concert, he was told they had left halfway
through. Michael told the court during his evidence: 'I was very offended by
this . . . I felt it was actually a fairly deliberate move.'
Mr Justice Parker said he was satisfied the two executives had stayed until
the encores. He added: 'Mr Michael has demonstrated a degree of touchiness
which I find surprising and which needs, in my judgment, to be borne in mind
as the story continues and as Mr Michael's relationship with Sony
progressively deteriorates.'
Some rival music executives take a different view. If you cannot deal with
touchy, sensitive individuals, they say, you should not be in the music
business. Most artists go through periods of insecurity. Many feel they are
not fully appreciated by their companies, the press or the public.
The job of a music company manager is to make sure that these feelings do
not grow to the point where the artist can no longer perform. If music
companies cannot get on with their successful artists any longer, some
executives believe they should consider ending their relationship. To reach
this point is widely seen as a failure. To go further and engage in a
widely-publicised acrimonious legal battle is regarded by many as worse.
One executive said yesterday: 'I never see law suits as being happy. This
should never have come to court. These things should be settled on the basis
of mutual respect.'
Other music companies feel, too, that Sony's victory does not mean the
contracts with their artists will now escape scrutiny. Had George Michael
won the case, other artists would probably have attempted to alter their
contracts. His loss might dissuade some from doing so, but music executives
said yesterday there would still be legal challenges in the future.
Mr Rupert Perry, UK chief executive of EMI Music and chairman of the British
Phonographic Industry trade association, said that while the George Michael
dispute had attracted more publicity than previous cases, there had been
instances of artists challenging their record companies and winning.
In 1989, the Court of Appeal found that the contract between Holly Johnson,
lead singer of the group Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and the recording
company Zang Tumb Tuum was unenforceable. The court said that the contract,
lasting up to nine years, was 'grossly one-sided'.
Mr Perry said the law appeared to be evolving. It was too soon to draw any
definite conclusions from the George Michael case.
Mr Justice Parker made it clear that his decision was based on Michael's
relatively powerful negotiating position with Sony, resulting from the high
level of sales he had achieved and previous successful attempts to
renegotiate his contract.
The singer's attempts to alter his contract date back to 1983, when George
Michael was part of the duo Wham] He claimed then that his contract, with a
company called Inner Vision, was an unreasonable restraint of trade and took
legal action. This was settled and resulted in a new agreement with CBS, the
US entertainment company.
Following the break-up of Wham] in 1986, Michael produced his first solo
album, Faith, which was a huge commercial success. Michael then asked to
renegotiate his contract, so that he would be treated on a par with other
superstars. This resulted in a new agreement, requiring Michael to record
additional albums, but improving his financial terms.
In 1988, CBS was taken over by Sony. The singer spent that year touring
outside the UK, which had favourable tax implications for him. He asked Sony
to bring forward payment of money due to him, so that he would receive it
during his time outside the UK. The company agreed and paid him advances and
royalties of over Pounds 11m.
In 1990, he successfully renegotiated his contract once more, further
improving his terms. However in February 1992, the singer's lawyers told him
he could argue that his agreement with Sony was an unreasonable restraint of
trade. Six days later, his accountants wrote to Sony requesting an advance
of Dollars 1m due for his next album. Sony paid the advance.
The judge said that in August 1992, George Michael repaid the advance. In
October of that year he started legal action. Mr Justice Parker said that
when the contract moved from Inner Vision to CBS, this was the result of an
agreement to end a legal dispute. It would not be right for Michael to
attempt to claim the subsequent agreements were unenforceable. He had expert
legal advice at all times. Moreover, by accepting the Dollars 1m advance he
affirmed his agreement with Sony.
In a statement after the judgment was announced, Michael said that the
renegotiations of his contract were an attempt to improve an agreement first
made when he was 18. He added: 'I was trying to make the best of a bad job.'
The problem with a recording contract, the singer said, is that when you
sign your first one you are stuck with it. 'There is no such thing as
resignation for an artist in the music industry. Effectively, you sign a
piece of paper at the beginning of your career and you are expected to live
with that decision, good or bad, for the rest of your professional life.'
Rival music executives believe that if the singer is not successful in any
appeal, he and his music company will have to find a way to live with one
another. One solution would be to shorten the length of the contract.
Sony said yesterday that it looked forward to continuing its relationship
with Michael. The singer has said in the past that he would never record for
Sony again. One music manager said that would be the end of George Michael's
career. 'Kids' tastes change very rapidly. Nobody can afford not to record
for years, except Frank Sinatra, of course.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Prowse ('Clinton v Friedman on welfare', June 20) is wrong. The
proponents of a guaranteed 'basic income' in Britain do not advocate
negative income tax. The concept of basic income - now usually called
citizen's income - is based on a different approach.
Citizen's income is a universal benefit, not means-tested or work-tested as
negative come tax. It is based on the individual not the family unit.
Negative income tax brings with it all the limitations of the existing
welfare systems - administratively complex, a disincentive in that it
extends poverty and unemployment traps, and a bureaucratic nightmare.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Innovation index would help rate R&amp;D
success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr FIONA STEELE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your feature, 'Technology: R&amp;D Scoreboard' (June 17) is a welcome
recognition of the importance of technology in underpinning the
wealth-creation process. As you also recognise, R&amp;D is only one of the
contributors to a company's competitiveness. Without attention to the whole
range of innovation indicators - including capital investment, market
research and training - R&amp;D on its own can be misleading. Indeed, the latest
Confederation of British Industry/Natwest Innovation Trends Survey, weighted
to reflect the performance of all sectors, indicates a reduction in the
amount of expenditure, not an increase, as the R&amp;D scoreboard suggests.
Differing time-frames can possibly explain this apparent contradiction, and
certainly trends survey predictions for the next 12 months are more bullish.
But in the accompanying interview with Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, it is acknowledged that it is the quality of the output from
innovation investment in terms of profitable products that counts; and this
points to the need for an innovation index to assess outcomes.
The CBI/Natwest survey has influenced much of the thinking behind the
development of such an index, not least by providing the database of
companies for the joint CBI/Department of Trade and Industry activity on
best practice. The survey will help place individual company performance in
the context of its related sector. The indicators need to be developed in
parallel and we are in close touch with the DTI on the way forward.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Effectiveness of single market rests
with member states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RANIERO VANNI D'ARCHIRAFI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If you had found time to read the two earlier reports concerning the
internal market council, ('Foot-dragging slows path to single market', June
16 and 'Brussels shelves pension deregulation' June 17), you might have
chosen to revise your editorial, 'Slipping Market' (June 17).
In one of them, I was described as being 'on the warpath'. Indeed, I left
the council of ministers on June 16 in no doubt of my continuing commitment
to bring about a fully effective internal market.
Since 1992 the Commission has systematically taken member states which do
not fulfil legal obligations on time to the European Court of Justice. Last
week I told the council of ministers the Commission would in appropriate
cases use its power under Article 171 of the treaty, which provides for
recommendations of fines to the court once an infringement has been proven.
The Commission has made public for the first time which member states have
fallen behind in which areas, in order to increase pressure on national
governments to make transposition their number one priority. At the next
council meeting in October we will look at the quality of national
transposition measures in detail. This vigorous approach was endorsed by
ministers.
As for mutual recognition of national rules, to describe the Commission
proposal for a notification procedure as 'a plan for national civil servants
to report on other governments that do not stick to the rules' is either a
misunderstanding or a misrepresentation. This proposal completes existing
measures by providing a practical means whereby national authorities would
inform each other and the Commission whenever they decided to refuse access
to their markets to particular products for reasons related to the
protection of health, safety, the environment or the consumer.
Some member states (a minority) dislike our proposal and will label it
bureaucratic, but the lively debate in the council last week demonstrated
that it goes to the heart of the issue. I note from your article that the UK
minister responsible for deregulation fully supports it and has referred to
it as a 'crowbar to prize open markets'.
Your editorial makes the mistake of shooting the messenger. It is the member
states which must decide at the end of the day how effective they want the
single market to be. Meanwhile I will continue to do everything in my power
to ensure that the member states live up to their obligations.

Single Market Commissioner,

comes rather late in the day

<TEXT>
Sir, How commendable it is that, once again, Mr Joel Joffe should bring the
misdeeds of those rascals in the life insurance industry to the public's
notice. He is to be thanked for this, the latest effort in his crusade
against these despicable people (Letters, June 18/19).
Of course, a cynic might well inquire as to the rationale behind his sudden
missionary zeal and further inquire as to why a man with such strongly held
views on such pressing matters did not chose to air them during his time
with a company - the name of which temporarily escapes me but, surely, not
one of those 'driven by an unprincipled disregard for the best interests of
the public' - and why he should now choose to bite the very hand that fed
him so well. But, of course, I am not that cynical.
In the meantime, as per Mr Joffe's calling, I for one willingly express my
deep regret for being a part of such a unregulated miasma and, yes, I
certainly am grateful to Mr Joffe's new-found friends, those financial
journalists of the school of incisive reporting, for their labours in this
field. However, it is Mr Joffe who really deserves our thanks and I shall
certainly sleep easy in my bed in the sure and certain knowledge that Mr
Joffe is still out there doing his bit for those of us still trying to earn
an honest shilling from the industry he now finds so distasteful.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Apres moi, le vide: The race to replace Jacques Delors is
based on false expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smart Alecs on the European circuit have lately taken to poor-mouthing
Jacques Delors as if he had over-stayed his welcome and over-stretched his
powers. But if you want an objective measure of what Delors has achieved in
his 10 years as president of the European Commission, you only have to look
at the international calibre of the politicians who want to succeed him. A
decade may or may not be too long. But the fact is that Mr Delors has raised
the status of his job to a level where only those with top qualifications
need apply.
Walter Hallstein, the first president of the Commission, was also by far the
most impressive, until Delors came along; and yet Hallstein, came from a
modest background as a junior minister in the German government. Roy Jenkins
was another distinguished president, and he had had a much more prominent
national political career; but Jenkins never quite made it to the top in
British politics.
Today, in contrast, the battle to succeed Delors is being fought out between
prime ministerial candidates: Jean-Luc Dehaene of Belgium, and Ruud Lubbers,
until recently the long-serving premier of the Netherlands. Not long ago,
there was a third prime minister reported in the running, Felipe Gonzales of
Spain. And when Chancellor Helmut Kohl seemed to be facing certain defeat in
the German federal elections, nobody laughed when it was suggested that even
he might be a contender for the Brussels job.
So fierce has the battle become, that if it isn't finessed through a
compromise on one of the lesser candidates, such as Peter Sutherland or even
Sir Leon Brittan, it could even deadlock this week's European summit on
Corfu.
But the paradox of the battle over Delors' successor, is that it seems to be
largely based on misplaced expectations. For the one thing we know almost
for sure, is that the next president, whoever he is, will be a much less
important figure than Delors; not for reasons of personal incapacity, but
because the circumstances which favoured Delors have changed or are
changing. Indeed, it is possible that no president will ever again play as
big a role in the construction of Europe as Delors has played in the past 10
years.
First, the volume of European legislation is likely to shrink, and with it
the role of the Commission as its motor. The single market white paper and
the Single European Act stimulated an unprecedented proliferation of
legislative proposals in the run-up to the introduction of the unified
market in 1993; but that process is now complete, so the pace of legislation
will subside.
Second, the anti-European backlash in many member states, and the new stress
on subsidiarity enshrined in the Maastricht treaty, should ensure that the
Commission will think twice before trying to push forward the frontiers of
European integration with gratuitous new initiatives.
Third, and the most important factor, is that Europe's agenda is now
changing from the technical to the political; as a result the centre of
gravity will move from the Commission to the member states.
In the 1980s, Delors was brilliantly successful in inventing, and then in
riding the bureaucratic processes which led, with apparently inexorable
logic, from the white paper to the Single European Act, then to the
so-called Delors committee on Economic and Monetary Union, and finally to
the Maastricht treaty. But the reason why he was able to dominate this
process, was that it could be represented as little more than the
implementation of long-established EU goals: the single market was the
logical extrapolation of the Rome treaty's customs union, while monetary
union had been a declaratory objective of the member states since the early
1970s. All Delors was doing, was putting the power of the Brussels machine
behind political objectives of uncontested legitimacy.
His successor will not be able to match this bureaucratic tour de force,
because the next phase in the development of the European Union, the
enlargement to the east, lies in uncharted territory. No one knows exactly
how east Europe can be accommodated within the Union; but everybody knows
the enlargement process will require far-reaching revisions of Europe's
treaty arrangements. These revisions will undoubtedly be bitterly contested
by different governments. It is already clear, for example, that the 1996
Inter-Governmental Conference will be a fierce battle between supporters and
opponents of a more explicitly federalist Europe.
In this battle, the Commission has no leadership role. It has a mandate to
uphold existing treaty obligations; and perhaps it can fudge a mandate to
extend existing treaty obligations; but since it has no independent
legitimacy, it has no mandate to invent new political objectives. Those can
only be determined by the member states.
So when you hear that Britain opposes the appointment of Dehaene, on the
grounds that he is a federalist, you know that the British government is
once again talking through its collective hat. Not merely will the future
shape of Europe not be determined by the preferences of the next president
of the commission, he will not even be asked to draft the agenda.
What will count, in 1996, will be the line-up of France and Germany. In next
spring's presidential election, French conservatives may be tempted to play
the nationalist card, though in practice they would almost certainly revert
to the traditional pro-European alliance with Germany. But it would be a
delicious irony if the next phase in the development of Europe were led by
President Delors - of France.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Arts: Opera Ballet in superlative form - Clement Crisp
reviews 'Twentieth Century Classics' in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We had a leaflet raid in the Palais Garnier on Friday night. From the little
gallery that runs round the inner dome of the ceiling papers fluttered down
just before curtain rise. A protest, of course, and one part of a campaign
by the Opera's unions to protect jobs at a time when Garnier's palace closes
for refurbishment (the ballet goes to the Opera Bastille next season) and a
new administration is foreshadowed.
The rights and wrongs of the matter are not for me to rehearse here, but one
phrase in the leaflet made me feel immediately sympathetic to the cause:
'substantial savings can be made by forward planning on productions, and by
not yielding to so many of the caprices of producers and designers.' These
words, decorated with audience bravos, should be inscribed in every opera
house. Why yet another re-designed and politically galvanised Ring cycle, or
another tarted-up ballet classic, or someone-else having his go at Swan Lake
or Figaro? Opera houses plead poverty and screech for funds. Let them
concentrate their cash on new work, new artists, and spare us the desperate
cosmetic exercises that cloud and minimise the established repertory with
radical decoration and wrong-headed recensions.
The Opera Ballet is ending this season with two triple bills under the title
Twentieth Century Classics. And if for 'classics' you read 'enduring
repertory items', then the title is a good one. What the programmes
demonstrate yet again is the superlative quality of the Opera Ballet as a
performing ensemble, stunningly well-trained, bursting with talent.
The first bill concentrates, not without wit, on the company as an assembly
of virtuosos. Harald Lander's Etudes has been a celebrated show-piece for
dancers since he made it in Copenhagen in 1948. It hymns the disciplines and
rewards of academic training, and with the Opera's dancers it is a thrilling
display of French style in its present and most exultant form. You watch the
girls working at the barre, and notice the clarity and sensitivity of their
feet, the taut outlines of each step. You see the boys beating and turning
with unfailing ease. And, as the heart of the affair, on come Agnes Letestu
and Jose Martinez (both making debuts, though their authority was absolute)
and Nicholas le Riche, tossing off prodigies of movement. They are three
young angels. They look proud, happy, commandingly good. Radiant security in
effects; unforced charm; elegance of means: these qualities mark the work of
the principals and also the dancing of the least member of the cast. And,
because Opera schooling is strong, unified, coherent, the whole affair has
the gloss given by finest craftsmanship. It is exactly this assurance that
Derek Deane, in his recent comments upon failings in dance training here,
wants our dancers to find.
The closing In the middle, somewhat elevated looks like an abrasive response
to Etudes. William Forsythe's choreography is a kick in the slats of
academic dance. The brutish Thom Willems score is matched by ferocious
energy in the choreography, disjointed, deconstructed, disassembled, and
perversely lit so that you think you can see, but actually can't - which is
Forsythe's neatest trick.
On any other company it looks as if the Forsythian bull has done his worst
in the daintiest of balletic china-shops. The Opera cast is so strong, and
so stylish, that the mayhem has an odd fascination: there are the wonderful
Manuel Legris and Lionel Delanoe, Nathalie Rique and Nathalie Aubin,
polishing every jagged shard of movement as if it were of worth. They are
superb. The piece is a con-trick.
Separating these two displays of bravura - Hyperion to a satyr - was Jerome
Robbins' In the Night. Henri Barda playing Chopin nocturnes with grace;
three couples; emotion ranging from serene to stormy; the Opera's stars at
their most effulgent in feeling and technique. And, because it is the
women's ballet, Monique Loudieres, Carole Arbo, Isabelle Guerin floating on
the music, or transfixed by it, with exquisite sensitivity. Kitsch at
moments, but marvellous all the time.
The second programme was rather more solemn in mood. I do not think that
Tudor's Jardin aux Lilas has a chance at the Opera. The location is too vast
for a ballet first given on a stage 18 ft. square; the lighting on Friday,
when I saw the performance, was sepulchral; the garden looked as if the
Douanier Rousseau had a hand in planting it; interpretations had no chance
to show those subtleties - of glance, of under-the-skin tension - which are
the fabric of Tudor's dances. Monique Loudieres and Manuel Legris are ideal
for the roles of Caroline and her lover: their readings were swamped.
About Paul Taylor's Speaking in Tongues which followed, I comment with
reluctance. This study in ecstatic religion in the American Middle-West,
with its fundamentalist hysteria, is the only Taylor work that I do not
enjoy. I find it over-long, inexact. Its Opera performance - led by Kader
Belarbi, as a darkly powerful preacher - was fine. And I still do not
understand it.
In the closing Song of the Earth, the dancers gave performances of beautiful
and proper simplicity. MacMillan's contemplation of death and renewal needs
no applied solemnities, and a strong musical account (the Lamoureux
orchestra with Catherine Keen and Ian Caley, under Jonathan Darlington)
inspired no less uncompromising dancing. In Isabelle Guerin, the role of the
Woman finds a most eloquent interpreter - dignified, selfless. She tells
everything of the woman's grief, her isolation, and she pours out
MacMillan's dances in a grand stream of movement - the sequence of pas de
bourrees at the end of the last song exquisite in shape and feeling. Laurent
Hilaire was the Man, Wilfried Romoli the Messenger: both readings were, like
Guerin's, admirable, truthful.
The Tudor/Taylor/MacMillan triple bill can be see at the Opera Garnier on
June 23, 24, 25, 27, 28.

First indications that something odd was happening reached me at 2.45 on
Saturday morning. Listening to Radio 5 Live as I cleaned my teeth I heard
Richard Dallyn (sensibly grabbed from LBC by the BBC's new continuous news
network) patching into a live transmission between a helicopter in Orange
County, California, and Ted Turner's 24-hour television news channel, CNN.
Someone called OJ Simpson was being chased up Interstate 405 by umpteen
'black and whites' (Los Angeles police cars) with TV choppers following
overhead. By noon of the same day I was talking live on air, via the
telephone, to Brian Hayes in his Radio 2 programme Hayes On Saturday. We
were discussing the way in which matters develop instantaneously into media
events these days.
Before Saturday I had never heard of OJ Simpson. By lunchtime of that day,
having been tanked up with media coverage like a racing car at a pit stop, I
was able to suggest knowledgeably to Radio 2 listeners that in order to
understand American interest in the incident we needed to imagine 18
Metropolitan Police cars on the M1 chasing a Range Rover in which passenger
Gary Lineker was holding a gun to his own head while talking on a cellular
phone to a detective in Scotland Yard, explaining his suicidal instincts
after being accused of the murder of his wife and her toy boy. All this I
had gathered from virtually non-stop coverage of the incident on Sky News
which relayed America's ABC News to British viewers, and from terrestrial
television news which also provided extensive inserts of American footage.
However, it is the subsequent reactions in the other mass media that are so
interesting. More often than with any other medium, the television messenger
is routinely blamed for the messages it delivers, and here was a classic
instance. News stories of this sort - visually dramatic, long lasting, and
occurring in peak viewing hours - are meat and drink to 24-hour news
channels, though they occur very rarely. Apart from wars, CNN has won its
top ratings with coverage of the frantic attempts by emergency services over
some days to rescue a child trapped down a well. Television did not put her
there, nor force the public to watch: it simply provided the newsreels, but
CNN was likened to a vulture.
So too with the OJ Simpson story. In Monday's Daily Mail we were told that
'Big Brother television' had been watching, and that 'the dividing line
between true life and movie fantasy has become dangerously blurred'. As with
much commentary elsewhere this seems to have been prompted by the fact that
many American viewers left their screens to drive out on to the freeway and
cheer their hero (Simpson having moved on from fame in American football to
greater fame in Hollywood films). But the viewers chose of their own free
will to do that; television was merely the technology which conveyed the
pictures - a technology which, incidentally, in these sorts of circumstances
leaves newspapers and even radio looking pretty flat footed.
What is so striking is the widespread desire to blame television for matters
over which it has little if any control. You might imagine, from the
vilification being aimed this week at television sports departments, that
broadcasters had conspired to arrange a clash between World Cup football,
Wimbledon tennis and Test cricket. 'A hundred and fifty hours of sport in
one week] How can they possibly justify it?' ask the radio and newspaper
commentators. The answer, presumably, is that the television chiefs would be
the first to avoid such clashes if they could; they must be at their wits'
end finding enough outside-broadcast equipment, and seething at the way that
the different sports will damage one another's potential ratings.
Yet many people seem to feel a need for something other than ourselves on
which to blame the baser instincts of mankind. There have been supercilious
reactions to the inclusion in the final episode of ITV's excellent
documentary series about the British royal family, The Windsors, of extracts
from the 'Squidgy' and 'Camillagate' tapes. In the first someone who sounds
awfully like Princess Diana uses the 'F' word while talking to a man friend
about the royal family, and in the second someone who sounds awfully like
Prince Charles says how he needs several times a week the woman on the other
end of the line who sounds awfully like Camilla Parker Bowles. Television
did not commission or create those tapes and I for one was grateful to hear
them, rather than simply to see them transcribed in print. Royalists may not
like what they convey, but viewer/voter/subjects in this mature old
democracy are surely entitled to consider such vivid bits of evidence.
Television can rightly be blamed for its messages when the broadcasters are
responsible for commissioning them. Last week's Dimbleby Lecture was an
example. By inviting as lecturer the head of MI5, the BBC made itself a part
of an old British problem (a powerful instinct among politicians and civil
servants to conceal matters from those who elect and pay them) rather than
part of a possible answer (mass media with an instinct to disclose and a
policy of digging and challenging).
Stella Rimington was given 45 minutes of public service broadcasting time to
deliver a PR hand-out - the gist being 'We are honest, trustworthy, over
stretched, endlessly accountable and generally rather charming don't you
like this buttercup yellow outfit?' - and of course nobody was allowed to
challenge her. She admitted 'A cynic may say 'How can I know that what you
are saying is true?'' Actually you only need to be ordinarily sane to ask
that question, to which, of course, she had no answer.
But the most important time to blame television is when it fails to provide
the messages that it ought to. True, it was not the broadcasters' fault that
cameras, and thus the general public, were excluded from the Scott Inquiry
investigating the arms-for-Iraq imbroglio which so vividly illustrated both
the institutionalised secrecy of the British state and the contempt in which
some politicians and civil servants now hold the public. In the US,
television coverage would have been routine and public interest consequently
enormous. But if fringe theatre can come up with a way of tackling the job,
so should television. Nicholas Kent's production, Half The Picture,
currently at the Tricycle in Kilburn is a fascinating stage documentary on
the Scott Inquiry which could easily be transferred to the small screen. The
quicker somebody in television snaps up this message and delivers it to a
national audience, the better.

BBC1's drama series The Lifeboat has been attracting remarkably few viewers.
While Morecambe And Wise repeats from 25 years ago have been pulling in 10m
and more, this series dreamed up by Lynda la Plante has been failing even to
make it into BBC1's weekly Top 30, which means it is getting fewer than 5.8m
viewers. Could it be that people are finally tiring of drama run off the
production line like lumps of pre-moulded plastic? In today's episode Keith
Barron plays a rich man who needs rescuing when his yacht runs aground
(8.00). In Frontline journalist Simon Winchester who has lived in Hong Kong
for seven years argues that the British government has mishandled its
negotiations over the future of the crown colony because of its failure to
understand the Chinese (9.00 C4). This week's 'Screen Two' drama, Criminal,
tells the story of Simon Willerton, a teenager who hanged himself in prison
in 1990 (9.00 BBC2). The Late Show is devoted to Rem Koolhaas, a Dutch born
architect, trained at the Architectural Association in London, who is more
famous for his theoretical writing than for any buildings (11.15 BBC2).

FT  22 JUN 94 / Arts: A happy 'Coppelia' - Ballet in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What a wonderful, odd ballet is Coppelia. Odd because of its blatant
unreality - those peasants wearing a permanent rictus of joy; the whiff of
alchemy in its second act - and wonderful because its joy touches our
hearts. Delibes, of course, set it towards glory with an unflawed score.
Whatever choreographic hands have fashioned its text today - and I do not
think it is now possible to unravel who did what - they have taken the music
as their guide, and blessedly so. The story may owe something to Hoffmann;
it owes more to a kind of dramatic good sense that responds to the idea of a
girl winning her boy after a trial by magic.
Frantz must pass through Act 2 in Coppelius' workshop and learn the
difference between a dream love and his real fiancee; Swanilda must know
disappointment, and fight for her errant lover's return to a waking world.
It is basic folk-myth that is the armature for this enchanting comedy. We
may not notice it, but it gives a subliminal strength to the tale, and
because of it we care about Swanilda, and even about Frantz, who is a less
appealing figure (a roving eye; liable to pin butterflies to his jacket:
would you let your daughter marry this man?)
We care most immediately about the production which expounds this drama, and
London City Ballet - at the Wells this week with their happy version - do
not cheat us, or Coppelia. The text is neat but not gaudy, and so are the
performances and the staging. I found it well-meant and well-reasoned on
Monday evening. Peter Farmer's sets are discreet and pretty. The company
bounced through the general dances; the principals - Tracey Newham Alvey as
Swanilda, Roger van Fleteren as Frantz, Terry Hayworth as a jovial and
touching Coppelius - worked with a will.
I record with gratitude that in the audience was Pamela May, whose Swanilda
was one of the abiding joys of our national ballet - witty, musical,
deliciously pouting, shining in step, and serenely grand in the last act
duet. Her performances taught me a lot about Coppelia's greatness - not
least that is a ballet which rewards its audiences as handsomely as it does
the finest dancers. London City's identity and task is as a missionary
taking medium-scale ballet to a public who might otherwise never see a
serious classic production. It is valuable work, and this Coppelia shows how
well LCB does it.
At Sadler's Wells all week

FT  22 JUN 94 / Arts: Borodin plays Shostakovich - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Borodin String Quartet is with us again, this time to play all 15 of
Shostakovich's quartets at the Barbican. Music-lovers who have heard these
Russian artists will need no more than this reminder, but some further
description is in order for the others. So: this is a peerless ensemble,
whose every performance has the patina of long-considered experience and
musical wisdom. The playing is technically superb - but one scarcely notices
that, because expressive musicianship is so completely to the fore. Hearing
the Borodin can be a revelation of the miraculous range and depth of the
string-quartet medium.
Unfortunately they cannot be recommended to novice listeners, who might find
subsequent quartet-recitals grey and disappointing by comparison. The
Borodin exemplify the quartet ideal: four strongly individual voices (even
the second violin), perfectly matched, able to slip between solo status and
supporting roles at a moment's notice, always retaining the sense of a
contrapuntal dialogue. It is a mere bonus that their palette of tone-colours
happens to be unsurpassed, as likewise their long-sighted perspective on
every quartet they play.
Shostakovich's rich cycle of quartets has two quite peculiar strengths. One
is that they are all 'mature' works: the First, which we heard on Monday
with its two immediate successors (the Borodin programmes are chronological,
not mix-and-match), was composed after the Fifth Symphony - and 13 years
after his precociously brilliant Symphony no. 1. The other is that as the
composer grew ever more fearful of the 'ideological' scanning to which his
large-scale works were subjected by cultural apparatchiks, he came to
reserve his most candid, heartfelt scenarios for the quartet medium,
relatively un-public and safely under-noticed.
The Borodin owns the special authority of having studied every quartet with
Shostakovich himself. (Or at least its incomparable violist and cellist did:
they are original members from 1945, whereas the two violins joined them a
mere 20 years ago, the year before the composer died.) Not a page goes by
without some illuminating touch unthought-of by other ensembles, and the
calculated force of each whole work develops in a clean trajectory. If
novice listeners will risk going to hear these players and spoiling their
appetite for any less exalted team, they will at least have the satisfaction
of knowing how a great, irreplaceable quartet sounded.
Remaining concerts in the cycle: tonight, Friday, Monday and Wednesday next

FT  22 JUN 94 / People: Sir David White to chair Coal Authority
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir David White, chairman of Mansfield Brewery and Nottingham Health
Authority, has been appointed the first head of the Coal Authority which is
being set up by the government to supervise coal mining when the industry is
privatised later this year.
His appointment as chairman-designate of the authority, where he will work
one day a week, means he will step down as part-time non-executive director
of British Coal. He has been on the board at the corporation since last
October.
Sir David's work in the coal industry continues a long association with
energy. Early on in his career he served at sea working for Shell Texaco and
Gulf Oil.
The government announced yesterday that the authority would be based in
Mansfield in a building already part-occupied by British Coal Opencast. The
Coal Authority will take over British Coal's ownership of coal reserves,
license coal mining operations and deal with liabilities arising out of
former British Coal-owned pits. It will employ up to 100 people.
Sir David, 64, said appointing a chief executive would be among his first
tasks.
He said his appointment as chairman, which is expected to be effective from
July when coal privatisation receives royal assent, was a terrific
opportunity to help facilitate the development of private sector coal
mining.
Sir David, 64, was brought up in Nottingham, where he now lives. 'I am
steeped in Nottinghamshire and therefore the coal industry,' he said.

FT  22 JUN 94 / People: Bay Green moves up at Kleinworts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bay Green, 51, has been rewarded for returning to the Kleinwort Benson fold.
Three years after he resigned as Hill Samuel's head of corporate finance, he
has been appointed head of Kleinwort Benson's financing and advisory
division.
Green, a chartered accountant who first joined the merchant bank in 1971,
takes charge of one of the biggest parts of Kleinwort's business. It covers
everything from corporate lending and leasing to privatisation advice and
public issues. It has a staff of around 600.
His appointment follows last year's management reshuffle when the group's
investment bank business was put under the control of two joint chief
executives David Clementi and Sir Nicholas Redmayne. At the time the
corporate finance and financing divisions were merged; Clementi took over as
head of the new division and Bay Green was appointed his deputy. Having
overseen the merger of the two divisions, Clementi has decided to hand over
control to Green and concentrate on his job as joint chief executive of
investment banking.
Kleinwort portrayed Green's appointment as a natural promotion but it is
understood that there has been some jockeying for power behind the scenes.
Earlier this month, Ian Peacock, 46, the main board director who had headed
Kleinwort's financing division before the merger with Clementi's division,
left to join BZW as co-head of merchant banking in the US.
Meanwhile, Kleinwort Benson has merged its project advisory and medium term
export finance businesses into a new project and export finance department
chaired by Patrick de Pelet. Adrian Montague and Simon Parker have been
appointed co-head.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Technology: Assessing the damage - Andrew Jack meets a
company president with a green mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eckart Wintzen is a rare combination of the 1960s and the 1990s: his long
hair, beard and idealism are offset by his presidency of BSO Origin, a
successful high-tech Dutch-based computer services company.
Nowhere are the two sides of his character better matched than in the annual
report of his business, which adopts a highly innovative approach to
environmental reporting and shareholder communication.
Each year he hires a different company of designers to help produce the
annual report. Two years ago it was printed using a comic book format; last
year it included a teabag and a sticking plaster; this year, a series of
philosophical musings on interrelationships.
But one thing has remained constant in the annual report over the last four
years: details of an assessment in monetary terms of the environmental
impact of the company.
BSO has pioneered the use of quantifiable information attempting to show the
'extracted value', or the effect of the company's operations, on the
environment.
'We calculate the theoretical costs to repair the damage done,' says
Wintzen.
'It is impossible to achieve any serious structural improvement unless you
know the cost of the alternatives.'
He says his initial interest in environmental matters dates from reading the
influential Club of Rome report in the early 1970s which warned that, as he
puts it, 'you can't have unlimited growth on a limited planet'.
He worked with a series of scientists to develop a methodology that could
express a price for the ecological impact of his company. It makes a series
of assumptions in order to estimate the costs at a point at which the
marginal cost of clean-up is equal to its marginal benefits to society.
The results provoked some surprise. In the current year, the environmental
impact of BSO was Fl3.7m (Pounds 1.3m), offset by environmental spending of
Fl452,000. Of the total, Fl2.8m came from road traffic alone - the costs of
staff commuting to work.
'We found out where the damage was and it is nonsense to talk about using
plastic cups - the cost of accounting for them is more expensive than their
impact,' he says.
Using the data, BSO has instituted campaigns in its operations around the
world: from cutting back on the use of cars to using double-sided
photocopies, turning off the heating and air conditioning outside office
hours, and dispensing sugar in jars rather than disposable sachets.
There are questions about the techniques BSO uses. It includes in its
calculations the environmental costs incurred by clients on whose premises
many of its staff work; and it does not count the waste of old computers
because these are normally donated to schools rather than thrown away.
The company's effect is minimal compared with polluting industries. But, as
Wintzen says: 'We say 'look at the damage even a service company does'. We
are not going to change things on our own but we are doing our little bit.'
He points to the growth of the term 'extracted value' by politicians and
senior business people over the last few years, and continues to spend time
discussing the issues.
Next year he plans to place greater emphasis on assessing the results of
unemployment, arguing that it is part of the same problem as ecological
damage. It is caused by a tax system that generates most revenues from
employment and a tiny fraction on raw materials. He would like to see the
situation reversed.
But Wintzen has no plans to abandon business and proselytise full time. 'If
I gave up business and just went around in sandals no one would listen to
me,' he says. 'Because I also make money, they have to pay attention.'

FT  22 JUN 94 / Technology: Debate fuelled by recycled oil - Peter Knight
looks at why environmentalists are for re-refining and the big companies
against
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Would you put recycled oil into your car? Some Californians do, providing a
business for Evergreen, a company that specialises in collecting and
re-refining lubricating oil. Similar oil is available through Wal-Mart, the
US retail chain. And UK motorists will soon have the chance to use a
re-refined oil, Envirol, produced in the UK by Orcol.
But is recycling the best environmental option for dealing with waste oil?
The answer depends on your commercial position. The oil business tends to
think used oil should be burned as fuel in certain high-temperature
processes, such as cement making and roadstone preparation.
Environmental campaigners think it should be treated and returned to its
original use. Both sides have strong economic and environmental arguments in
favour of their opposing positions.
There is no disagreement on the problem of used oil. Roughly half the oil
sold is 'lost' in use. Some escapes through leaks, some is burnt inside the
engine, some is burnt as a heating fuel and the rest is dumped illegally.
In the US, it is estimated that more than 1.4m tonnes of used oil is dumped
in landfills, on land and down sewers each year. That is equivalent to 35
Exxon Valdez disasters a year. The UK consumes about 800,000 tonnes of
lubricating oil a year and roughly half of that disappears. West Germany
(before unification) consumed just over 1m tonnes a year with just over half
collected after use.
The dumped oil is not only a wasted resource but a powerful pollutant which
can contaminate land, poison water supplies and destroy wildlife. A gallon
of dumped oil can contaminate up to 1m gallons of drinking water with heavy
metals, chlorinated solvents and carcinogenic compounds.
In Europe, an EU directive makes member states responsible for ensuring the
safe collection and disposal of waste oil. The preferred option is to
re-generate and re-use it. Failing that, it should be used as a fuel.
European countries have used different policies to encourage collection.
Taxes and subsidies have been tried by Germany, France, Italy, Spain and
Finland. Sellers of motor oil have been obliged to take it back in Germany.
Some countries, such as Germany, treat some used oil as hazardous and
therefore subject to special handling. Other countries, such as the US, have
decided against this classification. No country or state appears to have
found the ideal solution, especially to encourage do-it-yourself oil
changers to bring back their used oil.
A UK survey found that in one city 63 per cent of motorists changed their
own oil and 80 per cent of those admitted pouring the old oil down the
drain.
Re-refining used to be a messy process which used sulphuric acid and clay to
extract the impurities. This created by-products that were more hazardous
than the original waste oil.
Newer technologies now use a combination of distillation, filtration and
hydrogenation to finish the oil. This removes the water, most of the
contaminants and additives. It produces a base oil which can be blended to
make a product that is claimed to be as good as that made from virgin oil.
Angela Himus, editor of Industrial Waste Management, says used oil is
treated at three levels. 'Although the equipment may vary and companies may
use proprietary processes the basic levels are fuel oil, recycling, and
re-refining.'
To produce fuel oil the waste is dewatered, filtered and then centrifuged.
Road stone makers, cement makers and power stations buy this oil, which has
a lower sulphur content than virgin fuel oil.
Recycled oils are usually those used in hydraulic equipment or other
industrial machinery. The oil is returned to its original specification
after residues, contaminants and water are taken out.
Re-refining produces a number of different fractions: diesel, lubricating
oils and asphalt. The lubricating oil fraction is finished to produce a base
oil, which is blended with additives to make the final product. Modern
re-refining methods create no harmful by-products.
Makers of such oil, such as Evergreen in the US and Orcol in the UK, say
their products can meet all the engine makers' performance specifications.
But the oil majors are sceptical.
Nick Wilkinson, a business adviser to BP Oil Marketing, says re-refined oil
would not meet his company's standards for health and safety. 'In our
estimation most re-refining processes are insufficient to overcome the
health and safety aspects because of the presence of PCAs.'
PCAs, or polycyclic aromatics, are formed when the oil is circulating in the
internal combustion engine. PCAs are harmful if they come into contact with
the skin.
But according to Jeff Underhill, vice president for business development at
Evergreen: 'We do not see this as a problem. Our base oil meets all the
standards and passes all the tests for health and safety.'
Wilkinson is also sceptical of the energy efficiency of the re-refining
process. The EU says preference should be given to re-refining because of
the energy savings it can bring, but the oil industry doubts the accuracy of
this statement.
Underhill is not convinced: 'We think that when you consider all the issues,
re-refining is the most energy-efficient option. I don't see burning used
oil as a long-term solution anyway, because air purity standards will get
tougher.'
Re-refining can also be highly profitable if the systems of collection are
efficient. 'From a green investment point of view the business of
re-refining lubricating oil is very attractive because of the margins that
can be achieved,' says Mark Campanale, an analyst for the NPI Global Care
Fund. 'By using recycled oil you are also replacing a virgin product with a
recycled raw material. It must make both business and environmental sense.'
But if these margins are to be realised the collection systems have to be
reasonably close to the refineries and well-managed to prevent lubricating
oil becoming contaminated with other oils and liquids, such as synthetic
cooling oils.
The efficiency of collection systems depends largely on government policy -
especially its enforcement - as well as the demand from industry for
recycled oil. Even in those countries where the law has been strict, such as
Austria, enforcement is slack.
In the UK, illegal disposal can lead to a fine of Pounds 20,000 or six
months in prison. But the collection systems are at best haphazard and there
is little demand from industry for re-refined oil.
While the crude oil price remains low and margins tight in the oil business,
the big oil companies have little interest in promoting collection or
recycling.
'The government needs to do more to encourage recycling. The existing
collection systems are well established and local governments are providing
facilities but we need the government to provide the push for the next step
up. The recovery and recycling companies can cope with any increase in the
volumes recovered,' says Arthur Rennie, general manager of Lanstar
Hydrocarbons, a recoverer and recycler.
Orcol, the UK's biggest collector, is trying single-handed to stimulate
recovery. It has launched a collection promotion called 'Earth Defender'
where service stations will provide facilities for DIY oil changers to
deposit their waste oil.
This might be sufficient to guarantee a flow of sufficiently high-grade raw
material for Orcol's production of Envirol, but it will not make much of a
difference to the UK's waste oil problem.
While the German system is far from efficient, some used oil is treated and
returned to the lubricating oil cycle by using it as a feed alongside virgin
oil in some major refineries.
'This is a highly subsidised activity. If you have to install new equipment
in oil refineries to use waste oil as a feed it will increase costs and the
exercise will not be economic,' says Wilkinson.
Without uncontested figures to back re-refining, effective government policy
and a change in the motorist's perception of recycled oil, the problem of
used oil seems set to grow as fast as the world's expanding car population.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Chartered, the UK-based international banking group, has reshuffled
the responsibilities of its senior directors, freeing its current head of
investment banking, Christopher Castleman, to take charge of large client
relationships.
The bank has tried to sharpen its management following the appointment of
Patrick Gillam as its chairman, and Malcolm Williamson as its chief
executive. It has yet to shake off decisively its image of being
accident-prone.
The reshuffle places Castleman in charge of major client relationships for
the group around the world as well as some strategy issues. Peter Wood, who
already controls finance and risk, will take overall responsibility for
strategy.
John McFarlane, who heads treasury and capital markets, will take over
responsibility for merchant banking, capital markets and stockbroking. This
is intended to create a single unit for all trading and markets activities.
David Moir, the executive director responsible for the Asia Pacific region
and group personal banking, will assume responsibility for custody, private
banking and private trust businesses within the bank's Equitor group.
David Brougham, the executive director responsible for banking activities in
Europe, America, Africa, Middle East and South Asia, will take additional
responsibility for credit and credit services.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Management: Diversification brews success - Emiko Terazono
meets shipbuilder turned tea-seller Michio Ota
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate venturing has a chequered history in Japan. Recent forays by steel
companies into computers, breweries into the flower business and ball
bearing manufacturers into semiconductors demonstrate this. But the decision
by Hitachi Zosen, a leading shipbuilder, to invest in Tu-Chung Chinese tea,
has proved a notable exception.
The venture, started in 1986, has grown into a Y10bn (Pounds 64m) business
and profits contributed to half of the company's 26.3 per cent pre-tax
earnings growth last year.
Like other shipbuilders in the mid-1980s, Hitachi Zosen faced a sharp
decline in demand and plunging profits due to the high yen. In an effort to
reduce dependence on its core business, the company appointed Michio Ota, an
engineer who had spent the previous 39 years constructing ships, as general
manager of the new biotechnology division.
Ota's new career began unpromisingly with the failure of projects to grow
mushrooms and make a type of fish bait. But he was sure that the idea of a
healthy Chinese tea would be popular given Japan's ageing population and
growing interest in health products.
The tea's effectiveness had been tested in several university hospital
laboratories. 'Having a background in physics, I liked the concept of
manufacturing and selling the tea with a lot of scientific research data,'
he says. That people in China have been drinking it for 5,000 years was also
reassuring, he adds.
Market research was carried out on 30 Hitachi employees, who confirmed that
the tea induced a favourable effect, including weight loss, a decline in
cholesterol and lower blood pressure. However, introducing a product and
being new to the business proved to be a handicap. 'No one would buy the tea
for the first few years,' he says.
Neither Ota nor Hitachi had experience in dealing with consumer products.
The company did not have a retail network and Ota was unable to entice any
of the beverage or foods makers into a tie up. As a result he decided to go
it alone, walking from retailer to retailer, asking barber shop chains and
cosmetic sales staff to offer the tea to their customers.
Hitachi's president ordered the company to use Tu-chung tea internally,
while sales staff in the shipping divisions were told to give clients and
business contacts samples of the tea and special kettles to brew it with.
Hitachi attracted the interest of large stores with health food departments
in 1989, but the big break came in 1992 when the product was introduced to a
wider audience by a health magazine. When a television feature described the
tea as an effective dietary aid, food companies, including Coca Cola and
Asahi, which had shunned Hitachi's initial requests, all rushed into the
market.
Hitachi, which now sells its tea in more than 5,000 retail outlets, faces
growing competition with over 50 companies active in the tea distribution
business. Quality control is an increasingly important competitive weapon;
tea leaves imported from China which do not have enough acids to cut
cholesterol or anti-stress substances are now removed.
The company's diversification into environmental machinery - for instance,
incinerators - has also succeeded, and it has managed to reduce its
dependence on shipbuilding to only 30 per cent of sales. For the business
year just ended last March, Ota expects to post Y10bn in tea sales, 2.5 per
cent of total sales.
Food fads, though, come and go quickly in Japan, and the popularity of
Chinese tea could start to wane. 'We want to start marketing the tea as an
ordinary beverage rather than just a health remedy,' says Ota.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Management: Outsiders move in - Andrew Jack on the future
for accountancy partnerships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Turnbull faces a daunting task this month as he settles into his new
office on the edge of the City of London. He has become one of only a
handful of outsiders to be hired in a senior position by an accountancy
firm.
His appointment as chief operating officer marks a renewed attempt by Robson
Rhodes, the UK's 15th largest firm by fee income, to bring in external
expertise from his roles as managing director of Lex Service and as an
independent consultant, to help with the management of its professional
practice. Two years ago the firm appointed Ray Pierce, a non-accountant, as
chief executive, but he was subsequently headhunted by Guardian Direct, the
telephone insurance company.
The changes at Robson Rhodes reflect a broader trend among accountancy firms
in the UK, the US and elsewhere, which are seeking new approaches to
management as the traditional structure and operations of partnerships are
increasingly seen as redundant.
'We have all spent ages trying to make it work, but the partnership model
isn't sustainable. Genuine partnerships collapsed with size,' says Hugh
Aldous, managing partner of Robson Rhodes.
Deregulation by professional bodies in the early 1970s removed formal
restrictions limiting the total number of partners in accountancy firms, at
a time when they were already fast expanding in size, offices and the range
of services.
The days are now long gone - if they ever really existed - when all partners
in the bigger firms could get round a single conference table, let alone
meet regularly to control their practice by consensus.
The role of the senior partner has consequently changed to focus more on
management, with its occupant increasingly selected on merit. 'In the 1970s
we were dominated by old men nearing retirement. You became senior partner
at 60, and the place was full of nice old gentlemen,' says a partner in one
firm.
One of the first British firms to appoint a non-accountant to a top
executive position was Casson Beckman, a London-based practice, which hired
John Pearce, joint founder of Hoskyns Group, the consuntancy, as chief
executive on a three-year contract in 1988. 'He structured us along tighter
divisional lines,' says Geoff Barnes, the accountant who took over as
chairman from within the firm.
A small management committee reviews day-to-day operations, while all 25
partners meet each month to discuss topics such as hiring or removing
partners. 'You cannot make every decision around a 25-seat table. Many
partners want to be involved only in client work and are happy provided they
are communicated with,' he says.
The introduction of outsiders has been resisted by most firms, with the
exception in many large US firms of general counsel, a senior lawyer
appointed in a reflection of the country's litigious environment.
Evidence of broader changes to internal management is more widespread.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK's biggest firm, has for a number of years been
headed by a chairman and an executive committee. Similar structures exist in
all its big competitors. Most are based on hierarchical, traditional
corporate-style approaches.
'I saw signs of this beginning in the early 1980s,' says Alan Hodgart of
consultants Hodgart Temporal. 'There was enormous trauma and a tendency to
centralise power.'
In response, many partners within the bigger firms began to feel alienated,
demotivated and isolated from decision-making. The consequence has been
cynicism and a temptation to ignore or frustrate senior management's
strategies.
Hodgart says reformers at the time came to the wrong conclusion because they
were often guilty of sophistry: they wrongly suggested that the partnership
was the cause of management problems, and that the solution was to introduce
alternative, corporate structures.
The changes by accountants ironically have taken place at a time when many
companies are trying to remove layers of hierarchy in their own
organisations and to mimic the most powerful element of partnership - sense
of ownership as a motivator.
Hodgart says a number of the accountants also mistakenly believed they were
following the lead taken by one of the world's biggest and most successful
firms, Arthur Andersen. In fact, Andersen may have tight management but it
continues to involve its partners actively in strategy discussions.
'Andersen, and other successful partnerships like McKinsey and Goldman
Sachs, spend a fortune flying partners around the world to debate strategy,'
says Hodgart. 'Because the partners know where they are going, they are
willing to work within the strategy.'
The structure also works because Andersen has grown organically rather than
through merger, with partners around the world sharing a common culture,
training and approach.
The firm retains a strong element of democracy, with partners voting on the
admission of their peers, and being consulted on the appointment and
performance of their managing partners. Perhaps most important, partners are
also receptive to the strategy adopted by the firm because it has manifestly
worked, with Andersen widely perceived to have among the highest levels of
profits and growth in the sector.
However, David Maister, of Maister Associates, a US-based consultant to
professional firms, argues that simply focusing on senior management
structures and on the extension of participation in strategy is not enough.
'I have seen the strategic plans of all the major firms and they are
identical,' he says. 'That is not a mistake. They are all stressing the
right things. The race is about who can implement them best.'
Maister argues that while firms may have altered their structures during the
1980s, they did not introduce management so much as ad-ministration by
numbers. 'There was a sense that people will leave you alone as long as you
meet your target,' he says.
'Very little changed until the last recession. For the last 20 years they
were asked to be effective, not efficient. Now clients are realising that a
lot of what the accountants provide is methodology-driven and not brain
surgery.'
While they have long made money selling management information systems to
others, the firms are only now installing them internally. 'The real need is
not for management at the top of the organisation but for better front-line
coaches,' he says.
For firms hoping to flourish in the late 1990s, learning the management
lessons from their more progressive clients will be of vital importance.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Management: Change brings results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Change management is often viewed sceptically by shareholders, media
commentators and employees. But a new survey* of senior American and
European executives suggests those at the top are still confident of
producing positive results.
Roughly two thirds of the 160 or so companies responding to the poll claimed
they had made significant progress in getting employees to focus on quality
issues, while half reported big strides in boosting productivity and
increasing employee awareness of customer needs.
Other results, though, were more mixed. Just over half reported an improved
share price and better profitability, but only 30 per cent said they had
made significant gains in market share. Only one third believed they had
been successful in winning employee commitment and in increasing workers'
adaptability to change.
The survey, by the business organisation The Conference Board, found that
most companies began their current round of change management in 1989. More
than half said they had made marked changes in their organisation structure,
business strategy, and the size and composition of their workforces, while
at least half had overhauled their leadership style and company culture. At
least 40 per cent had also changed their use of information technology,
decision-making styles, basic work processes and reward systems.
The difficulty of implementing a new culture and values was cited by 40 per
cent of respondents. 'Vision and values now serve as the glue that holds the
decentralised organisation together', says the report.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Recruitment: Time to let the train take the strain -
Frustrated commuters agonising about rail transport disruptions should
consider working from home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The disruption to Britain's railways by striking signalling staff seems as
good an excuse as any to take a fresh look at the merits of teleworking.
It may be that this form of employment comprises part of your working week
already. A Department of Employment study in February found that one in 10
employers had at least one home-based worker and BT has estimated that by
1995 2.25m people will be working from home three days or more a week in the
UK.
For the rest of us, it is perhaps one of those employment ideas that has
been shelved in the rainy day file to be pulled out, dusted down and
re-examined with the toast and marmalade as we face the prospect of lengthy
traffic queues on the way to work.
The idea of teleworking is nothing new. The advent of the personal computer,
modem and the Fax machine make working from home, in theory, a far more
feasible proposition.
Information technlogy developments accompanied by greater availability,
quality, reliability and cheaper prices have led to increasing numbers of
employees often deciding that there are different ways to organise their
workloads.
Noel Hodson, director of Strategic Workstyles 2000, an Oxford-based
teleworking consultancy, has studied the prevalence of what he terms 'tacit
teleworking', where it has been adopted almost unconsciously by employees
outside the policies of their employers.
When he investigated teleworking at the World Bank headquarters in
Washington he was informed by its personnel department that it did not exist
there. An inquiry among information technology specialists however, revealed
they had established communications links for 1,000 teleworkers a day.
'This meant that the equivalent of 240,000 man-days a year were being worked
outside formal systems. The personnel people were rather cross when they
found out,' says Hodson.
The spread of tacit teleworking is such that some organisations are unclear
how many of their employees are what might be termed 'in station' at any one
time. Dr Frank Becker at Cornell University carried out a survey of empty
desks in a number of companies and found 70 per cent unstaffed in some
offices.
Teleworking often evolves naturally but it is sometimes triggered by an
outside event. Within hours of the Los Angeles earthquake last year,
thousands of telephone lines were being installed in peripheral offices
allowing people to work outside the city. In the UK, the immediate stimulus
may be transport problems caused by industrial action but high office rents
have also driven the trend.
Digital, the US-based computer company, began introducing teleworking among
its employees six years ago: now 40 per cent of its 4,000 UK workforce have
modems or similar links for using personal computers and other
communications equipment from home.
The latest stage in developing the concept involved closing down Digital's
Newmarket office in April. The office, which used to accommodate 100 people,
was replaced with a small tele-centre manned by nine staff and supporting 80
people working around it.
In-coming telephone calls are taken by the Newmarket or Welling offices and
re-routed to people's homes without the caller knowing that they are
speaking to anyone outside an ordinary office.
Ian Christie, Digital's marketing manager for flexible work services, said
the reorganisation was saving the company about a third of a million pounds
a year on direct property costs and running costs.
'Generally speaking the response has been very positive but it must be said
that we have very few people who work five days a week from home. It is part
of managers' responsibilities to have regular team meetings for which a
three-line whip is essential,' he says.
Teleworking has been criticised for divorcing employees from their normal
social contact in the office but Christie argues that it can create greater
contact if people ensure that they do not isolate themselves. 'Instead of
meeting the same faces around the coffee machine you make a much broader
social circle.'
Christie says he often choses to work at Digital's head office in Reading
deliberately to pick up those unexpected contacts or jobs that tend to
materialise in the conventional office.
Noel Hodson believes there is a powerful economic argument for teleworking.
He says that 18 per cent of all office time, the equivalent of almost a full
working day, is taken up with office politics. Moreover, the time saved that
would be normally spent commuting can be utilised for work.
He says: 'I used to spend four hours a day commuting from my home in Oxford
to north London. That was the equivalent to half a working year.'
Hodson adds that the momentum for teleworking has grown markedly in the past
year. He has just completed some research which concludes that teleworking
is going to increase the number of jobs by promoting what he calls the
'24-hour society', already happening among some telephone sales
organisations unrestricted by normal office hours. He estimates that
equipping Europe with an 'information super highway' adopting Integrated
Services Digital Network lines - high quality computer links - and optic
fibres allowing speedy computer communications will create 3m jobs, although
many of these may be outside Europe itself.
A Henley Centre for Forecasting study suggested that 50 per cent of UK jobs
overall could be teleworked and predicted that 15 per cent of all work could
be sourced from home by the end of the century, equivalent to 3.3m jobs.
These predictions may turn out to be over-enthusiastic because of the
inherent resistance to working from home among many people and indeed some
companies.
These seem manifest in a number of anxieties. There is an innate desire to
be seen to be there and doing something. We dare not be away. It may not be
an idle fear. Reading the other day about purges instigated by Mao Zedong
during the Cultural Revolution it was noticeable how many party officials
were denounced simply because they were absent at the time of meetings to
discuss potential recalcitrants. Corporate Britain may feel far removed from
this but office plotting is not unknown.
So teleworking takes a certain hardiness and confidence. Why not try it? If
you're stuck at home, strike-bound and haven't planned your day beforehand,
it is probably already too late to maximise your time outside work. Hodson
suggests an action plan for setting up a teleworking day:
Prepare two days work with all the files and stationary you need.
Organise a work area and make it clear to your family that this isn't a day
off.
Circulate telephone and Fax numbers and agree how often you need to stay in
touch.
Managers, he says, should ensure that not everyone is outside the office and
should afterwards review the benefits of part-time teleworking for the
company.
There is a downside to teleworking among people who find it difficult to
draw the line between work and home life. Parents find it hard to explain
that they are not always available to their children.
Often there is also a tendency for people who cannot let go of their work to
do too much. If you don't fit that description you might take another tip:
turn the sound down on the TV when when you answer the telephone. The echo
of tennis balls has a distinctive resonance.

Information 'superhighways' - advanced communications networks capable of
carrying text and moving video images - are being considered as a means of
disseminating official information to the public.
The government yesterday published a consultation document and said it was
reviewing the possibilities presented by superhighways. The report was
prepared by the government's Central Computers and Telecommunications Agency
for Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister.
The world's leading telecommunications and computer companies have made
dramatic advances in the development of information highways.
In the US, research to increase the availability and reduce the costs of the
technology for government information purposes is continuing.
Among the possibilities are access to government reports and statistics,
access to job vacancies and checks on citizens' rights.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Minister's call on VAT highlights Tory tax splits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Splits inside the Conservative party over the government's taxation policy
seem to be intensifying, with a junior minister urging the Treasury to
abandon the next phased increase in value added tax on fuel.
Mr Allan Stewart, a Scottish Office minister, has told colleagues that the
planned increase in VAT on fuel to 17.5 per cent, due next April, should be
withdrawn.
Friends of Mr Stewart say that his call for VAT to remain at 8 per cent has
received encouraging support from other junior ministers. Those arguing for
the move believe that the upswing in the economic cycle is strong enough to
diminish concern about public finances, and that the government now has the
scope to reduce the tax burden without endangering the deficit.
With the Tories at historically low levels in opinion polls, a number of
Tory backbenchers have also argued that the government must set about
reducing taxes if it is to have any chance of winning the next election.
Mr Stewart is being careful not to intensify the issue by insisting on
meetings with Treasury ministers. Instead, he merely wishes to reflect the
views of senior Scottish Tory councillors to whom he has spoken in recent
weeks. They believe that their poor performance in the Scottish regional
elections was largely due to the increase in VAT on fuel.
Treasury insiders caution that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is
unlikely to have the scope to abandon the VAT increase next April unless the
public sector borrowing requirement comes down unexpectedly quickly by
November. But they also admit that, if there is a windfall, the permanent
pegging of VAT is likely to be at the top of the chancellor's list of
measures, ahead of other possible tax cuts.
In political terms, a U-turn over VAT would leave the government vulnerable
to opposition charges that it is weak and indecisive.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Mortgage complaint cases up 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Complaints about the treatment of mortgage customers taken up by the
Building Societies Ombudsman Scheme rose 15 per cent in 1993-94 compared
with the previous year.
At the publication of the scheme's annual report yesterday, Mr Stephen
Edell, the senior ombudsman, highlighted complaints in areas such as
mortgage-protection policies and the explanation of fixed-rate mortgage
terms.
He said some societies needed to improve their practices significantly in
relation to mortgage protection. As a minimum they should comply with the
code of practice devised by the Association of British Insurers.
The report describes some society documentation on fixed rate loans as
'unacceptably sloppy'. Societies should ensure that the papers reflect their
real intentions, it says.
It also criticises the reluctance of some societies to publicise the
ombudsman scheme, suggesting that this is in breach of the code of banking
practice.
Overall, the report shows a drop of just more than a third in the total
number of complaints taken up to 901 from 1,352 in 1992-93. There was also a
slight drop in the number of complaints received, to 9,100 from 9,402.
The figures reflect both a greater readiness among societies to settle
complaints through their own procedures, and also improvements in the
treatment of investors with information about obsolete accounts.
In spite of a lower total number of complaints taken up the ombudsmen have
found for the complainant more often than in 1992-93. In 338 cases the
customer was at least partly successful, compared with 279 in 1992-93.
Mr Edell welcomed the fact that from the beginning of next month, the
ombudsmen's powers would extend to dealing with complaints arising from what
happened before a mortgage or investment was completed, provided the
transaction did then take place.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Urban scheme 'failed to halt decline'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government policies for inner-city regeneration in the late 1980s failed to
arrest the decline in the centres of England's largest cities, says a report
published yesterday by the Department of Environment.
It says the Pounds 10bn spent on more than 20 programmes under the Action
for Cities Initiative between 1988 and 1991 achieved a 'measurable positive
impact'. The gap between the 57 urban priority areas targeted and other
urban areas had narrowed.
But in many of the most intractable inner-city areas conditions continued to
decline in spite of the investment of large sums in regeneration.
Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne, Hull, Coventry and London boroughs such as
Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Lambeth were among those that received the
highest level of resources under the initiative, yet showed the poorest
outcomes in terms of jobs, new businesses and other regeneration indicators.
The report says: 'Local analysis shows that there are growing numbers of
areas (in very large cities) that are disadvantaged and that the districts
are the home of a growing share of disadvantaged people.'
The report, by independent researchers at three universities, makes five
recommendations to improve the effectiveness of urban regeneration. These
include better co-ordination between the programmes and a stronger role for
local leadership, particularly by local authorities.
The environment department said yesterday that changes in policy since the
end of the Action for Cities initiative had effectively implemented these
recommendations. The creation of a single regeneration budget would improve
the coherence of programmes, while new government regional offices would
encourage the formation of local partnerships.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Trade deficit with non-EU countries widens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's visible trade deficit with countries outside the European Union
widened to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 767m in May, as imports rose 2.5 per
cent and exports fell 2.5 per cent on the month.
The Central Statistical Office revised down April's deficit to Pounds 493m,
from Pounds 566m. If oil and erratic items, such as ships and precious
stones, are excluded May's deficit was Pounds 669m, compared with Pounds
614m in April.
In the three months to May the visible trade deficit was Pounds 1.95bn,
compared with Pounds 2.09bn in the previous three months.
In volume terms the UK is seeing a modest improvement. In the three months
to May import volumes were 2 per cent lower than in the previous three
months. Export volumes fell 1 per cent. The CSO said that on a trend basis
export volumes were unchanged while imports were falling by  1/2 per cent a
month.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'The dip in
import volumes is a further sign that suggests that the UK economy is not
accelerating into an unsustainable boom and contrasts with the late 1980s
import surge.'
Yet Mr Sanjay Joshi, head of bond research at Daiwa Europe, said the figures
showed 'a disappointing export performance. The benefit of the competitive
devaluation in September 1992 seems to be fading away'.
Import prices rose faster than export prices in the three months to May,
with the main increase coming in basic materials, which might reflect the
recent rise in world commodity markets. Prices of both exports and imports
have risen 20 per cent since August 1992.
After the recent rise in North Sea production the oil account was once more
in surplus. In the first five months of the year the UK had a Pounds 36m oil
surplus, compared with a Pounds 1.38bn deficit in the calendar year 1993.
The CSO said that in the three months to May there was a sharp rise in
imports from other OECD countries, mainly Japan, Australia and New Zealand.
Exports to North America and the rest of the world rose. Trade with Malaysia
showed little sign of the ban on state contracts for British companies:
exports to Malaysia were Pounds 161m in May, Pounds 110m in April and Pounds
78m in January.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Pensions white paper to dilute reform advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is expected to release a white paper tomorrow on regulatory
reform of the occupational pensions industry in Britain that will be a pale
reflection of the reforms recommended by the government's advisers last
autumn.
In particular, the paper, which is intended as a blueprint for a bill in the
next parliamentary session, contains a far more modest proposal for a new
pensions regulator than that recommended by the Pension Law Review
Committee.
The committee, chaired by Mr Roy Goode, a professor of commercial law, urged
establishment of a government-funded body which would monitor pension scheme
solvency, investment activity and administration. It is expected that a
scaled-down version will be proposed and that the government will urge
professional advisers to each scheme to act as a kind of watchdog.
Mr Nigel O'Sullivan, partner at actuarial consultants Bacon and Woodrow,
said the failure to institute a tough regulator could raise the costs to the
industry of a compensation scheme. The white paper is expected to propose a
compensation scheme for losses caused by theft, fraud or malfeasance that
would require other schemes to finance 90 per cent of the assets lost.
Mr O'Sullivan said he had calculated that a Pounds 200m charge on the
compensation scheme would cost a Pounds 50m pension scheme Pounds 40,000 in
levies. A Pounds 1bn scheme would have to pay Pounds 800,000. 'This is a
Pounds 500bn industry,' he said. 'If we can't afford to have somebody decent
regulating it then I don't know what we are doing.'
The white paper is also expected to back away from a requirement that all
occupational schemes with more than 50 members be required to allow members
to appoint at least one-third of the board of trustees. The paper will say
this is regarded as best practice, but the government will not make it
obligatory.
Among other proposals, the report will urge adoption of a modified 'minimum
solvency standard' requiring schemes for the first time to hold enough
assets to pay at least 90 per cent of their retrospective pension
obligations.
But this standard is watered down from the Goode proposal that schemes
calculate the 'cash equivalent' of buying each member's retroactive
benefits.
Calculations of cash equivalent values are tied to UK government gilts
yields and the actuarial profession has suggested a compromise to allow
higher equity yields to be taken into account when calculating the pensions
of younger people.
In other areas, the white paper is expected to recommend severing the link
between benefits paid by the State Earnings Related Pensions Scheme to those
not in an employer's scheme and guaranteed minimum pensions which are paid
to those who are.
The white paper will propose that employers need no longer provide benefits
equivalent to those available under Serps - and the government will no
longer have to make up the shortfall for those which do not. In return,
schemes will have to guarantee that pensions in payment are increased each
year by 5 per cent or by the rise in retail prices, whichever is the lower.
Guaranteed minimum pension, which accounts for up to 20 per cent of each
employee's occupational pension, must currently be uprated each year by 7
per cent. But there is no government requirement that pensions in payment be
increased in line with inflation.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Big rise in legal aid abuse inquiries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rise in cases of fraud and abuse of the legal aid scheme was
reported yesterday by the Legal Aid Board.
In its annual report the board, which administers the scheme for the
government, said the number of preliminary investigations undertaken by its
investigation section had risen from 642 in 1992-93 to 1,035 in 1993-94.
The number of cases under investigation also increased from 362 in 1992-93
to 957 in 1993-94.
The board said the rise was largely because of the number of letters sent to
solicitors requiring an explanation of questionable costs claims.
Of the 957 investigations, 836 fell into that category. As a result,
information about 363 firms had been passed to the Solicitors Complaints
Bureau and 21 had been reported to it with a request for disciplinary
action.
The remaining 121 cases involved more detailed investigations. Six cases had
resulted in court appearances, four of which involved solicitors and their
support staff.
Two solicitors and a clerk were convicted and one solicitor acquitted.
The two other cases involved legal aid applicants making false declarations
to obtain aid.
At the end of 1993-94 there were 517 continuing investigations of which 30
had been reported to the police and five were awaiting trial.
The investigation section also dealt with solicitors' firms which, during
the course of investigations, had been found to be over-claiming costs on
the legal aid fund.
A total of Pounds 143,000 had been recovered.
During 1993-94 the board met all but one of its performance targets on
handling aid applications and payment of lawyers' bills, and achieved the
quality assurance standard, BS 5750.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Banker attacks floating charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A leading banker yesterday called for the abolition of the floating charge,
a powerful method banks use to secure loans to corporate borrowers.
The zrecommendation was made by Mr Derek Sach, director of specialised
lending services at the Royal Bank of Scotland.
It comes at a time when insolvency issues are under growing scrutiny and
while the Department of Trade and Industry is examining revisions to
existing legislation.
The floating charge allows banks to take a charge over all of a company's
changing assets, such as inventory, as security against loans  - in contrast
to the fixed charge, which is secured over specified fixed assets.
Small businesses say the floating charge - permitted only in a few countries
such as the UK, Australia and Canada - unfairly tilts the balance of power
in favour of lender banks and away from the interests of management and
unsecured creditors to a company.
Mr Sach said removing the floating charge would encourage banks to
concentrate more on companies' cashflow and financial position rather than
focusing on security.
'It would encourage banks to take better decisions and lead to greater
business survival rates for the greater good of mankind,' he said.
His view stands in stark contrast to the opinion of the British Bankers'
Association and individual banks which have insisted that abolition of the
floating charge would reduce their willingness to lend.
Mr Sach stressed that he was expressing a personal view and that the Royal
Bank would continue to take floating charges. Mr Sach, who joined the Royal
Bank to set up a special unit for dealing with companies in distress and who
previously worked for 3i, the venture-capital company, is known for his
outspoken views.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Salad growers plead for state help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Salad growers last night urged the government to take action to prevent the
collapse of the Pounds 154m sector in the face of cheap imports.
Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, led a delegation
of growers who told MPs from both sides of the Commons that many UK salad
businesses would go bankrupt unless the government helped.
He said overproduction of salad in the European Union had pushed down prices
for UK growers. Imports of iceberg lettuces from Spain alone had more than
doubled since 1988 to 70,000 tonnes last year.
Mr Roger Sayer, managing director of Humber Growers, which produces nearly a
quarter of the country's cucumbers, said spring prices were 40 per cent down
on last year.
Mr Sayer said the government should investigate whether other EU growers
were receiving state aid which distorted competition.
He also called for government funding to promote fresh fruit and vegetables,
and faster approval of pesticides so UK growers had access to the variety
available to EU competitors.
'We're just as efficient as our European colleagues, but unless we get a
fair crack of the whip the business will disappear,' he said.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Birmingham M-way toll inquiry begins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The public inquiry which may settle the fate of the first toll motorway
proposed in the UK opened yesterday in Walsall, West Midlands, amid
expectations that it will hear evidence for between six and nine months.
Sir John Fitzpatrick, the government-appointed inspector, heard the opening
statement of the Department of Transport, which wants to build the
Birmingham Northern Relief Road around the northern and eastern sides of the
Birmingham-Black Country conurbation to relieve the M6. The new road would
run through the green belt from the M6 west of Cannock to Coleshill, east of
Birmingham and close to the junction of the M6 with the M42. It would cost
about Pounds 500m and involve the purchase of about 1,500 acres of private
land.
The proposal, which was first made in 1980, has prompted objections from
more than 7,000 people. They include representatives of environmental groups
such as Friends of the Earth; villagers fearing disturbance and
representatives of special-interest lobbies such as the British
Motorcyclists Federation.
The weight of objections will ensure that - as Mr Gwyn Drake, West Midlands
projects director of the Highways Agency, - said: this will be 'one of the
largest public inquiries for years'. It will rival in scale the inquiries
into the M40, the M1-A1 link road and the East London River Crossing.
The inquiry is the second into the relief road. Since the first in 1988, the
government has changed its proposals to bring in private-sector finance.
It has given a 53-year concession to build and operate the road to a joint
venture of Trafalgar House, the UK engineering and construction group, and
Iritecna, the Italian toll motorway operator. They modified the route
slightly from the transport department proposals of the 1980s.
The argument about the need for the road centres on congestion on the M6. Mr
Michael Fitzgerald QC, for the transport department, told the inquiry that
without the new road 'the conditions which are worst on Fridays will become
the norm'.
Friends of the Earth, which claims to have gathered 'the most comprehensive
alliance against any road in this country', will argue that the road would
generate more traffic.
It said: 'It's very important that a message goes to the government that
they can't build motorways through the countryside any more.'

FT  22 JUN 94 / Contractors urge tendering rules shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contractors yesterday called on the government to publish new ground rules
on compulsory competitive tendering and market testing.
The move follows a recent Court of Appeal decision that European rules cover
the transfer of a hospital cleaning contract from one private contractor to
another.
The Business Services Association, a public-sector contractors' lobby group,
said it was no longer possible to sustain the position that the European
rules - translated into UK law by the 1981 Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) Regulations, known as Tupe - did not apply to
contracting out.
The association said that contractors would have no option but to tender on
the basis that Tupe applied in most cases. When Tupe applies contractors
must take on an existing workforce on unchanged pay and conditions. This
makes it more difficult for private contractors to undercut public-sector
costs.
The association will continue to press for contracting-out to be removed
from the ambit of the European rules contained in the acquired rights
directive. In the meantime it said it was essential for the government to
reconsider details of its market testing and compulsory competitive
tendering rules in order to maintain genuine competition.
Mr John Hall, the association's director-general, said contractors wanted:
Warranties from public authorities of the accuracy of employee information,
with an indemnity for any undisclosed liabilities.
Indemnity for historic liabilities accrued while staff were in the public
sector.
Longer contract periods to maximise opportunity for cost-saving
reorganisations of the workforce.
The association also wants the government to change its advice that
contractors must offer pensions comparable to those in the public sector.
Another group of contractors represented by the Clause 26 Group confirmed
yesterday that as many as 200 companies holding contracts for work in the
local authority sector might sue the government for up to Pounds 20m for
misleading them over the application of Tupe.
Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman, the group's co-ordinator, said contractors had been
advised by lawyers that they had a strong case for recouping money spent on
legal advice on Tupe in the past two years.
There was evidence the government had known in 1983 that Tupe did not meet
the requirements of the acquired rights directive, he said.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Milk Marque confident over farm deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Milk Marque, the producers' co-operative that will succeed the Milk
Marketing Board in November, is confident it will sign up between 70 per
cent and 80 per cent of the 30,000 dairy farmers in England and Wales.
Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive, said yesterday that contracts and interest
so far indicated this target would be achieved. He had previously confirmed
only that more than half of all dairy farmers had signed up.
Farmers will be free to sell milk either to Milk Marque or direct to dairy
companies under the board's plans - approved by the government last week -
to open the Pounds 3.3bn market to competition on November 1.
Mr Dare's confidence about attracting the vast majority of producers will
fuel concern among dairy groups that Milk Marque will be too powerful.
The Dairy Trade Federation said yesterday it was worried that 'the
arrangements provide considerable potential for the abuse by Milk Marque of
the dominant position it seeks to achieve'.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, said last week that she expected
the Office of Fair Trading and the European Commission to ensure that Milk
Marque did not abuse its market power.
The trade federation, which has previously threatened legal action over the
board's plans, said it would consider whether the government's assurances
met the needs of buyers and producers 'for a fair and stable trading
environment'.
The milk board announced yesterday that it expected Dairy Crest, its
processing subsidiary, to be floated on the stock market in late September
or October. But it might take place after the November launch of Milk Marque
if stock market conditions did not improve.
The proportion of Dairy Crest that ends up in public hands will depend on
whether dairy farmers, who are entitled to Pounds 65m from the sale for past
investments in the company, decide to take the money as cash or shares.
Mr Dare said the board would announce an indicative price next week for Milk
Marque's sale of milk to dairy companies, asking them for a response by
mid-July.
'If we get more demand than we have supply available, we shall have to look
again at prices and adjust upwards, or vice-versa if prices are too high,'
said Mr Dare. 'If necessary, we will scale back (allocations) if there is
not enough supply.

Labour is planning to table a motion of censure against Mr William
Waldegrave, public services minister, for preventing the cross-party Commons
Treasury and Civil Service committee from conducting an attitude survey
among civil servants.
The committee will today publish a report on the proposed survey, which
would be part of its inquiry into the changing status of civil servants
under the government's market orientated reforms.
Mr Waldegrave believes the survey would constitute a breach of Civil Service
impartiality.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Battle for Channel 4 funds stepped up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Channel 4 and the independent television companies yesterday stepped up
their battle over several hundred million pounds in advertising revenues,
Raymond Snoddy writes.
Sir Michael Bishop, Channel 4 chairman, and Mr Michael Grade, chief
executive, met Mr Peter Brooke, the National Heritage secretary, to persuade
him to remove the present funding arrangements. They say this could result
in Channel 4 paying Pounds 500m to ITV over 10 years - money that will go
straight to ITV profits rather than funding programmes.
The complex safety net formula was designed to protect Channel 4's remit for
innovative programming. Of all Channel 4 revenue above 14 per cent of total
UK non-satellite television advertising, half goes to ITV, 25 per cent is
kept by Channel 4 and 25 per cent goes into a reserve fund. If revenue falls
below 14 per cent Channel 4 is compensated out of the reserve fund and then
directly by the ITV companies.
Last year Channel 4 paid the ITV companies Pounds 38.2m. The figure is
expected to be Pounds 50m this year.
Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of the ITV companies, said the present funding
arrangements had to be maintained in the face of growing competition. The
safety-net arrangement had been part of the invitation to bid for new
franchises.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Level of grants deter Design Council bidders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government plans to sell the Design Council's industrial services have run
into trouble because private-sector bidders want 'unacceptably' high
government grants.
The Design Council, the government-funded body which provides design
services to industry, is in the throes of a reorganisation which will leave
it with just a quarter of its staff of about 200, and a greatly reduced
budget.
The government's intention is to transfer many existing services to a
regional network of one-stop business service centres, called Business
Links, and for other services to be sold to the private sector.
The industrial services include the Materials Information Service, which
maintains a database of materials and their applications; an 'Innovation
Noticeboard', which helps inventors get their ideas produced and marketed;
and a design-consultancy register, which provides businesses with the names
of approved consultants.
Both the government and the Design Council's management had hoped that the
industrial services could be kept together. A shortlist of four bidders put
forward plans for purchases of the package, on the understanding that some
Department of Trade and Industry funds would be made available through
Business Links. It now appears that there will either be very limited DTI
cash, or none.
Design Council staff were told yesterday that attempts were to be made to
sell the individual services and fresh bids were being invited from the
private sector on that basis.
The staff, through their union MSF, had been campaigning to keep the
services together. There are fears that fragmentation will mean that
individual schemes which do not find private-sector purchasers will be
scrapped.
There is concern among staff that the Business Links network, which has been
slower to get off the ground than the government envisaged, has yet to prove
its interest or commitment to design.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Rifkind accused of laying ground for Rosyth closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, was accused in the Commons
yesterday of making political preparations for the closure of the Rosyth
naval base, in Fife, instead of fighting for its survival.
At the same time the Rosyth naval dockyard took its diversification from
warship refitting a stage further by launching a company to carry out steel
fabrication for outside customers.
The attack on Mr Rifkind was made by Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish
National party, who said that the government's intentions had been made
clear by Mrs Susan Bell, the Conservative candidate in the Monklands East
by-election.
Mr Salmond said she had described the Rosyth base as 'yesterday's
installation, unable to meet the demands of tomorrow'.
Mr Rifkind said the future of the base was being examined with that of other
installations as part of the 'front line first' study of defence support
costs. He expected final proposals to be announced next month.
Babcock Facilities Management, which operates the dockyard, has invested
nearly Pounds 5m in new steel fabrication facilities and yesterday announced
a Pounds 3m contract to supply steelwork for upgrading the Forth road
bridge, close to the yard.
It expects the subsidiary, Babcock Rosyth Fabricators, to win contracts for
modules for offshore platforms and other work.
The contract for the Forth road bridge involves supplying 1,600 tonnes of
structural steel over 20 months to Grootcon UK, the contractor upgrading the
towers of the bridge to take increased traffic.
Babcock Facilities Management, a subsidiary of Babcock International,
employs 3,500 people at Rosyth. About a quarter of the dockyard's work is
for civilian customers, and it would like this to increase to 40 per cent.
The dockyard already refurbishes trains for London Underground and makes
joinery products.
Babcock Rosyth Fabricators is building rudders for ships, modules for gas
turbines and the hull of a highspeed ferry for Hong Kong.
Mr Allan Smith, managing director of Babcock Facilities Management, said
diversification spread the costs of the yard's overheads more widely and
improved its viability.
In the Commons Mr Rifkind insisted that no decision had yet been taken about
the Rosyth base.
He told Mr Salmond that he was in danger of 'giving humbug a bad name'.
Mr Menzies Campbell, defence spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said that
closure of the naval base would raise strategic issues of 'profound and
irreversible importance'.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Coal sell-off fails to attract foreign bidders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government efforts to attract foreign bidders for British Coal appear
largely to have failed after it emerged yesterday that at least 23 of the 25
companies considering tenders for the corporation's five core regions are
based in the UK.
NM Rothschild, which is advising the government on coal privatisation, is
thought to have sent out preliminary sales memoranda to almost 100
companies, 30 to 40 of them in other countries including the US, South
Africa and Australia.
However, only 33 companies applied to qualify to bid for the five packages
and six mines that are being sold separately. Rothschild considered 25
companies eligible to tender for the five regions.
Research by Coal UK, a Financial Times newsletter, has identified 23 of the
companies - all of them British. Rothschild has refused to name the
companies, but it is possible that none of the 25 is based overseas.
Although there are enough UK companies to ensure that each of the regions
will attract one bidder or more, a tender from an overseas company would
have added prestige to the privatisation and could have increased the amount
raised.
Coal UK's research shows the deep-mine areas of the central south (mainly
Nottinghamshire) and central north (mainly Yorkshire) regions are the least
popular, with 10 and nine potential bids each. South Wales and Scotland have
14 potential bids each, followed by the north-east with 13.
Some of the qualifying companies are thought to have only limited interest.
Larger companies such as RTZ, the international mining conglomerate, and
National Power and PowerGen, the electricity generators, are considered
unlikely bidders even though they have qualified to bid for all five
regions. Apart from them, only three companies, CP Holdings, NSM and RJB
Mining, have qualified for all five regions, although Coal Investments, the
company headed by Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal commercial
director, has done so through a mixture of direct and indirect interests.
It is considering bids for the English regions with the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers, has qualified separately for south Wales and is part of the
Mining Scotland consortium bid for Scotland.
Other potential bidders are: AMEC, the construction group, for cotland and
south Wales; Banks mining company for the north-east; Caledonian Mining for
Scotland and south Wales; a management buy-out team headed by Mr Alan
Houghton for central north; Kier Mining for Scotland, the north-east and
south Wales; Law Mining for Scotland; Rackwood mining group, for Scotland; a
management buy-out team headed by Mr Bryan Riddleston for South Wales; Ryan
Group for south Wales; Ryan/Alcan for the north-east; ScotCoal for Scotland;
a management buy-out team headed by Mr Alan Siddall for the English regions;
Taywood for all regions except central north; Wimpey and Powell Duffryn for
the north-east and south Wales.

Coal could be derailed by a Lords amendment to the Coal Industry Bill.
Peers voted 127 to 121 for a cross-party amendment requiring ministers to
satisfy themselves that new owners can meet liabilities to landowners. The
amendment is aimed at ensuring that potential owners of privatised pits can
cope with liabilities such as the cost of cleaning up contaminated land.
Lord Strathclyde, industry minister, said the amendment would 'create
uncertainty' in the privatisation process. 'There would also be greater
scope for judicial review.'
Lord Morris of Castle Morris, Labour's energy spokesman, said the amendment
would ensure that British Coal's 'so-called environmental time-bombs, such
as subsidence, water pollution and contamination of land,' were taken into
account. 'This is a great triumph in protecting the innocent people who may
be adversely affected by coal privatisation in respect of land contamination
and other potential damage to their property.'
However, the government is likely to seek to reverse the amendment in the
Commons.
Peers also voted 83 to 72 for an amendment requiring pit owners seeking
access to private land to pay landowners the higher of open market value or
compensation for loss.
A third amendment limiting conditions under which a compulsory order for
access to land could be made was agreed without a division. This amendment
restricts orders to cases where more than 250,000 tonnes of coal were
thought to be available and where voluntary agreement had proved
impracticable.
The bill was given a third reading by the Lords and will return to the
Commons shortly for a debate on the amendments.
MPs last night voted by a majority of 133 (293-160) to reject a decision by
the Lords which would have freed large garden centres, nurseries and DIY
shops from all restrictions on Sunday trading.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Railtrack takes the route to modernisation: Robert Taylor on
the radical reforms which would end archaic practices for signalling staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack's offer to modernise the pay and practices of its 4,600 signalling
staff provides an indictment of the obsolete industrial-relations culture it
inherited less than two months ago from British Rail.
'We cannot continue with an outdated structure which is inefficient, costly
and denies our employees the opportunities of a varied and rewarding
career,' Mr Bob Horton, company chairman, said yesterday. 'I believe the
union agrees with us on this.'
Details of the offer released by Railtrack yesterday illustrate archaic
labour practices that should have been negotiated away a long time ago.
Railtrack wants to negotiate change with the RMT rail union on a tight
timetable, with a settlement by October 1.
What is proposed amounts to a radical reform that will increase take-home
pay for about three-quarters of the company's signalling staff - although
the rest would see no benefit.
Railtrack proposes to remove obstacles to promotion and job changes in
signalling grades. In future existing signalling staff, other employees or
external applicants 'deemed suitable by local management' would be able to
apply for any signalling vacancy. This proposal is intended to end the
regional boundaries which, for example, prevent a signal operator at
London's Kings Cross station applying for a job at Euston station, a few
hundred yards away.
The company proposes an annual career development review; extra pay for
employees who carry out training; and a job-evaluation system that 'properly
rewards increased responsibility'.
It also proposes a higher basic rate of pay to subsume a range of allowances
introduced piecemeal over the years - including one for using closed-circuit
television; another for working in isolated areas, and others for working
irregular and unsocial hours. Railtrack points out that sick pay and
pensions, which are calculated on basic pay, would be improved.
The company also wants to simplify the pay structure. At present, signalling
staff have widely differing pay levels, including three kinds of shift
allowance. Railtrack proposes that signal-staff pay would consist of three
elements: a basic rate, a shift premium of up to 20 per cent of the basic
rate, and an 'additional-time payment' of up to 30 per cent of basic to
replace overtime.
Signalling grades would be paid monthly by credit transfer. A quarter of
staff are still paid weekly in cash, with security vans delivering wage
packets to the signal boxes.
Flexible rostering would replace the present fixed hours of work, giving
management 'freedom to roster turns of duty up to a 12-hour maximum limit'.
Sunday would be treated as part of the normal working week.
Signalling staff would be asked to do a range of tasks, which could include
controlling electronic control centres; dealing with equipment failures;
cleaning signal boxes; using portable data terminals; and operating
passenger information systems.
A computerised system would replace the ledgers in which signal staff now
write all train movements.
Railtrack estimates these changes would generate Pounds 4.3m in savings,
raising the basic pay of signalling staff by at least 16 per cent and giving
75 per cent of signal staff higher take-home pay.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, accused Railtrack of offering a 'pig
in a poke' with the 'uncertainties of job evaluation'. The union's
negotiators believe average earnings 'on Railtrack's own figures' would
bring a pay rise of only Pounds 4 a week.
The union insists that it is not its fault that the grievances of the
signalling staff had not been dealt with before. 'We have struggled to
negotiate a deal for them for weeks - if not years,' said Mr Knapp.
Both sides accept that the signalling staff have been a badly neglected and
uncomplaining group in the railway network. But the union is insisting on an
'up-front' payment for past productivity improvements, while Railtrack says
the only pay increases available are those on offer under its reform plans.
Mr Knapp said: 'The company appears to be negotiating on the basis that the
industrial world began on April 1 when the government gave birth to them.'
Rail travellers, business customers and Railtrack are now having to pay for
past neglect by a union that should have pressed the cause of signalling
staff more resolutely years ago, and by British Rail, which was too timid to
press for long-needed change in the way the signal staff work.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Service is stressed for mail sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday outlined a new regulatory framework for a
privatised Post Office. Its main function would be to guarantee services
rather than to stimulate competition.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, trade and industry minister, said the DTI expected to
win backbench support for privatisation with a regulatory structure aimed at
strengthening rural services and the uniform letter delivery.
At the centre of the regime would be a director-general for postal services
with a statutory obligation to ensure that the public was provided with a
comprehensive level of services.
Mr McLoughlin told a conference in London: 'There would be a legal
requirement for Royal Mail to carry out these services and on the regulator
to ensure they do so.
'This would represent a far greater level of protection for the Royal Mail's
customers than exists at present.'
In contrast to the role of some of the utility regulators, competition would
be a secondary issue for the regulator of a privatised Royal Mail, the Post
Office's letters division.
The need for 'some increased competition' was a secondary function.
Mr McLoughlin warned, however, that the DTI had little confidence in those
who argued for 'free competition' that would allow the most efficient
operator to exploit economies of scale.
He said more competition would ensue from reducing the Post Office's
monopoly on letters costing less than Pounds 1 to send and extending the
range of discounts to customers who pre-sorted their mail.
The DTI hopes to publish its green paper setting out the options for change
in the next fortnight.
Mr McLoughlin said a partial or 100 per cent sale of shares in the Royal
Mail and Parcelforce 'represents the best way forward'.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, was recently forced to
give the option of commercialisation in the public sector greater emphasis
in the green paper. Mr McLoughlin questioned this option, asking how the
government could prevent a public-sector Post Office from exploiting its
letter monopoly or from cross-subsidising its products.
Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive of the Post Office, said he was 'deeply
sceptical' that the option of more commercialisation in the public sector
would work.
He warned that the only way to protect services to customers was by radical
change.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Insurance prices fall as profits increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The price of motor and home insurance is beginning to fall as the industry
returns to profitability, the Association of British Insurers said
yesterday.
'Some policyholders have already benefited from rate reductions as
competition within the industry remains strong,' said Mr Allan Bridgewater,
chairman.
Rates in the motor insurance market fell an average of 5 per cent during in
the year to 1 April, according to the association. No comparable figures
were available for home insurance, although some policyholders had benefited
from premium cuts of up to 20 per cent.
Rates increased sharply in 1991 and 1992 after insurers were hit by record
losses from storms, subsidence and recession-related claims.
Last year the industry returned to the black, achieving a profit of Pounds
1.9bn, equal to 5.4 per cent of its premium income compared with a loss of
2.7 per cent in 1992. An underwriting profit equal to 1 per cent of premiums
was achieved in motor insurance.
The turnaround has resulted from reduced operating costs, lower claims in
some areas of business, and the impact of premium rate rises.
Mr Bridgewater warned, however, that the industry needed to be more careful
in placing too much importance on capital gains and investment income during
a period of very low inflation and lower returns as a result of falling
interest rates. Separately Mr Bridgewater said he was sure the insurance
industry would 'do everything possible' to make a success of the Personal
Investment Authority, the new watchdog intended to protect the private
investor.
The formal recognition of the PIA by the Securities and Investments Board,
the chief City regulator, is expected in the next few days, paving the way
for the watchdog to become operational.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Workers on second Severn crossing to be reinstated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seven hundred construction workers on the second Severn crossing, who were
sacked last Thursday for staging a 24-hour strike, are to be reinstated.
Laing-GTM, the main contractor for the Pounds 300m crossing between England
and Wales, said last night that it had offered to re-engage all the
dismissed employees without loss of continuity of service. In return, the
unions agreed to suspend industrial action.
Work on the bridge is expected to start again on Monday. Nearly half the
sacked workers have already left the Severn area in search of other jobs and
have to be contacted.
The agreement came after a further day of talks between the management and
Ucatt, the construction union, and the TGWU and GMB general unions. Last
week's strike followed a ballot in favour of limited action in pursuit of
higher bonus payments. Laing-GTM said the terms and conditions of employment
had been agreed by management and unions and it dismissed the men for breach
of contract.
Both sides yesterday agreed a statement that, on the resumption of work,
they would undertake 'immediate discussions on matters of mutual concern to
establish a firm framework for future good working relations'.
It is understood the men will be re-employed under their old terms and
conditions and that the issue of guaranteed bonus payments will not be part
of the immediate discussions.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Concern on nuclear waste dump 'leaks': Advisers warn of
dangers from water flows at Sellafield underground site
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's first underground nuclear waste dump might have to be strengthened
to prevent radiation leaks to the surface if it is built deep below the
Cumbrian mountains, a government advisory committee warned yesterday.
Scientific investigations into the flows of water in the rocks underneath
Sellafield suggest that water may flow upwards through the proposed site,
according to the Radio-active Waste Management Advisory Committee.
Sir John Knill, the committee's chairman, said that if further research
'demonstrated flows to the surface it would put greater reliance on the
physical and chemical containment' of the radioactive waste to be buried.
The warnings, contained in the committee's 60-page annual report, published
yesterday, come as debate grows over the options for disposing of the UK's
nuclear waste.
Next month the government is due to publish a consultation paper on
radioactive waste disposal, in parallel with the review of the future of
nuclear power now under way.
Mr Tom Curtin of Nirex UK, the nuclear industry company with the task of
finding a site for the store, said yesterday that the past year's research
had left it 'more confident, not less' that Sellafield would eventually
prove suitable.
At present the UK's nuclear waste is stored above ground.
Sir John said that within 'a small number of years, although not immediately
. . . the storage issue will be critical'.
The underground site, which would hold waste of low and intermediate levels
of radioactivity, would be sealed for tens of thousands of years until the
radioactivity had diminished to safe levels.
High-level waste would continue to be stored on the surface where it could
be examined. Plans for the store have been politically and scientifically
controversial, however, and Nirex has repeatedly extended its timescale.
The advisory committee said yesterday that Nirex's latest target of the year
2010 for completion was the most realistic yet, but that it assumed
regulators did not want further tests.
Environmentalists are concerned that radioactivity will leak from the store
into the water table.
Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, which yesterday published its own
74-page report into the proposed store, called on nuclear companies to
repackage waste so that it could be stored for longer at its existing sites.
This, it says, would allow more time to investigate the underground store.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Jobseeker benefit deal 'a shambles'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The departments of employment and social security have reached a compromise
over the administration of the new Jobseeker's Allowance.
After months of wrangling it was announced yesterday that the allowance will
be jointly operated by the Employment Service, a Department of Employment
agency; and the Benefits Agency, which comes under the social security
department. Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the Commons social security
committee, attacked the deal as a 'shambles' and 'the worst of all possible
fudges'.
The announcement, which unions warned could result in at least 3,000 job
losses, ends weeks of speculation over which department would take
responsibility for the new benefit, which replaces unemployment benefit.
Under the deal, the Employment Service will be responsible for advice and
tests such as availability for work. Financial aspects, including the
calculation and payment of the benefit, will be the responsibility of the
Benefits Agency.
It had been feared that the transfer of the allowance to the DSS might have
weakened the employment department at a time when its future as an
independent department is under discussion.
Mr Field said the arrangement 'couldn't be more unsatisfactory'. It would
have been better, he said, if one department had disbursed all benefits and
at the same time had been responsible for running the job clubs, which are
government-run centres for job seekers.
The allowance, to be introduced in April 1996, will be paid for only six
months, compared with the one year for unemployment benefit. Subsequent
benefits will be means-tested and there will be a greater obligation upon
the individual to seek work.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said the reorganisation
of services for the unemployed was 'wrong in principle and damaging in
practice'.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Labour left seeks ways to block election of Blair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair's runaway lead in Labour's leadership election has prompted an
attempt to forge a broad-left coalition against the party's dominant
modernisers.
The hard-left Campaign group and leftwing members of the largely moderate
Tribune group have called a meeting to discuss ways of blocking Mr Blair,
the shadow home secretary.
Leftwing MPs said the weekend meeting, organised by the Tribune newspaper,
would be the 'biggest and most ecumenical' gathering of the Labour left for
years.
The meeting will be attended by senior trade unionists, including critics of
the modernisers such as Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union,
and Ms Margaret Prosser, national organiser of the TGWU.
Speakers will include Mr John Prescott, who is contesting both the
leadership and deputy leadership on a traditional socialist platform, and
prominent supporters of Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader.
Mrs Beckett, whose support is mainly on the hard left, will be attending a
conference of European socialist leaders in Corfu.
A moderate leftwinger said: 'There is a feeling that the left has been very
weak, and that it needs to get together and discuss its policies and
organise together. The leadership contest has provided a trigger for that.'
Serious contacts between Campaign and leftwing Tribunites started in
November, when modernist supporters of Mr Blair blocked the election of two
leftwingers as officers of the Tribune group.
The contacts were accelerated after the publication of nominations for the
leadership, which showed that three-quarters of Tribune mem-bers and five of
the group's six officers backed Mr Blair.
Leftwing members of Tribune, who until recently formed a majority, say the
group has abandoned its traditional role as the main guardian of the party's
socialist values.
They have also been encouraged to seek an alliance with the hard left by the
election of two younger MPs - Mr Malcolm Chisholm and Mr Alan Simpson - as
Campaign's chairman and secretary.
The change of leadership is said to have freed Campaign from the ideological
baggage bequeathed by influential older MPs such as Mr Tony Benn and Mr
Dennis Skinner.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Gooda underwriter 'hid from facts'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former underwriter of the loss-making Gooda Walker syndicates failed to
measure adequately his exposure to potential loss, it was alleged yesterday
in the High Court.
The criticism came in the 20th day of a civil action by 3,095 Lloyd's Names,
the individuals whose wealth supports the insurance market, who are suing
their agents to recover losses of more than Pounds 600m.
Their syndicates were swamped by losses from disasters between 1988 and
1990, including the explosion aboard the Piper Alpha oil platform in the
North Sea and Hurricane Hugo in the Caribbean.
Mr Ulrich von Eicken, appearing as an expert witness for the Names,
dismissed claims by Mr Stanley Andrews, underwriter for syndicate 298, that
the scale of the Piper Alpha oil platform loss was unimaginable. He said
this was 'simply hiding yourself from the facts'.
Mr von Eicken is a former executive with Munich Re, one of the world's
biggest reinsurance companies.
He told the court that Gooda Walker underwriters were wrong to base their
business on the assumption that they would be hit by no catastrophic losses.
'If you are in the catastrophe business you can't possibly base your
activities on there not being a catastrophe,' he said.
Mr Andrews, whose syndicate lost heavily after the disaster, told the court
last week that: 'We never honestly thought that the loss of Piper Alpha
could actually ever occur.'
Mr Andrews' system for measuring his aggregate exposures was 'thoroughly
inadequate', added Mr von Eicken.
Earlier Mr Jonathan Gaisman QC, cross examining Mr Andrews, said Lloyd's
agents had alleged the underwriter 'did not have a clue about what he is
underwriting' and 'did not inspire any confidence whatsoever'.
Other documents cited by Mr Gaisman show that Mr Andrews believed his
syndicate would break even in its 1988 account, months after the Piper loss.
According to the documents, one agent, reporting a meeting with Mr Tony
Gooda, chairman of the Gooda and Partners members' agency, said: 'I asked
whether it was incompetence or the fact that he was pulling the wool over
our eyes. Mr Gooda said regrettably that it was due to incompetence, and
that he and the board were also partly to blame.'
Another agent knew of the scale of Mr Andrews' Piper losses months in
advance of the underwriter.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Henderson to appear at Scott inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paul Henderson, the former Matrix Churchill managing director, is to give
oral evidence to the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry, it was announced
yesterday.
Mr Henderson, one of three Matrix Churchill directors cleared of the illegal
export of machine tools to Iraq, had asked to give oral evidence after
statements made to the inquiry by Lord Trefgarne, one of three
middle-ranking ministers involved in the alleged relaxation of guidelines
for such exports.
He will give evidence on the points raised by the former minister.
Mr Christopher Muttukumaru, the secretary to the inquiry, said Lord Justice
Scott had also obtained evidence of Mr Henderson's contacts with the
intelligence services.
Mr Henderson would be questioned on some aspects of these contacts, he said.
This part of his evidence would be heard in private at Mr Henderson's
request, he said.
Mr Muttukumaru said Mr Henderson had helped the inquiry from a very early
stage, answering questions and providing written evidence.
Mr Henderson is expected to give his evidence on July 7.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Ashdown moves to attract support from business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown last night tried to woo support from British business by
underlining his party's support for a single European currency in a speech
to a Confederation of British Industry dinner in London.
Mr Ashdown said that only the Liberal Democrats among mainstream British
political parties argued that 'if and when' a single currency emerged in the
Europe Union, there was 'no viable future for Britain outside of it'.
Attempting to set out a distinctive Liberal Democrat approach to economic
policy, he said that only his party had consistently advocated operational
independence for the Bank of England. An independent central bank was 'the
cornerstone of an economic policy based on low inflation'.
Making no reference to the party's rejection of Britain's so-called 'opt
out' from Maastricht's social chapter, Mr Ashdown highlighted its opposition
to a national minimum wage - as advocated by Labour.
He said this opposition would be reinforced if such a wage operated 'at the
levels set in countries like France'.
On small business, he said the party supported legislation to tackle the
problem of late commercial debt. The average company was now owed Pounds
145,000 in late debt, he said. 'We have long argued that small businesses
deserve much stronger support from government.'
Mr Ashdown - who is also expected to address the CBI annual conference this
autumn - took pains to differentiate Liberal Democrat policy on full
employment from Labour.
'Unlike Labour we do not promise to deliver full employment,' he said.
'Instead we pursue the goal of full employability.'

FT  22 JUN 94 / Major under pressure to bring forward cabinet reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke emerged last night at the centre of a cabinet struggle
over the shape of the government's legislative programme as Mr John Major
faced pressure to bring forward from mid-July his planned cabinet reshuffle.
Warnings from ministers that Whitehall decision-making has been paralysed by
uncertainty over the reshuffle prompted speculation at Westminster that Mr
Major might move to reshape the government as early as next week.
Senior officials said mid-July - closer to the summer parliamentary recess -
was still the favoured option. But they refused to rule out entirely the
possibility that it might be sooner. Ministers said the uncertainty had
added further confusion to the struggle within the cabinet between so-called
consolidators and radicals over the legislative programme for next year.
Mr Clarke, the chancellor, is waging a battle against the consolidators'
attempts to limit the number of contentious bills in the Queen's Speech.
Apart from giving determined backing to Mr Michael Heseltine's plans to
privatise the Royal Mail, Mr Clarke is pressing for a further raft of
privatisation measures.
The industrial dispute at Railtrack has strengthened the Treasury's resolve
to push the organisation into the private sector at the earliest possible
opportunity.
Mr Clarke is also pressing for legislation now to pave the way for the
eventual introduction of electronic pricing of motorway journeys. Such
charges could not be introduced until 1998 - but Mr Clarke believes early
legislation would be an important positive signal of the government's
resolve to control public spending and borrowing.
Friends say his overall approach is based on the belief that the
government's political fortunes can only be revived if it demonstrates it is
'firm and purposeful'.
A clutch of privatisation and other economic measures - including the
introduction of the Jobseeker's Allowance for the unemployed - would allow
the government to make improved competitiveness the central theme of the
Queen's Speech.
But Mr Major has been joined by a series of other senior ministers in
arguing for a much more cautious approach. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, is among those pressing for the cabinet to put competence before
ideology.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Amish drive horse and buggy through health insurance plan:
Self-sufficient sect is exempted from Clinton scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the back rooms of Congress, a small and soft-spoken group has moved
quietly to knock a small hole in President Bill Clinton's promise of
universal guaranteed health insurance, winning itself an exemption from any
US healthcare reform bill.
The Amish, an Anabaptist sect which has tried to remain separate from the
modern world and whose descendants continue to shun 20th-century
conveniences such as cars and electricity, persuaded the House of
Representatives ways and means committee to allow them to opt out of
universal health coverage on religious grounds.
Mutual help is a strong tradition among the Amish. When a member of the
community loses his barn in a fire, the neighbours gather to build a new one
 -a scene that became familiar to filmgoers in the thriller Witness,
starring Harrison Ford, part of which is set in the Amish country of
Pennsylvania.
'One of the most basic tenets is that they don't believe in public or
private insurance because they believe that it breaks down the community,'
says Mr Mark Weller, a spokesman for a coalition of businesses that employ
Amish, which has led the effort to win the religious exemption.
The Amish came to the US, in search of religious freedom, in the middle of
the 18th century, and in a second wave in the early 19th century.
About 130,000 now live in 22 states and in Canada, although the population
is mostly concentrated in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana.
In some areas, such as Pennsylvania's Lancaster, the black-clad Amish in
their horse-drawn carriages have become a popular tourist attraction.
While the core of the Amish tradition is farming, farmland is scarce and
Amish families are often large, so many members now work outside their
community.
Many are employed in Indiana building the sort of motor-powered recreational
vehicles and camper vans that their own customs would not allow them to
drive.
The exemption agreed by the ways and means committee, which is closely
modelled on a similar exclusion from the social security pension system,
would also cover the Mennonites, who have a similar religious objection to
insurance.
Advocates note, however, that it would not include religious groups who
reject medical treatment of any kind.
The Amish do, in fact, visit doctors, and have even been able to negotiate
substantial discounts from hospitals because, when a member is ill, the
community pays in cash and in advance.
Few Amish take part in the political process, although they have won
exemptions from social security, state unemployment insurance and hard-hat
regulations, as well as from the requirement to send their children to
school after the age of 14.
The lobbying for the health insurance exemption was largely carried out by
their employers - who stand to benefit if they can also win exemption from
the obligation to pay the employer's premium envisaged in the Clinton reform
plan.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Weak dollar complicates Greenspan's task: Michael Prowse on
market-created tensions on the eve of Fed chairman's House testimony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, faces an unusually
difficult challenge in today's testimony before the House of Representatives
budget committee.
Gobal financial markets will be looking for signals that the Fed is willing
to take tough measures to defend the dollar, which has plunged on foreign
exchange markets in recent days. Many investors believe the Fed must tighten
monetary policy another notch and lead another round of global intervention
to support the US currency.
Yet Mr Greenspan's Capitol Hill audience will not be greatly concerned that
the dollar has fallen through key support levels against the yen and D-Mark.
Legislators worry about domestic growth and jobs; they care about dollar
weakness only to the extent that it pushes up long bond yields and thus
threatens to depress US economic activity. Many are still not convinced the
increases in short-term interest rates announced earlier this year were
necessary, and worry that the tighter policy is already retarding growth.
The views of senior administration officials fall somewhere between these
two extremes. They certainly want to avoid a dollar free fall, yet they see
no reason why domestic US economic policy should be dictated by fleeting
shifts of mood in global financial markets.
But for the turmoil in markets, US policymakers would probably feel fairly
relaxed. Most forecasters believe the underlying pace of economic growth is
moderating from an annual rate of about 5 per cent in the second half of
last year to a more sustainable 3 to 3.5 per cent. Some believe growth could
slow to an annual rate of 2 to 3 per cent in the second half of this year,
in line with the economy's long-run potential.
At the same time, despite increases in commodity prices, there is little
hard evidence of strong upward pressure on inflation. The administration
view is that nearly all components of demand point to more moderate growth.
Consumer spending must decelerate because consumption outpaced personal
incomes last year, sharply depressing the savings rate. Housing will provide
less of a boost because the sharp increase in mortgage rates since February
is reducing consumer demand.
Growth of business investment will remain healthy but must moderate somewhat
since spending on information processing equipment cannot grow at
double-digit rates indefinitely. Government spending will remain weak,
reflecting continuing efforts to reduce the federal deficit.
Net exports are likely to remain an economic drag at least until early next
year because the US is still growing more rapidly than most of its trading
partners.
Several recent reports appeared to support this comforting prognosis of
steady, but not worryingly rapid growth. Retail sales fell in April and May.
Housing starts have failed to regain last year's peaks. Growth of industrial
production has slowed sharply. Figures yesterday showed a decline in exports
in April and an increase in the trade deficit.
But administration officials admit the economic picture is blurred. The
jobless rate has fallen far more rapidly than anybody expected - to 6 per
cent in May against 7 per cent in December. This puts it at or below most
estimates of the natural or 'non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment
(Nairu)'.
In the late 1980s inflation began to rise quite rapidly once unemployment
fell below the Nairu. But officials say the data may be misleading because
the way unemployment is measured has recently been changed.
Since payroll employment is also growing rapidly, estimates of output based
on projections of hours worked and productivity point to much faster growth
than suggested by the spending data. Hours worked, for example, point to
real growth at an annual rate of 6 to 7 per cent in the second quarter, more
than double the pace indicated by expenditure estimates.
On domestic grounds, Mr Greenspan probably regards further increases in
short-term rates as desirable but not yet an urgent priority. He is probably
less confident than the administration that growth is slowing to a
sustainable pace and more worried about the inflation outlook: producer
prices, for example, rose at an annual rate of more than 3 per cent in the
first five months, a sharp acceleration from last year. Leading indicators
suggest consumer price inflation could rise this autumn.
The dollar's weakness, however, complicates matters. Last month, the
Treasury signalled that it cared about the dollar's absolute value, not just
its rate of change against other currencies. It wanted to do more, in short,
than maintain 'orderly' conditions in currency markets.
Yet on a longer view, the administration believes that currencies must
reflect economic fundamentals, including differences in relative inflation
rates. It may thus feel ambivalent about defending any particular nominal
exchange rate for fear this would provide a one-way bet for speculators -
rather as Britain did when it tried to maintain an unrealistic parity
against the D-Mark.
History suggests US policy will be geared mainly to the needs of the
domestic economy. Mixed signals on growth and inflation suggest the Fed will
raise short-term rates again but perhaps not as aggressively as demanded by
some global investors. The Treasury and Fed will try to keep currency
markets off balance by intervening to support the dollar when least
expected.
But while anxious to prevent erratic currency shifts, it is not yet clear
that US officials put the same priority on exchange rate stability as their
colleagues in more open, and thus more vulnerable, European economies.

FT  22 JUN 94 / US trade deficit up as exports decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US trade deficit rose sharply in April to Dollars 8.4bn (Pounds 5.5bn)
against a revised Dollars 6.9bn in March, official figures indicated
yesterday, putting additional downward pressure on the US dollar in foreign
exchange markets, Michael Prowse writes from Washington.
The rise in the deficit was larger than most economists expected and mainly
reflected a 3.3 per cent decline in exports from March to Dollars 56.2bn.
Imports fell slightly to Dollars 64.6bn. Part of the weakness in exports,
however, reflected an erratic decline in exports of gold bullion.
The figures pointed to a widening gap in the trade performance of goods and
services. The deficit on goods rose to Dollars 13.3bn against Dollars 11.5bn
in March. The surplus on services rose to Dollars 4.9bn against Dollars
4.6bn.
The overall deficit for the first four months was Dollars 32.7bn against
Dollars 20.8bn last year, indicating a deterioration in the US's external
position. The deficit on goods so far is Dollars 50.2bn, indicating the US
is heading for its worst showing on merchandise trade since 1987 when it
exceeded Dollars 152bn.
The poor figures, however, mainly reflect faster economic growth in the US
than in other leading economies, rather than a loss of US competitiveness.
The deficit may thus decline once Europe and Japan emerge fully from
recession.

FT  22 JUN 94 / N-waste row to be taken to court
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The decade-old quandary over what to do with the US's nuclear waste has
erupted into legal controversy. A coalition of utilities and state power
regulators has filed a suit accusing the federal Department of Energy of
defaulting on its promise to take spent fuel.
The suit contends that the Energy Department has collected nearly Dollars
10bn (Pounds 6.5bn) in fees from nuclear power generators under the 1982
Nuclear Waste Policy Act, but is now backing off the act's requirement that
it start collecting spent nuclear fuel in 1998.
The Energy Department said the suit was 'unfortunate, since we are in the
middle of a formal public process to address these concerns'.
The search for a permanent nuclear waste dump has dragged on for years with
little discernible progress, and the energy department says its proposed
central waste dump at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, will not be ready until 2010
at the earliest.
Under the 1982 law and additional legislation passed in 1987, the federal
government would have to pay Nevada for accepting the spent fuel at Yucca
Mountain, but Nevada would in turn have to give up its right to veto the
site, which it has not done.
But many nuclear power plants, which were built with limited storage
facilities on the assumption that their spent fuel would be reprocessed or
stored elsewhere, are fast running out of room.
The Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry grouping, estimates that 23 plants
will have run out of spent fuel storage space by 1998, when the act foresaw
that the federal government would take over the responsibility for this
highly radioactive waste.
Ms Hazel O'Leary, energy secretary, argued last year that the federal
government was not obliged to take the spent fuel if it had no central
depository.

FT  22 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Niceness reigns in the heat of battle - Jurek
Martin in Washington finds plenty to cheer about as the tournament gets into
its stride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It won't last, of course. Somewhere, somehow, soccer must beget mayhem
because that it is the natural order of things. But it has not happened so
far. Over the first five days, 11 matches in nine cities produced only
sweetness and light, on the field and off it.
First, the players are being nice to other players from other teams. Only
two have been sent off, one a Bolivian substitute who clearly wandered on
the field by mistake for three minutes thinking he was playing in the last
World Cup - and even then the referee's judgment seemed a little harsh.
Next, the fans are being nice to each other. Even the Dutch, more boorishly
English than most, contained themselves after their victory over Saudi
Arabia here on Monday night, perhaps because they realised they were a
little lucky to get a win at all. Their orange-clad masses made a lot of
racket compared with the Saudis, but doubtless the 50 princes present would
have frowned on unseemly behaviour.
Finally, the great American watching public, both the couch potatoes seeking
relief from the heat and inexorably drawn to the OJ Simpson drama played out
live, as well as those at matches, seemed quite beguiled by it all. In the
TV ratings on Saturday afternoon, Italy against Ireland outdrew the US Open
golf, even though Nicklaus and Watson, two American icons, were contending
for the lead.
The on-field vignette that most caught the spirit featured Jostein Flo and
Jorge Campo. Flo is a very tall Norwegian striker, Campo a very short
Mexican goalkeeper who compensates by wearing a jersey and shorts that would
make a psychedelic Sumatran parrot look dowdy.
Flo, sensibly playing to his advantage, spent most of the first half
climbing all over Campo, who frequently ended up on the turf. The Hungarian
referee, who had obviously been reading up on the importance of Nafta,
considered this an unfair trade in bodies and repeatedly blew his whistle,
though objective observers thought Flo was a little hard done by.
But, as they waited for a corner kick in the second half, their tongues
hanging out in the stifling 96' heat, there was Campo handing Flo a water
bottle, not laced, as far as can be told, with tequila or jalapeno peppers.
Moreover, Flo did not throw it back at him but politely returned it. They
might even have smiled if they had had energy left to spare for lip
movements.
It was much the same in the Saudi-Dutch match. The sons of the desert kept
offering a hand to any cloggie they had just hacked down, which they managed
frequently and with enthusiasm. This unnerved the Dutch at first, who tended
to treat any fallen Saudi with suspicion, largely because the Saudis fell
often and with a dramatic effect that suggests that their latest South
American coach had been reading Lawrence of Arabia rather than the Koran.
But, in the end, the Dutch became positively benign, too.
Even the Russians, beaten far worse by Brazil than the 2-0 score implied,
contained themselves, though they conceded the only penalty, the first
awarded before Greece's yesterday. Not that there were many sympathetic
Russian supporters out at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto to egg them on to
dirty deeds. The few ancient and hardy Sovietologists from the Hoover
Institution were easily outnumbered by the Brazilian press corps alone, most
of whom spent their time getting Pele's autograph.
A contributory factor may be the referees. This is not because they have
been calling games tight amd flashing yellow cards at the hint of a nudge.
The more likely answer is that their authority has been enhanced by new
uniforms. No longer garbed in sinister black, the refs now sport a rather
gorgeous mauveish-purple, uncannily similar in hue to that of a Church of
England bishop, though flashier.
Fan contentedness also matters. Washington has been a sea of celebrants,
driving round in cavalcades and making polite merry in Georgetown's bars.
Norwegians did not impale Mexican sombreros on horned helmets after their
Sunday victory. A local Catholic priest urged his constituents on the
morning after the loss to Ireland to pray for the Italian team rather than
to make Norway an offer it could not refuse before tomorrow's match in New
York.
US media coverage has also been conspicuously helpful to the uninitiated.
Where US sporting jargon has been introduced into commentaries, it has
tended to enlighten, not confuse. Thus, from ice hockey, comes the
expression that a goalkeeper was beaten 'on the high side,' and from
baseball that a player 'steps up to the plate' to take a free kick. Less
felicitous is the word 'rejected' for any kick into touch, because a blocked
shot in basketball is one of the game's high points.
But US broadcasters have also adapted and begun to speak of draws, not 'tied
games,' and of one-nil, not one-zero. The absence of commercial
interruptions has been an unmixed blessing, though the commercials that
dominate half-time and the pre- and post-game shows do not speak much for
the creative talent and knowledge of soccer of the American advertising
industry.
US mania with sporting statistics, in which simple soccer is fundamentally
deficient, sits less easily. After each quarter of a basketball game, the
press boxes are provided with minute detail about every shot, pass, assist
and foul. So, after half-time here, sheets are issued with no less than 16
statistical categories, including the number of times the ball has been
headed, by whom and in what part of the field. The foreign hacks crumple
them quickly.
But, in the end, it is the matches themselves which have most entertained.
Even if goals have not come by the glut, all games have been competitive,
except Brazil-Russia and Argentina-Greece. Some favoured teams - Italy,
Colombia, Spain, Mexico - have been found wanting at the first hurdle. The
gap between the touted and the unsung has not appeared that great.
Saudi Arabia, indeed, could - though not should - have beaten Holland. Fuad
Amin's first-half header was a deliciously clinical piece of work and not
the only example of his eye for the goal. For the 45 minutes he played,
Majed Abdullah, the 'Desert Pele,' gave Koeman and van Goebbel in the Dutch
defence fits, as did his replacement, Falatah, and Owairan.
It took a mighty strike by Wim Jonk and an 87th-minute error by the
previously excellent Al Deayea in the Saudi goal - a weak punch gave Taument
a header into an open net - to bring Holland through. The Saudis did tire
badly in the last 20 minutes, but their worst fears of humiliation were
easily avoided. After the game, faithful retainers handing out information
leaflets about the Kingdom even found some takers.
For what it is worth at this early stage, and with only Nigeria of the
fancied sides still to play their first games later yesterday, Brazil and
Germany (though not at their best in beating Bolivia) still look the cream
of the crop. In their respective ways, Ireland, Holland and Norway have
shown they will be no easy marks.
Today's match between the US and Colombia looms as the next biggie. The US
did not impress in drawing with Switzerland, but Colombia, picked by no less
than Pele to win it all, were simply awful in losing 3-1 to Romania. If
Colombia recover form and score the goals they now need, US progress into
the second round will be doubtful, and so will domestic interest in the
competition.
Or so conventional wisdom has it, but it could be wrong. If the World Cup
continues to overflow with its present spirit, the national hangover may
endure.

FT  22 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Goalkeepers caught by high-tech ball
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Already, World Cup goalkeepers are winning - and losing - matches. Michel
Preud'homme of Belgium, Romania's Bogdan Stelea and Ireland's Packie Bonner
starred in their sides' opening games. But when it comes to Colombia's Oscar
Cordoba or Carlos Trucco of Bolivia - don't ask.
However, Preud'homme has criticised the World Cup's new Questra ball, from
adidas. While it helps the forwards, the lighter, swifter Questra ball makes
goalkeeping even trickier.
Referring to Georghe Hagi's second goal for Romania in their 3-1 win against
Colombia, Preud'homme said: 'The ball curls early on and suddenly it stops.'
'If it starts that way, it has to continue that way,' he said, complaining
of inexplicable deviations in the ball's flight.
Cordoba concurred. 'The flight of the ball fooled me,' he said, refusing to
take full blame for Colombia's loss. 'I don't think I can be considered
(solely) responsible. The team has always celebrated success together. Why
not defeat?'
The authorities wanted to encourage goal-scoring, so the new ball has a
glossier surface that cuts air resistance, allowing it to travel up to 15
per cent faster.
It is made of five separate materials, including a new polyethelene foam;
when combined, says adidas, they 'provide high energy-return properties,
strength, durability and control.' The Questra was developed at adidas
ball-research facilities in France, and field-tested in France and Germany.

FT  22 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Maradona shows glimpses of old skill against
Greece
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Maradona lives: at least Argentina's flawed 33-year-old glory thrived
against an outclassed Greece, scoring a goal and playing all but the last
seven minutes in his team's 4-0 win at Foxboro Stadium, Massachusetts.
He was not the Argentina star of the day. That honour belonged to Gabriel
(the archangel) Batistuta, who achieved the World Cup's first hat-trick - a
second-minute poke through the Greek goalkeeper's legs, a 43rd-minute right
foot blast from 18 yards and an injury time penalty after a hand-ball
offence.
But there was no sneezing at Maradona's goal, a precise and opportunistic
left-foot shot from the edge of the penalty area that squeezed inside
Minou's right-hand goalpost.
He spent much of the first half on the turf, victim of close Greek marking
and his own theatrics, while Batistuta and Caniggia - another Argentine
coming off suspension for narcotics abuse - made most of the one-way
running. But, after the break, as Greece became tired and disheartened,
there were glimpses of the old surging Maradona runs and flicks.
Still, the Greeks were ancient, in the calendar sense, and it remains open
whether Maradona, playing in his fourth World Cup, can match the pace and
toughness of the Nigerians and Bulgarians in Argentina's remaining first
round matches.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Mexico rebel chief warns of civil war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sub-comandante Marcos, the Zapatista rebel leader in the state of Chiapas,
has warned of an imminent civil war in Mexico unless there is a 'democratic
transition', according to an interview in La Jornada newspaper.
Without offering any evidence, Marcos claimed that armed groups across
Mexico were ready to rise up against the government if there was not a
democratic opening, and that there would be 'war not between two armies but
between many armies'.
The rebel leader's comments appear intended to destabilise the political
system before the August presidential election, and boost his own
importance. As such they represent a further hardening of the Zapatistas'
rhetoric since they turned down the government offer of peace 10 days ago.
The government has refused to negotiate national political issues with the
Zapatistas, although many of the rebel demands for democratic reforms have
been met indirectly. Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the candidate of the ruling party,
has openly criticised Marcos, saying on television that a 'minority group
cannot impose its will' on the rest of the country.
The kidnappers of Mr Alfredo Harp Helu, joint head of Banamex-Accival,
Mexico's largest bank, have threatened to kill him unless his son, his
lawyer, and a representative of the Catholic church appear by tomorrow on
Mexico's main television news programme and agree to pay the ransom. Mr Harp
Helu, one of Mexico's wealthiest men, was abducted in March.

FT  22 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: All at stake for Colombia and US
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Colombia's assistant coach Hernan Gomez said the team were more united than
ever, ahead of today's match against the US in Pasadena. Poor results in
their opening Group A matches mean that defeat today, for either, could seal
elimination.
The US drew 1-1 with Switzerland. If they lose to the South Americans, their
place in the second round would depend on winning big over Romania in their
last group match and hoping for other results to fall their way.
Defeat for the US would almost certainly mean a first-ever first-round
elimination for the host country.

Senior Irish government officials, in Boston on a state visit, are trying to
find World Cup tickets for 379 Irish fans whose arrangements with a British
travel firm have not worked out brilliantly.
The affected fans paid Dollars 1,800 each for Sportex packages that included
round-trip transportation to the US, flights between soccer venues in New
Jersey and Florida, and tickets.
'(Sportex) has given assurances to compensate or make good on their
commitments,' said Conor O'Riordan, the Irish counsul-general in Boston.
Balder Battu, the Sportex lawyer, refused to say what went wrong with the
two tours. 'This is the first time something like this has happened,' he

Argentina thrashed Greece 4-0 in their opening Group D game in Boston last
night.
Greece had a disastrous start to their first-ever World Cup finals match
going a goal behind after some slack marking in the second minute.
Maradona's goal on the hour recaptured his great days of 1986, when he led
Argentina to its last title. In the final minute, Greek defender Stratos
Apostolakis handled just inside the penalty area and Batistuta hit his third

FT  22 JUN 94 / Argentina miracle needs more foreign capital: Stephen Fidler
and John Barham on a threat to high-growth, low-inflation economic policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For three years, President Carlos Menem of Argentina and his economy
minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo, have looked like economic miracle workers.
Since 1990, when consumer prices rose by more than 2,300 per cent, they have
brought inflation down to single digits, with the figure for the year to
May, 3.4 per cent, the lowest in 41 years. But this has not been achieved at
the price of a recession - in fact, just the opposite: from 1991 to the end
of 1993, the Argentine economy expanded 25.5 per cent.
The medicine for this magic combination of low inflation and high growth has
been big inflows of foreign capital.
The government's fiscal rectitude, the settlement of its 1980s bank debt
defaults and Mr Cavallo's convertibility plan - which fixed by law the
Argentine peso at parity to the US dollar - have led to enthusiastic support
of the Argentine economy by foreign investors. An estimated Dollars 33.5bn
(Pounds 22bn) of capital flowed into the country in three years, more than
half - Dollars 17.6bn - entering last year.
This year, though, things look different. Since February 4, when the US
Federal Reserve raised interest rates, foreign investors have been stingier
and inflows to almost all emerging markets have slowed. In Argentina, where
the convertibility plan means there is a direct relation between capital
inflows and money supply, slower capital inflows mean slower growth.
As a result, Mr Miguel Angel Broda, who runs an economics consultancy in
Buenos Aires, expects growth to fall this year to 3.5 per cent, from 6 per
cent last year.
Yet slowing growth and dependence on volatile foreign capital are not the
only economic worries for Mr Menem, who is seeking, from a special assembly
now in session, a constitutional revision to let him seek re-election next
year.
Argentine trade sank further into deficit in the first four months of the
year - Dollars 2.4bn, against only Dollars 500m in the equivalent period of
1993 - providing grist for critics who say the peso is much overvalued.
Yet Mr Cavallo says he is unworried. Although the deficit is high in terms
of Argentina's trade - it has been running at more than half the level of
exports - it is small compared with the size of the economy. Even if the
deficit continues at this rate for the rest of the year, which is unlikely
because of higher crop prices from May, it will be equivalent to less than 3
per cent of GDP.
What's more, Mr Cavallo says, the figures also indicate a big jump in
capital goods imports, providing the base for a new export sector.
But economists say government statistics are inadequate and probably
overstate investment. Even Mr Cavallo recognises that investment, 18.4 per
cent of GDP last year, is too low, although he says it was 28 per cent
higher in the first quarter than a year earlier.
For more than a year, Mr Cavallo has promised measures to encourage domestic
saving - necessary to reduce dependence on capital inflows - and investment.
But the government's private pension fund plan has got off to a
disappointing start and, says Mr Rosendo Fraga, a political analyst, there
has been a paralysis in new structural economic reforms as Mr Menem has
manoeuvred for the chance of re-election.
The elections in April for the constituent assembly were also a setback,
with Mr Menem doing less well than he had hoped, and a strong showing by the
left being interpreted as an indicator of increasing concern about social
issues, such as poverty and rising unemployment.
Indeed, says Mr Broda, the overall strong economic indicators hide some
profound weaknesses. 'There are some provinces where GDP has fallen 25 per
cent in three years. There are geographical and sectoral distributions which
are very different to the overall picture.'
This has emphasised, says Mr Broda, 'that Menem is more dependent on Cavallo
and the performance of the economy'. It has also 'put the government on the
defensive. I don't think that, in the next year, they can advance the
reform.'
Yet, while developments such as riots last December in the provincial
capital of Santiago del Estero have given cause for concern, few observers
believe Argentina is on the verge of imminent social crisis.
Mr Broda says the government had pushed through 85 per cent of the necessary
reforms but that, without labour and social security reforms, 'you can't
guarantee that you aren't going to have problems.'
He and others believe there is a strong probability that capital flows will
be sufficient to maintain growth in positive figures until beyond the
presidential election, due to take place in the April-June period next year.
The government has some leeway to supplement those flows for the coming 12
months - for example, by selling its remaining stakes in privatised
companies. The sale of its shareholding in YPF, the privatised national oil
company in which the government retains 20 per cent, could raise close to
Dollars 2bn.
Yet this cushion will not last for ever. By next year, the government will
have run out of assets to privatise. Without growth in its capacity for
exports and in domestic savings, there will remain grave doubts about
Argentina's capacity, in the long run, to pay its way in the world.
Until these doubts are removed, the inexorable logic of the convertibility
plan means that a slowing of capital inflows will cause a deceleration of
the economy. The survival of the Argentine economic plan will then depend on
the willingness of Mr Menem - or of a successor - to tolerate recession.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The kidnappers of Mr Alfredo Harp Helu, joint head of Mexico's largest bank,
have threatened to kill him unless his family and partners agree to pay a
ransom by tomorrow, according to letters sent to Mexican newspapers.
Mr Harp Helu, the president of Banamex-Accival and one of Mexico's
wealthiest men, was abducted in March. His kidnapping sent Mexico's stock
market tumbling, and heightened concerns about political and social
instability this year.
The latest letter from the kidnappers, if authentic, contradicts recent
reports that the family of Mr Harp Helu had already agreed to pay a ransom.
The kidnappers wrote that his representatives had refused last Monday to pay
the ransom demand, reduced from an initial Dollars 90m (Pounds 59.2m) to a
reported Dollars 60m.
The kidnappers promised to kill the captive financier unless his son, his
lawyer and a representative of the Catholic Church appear on Mexico's main
TV news programme and declare their willingness to pay the ransom, and agree
not to involve the police.

<TEXT>
Recent tensions and China's economic woes were reflected in May orders for
Taiwan's exports to Hong Kong, which dropped 16.4 per cent from the April
level, but climbed 9.3 per cent year-on-year, writes Laura Tyson in Taipei.
Most of Taiwan's exports to Hong Kong are re-exported to China.
Taiwan's total export orders last month were Dollars 7.77bn, down 0.5 per
cent from April but up 4.1 per cent from May 1993, the economics ministry
said yesterday. Jan-May export orders were Dollars 36.86bn, up 4.4 per cent
from the equivalent period last year. Orders received from the US, Taiwan's
biggest market, were Dollars 2.99bn in May, up 9.4 per cent from April and
4.6 per cent from a year earlier. For Jan-May, orders from the US were up
2.9 per cent from the same period in 1993.
China, via Hong Kong, is Taiwan's fastest-growing export market with 17.2
per cent of May orders.

<TEXT>
Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, yesterday reported a decline in US
merchandise exports for last month, writes Our Foreign Staff.
Noting that the US trade position had deteriorated in every major foreign
market area except Latin America, he cited lower shipments of non-monetary
gold as a big factor in last month's decline. Analysts have attributed the
trend to business cycle factors. The secretary said the US trade balance in
services, led by travel expenditures, improved last month while the deficit
in goods deteriorated.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the member of the European Union Commission
responsible for broadcasting, said that the EU would convene a conference to
consider proposed changes in the broadcast directive. He promised that these
would not be anti-US and that quotas would not be tightened, writes Nancy
Dunne in Washington.
The 1989 broadcasting directive has been at the centre of a long row between
the US and EU. It requires EU-based television channels to allot at least
half their broadcasting time to European-made programmes, not including
news, sport, games or advertising. Washington is also unhappy about
subsidies for European film-makers, especially as US films contribute much
of the funding through a levy on cinema shows. However, the European
audiovisual industry believes the support is essential to counter
competition by cheap US imports.
Mr Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America,
said he was encouraged by signs that the European industry might be willing
to compromise.

FT  22 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Relief in sight on high petrol prices -
Michiyo Nakamoto on moves to liberalise Japan's oil imports and pursue
deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At a glance, there is nothing unusual about the petrol stand just off the
Komaki interchange, about 200 miles west of Tokyo.
But the price of Y100 (63p) a litre at which Kanare Beikoku sells its petrol
is about 20 per cent cheaper than the norm and the service station has
attracted six to seven times as much business as the average station in
Japan.
Kanare's bold pricing strategy, which has earned it the wrath of the oil
industry, highlights the high price Japanese consumers pay for petrol.
Japanese petrol, at an average of Y121 a litre in May, is about four times
the price of petrol in the US and 20 per cent more than in France or
Germany.
There are expectations that a report on oil policy published this week will
put the government on track to liberalise imports by March 1996 and bring
Japanese petrol prices in line with those in other industrialised countries.
The report calls for the abolition of a law restricting imports of petrol,
kerosene and diesel to oil companies with the capacity to refine, upgrade
and store these products. The law, it notes, has widened the gap between
petrol prices in Japan and other industrialised countries.
With growing calls by politicians and business leaders for the industry to
be deregulated to help stimulate the economy, the high price of gasoline has
become symbolic of the burden Japanese consumers bear as a result of tight
bureaucratic regulation.
Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the powerful business organisation, the
Keidanren, expressed support for abolition of the law. In a meeting with Mr
Tsutumo Hata, the prime minister, Mr Toyoda suggested that regulations
prohibiting self-service petrol stations be lifted to lower petrol prices, a
proposal welcomed by Mr Hata.
At most Japanese service stations cars are welcomed by a host of attendants
who direct the car into the premises, fill the tank, wipe all the windows,
empty the ash tray and guide the car out again with a chorus of thank yous
and deep bows.
Those who favour deregulation charge that such excessive service and a
highly convoluted distribution system add to costs. They also note that
restricting competition through tight regulations on imports allows the oil
companies to keep petrol prices high, despite the fall in crude prices in
recent years and the sharp rise of the yen.
'Oil companies admit that margins on gasoline are around three times margins
on other products,' notes Mr Nicholas Smith, industry analyst at Jardine
Fleming, the securities company.
The high margins are partly explained by the fact that petrol is probably
the only profitable oil product for Japanese oil companies and they need fat
margins on petrol to make up for the others.
Moreover, to support industry, oil companies were required by bureaucratic
fiat to keep the price of oil products used in industry low and in return
were allowed to keep petrol prices high. For similar reasons, tax policy on
oil has favoured industry over the consumer.
Regulatory controls on the retail sector meanwhile allowed oil companies to
keep a tight-knit group of affiliated service stations to which they
distribute petrol, and thereby protect their margins.
This allowed a highly inefficient industry, badly in need of restructuring,
to survive under the protective shield of regulation.
But discounters such as Kanare Beikoku, which buy excess product made by oil
refiners through an informal market, are widening the crack that has opened
in that structure.
Liberalisation of imports would push the industry further towards
restructuring and possibly consolidation.
If imports are liberalised, as seems likely, the profits of Japanese oil
companies could be severely hurt, says Ms Lalita Gupta, industry analyst at
UBS Securities in Tokyo.
Mr Tadashi Maekawa at the Petroleum Industry Association warns that
liberalisation would force domestic refiners to reduce their capacity, lead
to a heavier dependence on petrol imports and make it difficult for Japan to
secure enough petrol in a crisis.
But the momentum behind liberalisation appears unstoppable. Neither can the
industry count on the ministry of international trade and industry its
long-time guardian, to come to the rescue. Recognising the need to introduce
greater competition into the industry, Miti has gradually taken steps
towards deregulation and the oil industry cannot remain immune to a
wide-ranging and long overdue restructuring.

FT  22 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Singapore to place Dollars 5bn air order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore Airlines (SIA) is expected to announce today an order for up to 50
wide-body airliners worth more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn), which would
double the size of the airline's fleet by the year 2003.
The order is expected to involve both Boeing 747-400 jumbo airliners, as
well as European Airbus A340 long-range aircraft for delivery, starting in
1997 and running to 2003.
SIA, one of the most profitable airlines, has also been looking at the new
Boeing 777 twin-engine 400-seater airliner.
The airline told the bidding manufacturers of aircraft and aero-engines four
months ago it needed 22 Boeing 747-400s and 30 Airbus A340s, in addition to
the 12 Boeing 747-400s and 13 A340s it already has on option.
However, the precise number of new aircraft it will order is only to be
disclosed today.
The deal is particularly important for the airframe and aero-engine
manufacturers because orders of this magnitude are now rare in the troubled
airline industry.
All three leading aero-engine manufacturers - including Pratt &amp; Whitney and
General Electric of the US, and the UK Rolls-Royce group - have submitted
bids to supply power plants for the new Boeing and Airbus aircraft.
SIA said this year it needed the new aircraft to meet expected annual growth
of 8 to 9 per cent over the next 10 years. The airline has also had a
longstanding policy of renewing its fleet on a regular basis so as to
maintain an average aircraft age of five years.
SIA has now earmarked China, India and Vietnam as its main new growth areas
during the next 10 years.
It is also seeking to operate services from London to the US, if it can
secure the necessary traffic rights and airport slots.

Japan's foreign minister, Mr Koji Kakizawa, plans to visit the US this
weekend for talks with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, on the two
countries' framework trade negotiations.
The announcement, which came as US and Japanese trade negotiators continue
efforts to agree on trade issues before a Group of Seven summit in Naples
next month, heightened hopes that an accord was near.
Mr Kakizawa's plans, however, are subject to the volatile political
situation in Japan, where the minority government may face a vote of no
confidence as early as Friday.
Japanese trade officials were also unwilling to place much hope in the
possibility that Mr Kakizawa's visit will achieve the breakthrough the two
sides have been seeking since the framework talks were resumed last month.
'It is not yet time for a political decision,' one Japanese trade official
said yesterday.
Mr Kakizawa has been keen to meet Mr Kantor, who expressed a desire to meet
the Japanese minister as soon as the latter was appointed.
The two sides have not yet held talks below cabinet level. Also, no
discussions have been held on quantitative indicators, the most difficult
obstacle, the official said.
Considerable progress has been made towards agreement on government
procurement, which with insurance and trade in vehicles and auto parts makes
up the three priority areas on the agenda. However, there was still much
work to be done before the summit. 'It may be difficult to reach an
agreement before then,' the official said.
The US embassy in Tokyo yesterday issued a statement welcoming Japan's
efforts to deregulate its economy.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Paris presses UN over Rwanda plan: Boutros Ghali supports
move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS AT THE UN, New York
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France last night pressed a sceptical United Nations Security Council to
sanction the despatch of up to 2,000 French troops to Rwanda to protect
civilians caught in the vicious civil war.
Despite widespread opposition the plan is expected to be approved because it
has the backing of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, and no
one wants to be seen standing in the way of a humanitarian mission.
Mr Jean Bernard Merimee, the French delegate, says France seeks no political
or military advantage and the mission would be 'absolutely' protective.
He will have to spell out just how and where the troops would enter Rwanda
since the Patriotic Front rebels have promised to eject them.
The RPF vehemently opposes French involvement, because it says Paris
supports the Hutu-led government and militias widely regarded as responsible
for most killings.
Last night the RPF demanded the Security Council withdraw the small UN force
already in Rwanda if it approved the deployment of French troops.
In a letter to the Council Mr Gerald Gahima, the RPF representative at the
UN, said this was necessary because RPF forces might not be able to
distinguish between UN and other foreign troops. There are 450 Ghanaian
soldiers in Rwanda under a Canadian general.
In Rome, Mr Antonio Martino, Italian foreign minister, sharply criticised
the French proposal, voicing fears any white troops entering Rwanda would be
'torn to shreds'. In Geneva, the World Council of Churches urged France to
abandon the plan saying the entry of French troops would worsen the crisis
and make a solution even more difficult.
Mr Boutros Ghali, who discussed the crisis yesterday with Mr Douglas Hurd,
UK foreign secretary, is trying to assemble a 5,500-man all-African UN
force. Because of logistical problems he has told the Security Council it
would be impossible to have it in place in much under three months.
Ethiopia, Ghana, Senegal, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Congo, Malawi, Mali and Nigeria
have all offered infantry soldiers, but on condition equipment needs are met
by more affluent countries.
This will create further delays because the troops must be trained in the
use of unfamiliar equipment - another reason why the French plan may win
acceptance.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Hong Kong talks make good progress: Officials say China's
doubts about airport seem to have been met
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The former mansion of Banque Indochine's general manager in Hong Kong was
the venue yesterday for what might well have been the turning point in
Britain and China's long running row over Hong Kong.
Standing on the steps above the terrace of Seabourne Villa, a large colonial
house built in 1905, Mr Hugh Davies, the UK's representative to the Joint
Liaison Group (JLG), which deals with the details of Hong Kong's 1997
transfer to China, proclaimed that 'excellent progress' had been made on the
first day of the three-day meeting.
Mr Davies said a top bilateral group would meet on Friday to discuss
financing Hong Kong's HKDollars 159bn (Pounds 13.5bn) airport project.
Government officials later said China's previous concerns about financing
the airport and its connecting railway, including the issues of land sales
and debt, appeared to have been met. Short of fresh demands, officials could
think of no reason why the financial plan could not be agreed on Friday.
Over the past few months China has signalled a desire to repair relations
with Britain and get back to work on Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty.
But in terms of what Britain and China need to do by 1997 the airport is
like the visible part of an iceberg - largely hidden from public view is a
vast amount of work which remains to be done.
Awaiting the attention of the JLG is, among other things, the regularisation
of Hong Kong's law, sorting out the colony's air services agreements, the
extension of the colony's container port, and determining what sort of
travel documents Hong Kong citizens will use after 1997.
At Seabourne Villa, Mr Davies and Mr Guo Fengmin, his Chinese counterpart
both acknowledged the tightness of the timetable ahead.
Mr Guo noted at yesterday's photocall: 'There are only three years until
1997 and there are a lot of problems for the JLG to discuss if a smooth
transition is to be guaranteed.'
The need for a 'smooth transition' may well be the motive propelling China
toward agreement. But some Hong Kong government officials will only believe
Beijing has had a change of heart when they see concrete evidence of it.
The Chinese walked away from a deal on military land and are busily trying
to extract further concessions from the UK. At Friday's meeting of the
Airport Committee, Beijing may decide on one further turn of the screw to
see if more can be extracted from a colonial government keen to show the
world that its relations with China are returning to normal.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Hongkong Bank may curb home lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hongkong Bank, the colony's biggest mortgage lender, may tighten lending to
60 per cent on mass-market homes from the current 70 per cent following an
18 per cent year-on-year surge on loans last month.
The bank, which is estimated to have a 28 per cent share of the domestic
mortgage market, saw new loans tip HKDollars 2bn (Pounds 170m) in May. Mr
Edwin Lau, head of retail banking at Hongkong Bank, said: 'We are concerned
that we have been taking in a lot of new mortgages every month despite all
earlier measures, and we don't want to reach the stage where we have to say
to the market: 'Hongkong Bank will no longer accept mortgages. . . We feel
we might have to do something sooner rather than later.'
He said the bank was considering tightening lending by 10 per cent.
Requiring home buyers to put up deposits of 40 per cent on medium-sized
properties worth less than HKDollars 5m is unlikely to have more than a
limited impact on property prices - it would follow two rounds of banking
curbs in 10 months - but analysts say it may undermine government measures
to damp rising house prices.
Reduced loan ceilings could force buyers into the primary market, where
special financing deals prevail. This pre-sale market is one of the key
targets of the government measures: under the new rules, buyers cannot sell
on the entitlement to an uncompleted flat - which in effect leaves them
sitting on a non-liquid asset for some six months.
Developers such as Hutchison Whampoa, the ports-to-property hong controlled
by Mr Li Ka-shing, offer loans of up to 85 per cent of property price.
Developers have been cutting prices by around 10 per cent in recent months,
since the government's intentions on property were first signalled.
Hutchison is bringing some 80 flats to market this week at HKDollars 5,112
per square foot, 10 per cent below the HKDollars 5,700 per square foot peak
price achieved in the same development's last sell-off three months ago. The
development, South Horizons, is exempt from government curbs on resale as
consent to assign was granted to the entire development before the measures
were introduced.
Hang Seng Bank, the listed Hong Kong banking subsidiary of HSBC, is also
keeping a watching brief on mounting loan applications, although it has no
plans now to introduce further curbs.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Japan greets recovery signs with caution: Gerard Baker on a
spring spurt that has fizzled out by summer three times before
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the fourth year in a row, Japan's economy has started the year with a
spurt. In each of the last three years, the spring surge has quickly given
way to a summer slump, however, and analysts greeted yesterday's figures
with caution, anxious not to be embarrassed yet again by premature
predictions of recovery.
But the economic signals have been more encouraging for longer this time and
hints from the government's Economic Planning Agency yesterday suggested
that the second quarter of 1994 would demonstrate that the recovery is being
sustained. If growth continues in the second quarter, it will be the first
time for three years that gross domestic product has grown for two
consecutive quarters. A small achievement, but it would start to look like a
trend.
But what sort of a recovery will it be? The strength and duration of the
upturn will depend entirely on the extent to which output has been lost
during the current recession - the output gap, or the difference between
long-term productive capacity and actual output. Japan has been used to
rapid growth, punctuated by brief, shallow recessions, but these days in
Tokyo it is hard to find much optimism about the country's long-term
prospects.
In the 1950s and 1960s Japan registered average annual growth rates
(measured from peak to peak of successive business cycles) of a remarkably
consistent 8 to 9 per cent. The first oil shock in 1973 halved that,
however, and average annual growth had slowed by the early 1980s to about 4
per cent.
There is little doubt that the salad days of the Japanese economy are over.
The decline is principally the result of economic maturation. In the 1950s
and 1960s, starting from a low base, Japan's economy grew rapidly. There
were plentiful supplies of capital, and industry was able to import vast
quantities of modern technology that would have taken the country years to
develop indigenously.
'For most of the period Japan was able to grow fast because it was in the
process of catching up,' says Mr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura
Research Institute in Tokyo. 'Now that it has caught up there is little
scope for those rates of growth.'
If Japan is now a mature economy is it condemned to US or even European
rates of growth of around 2 to 3 per cent a year? Two factors will influence
Japan's long-term growth prospects: productivity and an ageing population.
It is widely believed that both factors work against Japan. Few would argue
that it would be able to maintain its rapid rate of increase in
manufacturing productivity compared with most industrialised economies, the
key to Japan's post-war economic boom.
The labour force is projected to peak in the late 1990s and fall sharply
thereafter as Japan's ageing population ensures that the number of people
above working age grows rapidly in the first part of the 21st century. On
this view the economy cannot any longer expect to achieve faster growth than
its competitors.
But this is a gloomy view, typical of the saturnine outlook often associated
with business at this stage of the cycle. The key area for future
productivity increases is not manufacturing, which now accounts for just a
third of Japan's output, but services. While it is true that manufacturing
productivity has reached western levels, services productivity lags well
behind - by as much as 50 per cent in some sectors, according to a recent
study by McKinsey, the management consultants.
As Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo points
out, 'if the Japanese service sector can achieve the same sort of
productivity improvements seen in manufacturing, the growth potential for
the whole economy is enormous'. The scope for deregulation and increased
competition in the services sector could, some economists feel, produce
significant productivity gains.
The contraction of the labour force expected after the late 1990s may also
be illusory. The EPA's prognosis is based on the size of the population aged
between 15 and 60. But the labour force is actually likely to grow, since
more women will work and the retirement age may well recede as labour
becomes scarce.
The striking aspect of Japanese performance in the last 20 years has been
not a straight-line fall in long-run growth that could be explained by
maturation, but a single step down after the 1973 oil shock. Since then, the
average growth rate has been consistent at slightly more than 4 per cent.
If that continues, the implications for the next few years are considerable.
The output gap would be close to 10 per cent of gross domestic product and
Japan's economy would have room to grow at 5 per cent a year until the end
of the century before the gap was closed - a spritely performance for a
mature economy.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Taiwan ready for N-power showdown: Laura Tyson on a debate
over a fourth nuclear facility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan's ruling Nationalist party is marshalling its forces for a
parliamentary showdown with the opposition over the budget for the
government's planned Dollars 6.3bn (Pounds 4.1bn) nuclear power plant.
Lawmakers will tomorrow review the state power monopoly Taiwan Power
Company's proposed Dollars 4.2bn fiscal 1995 budget for the country's
controversial fourth nuclear facility, slated to be ready for production in
2001.
Debate over the plant's budget last year sparked a full-scale melee outside
the Legislative Yuan (Taiwan's parliament). Feuding legislators' supporters
battled for hours before police were able to overwhelm them.
In a bid to mollify public concerns over safety and costs, Taipower
yesterday released a white paper outlining the country's energy requirements
and emphasising the need for the plant.
Funding for the project had been frozen following the Chernobyl disaster in
1986 until 1992, when parliament released enough money to restart the
project and get the bidding process going.
Taiwan's demand for power is growing at 6 per cent a year. The margin of
surplus has been running at between 4 and 8 per cent, against a recommended
ratio of 20-30 per cent. Taipower has been forced to ration electricity to
industrial users during the summer months for the past several years.
Taipower's existing power generation capacity stood at 19,355MW at the end
of 1993. Of total capacity, 13.3 per cent is hydroelectric, 60.1 per cent
thermal and 26.6 per cent nuclear. By 2001, assuming construction proceeds
as scheduled, installed capacity is projected to nearly double to 34,000MW
for a reserve margin of 20 per cent.
It is far from clear whether the Nationalist party can muster enough support
to push the budget through, despite holding two-thirds of parliamentary
seats.
'The major difference between national energy policy in the 1980s and energy
policy in the 1990s is now you have to take the public's views into
consideration,' observed a senior researcher at a government-backed
think-tank, the Chung Hwa Institution for Economic Research.
Residents living near the proposed site in Kungliao township near Taipei are
fighting the project. Some 10,000 people joined an anti-nuclear protest
march in the capital on May 29. Critics of the plant say that, apart from
safety concerns, waste disposal will be problematic in crowded Taiwan.
Opponents say that adding coal- or gas-fired thermal plants would address
the energy supply problem without creating the public uproar fomented by
nuclear power.
Meanwhile, contractor bidding on the project remain in limbo pending the
outcome of the legislative session. Three companies - ABB, the Swiss-Swedish
concern, through its US entity Combustion Engineering, Westinghouse in
partnership with Nuclear Electric, the UK public utility and France's
state-run Framatome - are in the running for the nuclear reactor contract,
set to cost Dollars 2.2bn.
If MPs pass the budget, contracts are should be awarded late next month or
in August. Bidding for the plant's turbine generators, set to cost Dollars
1.9bn, is still in the pre-qualification stages.
Further down the road, the government has drafted regulatory changes which
would break Taipower's monopoly on the power industry by allowing private
sector companies to own and run power plants.
The proposed changes were in response to an application by Formosa Plastics,
Taiwan's largest private conglomerate, to build a coal-fired plant. Taipower
is discussing the logistics and technicalities of such changes with the
Ministry of Economic Affairs. It is unlikely that a result will emerge for
at least one or two years, Taipower officials say.
Mr Gordon Wu, head of Hong Kong conglomerate Hopewell Holdings, came to
Taiwan on a reconnaissance trip in March. Hopewell is credited with
alleviating chronic power shortages in the Philippines. But Taiwan has many
battles to fight before Mr Wu can begin to hope for a piece of the action.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Indonesian government yesterday banned three leading publications in
what amounts to its most severe crackdown on the media in years. The ban is
a reversal of the government's pledge over the past year to stimulate more
public debate.
The weekly magazines, Tempo and Editor, and the weekly tabloid newspaper,
Detik, have been lost their licences to publish following critical reporting
of the government's acquisition of a fleet of former East German warships
and articles speculating about a successor to President Suharto.
However, Mr Subrata, director-general of press and graphics, said Editor and
Detik had been banned because of administrative reasons.
With a circulation of more than 450,000, Detik is by far the most popular of
the three. Tempo, a pro-establishment journal, has a circulation of 200,000,
while Editor sells 87,000 copies a week.
In the last week Mr Suharto is reported to have accused the media of playing
one party against the other on the case of the purchase of the East German
warships. The purchase was organised by Mr JB Habibie, minister for
technology and research and a Suharto protege, but was opposed by the
military.
Last week, Indonesia announced that its year-old period of unprecedented
openness would continue, but warned journalists to adhere to what it called
ethical reporting after recent coverage of politics drew fire from senior
officials.
Under Indonesian press laws, the Information Ministry can revoke the licence
of publications. The last ban was in 1990 when the Monitor tabloid published
an article considered blasphemous to Moslems.
Diplomats and activists said the move was aimed at muzzling the more
outspoken of the country's revitalised media.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Third World child health improves as violence worsens
position in west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The widening net of immunisation and better primary health care are
improving the lives of children in developing countries, while growing
violence in industrialised societies is leading to a worsening in their
security, according to a United Nations report* published yesterday.
The 1994 Progress of Nations report, issued by Unicef, the UN children's
fund, assesses global developments in child health, nutrition, education,
family planning and progress for women.
The report explains the need for an examination of social development as
opposed to strict economic indicators by citing cases such as Vietnam,
which, with a per capita GNP of Dollars 240, has a far better child survival
rate than Algeria with a GDP per capita nearly seven times higher.
The assessment of quality of life for children in the industrialised world
is the most striking confirmation of Unicef's view that social development
is not 'an automatic by-product of economic advance'. It cites the US where
one in five children is living in poverty, 8m lack health coverage, 3m a
year are reported to be neglected or physically or sexually abused - triple
the number in 1980.
Unicef's account of social development in the Third World is predominantly
upbeat. Fifteen years ago, benefits of immunisation were restricted to no
more than 15 per cent of the developing world's population; today they reach
almost 80 per cent, preventing about 3m child deaths a year.
Falling infant mortality is coupled with a drop in fertility. Since 1960,
the family planning rate in the developing world has risen from about 10 per
cent to 55 per cent and family size has fallen steeply to an average of 3.7
from 6.
Nevertheless, 2m children die each year from vaccine-preventable disease and
a further 3m from diarrhoeal disease. The report forecasts Aids will claim
up to 850,000 extra child deaths a year by 2010. Malnutrition remains the
largest single factor in infant mortality.
Although more than 150 nations signed the 1989 Convention on the Rights of

FT  22 JUN 94 / Hosokawa denies he lied to parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's former prime minister, yesterday denied that
he had lied to parliament over a loan repayment and share purchase.
Mr Hosokawa dismissed as 'insulting' his summons before a parliament
committee yesterday by the two main opposition groups, the Liberal
Democratic party and Social Democratic party.
They summoned Mr Hosokawa in an attempt to embarrass the present minority
government, a preliminary to a possible vote of no-confidence.
Leaders of both opposition groups want to vote the coalition out of office
after the budget clears parliament, possibly on Thursday, and before the
parliamentary session ends on June 29.
However, they have yet to get the support of a significant section of their
own ranks, who want to continue negotiating to join the coalition rather
than rush into a parliamentary showdown.
LDP-inspired allegations that a Y100m (Pounds 636,000) personal loan to Mr
Hosokawa in 1982 from Sagawa Kyubin, a gangster-linked trucking group, was
an illicit political donation, prompted his resignation in April, after just
eight months in power.
Mr Hosokawa was also questioned yesterday on claims that he had tried to
cover up the purchase of shares in NTT, the privatised telecommunications
company. He again denied wrong-doing.
The ruling coalition initially resisted the summons on the grounds that
there was no consensus to interrogate Mr Hosokawa before parliament. But its
changed its mind for fear of being accused of seeking a cover-up, a possible
pretext for a no confidence vote.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Poll holds key to Belarus independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, RIGA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Belarus, the least independent-minded of former Soviet republics, tomorrow
elects its first president in a contest which could determine whether it
finally gives up its main attributes of independence.
The contest appears to be led by Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, a
neo-communist whose unrivalled access to state-owned TV has won him the
sobriquet of Uncle Kebich - after equally frequent advertising for Uncle
Ben's rice.
Having failed to reform what has become a stagnant economy, Mr Kebich is
campaigning on a promise to merge the Belarus economy with that of Russia.
He claims that a provisional agreement he concluded last winter with Russian
Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin for a monetary union between the two
states is the only way to save the Belarus economy from its catastrophic
state.
If endorsed, despite growing doubts within Russia, the treaty would require
Belarus to place its central bank under the tutelage of Russia, and to
adjust all its economic legislation to Russia's.
Since Belarus has already given up nuclear weapons inherited from the Soviet
era and has no pretensions towards an assertive foreign policy - it would
have very little else to give up in the way of real independence once it
hands over its central bank and the power to print money.
Mr Kebich pledges economic support for Byelorussians which Russia is
unlikely to endorse. By 1995, he has promised 100 per cent indexation of
pensions and savings, and says he will prevent bankruptcies among ailing
industrial enterprises - a pledge which effectively ends hopes of economic
reform.
Vying for the educated vote of those Byelorussians who feel something of a
national identity are Mr Zenon Pozdniak, the leader of the nationalist
Popular Front and Mr Stanislav Shushkevich, the reformist former chairman of
the parliament. Both men are promising fast market reform. While Mr
Shushkevich is seen as amiable but somewhat ineffectual, Mr Pozdniak
inspires some nervousness as to what his more nationalistic message would
entail in foreign policy.
Competing with Mr Kebich for the less sophisticated voters who want order
and security above all else is Mr Alexander Lukashenko, an anti-corruption
campaigner, who says his first decree as president would cleanse the
administration of corrupt officials.
The Latvian parliament yesterday approved a controversial nationality law,
severely limiting the rights of the large Russian minority to citizenship,
Reuter reports from Riga. The new law, passed at its third and final reading
by 66 votes to 11, sets a limit of some 230,000 Latvian-born people who can
become citizens by the end of the century.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Growth of 10% expected in first quarter: Eastern German
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The east German economy is expected to grow by 10 per cent in real terms in
the first quarter this year compared with last year and the productivity gap
in some sectors is narrowing between western and eastern German enterprises.
However, the upswing in the economy is far from becoming self-sustaining,
with the region still reliant on west German financial transfers. And growth
in gross domestic product comes from a very low base. Gross domestic product
fell by more than 30 per cent in 1990.
In separate reports, the Federal Statistics Office, the Bundesbank, and
Deutsche Bank Research, conclude that the 'de-industrialisation' in the five
eastern states since 1990 is now complete, providing a foundation for
gradual growth. This involved a massive restructuring of industry, including
modernisation and closures. But export demand, the main engine driving the
west German economy, remains extremely weak in eastern Germany.
According to yesterday's annual report by the Statistics Office, east German
exports totalled DM12bn (Pounds 4.88bn) last year, a fall of over DM1.79bn
on the previous year.
East Germany's total exports last year represented only 2 per cent of
Germany's total export trade, compared with 30 per cent in 1989.
Last year, over 52 per cent of east German exports were targeted on the
countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, consisting mainly
of mechanical engineering, chemical, and machine tool building products.
East Germany's exports to the region shrank by 80 per cent in the first few
years after unification, following German monetary union and the collapse of
Comecon, the former eastern trading organisation.
But as the Bundesbank and Deutsche Bank Research indicate, the restructuring
since unification, and continuing high level of investment, which was up a
real 17 per cent in the first quarter, is improving competitiveness in some
sectors. For example, car production at plants built since unification by
Opel, BMW, and Volkswagen, rose by 45 per cent in the first quarter this
year - and can match, if not exceed west German productivity levels.
Competitiveness in retailing and construction is also approaching west
German levels, according to the Bundesbank and Deutsche Bank.
Deutsche cautions that productivity across the sectors varies widely,
depending on the nature of the investments, lay-offs and restructuring, and
high unit wage costs, which are on average 50 per cent higher than in west
Germany, continue to delay international competitiveness.
Overall industrial production in eastern Germany is expected to increase
throughout 1994 after growing 21.6 per cent year on year in the first
quarter. New orders - for the whole German market - grew by 20.1 per cent in
the same period, and domestic orders rose by 27.6 per cent, an indication
that the east German economy is producing items which industry requires.
However, the region remains heavily dependent on western German goods,
particularly of consumer products, which last year were six times as high as
eastern German deliveries to western Germany.
But there are signs that west German companies that have invested in eastern
Germany are 'importing' the products back into western Germany. 'More east
German firms are now establishing a foothold in the west German market with
new, improved products. The investments in recent years are bearing first
fruit,' says Deutsche.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Russia's 'economic calm' set to end: Pressures are building
that political will alone cannot withstand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The second half of the year is always the worst for the Russian economy,
says Mr Boris Fyodorov who, as former deputy prime minister for finance,
should know. It is the time when the lobbies step up their demands and all
the signs are that the period of calm is coming to an end.
At root, the problem is simple: sharply rising demands on spending,
especially from the military and agriculture, sharply falling tax revenue
and very high real interest rates. They add up to pressures that political
will alone can probably no longer withstand.
'The situation is not sustainable,' says Professor Charles Wyplosz of
France's Insead business school, an expert on the Russian economy.
'Something has to give.'
An impasse, though perilous, does not necessarily mean disaster, western
experts and Russian economists say. Perversely, it may point to Russia
becoming 'normal'. Not in the sense of an advanced market economy for which
the Russian reformist governments were striving, but of a politically and
economically precarious developing country.
'Russia is now likely entering the so-called Romanian or Latin American way
 -with periods of high inflation and attempts at financial stabilisation
following each other,' says Mr Andrei Illarionov, deputy head of the
Economic Reform Centre.
'We could see a market emerging which is rather monopolistic with huge
government intervention, massive state regulation, depressed and fragmentary
market competition, highly protectionist economic policy, very efficient
production and high prices. We already have an example - Moscow's real
estate market - heavily regulated, protected and corrupt.'
The implicitly comforting message in this, that Russia can 'muddle through'
peacefully if bumpily, is increasingly believed in Russia and elsewhere. But
not by all, especially not by Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University,
the highest profile former adviser to the Russian government, who gave a
passionate address to a conference of reformers and experts in Stockholm
last week.
'This is a country with 2.1m men under arms; it has 30,000 nuclear weapons.
We can't afford to sit and wait for it all to go wrong,' he says.
It could indeed go wrong, poised as it is on the knife edge of a 'slow
reform' which many economists thought (and still think) impossible. Some
things are going right: inflation is down from nearly 30 per cent a month at
the end of last year to around 8 per cent last month; very high real
interest rates are keeping credit tight; and credits which once flowed
freely to the other former Soviet republics are largely stopped.
'The end of the rouble zone last autumn is one of the main reasons for the
drop in inflation,' argues Ms Brigitte Granville, senior research fellow at
the Royal Institute of International Affairs and a Moscow resident.
However, the costs of these and other policies are growing fast. The budget
for 1994, still being tossed about between the two houses of parliament and
the government, is way out of line. Mr Illarionov reckons that, in the first
three months of this year, less than half of budget revenues were collected.
Mr Wyplosz's figures (see graph) are less dramatic, but still show a serious
shortfall in the first quarter. Industrial production has plunged to little
more than half its early 1992 level, and, though that misses out the private
sector, it still means a disaster for the dominant state economy: closed
plants, idle workers, regional and city budgets starved of revenue.
The industrial directors, as usual, blame the government. Mr Vladimir
Shcherbakov, head of the Interprivitizatsia industrial investment fund (and
a former Soviet first deputy premier) says that without urgent action, the
government and society are at risk.
'We know what is happening to companies,' he says. They cannot get credit at
the price it is. They have no money, no supplies, no modern management
expertise, often no modern technology. They are usually not restructuring:
the management has simply withdrawn from activity and waits - for something.
'Most of them are technically bankrupt. In the refinery and the
petrochemical sector, most work at 30-40 per cent capacity. And I don't
believe, like the prime minister, that this is the bottom of the crisis. I
think that in the autumn there will be a further deep fall as these plants
which are working part-time close because they lack customers and lack
supplies.'
This has stimulated the opposition to call for changed policies, though with
much less vehemence than in the early part of the reform, when Mr Yegor
Gaidar was in charge.
Earlier this month, a flurry of decrees came out from government under the
prompting of President Boris Yeltsin, aimed at stimulating investment
through tax cuts and other measures. Mr Yeltsin has harshly criticised
acting finance minister Mr Sergei Dubynin and, by implication, prime
minister Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, for inaction, reflecting the tension that
exists over the economy.
Privatisation, the only active economic reform still being undertaken, has
produced a new class of owners. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime
minister for privatisation, takes pride in the 1m proprietors of the shops
and restaurants he has helped conjure into being in the past two years.
But entrepreneurs in today's Russia must cope with a lot - huge taxes which
must be evaded to exist, contradictory laws and regulations, terrible
communications and organised crime working without much hindrance and
becoming increasingly violent.
Mr Wyplosz says 'there has been a clear shift in Russia from extreme laxity
to extreme tightness in monetary policy'. Though this produces 'good'
figures for inflation, it means Russia plays a high price: indeed, Mr
Wyplosz has constructed a 'misery index' which shows how far production
falls for every one percentage point reduction in inflation.
Russia, argues Mr Sachs and others, would not be suffering so much had it
really instituted shock therapy rather than the appearance of it two years
ago: now, stuck in a trough between reform and retreat, it is in the worst
of all worlds.

Macedonia yesterday protested to neighbouring Yugoslavia about several

hill. The Macedonian Foreign Ministry said yesterday the moves by the
Yugoslav army could have 'unforeseen consequences'. The ministry repeated
calls for an urgent meeting with the government of Yugoslavia, now comprised
of Serbia and Montenegro, to define the border. The protest follows a
warning by the Macedonian chief-of-staff that he would send the army to put
a halt to the violation of what he sees as Macedonian territory.

The Slovak finance minister, Mr Rudolf Filkus, said yesterday he expected
gross domestic product to rise by 2 per cent next year, the first such rise
in four years. Mr Filkus said the target was included in the government's
draft 1995 budget, due to be approved by the end of July. Slovakia's GDP
fell by 4 per cent in 1993 and the National Bank of Slovakia is forecasting
zero growth this year. The budget sets targets of 14.2 per cent for
unemployment and 13.8 per cent for inflation. The government's GDP target is
broadly in line with preliminary forecasts of GDP growth of between 1.5-2
per cent. Mr Juraj Janosik, a national bank economist, said there are signs
the Slovak economy is emerging from recession, with the building and
chemical industries performing strongly so far this year.

Poland has a realistic chance of becoming a member of the OECD by 1996, Mr
Jean-Claude Pays, the secretary general of the Paris-based organisation said
yesterday at the close of a visit to Warsaw. Poland and the other central
European post-communist countries, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic
have since 1990 participated in a 'Partners in Transition' programme with
the OECD, and last February the four formally applied for membership.
Negotiations for full entry are to start 'shortly', Mr Pays said. He noted
that Poland was doing well in its transition to a market economy and that
its macroeconomic situation was under control. Mr Pays said the talks would
include subjects such as the necessary changes in Polish legislation to
bring the country's laws into line with OECD rules, on issues such as the
right to transfer capital freely.

<TEXT>
A tighter fiscal policy and a reduced budget deficit in 1995 were promised
by the Danish government yesterday. Mr Paul Nyrup Rasmussen, the prime
minister, said after a routine cabinet meeting, at which the 1995 finance
bill was discussed, that the impact of government finances on the economy
next year will be to dampen the GDP growth rate by about 0.3 per cent. In
the current year, a strongly expansive fiscal policy is estimated to add 1.2
per cent to the growth rate, which is expected to be about 4 per cent. The
1995 finance bill will bring the budget deficit to under DKR50bn (Pounds
5bn), said Mr Rasmussen. The government's most recent estimate is that the
1994 deficit will be about DKR51bn, some 5.5 per cent of GDP, about the same
as in 1993.

The Democratic Agrarian party, which has a pivotal position in Romania's
hung parliament, said yesterday it was withdrawing its support for the
ruling Party of Social Democracy and that it intended to lodge a
no-confidence motion in the left-wing minority government.
The PSD government has relied on the DAP and three small neo-communist and
nationalist parties to reach a 53 per cent majority in parliament since
narrowly winning elections in September 1992. None of the four parties has
lodged a no-confidence vote in the government to date. The DAP, a small
centre-left party supported by farmers, said it was bringing the motion on
grounds that the government's economic and social policies had failed and
that, in particular, it had done little to solve the problems facing the
agriculture and food sectors.
Romania's centre-right opposition parties, which control 47 per cent of
parliament, have also said they will lodge a no-confidence motion in the
20-month-old government this week. The DAP said yesterday it would
co-operate with any party sharing the same criticisms of the government.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Russians to sign military security pact with Nato
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia will today end nearly six months of uncertainty by signing up to the
Partnership For Peace, the military co-operation programme designed by Nato.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, will also set in motion a
broader co-operation arrangement between Russia and Nato, whose precise
formulation was being haggled over by diplomats in Brussels until late
yesterday.
The Russian side has stepped back from some of its bolder demands over the
wording of the broad agreement. However the very fact Nato has been prepared
to negotiate a separate deal to supplement PFP is a substantial concession
by the alliance. The supplementary agreement will state that Nato and Russia
have an important contribution to make to the security of Europe, and it
will call for long-term co-operation between Moscow and the alliance, both
inside and outside PFP.
It will call for political consultations and an exchange of information on
European security. Negotiation was going on until the last moment over
whether the text would contain an explicit reference to Russia's importance
as a nuclear power; and also whether it would envisage - as Russia has
suggested - that the two sides formally co-ordinate their peace-keeping
activities.

Denmark's first quarter current account balance of payments surplus declined
to Dkr7.2bn (Pounds 700m) from Dkr8.39bn in the same period last year,
according to a preliminary estimate by the official statistical office. The
decline reflected the fact that imports are rising faster than exports for
the first time for several years, under the influence of a strong economic
recovery this year. Merchandise exports rose by 5.0 per cent to Dkr61.5bn
and imports by 7.6 per cent to Dkr50.4bn. The total surplus on trade in
goods and services declined by Dkr1.5bn to Dkr12.6bn. Over the past four
quarters the current account surplus increased by Dkr4.6bn to Dkr34.8bn,
which is about 3.5 per cent of GDP.
Inflation in Italy looks set to fall for the first time in 25 years below an
annualised 4 per cent. According to the national statistics office, Istat,
June inflation in a sample of nine cities was running at 0.2-0.3 per cent,
giving an annualised 3.7 to 3.8 per cent. The inflation figures for the big
cities have tended to be an accurate reflection of monthly figures.
French consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent in May, to give a year-on-year rise
of 1.7 per cent, the national statistics institute, Insee, said.

Ornately-decorated maypoles are sprouting in villages and parks all over
Sweden as the country prepares for the traditional midsummer dancing and
parties to mark the start of the July summer holiday.
After that the nation will fall almost silent, for almost a month. But this
year the long-cherished summer break will be little more than a lull in a
political storm.
A general election on September 18 will be followed by a referendum on
November 13 on whether Sweden should join the European Union. Coming after a
period of deep recession, during which some of the most basic tenets of
Swedish society have been challenged, either poll on its own would have been
a watershed: together, they represent a fateful and complex double choice.
The election pits the incumbent right-centre coalition of the prime
minister, Mr Carl Bildt, comprising his conservative Moderate party, the
Folk (or Liberal) party, the Centre party and the Christian Democrat party,
against the Social Democrats, led by Mr Ingvar Carlsson, a former prime
minister.
Boosted by opinion poll ratings of around 50 per cent, the Social Democrats
are confident of returning to power, ending three years in which Mr Bildt
set out to transform Sweden from a country dominated by its famous welfare
state into a full-blown, open market economy.
It is a battle about the fundamental nature of Swedish society. But so, too,
is the campaign on EU membership. For the Swedes, joining the Union involves
abandoning a deeply entrenched aversion to big power blocs that has led them
throughout this century to maintain their neutrality. The Social Democrats
have plenty of election ammunition. Pointing to record unemployment - the
real jobless rate stands at an unprecedented 14 per cent of the workforce -
a large budget deficit and the fastest-rising national debt among OECD
countries, they argue that Mr Bildt's reformist mission has exacted too high
a social price.
'Their policy of fighting an inflation that wasn't there any more deepened
the recession and postponed the upturn,' Mr Carlsson says. He insists the
'Swedish model' requires refinement, not wholesale reform, in which the
target is to preserve the main structure of the welfare state. 'It was not
the cost of the Swedish model that caused the crisis, it was an enormous
boom in private borrowing. It was not the public sector that suddenly
exploded.'
Mr Bildt's response is that three years of reform, in which there has been
privatisation, deregulation (in areas such as energy, telecommunications,
transport and broadcasting) and trimming of welfare provision, has made the
Swedish economy significantly more competitive. But with state spending
still close to 70 per cent of gross domestic product, he argues that more
reform is needed to consolidate this year's return to growth.
'If you go back 70-80 years in this country the Social Democrats were the
modernisers and the traditionalists were the right. Now it is the other way
around. The Social Democrats are the feudal barons trying to retard the
advent of a modern society. They are appealing to people who fear the
future, people who fear change.' Opinion polls suggest, however, that the
electorate has tired of the government's reformist zeal, making the Social
Democrats clear favourites to win in September. But the question of EU
membership presents an awkward problem for both Mr Carlsson and Mr Bildt.
Despite a decision by the Social Democrats' party congress last weekend to
support Swedish membership, polls show that more than 50 per cent of the
party's supporters oppose joining the Union.
Mr Carlsson has thus adopted a cautious approach to the EU question,
insisting that the emphasis must be on winning the election, and only then
should the party throw its full weight into the campaign for a Yes vote in
the EU referendum.
This has infuriated Mr Bildt, for whom EU membership is an overriding
political goal. Faced with polls showing a solid lead for the well-organised
and united No to the EU campaign, the prime minister has called on Mr
Carlsson to take a more active role in winning over opinion within Social
Democratic ranks.
Only yesterday, in a letter to Mr Carlsson, he repeated his appeal and
suggested the two men meet in August to discuss a joint approach to Swedish
membership. 'It is their silence that is the problem,' declares Mr Bildt. To
which Mr Carlsson replies: 'Every time he speaks, we (the pro-EU lobby) lose
more votes to the No side.'
Mr Bildt stresses the importance of participating in Europe's political and
security structures and of building open markets; Mr Carlsson speaks of how
co-operation within the EU will strengthen left-of-centre policies against
unemployment and attacks on the welfare state.
Mr Bildt faces a dilemma. The painful - and ironic - reality may be that
Swedes will accept the historical step of joining the EU that he so
passionately advocates only if it is taken under the guidance of the Social
Democrats, guardians of the 'Swedish model'.

FT  22 JUN 94 / German M3 slows but remains off target: There is no chance
of the central bank meeting its 4% to 6% target for monetary growth this
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
German money supply grew at 13.7 per cent a year in May, down from 15.4 per
cent in April.
The headline figure for the M3 measure of monetary growth was better than
market expectations and the month on month increase was at its lowest level
since November last year. Between April and May, M3 grew by 0.5 per cent.
The figures were encouraging for the Bundesbank, facing a credibility
problem with financial markets after runaway monetary growth in the past six
months. But economists warned the reduction in M3 growth could be temporary
and that there was no chance the central bank would meet its 4 to 6 per cent
target for M3 growth in the year.
The improvement in the figures reflected one-off factors such as the removal
of the Bundesbank's profit which had inflated the previous month's data. But
bank lending continued to rise last month and capital formation did not
improve, boding ill for monetary development in coming months.
Bank lending, a key factor behind monetary growth and potentially a trigger
for future inflation, rose by 9.9 per cent over the previous six months on
an annualised basis, an increase from the 9.5 per cent rate in May. Capital
formation stagnated at the same level as in the previous month. The
Bundesbank blamed 'special factors' for continuing high levels of monetary
growth, especially the world-wide uncertainty over interest rates which had
caused an 'investment blockage' as investors left funds on short-term
deposit rather than returning to bonds.
However economists disputed whether the state of the world capital markets
could be described as a special factor and called on the Bundesbank to make
a clear statement of its monetary policy aims.
As Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, insisted last week, M3 remains
the German central bank's most trusted guide to future inflationary
developments. A credibility problem has arisen because the central bank has
cut interest rates aggressively despite the fact that money supply has
overshot its target in each of the past two years and is virtually certain
to do so again this year.
Some economists say interest rates should be raised to bring M3 down, but
the Bundesbank said its most recent discount rate cut would encourage
investors away from short-term deposits into long-term investments, turning
conventional monetary wisdom on its head.
The figures released yesterday were too early to have been influenced by the
new policy, but economists warned the current state of world financial
markets is likely to have prevented the desired shift in assets from taking
place.
'There could be a further acceleration in M3 growth in June as a result,'
said Mr Holger Fahrinkrug at Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft/UBS in
Frankfurt.
'This would put the Bundesbank's whole strategy into disarray,' he said.
Mr Tietmeyer may take up the issue at a Bundesbank press conference in
Potsdam tomorrow.
Bundesbank council member Mr Lothar Muller will resign from his position as
head of the regional central bank in Bavaria at the end of June, the
regional central bank said.

<TEXT>
The German opposition Social Democratic party yesterday called for further
investigations into the irregular activities of Mr Alexander
Schalck-Golodkowski, the man who masterminded the import of the bulk of
foreign currency into the former East Germany.
The call comes after a 13 person parliamentary committee published the
results of a three-year 1.5m page report on the methods Mr
Schalck-Golodkowski used to obtain foreign currency, at least DM29bn,
(Pounds 11.6bn) to fill East Germany's government coffers until 1989.
Between 1966 and 1989 Mr Schalck-Golodkowski ran Kommerzielle Koordinierung,
better known as KoKo, a department of the East German foreign trade
ministry.
According to the parliamentary report, as part of its attempts to gather
foreign currency, KoKo spawned at least 160 companies worldwide through
which East Germany traded political prisoners, stolen art works and toxic
waste and stole embargoed technology. As head of KoKo Mr Schalck-Golodkowski
was one of the half-dozen most important people in former East Germany.
He appeared six times before the committee, but Mr Axel Wernitz, the SPD
deputy chairman of the committee, said he still had a 'series of ethical,
moral and political questions to answer.' A fresh probe was necessary, he
said, when the new parliament convenes in October.
Mr Schalck-Golodkowski left East Germany in December 1989, a month after the
collapse of the Berlin Wall, and now lives in a villa on the Tegernsee in
Bavaria, home to many other wealthy Germans.
There has been widespread speculation in the German press that no criminal
charges have been brought against him for fear of unearthing unwanted
information about connections Mr Schalck-Golodkowski had with hundreds of
leading German politicians.
These included the late Mr Franz Josef Strauss, the revered former Bavarian
state premier who arranged a DM1bn loan to East Germany in 1983.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Delors brushes off 'philosopher king' jibes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER, PHILIP STEPHENS and ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors yesterday brushed off British government charges that he
had turned into a 'philosopher king' during his 10 years as president of the
European Commission.
Mr Delors, co-architect of the Maastricht treaty, powerhouse behind the
European Single Market, and putative French presidential candidate, said it
was wrong to suggest he had spent all his time in Brussels dreaming up grand
designs for the Europe's future.
'If that was the case, I would have been able to go to 10 football matches a
year instead of two. I would have been less tired,' he told a news
conference in advance of this week's European summit in Corfu.
Mr Delors, who leaves office in December, offered a hint of satisfaction on
how the Commission presidency had grown in power and prestige since he took
over in 1985.
Yesterday, he counted 89 articles on the contest to succeed him; his
appointment, 10 years ago, received only three lines downpage in the French
press.
But he avoided commenting on the prospects of the three declared candidates
to succeed him: Mr Ruud Lubbers, outgoing Dutch prime minister, Sir Leon
Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian
prime minister and current favourite.
In a sympathetic reference to Mr Lubbers, who is being blocked by France and
Germany, Mr Delors said he had tried to ensure that all candidates received
'fair treatment' among the heads of government whose choice must be
unanimous.
Fears are growing that the Corfu summit, which opens on Friday, could be
deadlocked over the Delors succession. This could force Germany, which takes
over the rotating EU presidency from Greece on July 1, to hold a special
summit in the autumn.
The British government insisted yesterday it would maintain its backing for
Sir Leon. Senior officials refused to discuss Mr Dehaene's candidacy,
hinting that Mr John Major, the prime minister, was prepared to see the
decision deferred until a special summit. The officials said Mr Major would
insist that Sir Leon would make an 'excellent president'.
They pointedly side-stepped the question of whether Mr Major would use
Britain's national veto, stressing instead that the 12 heads of government
were obliged to reach a 'consensus'.
In Rome, the Italian government made clear it was prepared to bargain hard
over Mr Delors' successor. Mr Antonio Martino, foreign minister, told
parliament it was vital to link the choice to the broader issue of obtaining
a strong Italian presence in running international organisations. Italy is
fielding Mr Renato Ruggiero, former trade minister, as a candidate to head
the new World Trade Organisation.
Mr Delors offered a low-key assessment of prospects for the meeting in
Corfu.
He hinted that he would not press EU leaders to support extra European
Commission borrowing powers on the capital markets to finance trans-European
networks. But he wanted a commitment for work to begin on the 11 'top
priority' cross-border road and rail projects.
Similarly, he expressed concern that EU leaders might use the incipient
economic recovery to shirk from tough choices to improve competitiveness
through reform of labour markets and easing the cost of hiring people -
matched by greater support for the disadvantaged and unemployed.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Procter deal is cleared by Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday cleared the way for Procter &amp; Gamble, the
US consumer goods multinational, to take over Schickendanz, a leading German
maker of sanitary pads, after deciding that the company would not dominate
the German and Spanish markets.
Brussels approved the controversial deal after P&amp;G agreed, at the last
minute, to sell Camelia, one of the Bavarian company's main brands, within
12 months of the takeover.
The Commission had been worried that the joint forces of P&amp;G's Always brand
of sanitary pads and Vereinigte Papierwerke Schickendanz's Camelia would
hinder competition by giving P&amp;G 60 per cent of the German market and 81 per
cent of the Spanish market. In Germany, P&amp;G's nearest competitor, Johnson &amp;
Johnson, the US healthcare products company, has only a small market share.
By selling Camelia, the merger will increase P&amp;G's share to about 40 per
cent - by value - with Camelia holding about 25 per cent and Johnson &amp;
Johnson about 10 per cent.
Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, said the merger, together with
the divestment of the Camelia business by P&amp;G was 'a good thing for
competition and a good thing for the consumer'. If there are too few
companies in a market, this can only be bad for prices, bad for consumer
choice, he said.
The case has been one of the most complicated takeovers to come before the
Commission. It was on the verge of being blocked earlier this month, but at
the last minute, P&amp;G came forward with the offer to sell Camelia in order to
win clearance for the deal.
The Commission has blocked only one deal in the two-and-half years since it
was given increased powers to vet large mergers. Of the mergers that have
been notified to the Commission, roughly 90 per cent are cleared within a
month. Only 10 per cent of the mergers notified to the Commission have had
to be substantially changed to win approval. For the remaining 10 per cent
of deals, the Commission has demanded that the interested parties - in
virtually all cases - make substantial changes before it has approved them.
Mr Van Miert said yesterday this case had caused the Commission difficulty
because of the speed with which it had to deal with last-minute undertakings
from P&amp;G.
He said he would like to make Commission procedure on mergers more
transparent.
One way to do this would be to make the interested parties offer
undertakings at least one month before the Commission's final deadline for
deciding whether or not a merger is allowable.
The need for greater transparency was more urgent in view of the sharp rise
in notifications of mergers received by the Commission this year, said Mr
Van Miert. He added that the increase possibly reflected the pick-up in
economic activity across the EU.

FT  22 JUN 94 / EU telecoms networks may be liberalised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission will take immediate steps to liberalise the supply
of telecommunications infrastructure across the EU if this week's heads of
government meeting in Corfu endorses the principle of competing networks.
Most of the EU's state telecoms operators are opposed to early competition
in infrastructure, but pressure on the heads of governments from the
Commission and business groups is intense following the report by the
Bangemann Group of industry leaders.
The Bangemann group, established by the last EU heads of government meeting,
has recommended setting a 'clear timetable' for the liberalisation of
'telecoms infrastructures and services still in the monopoly area' - an
advance on previous EU policy of opening services alone to competition by
1998.
Dr Herbert Ungerer, head of the regulatory division of the Commission's
telecoms directorate, said yesterday: 'Outside the UK the provision of
liberalised services is substantially held back by the limited availability
and high price of capacity.' Addressing an FT conference on European
telecoms in London, Dr Ungerer said that if political support was
forthcoming, the Commission would seek agreement this autumn for 'general
principles and a firm time schedule linking the liberalisation of
infrastructure to the liberalisation schedule for services.'
Such a step would give an immediate impetus to investment in networks
competing with those of state operators.
Mobile cellular services, data telecoms, and private corporate networks are
already liberalised across the EU, but competitors are obliged to rely on
state operators' infrastructure.
The main public 'voice' business of state operators will not be open to
competition until 1998 across most of the EU but some prospective
competitors are already active in other liberalised sectors. The Commission
believes they and others would find it cost effective to install
infrastructure in advance of the 1998 deadline.
Fears for Europe's competitive edge are behind the Commission's desire to
accelerate telecoms liberalisation. Dr Ungerer highlighted a 10-to-1
differential in the cost of leased telecoms lines between Europe and north
America.

FT  22 JUN 94 / German politicians decamp to the east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bonn, the seat of government, becomes a virtual political desert over the
next few days as Germany's most senior politicians decamp to the eastern
state of Saxony-Anhalt.
Government ministers are not going there to witness the outcome of the
opposition Social Democrats special party congress which opens today in
Halle, the second largest city in Saxony-Anhalt, tempting though it might
be. The SPD hope to use the congress to end their internal squabbling,
decide on an election strategy and nominate Mr Rudolf Scharping, party
leader, as candidate for Chancellor.
While the SPD charts their route to the October federal elections,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Mr Klaus Kinkel, chairman of the FDP, and Mr
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the FDP's former foreign minister, are in Halle to
win support before the Saxon-Anhalts go to the polls to elect a new state
parliament next Sunday.
The locals, who probably have sighted a handful of Bonn's political elite
since they were wooed during the last federal elections in 1990, have
already caught several glimpses of Mr Kohl.
His campaign managers have had the Chancellor visiting chemical works and
refineries, digging foundations for new enterprises and shaking hands.
Once called Red Halle because of its traditional socialist support, it was
here that Mr Genscher, who was born in Halle, received a raptuous welcome
soon after the Berlin Wall was torn down.
But memories are short. A crowd of about 300 turned up in early June to hear
him speak. But over 3,000 turned out for Mr Gregor Gysi, the charismatic
leader of the Party for Democratic Socialism, the successor to the former
east German communist party.
Indeed, it is the appeal of the PDS, , who did well in the recent European
Parliament and local government elections, which appear to be unsettling
sections of the establishment.
'They are draining votes away from us,' sighed Ms Dagmar Szabados, the SPD
vice-mayor of Halle.
But Mr Kohl does not want to waste all his energy on the PDS. His high
profile is designed to shore up the Saxony-Anhalt's incumbent CDU/FDP
coalition, and attract back disillusioned voters to the FDP.

FT  22 JUN 94 / EU fails to keep open-government pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France's National Assembly recently calculated that nearly two thirds of the
laws it has considered in recent years originated from decisions taken by
the Council of Ministers of the European Union.
Given the torrent of nearly 300 laws which has flowed from Brussels since
1988 alone to put in place the single European market, this is only mildly
surprising.
What is surprising, however, is that the EU Council - the arena of serial
voting by elected national ministers on behalf of 340m people - claims not
to be able to give even the sketchiest account of how its members lined up
on this corpus of Euro-law, now mostly transposed on to national statute
books.
Yet this is the claim made to the Financial Times by the Council
bureaucracy, or general secretariat, while rejecting in writing the paper's
request for selected voting records of the 12 member states since 1989 on
foreign affairs, the single market, social affairs, and agriculture. The
request was made under the Council's new code on public access to
information. It was turned down by the secretariat but is now in the hands
of the Council itself after an appeal.
Voting records do exist. But they are contained in the minutes of the
meetings which decided the proposals, and these the Council refuses to
release. The much-vaunted new code, passed last December after EU leaders
took fright at the public alienation from Europe revealed by the
ratification crisis over the Maastricht treaty, is in such confusion as to
risk bringing the Union further discredit.
The 'openness' policy was at its high tide intended to emulate the
Scandinavian tradition of open government, or at least the US Freedom of
Information Act. It originally proclaimed full right of public access to all
EU information, except where national security, monetary stability,
commercial confidentiality, privacy, or relations with non-EU countries
could be endangered. But last December, a majority of the 12, acting on
civil service advice, slipped in a discretionary clause for refusing access
'to protect the confidentiality of the Council's proceedings'.
Of 27 requests for information made by the end of May to the Council, six
were fully met, seven were met in part, nine were refused, one was under
consideration, and four - probably including the FT's - were subject to
further review.
But it is too early to judge how the catch-all clause is being employed.
'The system is in shock,' one EU diplomat said.
The Council is the only legislature in Europe which meets behind closed
doors. Experimental televising of parts of some of its sessions has yielded
the uninformative spectacle of ministers talking at each other in stilted
set-piece speeches.
There has been no televised debate on openness, and one can see why.
Many ministers emerging from Council meetings habitually give a heavy
national 'spin' to their version of what went on inside. But most stop short
of mendacity, if only because they risk being found out; they are in
competition with 11 other member states, some of which, like the Netherlands
and Denmark, are committed to open government.
But many countries, among them Belgium, France, Portugal and the UK, are not
so keen. 'Most countries are not prepared to go beyond their national
practice in distributing information,' one EU official said yesterday.
The Dutch government is challenging the new code in the European Court in
Luxembourg, supported by the European Parliament.
But the controversy is already stemming the flow of leaked information from
EU institutions. Officials now appear less willing to provide documents.
'When you create a channel you dry up most of the tributaries,' as one
British official put it.
Moreover, ambassadors of the 12 have proposed that the relatively low-level
General Affairs Group of the Council (with the multilingual acronym of Gag)
should adjudicate by simple majority on information requests, and that the
Council - of elected national ministers - 'will undertake in principle to
approve (this) without debate'.
The Dutch and Danes refuse to accept this, but as one of their adversaries
said yesterday, 'the reality is it's 10 against two'.
The odds will change if Sweden, Norway and Finland enter the EU next year.
They have attached declarations to their accession treaties reaffirming
their traditions of freedom of information, to which the EU has attached
counter-declarations expecting the newcomers to abide by EU law. The
'openness' battle looks set to run for a good while yet.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Dollar slides as traders test resolve of central banks: Bank
of Japan acts to stem sharp rise in yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, MOTOKO RICH and Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar fell to a postwar low against the yen yesterday as foreign
exchange markets tested the willingness of the world's central banks to
intervene in support of the US currency.
After dipping below Y100 in Europe to reach a new low of Y99.85, the dollar
rallied early today in Tokyo amid reports of Bank of Japan intervention.
Bankers said the Japanese central bank bought dollars at Y100.4, Y100.6 and
Y101.
As the dollar continued to edge higher, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, Japan's minister
of finance, said his country would take 'decisive' steps on excessive
currency movements in consultation with other Group of Seven members.
Japanese ministries were due to hold an emergency meeting later today to
discuss the yen's rise.
Earlier, the US currency finished in New York at Y100.335 after closing in
London at Y101.225.
Central banks last stepped in to support the dollar in early May, when it
had appeared to be testing Y100. After the intervention, the dollar
gradually climbed back to Y105, but in recent days it has been falling
steadily against the yen and the D-Mark.
Analysts warned that without intervention this time, the dollar could
quickly fall even further.
Agency reports quoted a US Federal Reserve official as saying that the bank
was unlikely to respond to the dollar's decline by increasing interest
rates. The official blamed rising US inflationary expectations and the
widening trade deficit for the fall.
Yesterday's plunge came after figures from the US showing that the April
trade deficit widened to Dollars 8.4bn,(Pounds 5.52bn) from a revised
Dollars 6.87bn in March. However, the key trade gap with Japan narrowed to
Dollars 5.48bn from Dollars 5.8bn.
Earlier in the year, traders had believed that the US administration was
trying to drive down the dollar against the yen to exert pressure in the
trade talks with Japan. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, has since
tried to dispel the impression that the US is happy to see the dollar fall.
However, a recent change in sentiment towards the D-Mark, on the grounds
that German interest rates may have reached a low, has increased pressure on
the US currency. Fears that the Japanese government might lose a vote of no
confidence also hit the dollar, since a change of administration in Tokyo
might make resolution of the trade dispute more difficult.
The dollar's fall did little to help sentiment on Wall Street. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average dropped 33.93 to 3,707.97 - having been more than 50
points lower during the afternoon.
In Tokyo early today the Nikkei 225 average was down nearly 400 points in
mid-morning, having dropped 338.87 to 20,813.16 in the previous session.
Europe's markets closed too early to reflect the full impact of the dollar's
decline, but continued to be driven down by fears of higher US interest
rates and inflationary pressures. Early weakness in the US Treasury bond
market also had a knock-on effect on European bonds.
In London, the FT-SE 100 index fell 30.9 to 2,940.2, ending only nine points
above its low for the year. In Germany, the DAX index, which fell 4 per cent
during Monday's official trading, yesterday managed a 14-point rally to
1,983.27. But after-hours, it dropped back to 1,957.08.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Flotation of 3i to go ahead despite weak stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The flotation of Pounds 700m of equity in 3i, the largest European investor
in unquoted companies, is to go ahead today despite the weakness of the
London stock market, driven by strong interest from institutional investors.
Institutional funds have bid for Pounds 1.2bn of equity, more than twice the
Pounds 540m they are to be allocated. The bids were based on the offer price
to be announced today by 3i, which is jointly owned by seven banks and the
Bank of England.
The company will announce that it is floating 45 per cent of equity rather
than the 40 per cent envisaged earlier. Shares will be priced at slightly
more than a 13 per cent discount to their net asset value, or about 275p a
share.
The weakness of the market since 3i announced its intention in February to
float led to speculation that it might have to postpone. Yesterday's fall
led to the postponement of an issue by Eurodollar, the car hire group, and
other companies cancelling flotation plans.
Advisers, however, have found strong demand for 3i shares in an informal
'book-building' exercise over the past few weeks. Large funds were asked to
submit informal 'bids' for equity at various prices.
Some 385,000 retail investors had registered for details of the share
pricing by the deadline of Monday. That is thought to be the largest
expression of interest by individuals in a flotation, except privatisations.
One reason for institutional interest in 3i shares is that the company may
enter the FT-SE 100 index this year. It would thus become a core stock for
funds that want to hold a balanced weighting of the largest UK companies.
The flotation also offers investors a chance to hold an indirect stake in a
range of small and medium-sized unquoted companies. The company holds about
3,500 investments and invests some Pounds 400m annually.
The level of institutional interest has encouraged 3i and its advisers to
select a relatively modest discount to its net assets compared with other
UK-listed investment trusts such as Electra, which is trading at a 17 per
cent discount.
But 3i is likely to argue that the price is fair because its holdings are
weighted towards higher-return investments in small, unquoted businesses. It
also believes that its regional branch network reduces its risks.
If retail investors fail to take up the full 25 per cent of the offering,
the company will allocate more shares to large funds. Failing that, they
will be taken by Baring Brothers, the merchant bank underwriting the issue.
The flotation will release cash for the high street banks that have owned 3i
since its formation as the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation in
1945.
Although the pre-registration among retail investors is not as strong as for
privatisation - 2.8m new investors registered for details of the third
tranche of British Telecom shares last year - it is higher than comparable
efforts.

FT  22 JUN 94 / BAT unit accused of boosting nicotine in tobacco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN and TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US subsidiary of Britain's BAT Industries is using a genetically
engineered form of tobacco with high nicotine content in some of its
cigarettes.
Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco publicly admitted the use of the high-nicotine
tobacco yesterday after Mr David Kessler, head of the US Food and Drug
Administration, accused it in Washington of secretly developing the strain.
Mr Kessler told a House of Representatives sub-committee that officials at
B&amp;W had instructed contract researchers who helped create the genetically
altered tobacco plant, code-named Y-1, to mislead his agency about its
existence.
He said Y-1, which is grown in Brazil, contained more than twice the
nicotine found in normal tobacco plants. Nicotine, a toxic substance, is a
stimulant in small doses and is also addictive.
Mr Kessler's accusation is the latest in a series of potentially damaging
charges against the tobacco industry. The House sub-committee is seeking to
determine whether the FDA can legally regulate tobacco as a drug. The FDA
chief also said some chemicals on a list of tobacco additives released by
six cigarette manufacturers in April were used to increase nicotine levels.
Tobacco companies, for example, routinely added ammonia to cigarettes as an
'impact booster', doubling the amount of nicotine a smoker inhales.
Mr Kessler said: 'The findings lay to rest any notion that there is no
manipulation and control of nicotine undertaken in the tobacco industry.'
B&amp;W officials admitted privately to the FDA last week that this
high-nicotine tobacco had been used in its Raleigh, Richland and Viceroy
brands, according to Mr Kessler. Those were 'distributed nationally in
1993'.
B&amp;W said last night that Y-1 had been originally developed by the US
Department of Agriculture in the late 1970s, in an attempt to find a tobacco
that would yield less tar for a given amount of nicotine. The company had
taken up the work and applied unsuccessfully for a patent for Y-1 in 1991.
It said the brands in which Y-1 was used represented less than 0.5 per cent
of the total US market last year. Mr Martin Broughton, BAT's chief
executive, said last night that cigarettes containing Y-1 had proved
unpopular and had been largely withdrawn.
Mr Kessler said yesterday that 'several million pounds' of Y-1 tobacco was
currently stored in warehouses in the US and could be used at any time.

FT  22 JUN 94 / Rail union to press ahead with two more strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The RMT rail union plans to follow today's strike of signalling staff with
two more 24-hour stoppages in the next two weeks.
'My union has no alternative but to continue the action,' Mr Jimmy Knapp,
RMT general secretary, said yesterday after the failure of late night talks
to resolve the conflict.
He said signalling staff would strike again on June 29 and on July 6.
British Rail said last night it hoped to run twice as many trains today as
it did during last Wednesday's 24-hour strike but most of the network will
still be severely disrupted.
'I hope the public will recognise that the responsibility lies firmly with
the government and Railtrack, the employers,' Mr Knapp said.
Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, the company which owns the track,
signals and stations of Britain's rail network, warned that new strikes
would damage modernisation plans. He urged the RMT to reconsider its
rejection of Railtrack's productivity based pay offer. 'This strike will
harm the industry and our customers and will inconvenience passengers and
damage British business,' he said.
'Every day the network is closed by strike action we are losing income that
could contribute to future investment. We have offered a restructuring
package which recognises the importance of the signalmen to the rail
industry and which is about restructuring this industry to meet the needs of
the modern railway.'
But Mr Knapp said Railtrack had refused 'to address the grievances of
signalling staff'. He added: 'There is a danger in this dispute of losing
sight of the issue. This is RMT's claim for a payment to recognise past
productivity.'
In the House of Commons, Mr John Major, the prime minister, sought to
exploit Labour's refusal to condemn the strike by labelling Mrs Margaret
Beckett, the acting opposition leader, 'the strikers' friend'.
Mrs Beckett said it was 'crystal clear' that the strike had been caused by
government interference in negotiations between Railtrack and the rail
union. Mr Major repeatedly denied that his office had played any part in the
pay negotiations, which were a matter for Railtrack and the RMT.
But he confirmed that Ms Jill Rutter of the Downing Street policy unit had
attended a meeting on Friday between Railtrack and Transport Department
officials.
A senior Downing Street official said it was 'normal practice' for policy
unit officials to attend such meetings 'to keep the prime minister
informed'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigel Rudd, 47, chairman of Williams Holdings, is severing his ties with one
of the three Derby companies he has been involved with for many years. He is
stepping down as a director of Raine Industries, the building materials
group that he chaired for six years. He will retire as vice chairman and
leave the board after the next agm.
Trevor Finn, 36, chief executive of Pendragon, the up-market car distributor
floated off by Williams four years ago, joins the board on July 1. Peter
Parkin, Raine's chairman, says the fact that Rudd is chairman of Pendragon,
which is based a block away from Williams on Derby's Sir Frank Whittle Road,
had nothing to do with Finn's appointment. Parkin, who chairs Raine's
nominations committee, says he had been looking for 'a young, successful
chief executive of a plc operating in the Derby area'.

<TEXT>
Taipei has responded coolly to a request from Beijing to resume high-level
contacts, insisting questions relating to the March murders of 24 Taiwanese
tourists in China be addressed first, a government official said yesterday.
On Friday, Mr Wang Daohan, Beijing's chief negotiator for Taiwan affairs,
faxed a letter to his Taiwanese counterpart seeking an 'urgent meeting' to
resolve differences - the first time the two would meet since 1993's
ground-breaking talks, when officials from both sides held talks for the
first time in more than 40 years.
'We have sent nine letters to the Chinese side about the tourists,' a
spokesman for Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said. 'We want to resolve
the issue. But so far we have received no answer'.
The Qiandao Lake incident occurred when the tourists were robbed and their
boat torched. Three Chinese were executed, but Taiwanese suspect they were
scapegoats. China has been accused of covering up military involvement.

<TEXT>
People in the small town of Yingde, in China's southern Guangdong province
use a boat to make their way down the street after severe flooding which has
caused many deaths. The floods rose higher yesterday as rains lashed the
southern provinces of Hunan, Guangdong and Guangxi. State media assessments
at the weekend put total deaths in excess of 400, with an estimated 160,000
homes destroyed and economic losses running into the tens of millions of
dollars, and the lives of 20m people affected.

FT  21 JUN 94 / EU risks Brussels presidency deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears were growing last night that this week's European summit in Corfu will
be unable to break the deadlock over the succession to Mr Jacques Delors as
president of the European Commission.
A stalemate risks putting Europe's political leaders on a collision course
with the new European Parliament which had hoped to scrutinise the choice of
Commission president at its opening session next month.
It would also be a sharp diplomatic setback for the outgoing Greek
presidency of the Union.
Prospects of a deadlock have increased in recent days as Mr Ruud Lubbers,
the Dutch prime minister and one-time favourite, has refused to bow to
Franco-German pressure in favour of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime
minister, who formally entered the race last Friday.
Germany, which takes over the presidency of the EU on July 1, now appears to
take a relaxed view of the danger of reaching a deadlock on issue at Corfu.
Senior German government officials now believe such an outcome may be
inevitable, even if regrettable, and are preparing for the possibility of
having to call an emergency summit.
This would probably take place in the early autumn.
'The federal government hopes that (the summit) succeeds in deciding the
question,' Mr Dieter Vogel, the German government spokesman, said.
'If not, we will have to do it later. It is important that we decide this
soon.' Senior diplomats in Brussels, Madrid and London agreed that it was
unlikely that Greece would be able to broker a compromise during the Corfu
meeting.
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, was also said to be unwilling to drop
Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, in favour of Mr Dehaene.
Mr Antonio Martino, the Italian foreign minister, who was in Bonn yesterday
for talks with Mr Klaus Kinkel, his German counterpart, also said later that
he thought a deadlock on the Commission presidency was probable.
He did not think it would be 'a great drama' if a special summit had to be
called to decide on the presidency in the autumn.
The German government has hitherto expressed concern that everything should
be done correctly by the member states to respect the new powers of the
European parliament, which intends to put the future Commission president,
and his individual commissioners, through a parliamentary vetting and
approval procedure.
This would mean not only submitting the candidacy of the president at the
earliest possible opportunity, but also the names of his commissioners.
For Germany in particular, with a general election in October, it is
politically difficult to finalise the names of commissioners at an earlier
date.
The proposed solution was to nominate one from Mr Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union, and one from the opposition Social Democratic party, to
ensure a balance whichever party wins the German election.
Thus the prospect of deadlock in Corfu, and a special EU summit in Germany
in September, could have a twin advantage for Chancellor Kohl.
It would provide him with an additional opportunity to play the
international statesman before the Germans go to the polls on October 16.
It also would mean that a decision on the German commissioners might
reasonably be left until the election result is beyond doubt.

<TEXT>
Voter turnout for Poland's local government elections on Sunday was between
25 per cent and 30 per cent, the lowest level since the fall of communism.
Only hard-core supporters of the political parties bothered to turn out to
vote for the 52,173 local government seats. Exit polls mirrored last
autumn's parliamentary poll, showing the ruling coalition PSL farmer's party
doing well in the countryside. Its former communist partner in government,
the SLD, maintained its position in the towns and received around one-third
of the vote. The opposition Freedom Union, a centrist group which led the
last government also won up to a third of the urban vote leaving the rest to
disparate, fervently anti-communist, right-wing groups.

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Leoluca Orlando, the leader of the Sicily-based reformist movement La
Rete (Network), has refused to resign as mayor of Palermo following the
announcement last week he was under investigation for alleged abuse of
office. He told Palermo city council yesterday he would not step down but
agreed to waive his immunity as a member of the European Parliament. His
position contrasted sharply with his demands that politicians under
investigation resign immediately. The investigation relates to his previous
period in the 1980s as Christian Democrat mayor of the city and concerns
delays in restoring Palermo's opera house, the Teatro Massimo. The saga of
the opera house is one of Sicily's better known instances of bungling
officialdom. It has been closed since 1974when it was declared unsafe. So
far L65bn (Pounds 26.7m) has been spent intermittently on restoration but at
least a further L32bn is required.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A dispute over Finland's move to join the European Union yesterday split the
centre-right coalition for the first time since it took office in 1991 as
the anti-EU Christian party pulled out of the government.
But the remaining three government parties, led by the Centre party of the
prime minister, Mr Esko Aho, retained an absolute majority with 108 seats in
the 200-seat parliament, despite losing the backing of the seven Christian
party MPs. The coalition, now comprised of the Centre party, the
Conservative party and the Swedish People's party, went ahead yesterday with
the formal ratification of Finland's agreement on the terms of accession
with the EU following approval at a special conference of the Centre party
at the weekend. A similar meeting of the Christian party rejected EU
membership, forcing the leadership to withdraw from the coalition in which
Mr Toimi Kankaanniemi, its leader, was minister for overseas aid.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Romania moves on new law to return property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUCHAREST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Romanian Senate yesterday passed a controversial property law, granting
limited restitution rights to former owners of around 250,000 residential
properties confiscated after 1945 by the former communist regime.
Under the bill, which must be passed by the lower house before becoming law,
former owners or their descendants may only claim back properties they still
live in as tenants. Those living elsewhere or with more than one confiscated
residence can claim cash compensation up to the equivalent of the annual
average salary for the past 20 years. Funds for compensation will come from
sales to tenants of unclaimed properties. The proposed law will only
compensate Romanian citizens resident in the country.
Former owners living abroad will have six months in which to return to
Romania and register their claims. Centre-right opposition parties, which
boycotted the debate and voting on the law, said the bill violated property
rights enshrined in the constitution. The National Peasants party, the main
opposition grouping, said it would challenge the bill in the constitutional
court if, as expected it becomes law.
The opposition and former owners' groups say the move favours former
communists living in confiscated properties, who under the bill will be able
to buy their homes for a fraction of their market value.

FT  21 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: GKN bought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Engineering group GKN, which yesterday returned to the premier list of FT-SE
100 companies, was among a handful of stocks that bucked the poor market
trend. The shares gained 7 1/2 at 594p in trade of 1.4m, with a large part
of the day's buying said to have come from index funds.
Sentiment was further boosted by reports of a positive note from Kleinwort
Benson and the stock basked in some of the glow surrounding British Steel.
The two jointly own steel company United Engineering Steels.
Higher oil prices and a broker's upgrade failed to stop British Petroleum
sliding 7 1/2 to 404p, with around 7m shares traded. The market was believed
to be fretting over the future of the near 10 per cent stake held by the
Kuwait Investment Office (KIO).
With the shares ending last week at an all-time high, there was a strong
argument that the Emirate's international investment arm might want to take
profits from its 540m-share holding. However, some analysts said the stake
was a prestige holding for the country and very unlikely to be offloaded at
a time of political uncertainty.
Meanwhile, Nomura's oils team raised its 1994 average oil price forecast by
a dollar to Dollars 17 a barrel and advised clients to make a short-term
switch from Shell Transport into BP because of the respective benefits to
earnings. The Japanese house said BP's 1995 earnings will improve by 13.4
per cent because of the rise in oil prices but Shell's profits will only
increase by half as much.
The dividend race between the regional electricity companies (recs)
continued apace, with East Midlands producing a healthy 16.4 per cent
increase, although profits slumped after a hefty exceptional charge. The
pre-tax figure of Pounds 51.2m was at the bottom end of market expect-ations
and followed a Pounds 129.5m charge taken against restructuring costs. The
company also announced plans to seek shareholder approval to buy back up to
10 per cent of its issued share capital.
The East Midlands performance was described as 'moderately good' by
analysts, although the shares slid back with the weak utilities sector,
closing 9 down at 568p. Manweb, which reports today, rose 3 to 679p.
Analysts are looking for profits of around Pounds 130m and a final dividend
of 22.5p.
Among water stocks, Wessex held up well, closing just a penny off at 603p.
The market is anticipating a bumper dividend payout from the company at
today's finals, with some optimistic analysts pencilling in 24.5p, against
last year's 21.5p. Profits should come in at around Pounds 103m.
Elsewhere, the sector weakness was compounded by several stocks going
ex-rights.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo receded 15 1/2 to 563 1/2 p following sharp
rises recently. There was some nervousness over a statement that the company
was considering legal action against plans by Novopharm, the Canadian
pharmaceutical group, to market a generic version of its best-selling ulcer
treatment drug Zantac in the US.
TSB Group held steady at 225p in response to a reiterated recommendation
from SGST and ahead of half-year figures due on Thursday. The market is
expecting a profit of around Pounds 215m - up from Pounds 80m previously -
because of a sharp fall in bad debt provisions. Traders said there was also
talk that Nomura was recommending the stock.
Elsewhere, former building society Abbey National was pulled back in early
trading after cautious weekend press comment on the recovery in the housing
market. But the shares recovered from a low of 405p to close 7 1/2 off at
415p.
In the oil sector, the possibility of a successful bid for Lasmo by
Enterprise Oil continued to recede in spite of a shaky rumour earlier in the
day that SG Warburg had been asked to buy 10 per cent of Lasmo's shares. By
the close Enterprise had firmed a half-penny to 415p while Lasmo was up a
penny at 150p.
Thorn EMI was the subject of some debate as the market awaited the verdict
on two important cases this week. First, the George Michael versus Sony
court case is due to be decided in the next few days, with Thorn supporters
hopeful of a positive outcome for Sony and in their view the record industry
as a whole.
Later in the week, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's report into
compact disc prices is also expected, with leaks from official sources
hinting that the record companies will escape censure over pricing. Thorn
shares dropped with the market, before rallying to close 20 1/2 down at
1039p.
Speculative buying buoyed Shoprite Group, the discount supermarket operator,
the shares gaining 6 to 65p.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel remained under a cloud as talk that a
large part of the Pounds 858m rights issue may be left with the underwriters
continued. The shares relinquished another 5 to 283p. The rights issue price
is 265p.
There were selective gains among building and construction groups following
the hefty setbacks suffered last week on the back of interest rate rise
fears. Among housebuilders and developers, Taylor Woodrow advanced 3 to
125p, AMEC 9 to 113p and Barratt Developments 5 to 198p. Beazer Homes was
steady at 147p.
USM-quoted Border Television moved forward 15 to 184p following a
recommendation in the weekend press.

FT  21 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Profits boost for Steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spotlight fell on British Steel as analysts hastened to upgrade profits
and dividend expectations after the group returned to profit with fig-ures
at the top end of market expectations.
The shares responded by rising 5 3/4 to 139p and it was the day's best
performing stock among FT-SE 100 constituents as 11m shares were traded.
Profits for the year to April 1994 came in at Pounds 80m, against a loss of
Pounds 149m in the previous year, but it was the 50 per cent increase in the
final dividend, making a year's total of 2p, which brought most surprise.
Analysts were pleased by the positive tone of the results meeting and said
the new legal challenge to the European Commission asking it to adhere more
strictly to its Steel Aid code was a sign of the renewed confidence at the
group.
The upgrading of current year expectations moved the range from a previous
Pounds 199m to Pounds 300m, to Pounds 270m to Pounds 325m, while that of the
dividend moved from previous expectations of 3p to a new range of 4p to
5.5p.

FT  21 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy setback on renewed inflation
concerns - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sudden wave of inflation concerns, reflected in setbacks in bond markets
across Europe, hit UK stocks hard yesterday. At midsession the equity market
was heading for its worst one-day fall of the year, but losses were
significantly reduced when UK government bonds steadied, helped by similar
trends in the US dollar and Federal securities.
The FT-SE 100 Index closed 51.8 off at 2,971.1, but had earlier shown a fall
of 85.3 for a session's low of 2,937.6. Renewed fears that inflation
pressures in the US will herald a general raising of global interest rates
left no sector of the stock market unscathed on the first day of the new
equity trading account.
However, trading volume was relatively mild and there was no question of
panic selling. London fared better than the German stock market, where the
prospect of a switch to upward pressures on interest rates came as more of a
shock.
Weakness in the US dollar was a bearish factor for the multi-national
stocks, and Unilever, ICI, Hanson, HSBC and many other big names suffered
significant losses. Even the oil shares sector, which at first responded
strongly as US crude oil prices moved above Dollars 20 a barrel, reacted
later as the US stock market continued to come under pressure. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average was 30 points off when the UK markets closed for the day.
As so often in current market conditions, much of the downward pressure was
exerted from stock index futures. Selling of the September contract on the
Footsie, which took over market leadership on Friday, drove the contract to
a discount as marketmaking firms struggled to protect themselves against a
collapsing stock market.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 48.4 down at 3,478.7 but, with the focus
strongly on blue chip stocks, trading in non-Footsie issues made up only
about 48 per cent of total business in equities. Seaq volume totalled only
460.1m shares, compared with 736.8m on Friday, when retail business was
worth Pounds 1.46bn.
Traders warned that the low level of turnover in the market yesterday should
not be taken as cause for comfort. 'There was no time to sell much stock,'
commented one head dealer, 'but the selling was done in the futures
markets.'
At last night's close, the FT-SE 100 Index was just over 39 points above the
year's low reached at the beginning of this month.
Below the year's low of 2,931.9 is an unsupported area for the index, with
the nearest support level not clearly visible much above Footsie 2,800.
UK market strategists found it difficult to draw heart from yesterday's
rally from the session's lows. London stocks clearly remained vulnerable to
the next move in bonds, and suggestions of decoupling suddenly sounded even
less convincing.
Moreover, it was clear that securities markets are now highly nervous of the
gains in commodity prices, which are likely to continue as the recoveries in
world industrial economies gather pace.
Domestic factors, including the announcement that new mortgage commitments
by UK building societies had edged higher to Pounds 3.39bn in May, were
largely ignored yesterday. Markets also appeared unperturbed by prospects
for Britain's non-EU trade deficit for May which is due for publication this
morning. For the near term, there is little doubt that trends in the UK
stock market are at the mercy of the US bond markets.

FT  21 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp setback in European bond markets on renewed fears on US inflation
hit the derivatives sector, sending stock index futures falling heavily,
writes Joel Kibazo.
On its first full day as the market leader, the September contract on the
FT-SE 100 opened at 2,985, and after a brief rise to 2,989 in the first few
minutes of the session, the direction was downwards for most of the day.
The prospect of higher interest rates to counter US inflation triggered a
sell-off in bond markets which in turn affected sentiment in futures.
Independent, or local, traders were said to have led the downward movement,
with the large institutions reported to have been unwilling to take part in
market activity for a large part of the day.
The low was reached at 1.30pm when September fell to 2,937.6, showing a
12-point discount to cash. The steadying in bonds brought a sharp rally to
the contract but renewed selling at the close curtailed a further advance.
The contract ended trading at 2,973, at parity with the cash market, in
heavy volume of 20,768 lots.
The strong activity in the derivatives sector brought turnover of 43,379
lots to the traded options. Some 26,001 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option
and the Euro FT-SE had 8,471 lots dealt. Hanson was the busiest stock option
with a total of 1,239 contracts.

FT  21 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Fresh setback for Dow as
dollar drops
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US stocks suffered their second big setback in a row yesterday as a falling
dollar excited fresh concerns over the direction of monetary policy, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 34.88 down at 3,741.90, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.97 lower at 455.48. The
Nasdaq composite dropped 10.50, or 1.44 per cent, to 718.85 and the American
SE composite weakened 4.07 to 436.19.
Activity on the New York SE returned to a more sedate pace after a frenzied
'triple witching' session on Friday. Closing volume was a light 229.5m
shares and declining issues outpaced rises by 1,715 to 495.
The continued weakness of the dollar sent a shiver through US financial
markets, destroying any hopes that stocks would rally on the heels of
Friday's 34-point drop. The market often recovers strongly on the Monday
after a triple-witching rout, as the quarterly expiration of options and
futures tends to exaggerate any underlying trend.
Yesterday, however, bargain hunters were thin on the ground. Stocks were in
retreat from the opening bell amid fears that the Federal Reserve may have
no choice but to raise interest rates as early as next month to support the
slumping dollar.
The potential impact of such a move on the economy undermined any
inclination by the stock market to rally. Bonds were no help either, though
the Treasury market was buttressed by a softer tone in commodities.
Amid these cross-currents, economically sensitive stocks were leading share
prices in a determined march lower. Caterpillar, the heavy equipment
manufacturer, retreated Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 106 3/8 and Eaton, a
supplier of motor vehicle components, lost Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 52 3/8 .
Reynolds, the aluminium producer, shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 48, while
Bethlehem Steel fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 20 1/8 .
Among other Dow industrial issues, Sears Roebuck slipped Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 47 5/8 . But Philip Morris put on Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 50 7/8
following news of the resignation of Mr Michael Miles, its chairman. He was
believed to be an advocate of a proposal to split the food and tobacco
businesses into separate companies.
US Healthcare jumped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 43 1/8 on speculation that
Johnson &amp; Johnson was considering a takeover bid for the company, a pioneer
in the field of health maintenance organisations. J&amp;J held at Dollars 43 5/8
.
The Nasdaq gave up more ground as the technology sector stumbled again and
financial issues weakened. Cirrus Logic fell Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 28 3/8
and Atmel receded Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 23 1/4 .
Canada
Toronto shares moved sharply lower in line with other Canadian financial
markets yesterday after Prime Minister Jean Chretien failed to promise more
spending cuts.
Early in the day, Mr Chretien sent financial markets into a tailspin when he
played down the significance of reports that Ottawa may be forced to make
new spending cuts to stop the deficit from increasing due to rising interest
rates.
The TSE 300 composite index tumbled 68.3, or 1.64 per cent, to 4,088.4 and
falls overwhelmed advances by 649 to 162. A modest volume of 47.9m shares
was well below Friday's 60.6m. All 14 stock groups ended weaker, led by
industrial products and mining, which lost 2.63 and 2.31 per cent
respectively. The banking and energy stock groups were each off 1.33 per
cent, while golds shed 0.92 per cent.

FT  21 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Futures-linked sales
leave Nikkei down 1.6 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Weaker bond prices and a higher yen depressed investor confidence, and share
prices fell sharply on technical selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average declined by 351.27, or 1.6 per cent, to 21,152.03 on
futures-linked selling. The index opened at the day's high of 21,515.60 and
fell to a low of 21,125.63 in the late afternoon.
Bond prices declined on continued expectations of an economic recovery,
while fears that the Bank of Japan had failed to inject enough funds into
the money market exacerbated the fall, raising worries of higher interest
rates among stock market participants. Meanwhile, the strength of the yen,
which rose back to the Y102 range against the dollar, depressed
export-related stocks.
Selling of Nikkei futures by foreign investors triggered liquidation of
arbitrage holdings. Traders said dealers, who had accumulated positions in
the futures market last week on hopes of increased participation by domestic
institutions, followed suit. Although individual investors and some domestic
institutions sought bargain prices, many investors remained nervous of the
large arbitrage overhang.
Volume totalled 410m shares, against 518m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks shed 21.06 to 1,684.47, while the Nikkei 300 fell 3.99 to
305.64. Declines led rises by 841 to 215, with 131 issues unchanged. In
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index dipped 14.75 to 1,363.50.
Export-oriented, high-technology shares lost ground on the higher yen.
Hitachi slipped Y30 to Y1,060, NEC Y30 to Y1,270 and Sony Y60 to Y6,280. Oki
Electric, a recent favourite among retail investors, was the most actively
traded, declining Y7 to Y808.
Rising commodity prices helped mining and oil related stocks. Mitsubishi Oil
advanced Y25 to Y1,000 and Sumitomo Metal Mining Y26 to Y998. However, Dowa
Mining lost Y7 at Y620 on profit-taking, and Showa Shell Sekiyu, the oil
refiner, receded Y40 to Y1,480 on index-linked selling.
Banks declined on arbitrage selling, Industrial Bank of Japan by Y50 to
Y3,200 and Mitsubishi Bank Y30 to Y2,680.
Nippon Shoji, a pharmaceutical wholesaler, fell Y80 to Y1,570 on allegations
of insider trading among its employees.
Speculative buying supported Nippon Zeon, which rose Y20 to Y595, Hanwa, the
steel trader, up Y7 to Y642, and Sanrio, Y30 higher at Y2,090.
In Osaka, the OSE average retreated 222.23 to 23,560.91 in volume of 82.2m
shares.
Roundup
Much of the region was under pressure, while Karachi was closed for a
two-day religious holiday.
HONG KONG was concerned about the weakness of the US dollar, and the Hang
Seng index, which fell more than 150 points at one stage, finished 115.78,
or 1.3 per cent, lower at 8,998.18. Turnover was a thin HKDollars 2.2bn.
Property issues weakened on profit-taking and in further response to
government measures to cool rocketing prices. HSBC Holdings dipped HKDollars
2 to HKDollars 85 and Cheung Kong HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 35.25.
SYDNEY was unnerved by inflation worries and the All Ordinaries index closed
26.8 down at 2,024.4, its lowest level since May 10.
NAB fell 26 cents to a 10-month low of ADollars 10.68, while ANZ ended down
15 cents at ADollars 3.91. CBA lost 12 cents at ADollars 7.51, its lowest
close since March 1993, and Westpac fell to a seven-month low of ADollars
4.34, off 12 cents.
BANGKOK was concerned about rifts within the ruling coalition that could
lead the Palang Dharma party to pull out of the coalition. The SET index
fell 17.25, or 1.3 per cent, to 1,353.28 in turnover of Bt6.2bn, after
Friday's Bt14bn.
KUALA LUMPUR staged a sharp reversal to early gains in the afternoon to
close lower as investors took profits. The composite index finished 2.58
down at 1,035.46 after a day's high of 1,041.93.
Construction and Supplies House, which resumed trading after signing a
MDollars 2.59bn timber deal, led activity with 22m shares traded. The stock
rose to a high of MDollars 11.20 before closing at MDollars 9.60, against
its pre-suspension price of MDollars 7.95.
TAIPEI saw profit-taking in the heavily weighted financial sector, which led
last week's rally. The weighted index retreated 121.33, or 2 per cent, to
6,038.41 in turnover that contracted to TDollars 57.7bn from Friday's
TDollars 68.66bn.
Among the hardest hit financials, China Trust dropped TDollars 4.5, or 6.3
per cent, to TDollars 67.5.
MANILA fell 1 per cent as investors waited for new issues to be listed and
sentiment was dampened by PLDT's fall overseas. The composite index receded
28.15 to 2,854.68 as PLDT lost 40 pesos at 1,695 pesos.
SINGAPORE turned volatile on rumours that Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad might not call a general election this year.
A report quoting Mr Mahathir as advising investors to avoid speculation on
stock market rumours and tips also dampened business, and the Straits Times
Industrial index closed 21.73 lower at 2,284.50.
WELLINGTON lost 1.5 per cent in response to weaker world bond and equity
markets, particularly in the US and Australia. The NZSE-40 capital index
slipped 30.63 to 2,072.70 in typically thin Monday turnover of NZDollars
32.8m.
SHANGHAI's A share index fell 5.1 per cent after 200m Shanghai Petrochemical
shares made their debut in an already weak market, crushing investor
confidence. The index shed 27.23 to 508.61 in turnover of Yn1.1bn.
Petrochemical declined 5.5 per cent to Yn1.91 in volume of 2.3m shares.
SEOUL continued to rally in active trade as hopes about the possibility of
summit talks between South and North Korea spurred buying interest.
The composite index moved ahead 16.31 to 942.50 in response to reports that
South Korean President Kim Young-sam had accepted a proposal by his Northern
counterpart Kim Il-sung for a first-ever summit.
Trading was active, with a total of 49.8m shares changing hands, compared
with the daily average of about 31m for the past week.
BOMBAY was buoyed by the better than expected performance of the corporate
sector and shares finished at a 26-month peak. The BSE 30-share index
climbed 50.4 to 4,332.9.

FT  21 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Fearful bourses shaken by
roller-coaster ride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses took a frightening roller-coaster ride, led down initially by a near
percentage point drop in US bonds after Continental market hours last
Friday, writes Our Markets Staff.
The gloom thickened on weekend comments suggesting that UK interest rates
would soon be on the way up, said Mr John Blackley at James Capel in London.
Bond markets around the Continent took fright, fell on heavy selling, and
equities followed suit.
In the European afternoon, US Treasuries fell, firmed, andfell back again on
profit-taking. Germany's September bund future followed this pattern, said
Mr Blackley, falling 110 basis points, and recovering to only 36 points
down; but it lost ground again, showing a drop of 68 at 90.37 late in the
day.
FRANKFURT's technical analysts offered a dismal prospect after the Dax index
fell 81.90, or 4 per cent, to 1,969.82 during the session. If support did
not hold at 1,950, said one, 1,750 was the next stop.
As it happened, bonds then staged their intraday recovery and the
Ibis-indicated Dax recovered to 1,986.42 after an intraday low of 1,953.15.
However, a number of analysts were saying that the index might test 1,950
again today.
Hopes of German economic recovery had been tarnished by a succession of
corporate disasters, said observers, in Metallgesellschaft, Schneider and,
most recently, Procedo. Banks weakened with Deutsche down DM38.50, or 5.3
per cent to DM693.50 and Dresdner DM26, or 6.9 per cent lower at DM350.
Meanwhile, the drop in the dollar below DM1.60 hit Lufthansa, DM13, or 7.4
per cent lower at DM163.
Turnover fell from DM25.6bn, inflated by last Friday's DTB contracts
closures, to DM8.9bn.
MILAN saw heavy selling ease late in the day but the Comit index still
finished 27.27 or 3.9 per cent lower at 671.63, sharply below the 690
support level.
Among the blue chip losers, Fiat fell L218 to L6,038, in the wake of weekend
comments by Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, who said that the
government had not yet discussed the issue of incentives for the motor
market.
Mediobanca lost L748 or 4.9 per cent to L14,411. The merchant bank has yet
to set a definite price for its rights issue later this week although it had
indicated at least L15,000 per share.
PARIS fell sharply, but ended off its lows on short covering, the CAC-40
index falling 32.91, or 1.7 per cent to 2,903.04 after a drop of over three
per cent at worst.
Turnover was heavy at FFr5.7bn. Traders said that much of the selling came
from French retail investors who had suffered losses on bond holdings held
in savings plans.
Transnational partnerships were shaky, Euro Disney hitting FFr14 before
recovering to go ex rights and 70 centimes higher at FFr16.25. Eurotunnel's
rights issue, meanwhile, seemed to be running into more serious trouble as
the shares closed another 45 centimes down at FFr25.20, after a low of
FFr23.85.
ZURICH was dragged down by interest rate worries, the weak dollar and
derivatives related selling. The SMI index fell 82.6 or 3.1 per cent to
2,545.0, after picking itself up from an intra-day low for the year of
2,512.8.
However, analysts commented that since the index had now convincingly fallen
through support at around 2,565, the way could be open for a further decline
to around the 2,400-point level.
The interest rate outlook continued to hit banks. CS Holding bearers fell
SFr22 to SFr511.
SBC lost SFr16 to SFr363 after Credit Suisse downgraded its 1994 earnings
estimate following reports that SBC had lost SFr100m in a currency deal.
AMSTERDAM fell 2.5 per cent to its low for the year, the AEX index losing
9.78 to 382.84.
Cyclical stocks were among the hardest hit with Nedlloyd, the shipping line,
Fl 3 or 4.5 per cent lower at Fl 64 and KLM Fl 2.20 or 4.4 per cent down at
Fl 47.30.
Shares and options in KPN, the partially privatised telecommunications and
postal group, were heavy sold by retail investors. The shares lost Fl 1.60
to Fl 47.70.
MADRID recovered from a 3.8 per cent drop to end with the general index down
5.19, or 1.7 per cent at 302.60 after a low of 296.01. Turnover continued to
climb, at Pta53.2bn. The food and construction sectors seemed to sustain
most damage; Tabacalera, after disappointing results recently, fell another
Pta165 to Pta3,475 for a six-day fall of nearly 15 per cent.
WARSAW dropped 5.9 per cent as hopes of a recovery, which grew after the
previous session, gave way to a renewed lack of confidence. The WIG index
fell 492.7 to 7,893.8.

FT  21 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg awaits budget
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stocks in Johannesburg fell sharply, in line with other markets, and ahead
of the new government's first national budget tomorrow. The firmer financial
rand also depressed equity prices.
Gold's inability to hold a Dollars 392 an ounce high and its subsequent dip
below Dollars 390 took the steam out of the golds sector, although shares
still managed to end higher on the day. The overall index fell 73 to 5,712
and industrials lost 109 at 6,621. Golds gained 30 at 2,227 after touching
2,273. Anglos came under pressure, shedding R8.50 to R234. De Beers fell
R3.25 to R112.75.

FT  21 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Italy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'The fundamentals tell us that Italy is expensive and not priced to allow
for risks of any kind.' Mr Robin Griffiths, a senior technical analyst at
James Capel in London, wrote this last week - just as the new Italian
government was studying ways to respond to a constitutional court ruling on
pensions that could cost the government up to L30,000bn. The Milan stock
market, doubly concerned about the outlook for interest rates and inflation,
led a sick Europe down last week with a drop of 8.1 per cent. Cash calls
during the current account areestimated at more than L10,000bn, and there
were rumours earlier in the week that domestic stockbrokers were selling
equities to cover the cost of losses in the bond markets.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar declines sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar struggled to keep off its lowest level against the D-Mark in
eight months yesterday after negative market sentiment forced it through
technical and psychological barriers, writes Motoko Rich.
The markets held a grudge against the dollar after its downward performance
on Friday when an independent think tank in New York said the US currency
could drop by 10 per cent against the D-Mark within the next 18 months.
Traders flirted with the dollar's lows against both the D-Mark and the yen,
and awaited concerted central bank intervention, which was not forthcoming.
In London the dollar closed at DM1.5986 from a previous DM1.6299, and at
Y101.970 from Y103.495. It finished New York trading at DM1.5995 and
Y101.90.
Meanwhile, the D-Mark was gaining strength on a fall-out in the European
bond and equity markets and optimism that Germany's economy is in recovery.
The US currency extended its Friday losses against the D-Mark as bearish
traders rattled at central bankers' doors and pushed the dollar through new
technical support levels. The dollar also slid against the yen on the back
of its downturn against the D-Mark.
'There was no news to trigger the dollar's fall,' said Mr David Cocker,
economist at Chemical Bank. 'When you have a large fall like last Friday,
you would expect to see some profit-taking, and that is exactly what
happened. It rallied a little bit, but not much, so the traders sold it
again.'
By the close of European trading there had not been concerted central bank
intervention to support the dollar. Earlier in the day, Bundesbank president
Mr Hans Tietmeyer declined to comment on the US currency, dampening
expectations of Bundesbank action.
Mr Cocker said the US currency will need central bank intervention before it
will rally. 'To see a turnaround in the dollar, you need to see the Fed
raising rates above the short-term German rates,' added Mr Cocker. 'To say
we do not have an active devaluation policy is not enough. They need to talk
the dollar higher.'
Attention today will be turned towards the US trade balance. Analysts expect
that if the figures are bad, traders will continue to sell off dollars.
'The US trade figures will take on an importance not justified by itself,'
commented Ms Alison Cottrell, senior international economist at Midland
Global Markets. 'The markets are nervous and thin and the trade figures are
the only thing to look at.'
While the market has been shunning the dollar, the D-Mark has come into
favour. 'The market is rerating prospects for the D-Mark,' said Citibank
economist Mr Neil MacKinnon. 'We have seen many indications that the German
economy has turned the corner.'
He said the markets have sensed that German interest rates have bottomed out
and are forecasting that the next rate move will be upwards. With generally
disappointing economic indicators emerging from the US in the last few
weeks, the market has also trimmed its expectations for Fed tightening.
A blood bath in European bonds, fuelled by Friday's fall in US Treasuries,
rising commodity prices and fears of inflation, gave the D-Mark a further
boost as investors fled to cash. 'Of course they could be buying any
currency, but investors seem happiest to be in D-Marks,' said Mr Cocker.
German call money stayed steady at 5.00 to 5.05 per cent.
The dollar's weakness also benefited the Swiss franc, which closed higher
against the US currency. The dollar fell through the SFr1.3500 level, its
lowest since Oct-ober 1992, finishing yester-day at SFr1.3488/3498 from
SFr1.3740/50.
Swiss franc/D-Mark cross trading was thin, and the franc ended the day
weaker against the D-Mark. The German currency closed at SFr0.843, from
SFr0.841 on Friday.
Sterling was unable to break away from its link to the dollar and was quoted
below the crucial level of DM2.46 at some points during the day.
'The pound has weakened steadily against the D-Mark because people are
buying D-Marks against the dollar, rather than sterling against the D-Mark,'
said Ms Cottrell.
UK statistics on M4 money supply and lending, as well as building society
net new mortgage commitments, had little effect on the market as investor
attention focused on the flailing bond and stock markets and the spiralling
dollar.
The pound closed down in London at DM2.4606 against the D-Mark from DM
2.4765 and up at Dollars 1.5393 from Dollars 1.5195.
While remaining quiet in early sessions, the Bank of England provided
liquidity of Pounds 78m at established rates and late assistance of Pounds
295m after forecasting a shortfall of Pounds 450m. The overnight lending
rate traded between 6 and 4 1/8 per cent.
In the futures market, trading volumes were high at 24,800 on the December
short sterling contract, which closed at 93.70 from 93.75. The December
Euromark contract saw 32,000 lots traded and closed at 94.78, from 94.81.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint):
Bio-technology offers a safer, more secure world - Widespread fears that
safeguards already in place are inadequate are probably based on ignorance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bio-technology designed to produce genetically-modified organisms via the
manipulation of deoxyribonucleic acid is not just a mouthful - it is beyond
the wit of most people to comprehend.
Reduce that acid to its initials, DNA, and its meaning becomes slightly more
accessible to the average person. DNA is, after all, constantly being quoted
as a means of solving violent crime through genetic fingerprinting. And most
of us, I suppose, are vaguely aware that it has something to do with our
bodily make-up and with food and farming.
But multi-syllabic words and scientific jargon are a big turn-off for most
people, and as we do not understand them we tend to fear the techniques they
describe. They conjure-up images of bespectacled boffins in white coats and
dangerous-looking laboratories. I confess to having had some of those same
fears until the commonplace nature of bio-technology in everyday foods was
explained to me.
I am assured, for instance, that it is possible to extract the DNA from an
onion using table salt, washing-up liquid, a normal household liquidiser, a
coffee filter and very little else. Furthermore, it can be done in any
kitchen or, as is already happening, in third-form school chemistry classes.
Not all of those people who defy concern over cholesterol and eat cheese may
be aware that the traditional way to promote the initial curdling of milk is
to add a small quantity of rennet, an enzyme extracted from a calf's
stomach. Bio-technology has now made it possible to produce an exact copy of
chymosin, the necessary enzyme, which is indistinguishable from the original
in both make-up and function, and, following approval by the UK government's
Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes, it is increasingly being
used in cheese-making, much to the delight, I imagine, of the animal welfare
lobby.
Other foods and drinks whose production involves the use of living
organisms, like yeast - such things as bread and beer - will also soon
benefit from improved versions of raw material that are the result of
bio-technology.
My own particular interest, however, is in the field of plant breeding. In
the past - and it has been going on for centuries - the development of
improved varieties has been done by the selection of desirable
characteristics in individual plants and crossing them with one another in
the hope that the result would be favourable.
In recent years, however, it has become possible to identify the qualities
required from DNA analysis and achieve more accuracy in the breeding
process. Plant breeders can now select far more specifically than before for
such things as milling quality in wheat; resistance to debilitating fungal
disease; tolerance to certain pests; and the ability to yield well with
lower levels of fertiliser.
Ultimately, for it still takes many years for these characteristics to be
fixed and for the resulting seed to be multiplied to sufficient quantity for
it to be made widely available, this work will lead to crop varieties that
will require lower inputs of chemicals and fertilisers and therefore be more
environmentally friendly. It will also open new doors for agriculture.
Take oilseed rape, for instance. Genetic manipulation, which will make it
one of the most versatile crops in the world, is well advanced. By modifying
the gene mix for different purposes, scientists are already confident that
the oils produced by the different strains they are developing can become
general purpose, environment-friendly, feed stocks for industry.
It could not only be used for cooking and lubrication, as at present, but
also for the manufacture of plastics, polymers, pharmaceuticals, inks,
detergents, nylon, cosmetics and probably many more. And, unlike the mainly
fossil-based raw materials used for those processes at present, oilseed rape
would amount to a renewable resource.
Scientists say that bio-technology will be our only hope as the population
of the world doubles during the next 50 years. That to have any chance of
putting food into those new mouths and to be able to continue to enjoy the
conveniences of modern life, it is vital that the developments they can
foresee continue to be introduced.
But 20th century successors to the Luddites see dangers. Their fears, as
mine were, are probably based on ignorance. They are not satisfied that the
mass of safeguards already in place will protect them from some horror being
released into the environment - fears which I have been persuaded are
groundless.
The government's response is to organise a Consensus Conference of
interested but uninvolved people to assess the evidence during the coming
autumn and come to conclusions in November.
It is a welcome and appropriate step, which I for one hope will promote a
public debate in which some of the mystique and misunderstanding about
bio-technology will be dispelled.
Given proper regulation and controls, the new technology is likely to
produce a safer, more secure and more environment-friendly world.

FT  21 JUN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Tea
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was very strong demand, particularly for brightest East Africans,
which often gained 10 to 15 pence, reports the Tea Brokers' Association.
Medium and plainer Africans were also well supported at generally dearer
rates. Brighter Ceylon bopf's also advanced with other descriptions firm.
There was improved demand for coloury Ceylon bopf's, which often gained
several pence, but bop's and thin, green types met limited interest and were
maily easier where sold. The few Africans on offer were dearer. Quotations:
best available 260p/kg, good 170p/kg, good medium 148p/kg, medium 122p/kg,
low medium 88p/kg. The highest price realised this week was 325p/kg for a

FT  21 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: World Bank accused of
attempting raid on gene reserves - Geoff Tansey on a row over control of
germplasm, a vital resource for the world's plant breeders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF TANSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some 40 major environmental and development NGOs (non-governmental
organisations) have accused the World Bank of attempting a coup to take over
control of the 500,000 crop samples held in gene banks in the various
international agricultural research centres, such as the International Rice
Research Institute in the Philippines and the Mexico-based International
Research Centre for Wheat and Maize, which developed the green revolution
varieties of rice and wheat.
The row over who controls this germplasm - a vital resource for future plant
breeding and a major asset gathered from the poor farmers and countries of
the world - looks set to dominate an international meeting on biological
diversity that began in Nairobi yesterday.
The NGOs want the second session of the Intergovernmental Committee of the
Convention on Biological Diversity to ensure that control over these
germplasm collections stays with an intergovernmental body run on a one
nation one vote system and that recognises farmers' rights.
Agreement on such a body was expected to be endorsed at a meeting of the
Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research in New Delhi at
the end of May after post-UN Conference on Environment and Development
negotiations between the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's Commission
on Plant Genetic Resources and the individual research centres.
However, this was rejected at the consultative group meeting, at which the
bank sought to strengthen its 'leadership' of the international agricultural
research system.
The research centres are funded by the consultative group - an informal
group of donors mainly from the industrialised countries and international
agencies, which is chaired by the bank - and faces the worst funding crisis
in its 23-year history. Funding fell by 7 per cent (Dollars 18m) last year
and another 6 per cent fall is projected for this year.
As part of its support to the group, the Bank announced in New Delhi that it
would forgive existing debts, increase its normal grant to Dollars 40m and
offer to match new funds from other donors up to a total of Dollars 60m. It
also announced the creation of a new Dollars 2.5bn fund over five years for
lending to national agricultural research linked to the consultative group.
Along with this cash came the creation, for the first time in its 23 years,
of a group steering committee chaired by the bank. It also announced that it
would consult the World Trade Organisation about the intellectual property
provisions in General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the disposition of
the group's germplasm.
The NGOs see this as aimed at preventing intergovernmental control of the
germplasm, which will become increasingly important once countries begin
charging for collecting crops within their borders. If they set high prices
then searching out materials from the existing collections will become more
important for users.
At present, the legal status of the research centres' collections is not
clear. Countries where they are based, such as the Philippines, which hosts
IRRI for example, might be tempted to exert national control over the
collections if they feel that developing countries will be kept out of
policy-making over the use of these collections, according to Rene Vellve of
Grain (Genetic Resources Action International).
In a statement on plant genetic resources to the Nairobi meeting, Ismail
Serageldin, Chairman of the consultative group and a vice president of the
World Bank, confirms that the research centres 'should not seek to benefit
financially from the commercialisation of germplasm, but should help
developing countries obtain financial benefit when opportunities occur'.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Commodities' underlying trend
remains strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Commodities Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The overall trend remained strong in the commodity markets yesterday. Gold
continued its rise while leading base metals touched fresh peaks before
running into profit-taking. Oil prices rallied after sustaining early falls.
The biggest losers were coffee and cocoa, which surrendered some of last
week's advances in thin trading.
Gold prices surged upwards in London following the pattern set in New York,
where in late trading on Friday the precious metal moved up sharply.
According to dealers this US lift-off for gold was caused by a combination
of higher grains, oil and base metals prices coinciding with weakness in the
US dollar and bond markets.
The gold price reached Dollars 391 a troy ounce at the London morning
'fixing', the highest 'fix' for three months. But it opened weaker in New
York and a wave of fund selling on the New York Commodity Exchange caused
uncertainty during the London afternoon 'fixing' session. Instead of lasting
only a few minutes the session went on for 40 minutes, according to one
dealer the longest 'fix' since August 1992. However, the volume of trade was
not big.
The London price closed at 390.40 an ounce, up Dollars 2.20 from Friday's
close. Analysts said there was very strong technical resistance between
Dollars 392 and Dollars 395 an ounce and gold would have to work hard to
break through that level.
Copper reached a 21-month peak of Dollars 2,477 a tonne on the London Metal
Exchange in early trading but then some investment funds decided to take
their profits after the metal's recent heady performance and halted the
rise. However, the important technical support at Dollars 2,420 a tonne held
firm and copper for delivery in three months closed only Dollars 7 a tonne
down at Dollars 2,438.50.
Aluminium was affected by copper's weakness but dealers said speculative
interest was still being attracted to a market whose fundamentals were
improving daily. Three-month metal closed yesterday another Dollars 4 a
tonne up at Dollars 1,474.50 on the LME.
The International Primary Aluminium Institute helped to steady the market
when it reported that average daily production in countries outside the
former Soviet bloc fell by another 500 tonnes in May to 38,900 tonnes. That
was the third successive monthly fall.
The fall has followed the agreement reached between some of the big
aluminium producing countries early this year to cut output so as to reduce
the huge stocks that have been depressing prices.
Oil prices weakened somewhat in early trading before recovering most of
their losses. The price of the benchmark Brent blend was Dollars 17.40 a
barrel in late London trading, near its Dollars 17.41 closing level last
Friday.
It fell to Dollars 17.18 at one point in the day, but traders said bullish
factors still dominated the market in spite of an apparent easing of tension
with North Korea, the main factor behind last week's price rally.
Coffee and cocoa futures fell sharply on profit-taking after last week's
gains. But trading volumes were thin, and there were bursts of buying in
coffee at lower levels.
At the London Commodity Exchange, the robusta contract for September
delivery ended Dollars 52 lower at Dollars 2,282 a tonne, well below the
morning peak of Dollars 2,362 but off the low of Dollars 2,257.
LCE Cocoa prices followed coffee's fall. The second position finished down
Pounds 14 a tonne at Pounds 1,022 after trading in a Pounds 30 range.

dollar

The US Treasury market was shaken yesterday by renewed pressure on the
dollar, but a sharp drop in commodity prices helped limit the damage to
bonds.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1/8 at
85 11/32 in light trading. The yield rose to 7.454 per cent, after flirting
with 7.50 per cent, the upper limit of its recent trading range, in the
morning. The two-year note was off  3/32 at 99 15/16 per cent, yielding 5.89
per cent.
Jitters over monetary policy, never too far from the surface in recent
weeks, resurfaced yesterday as the dollar's value eroded in the foreign
exchange markets.
The persistent weakness of the US currency has alarmed bond traders because
it could force the Fed to tighten monetary policy for the fifth time this
year, perhaps as early as next month. At least one Fed governor, Mr Lawrence
Lindsey, was on record as saying the dollar's decline had contributed to the
central bank's decision to lift rates last month.
Amid these misgivings, Treasuries moved moderately lower in early trading,
following through on overseas activity in which the yield on the long bond
tested the 7.50 per cent support level.
Later, bonds were given a sorely needed boost by reports that central banks
were quietly entering the foreign exchange markets to support the dollar.
US-denominated securities would benefit from the reinvestment of such
purchases.
But the bond market mostly benefited from the biggest one-day decline in
commodity prices in three years. Their sharp rise in recent weeks has
complicated the inflation outlook. A softer tone in gold, oil and other
products helped bonds trim their losses to modest levels as the afternoon
commenced. Later Treasuries nudged into positive ground, only to recede
again in the final hours of trading.
After last week's barrage of economic data, traders were looking ahead to a
rather quiet week. The most significant news is due on Thursday, with the
release of May durable goods orders and weekly figures on claims for
unemployment benefit.
The market is also facing a fresh influx of supply this week. The Treasury
is scheduled to auction Dollars 17bn in two-year notes today and Dollars
11bn in five-year securities tomorrow afternoon.
European government bond markets fell to new lows in volatile trading
yesterday, on weakness in US Treasuries, a falling dollar and worries over
rising inflation and talk of a global capital shortage.
After opening lower on the back of the mark-down in Treasuries on Friday,
markets rose in the afternoon on a technical squeeze before heading back
downwards. Futures trading dominated, with little activity reported in the
cash market.
Traders said many US-based investors took advantage of the weakness of the
dollar to switch from European into US assets. Dealers also reported
position-squaring by investors ahead of the end of the second quarter.
Although German government bonds were the least affected by the sell-off,
the September bund futures contract on Liffe fell by more than 1 point to a
new low for the year before settling around 90.33, down 0.78 points on the
day.
'The market is taking the worst-case scenario on inflation and interest
rates,' said Mr Ifty Islam, fixed income strategist at Merrill Lynch. 'They
are taking nothing on trust and want to see actual proof that (German) money
supply growth is under control and inflation is falling.' May M3 money
supply data are expected this week.
The French market was dragged down with the rest of Europe, with some added
political uncertainty following the resignation of Mr Michel Rocard as head
of the French Socialist party.
The September future contract settled at 122.84, down 0.94 points.
UK gilts also had a roller-coaster day, falling sharply on early selling in
the futures pits and recouping some of their losses on late short-covering.
In the absence of market-moving domestic news, gilts tracked international
markets lower. The September long gilt futures contract fell by about  7/8
points to 98 29/32 .
Italian bonds fell sharply early on but recovered somewhat on late
short-covering.
A sharp rise in the repo rate at the Bank of Italy's latest open-market
operations aggravated weak market conditions. The minimum rate rose to 8.05
per cent, from 7.75 per cent at the last repo and above the 8 per cent
Lombard rate. However, the central bank said this was an anomaly and it had
no intention of pushing rates higher.
Spanish bonds fared even worse, with the September 10-year futures contract
falling 2.3 points to 87.75. Its early plunge prompted the Spanish futures
exchange to widen its daily limit up or down for the contract to 300 basis
points from 200 points. The Spanish 10-year bond yield spread over bunds
widened to 362 basis points, from 336 points on Friday.
Japanese bonds took another tumble, dogged by jitters over domestic
politics, the rise in commodities prices, fears of an expanding budget
deficit and worries that economic recovery may lead to monetary tightening
by the Bank of Japan. Since May 30, the yield on the benchmark government
bond has risen by about 80 basis points to 4.51 per cent.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Treasury sets date for UK
privatised debt sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK Treasury's previously-announced sale of debt issued by privatised
companies will take place on July 18, Salomon Brothers, the US investment
bank acting for the Treasury, said yesterday.
The sale, which the Treasury hopes will raise between Pounds 1bn and Pounds
1.5bn, includes bonds issued by British Telecommunications, London
Electricity, Manweb, National Grid, National Power, Scottish Hydro and
Seeboard.
Issuers have been invited to submit firm offers to buy back their debt by
noon on July 18.
National Grid has pre-emption rights to repurchase the two bonds selected
for inclusion in the sale. If these rights are exercised the bonds will not
be available for sale to third parties.
The Treasury holds debt with a face value of Pounds 2.7bn issued by
privatised utilities.
This summer's sale of debt forms part of the Pounds 5.5bn privatisation
programme for 1994-95.
The programme, which was announced in last November's Budget, includes the
receipt of final payments for BT3 shares and the sale of remaining stakes in
the electricity generators.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Venezuela rating may fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Standard &amp; Poor's may lower the Republic of Venezuela's double-B minus debt
rating, which applies to the country's Dollars 2bn-worth of eurobonds.
The country's Brady bonds, consisting of Dollars 20bn of debt issued as part
of its 1990 commercial bank rescheduling agreement, are not rated.
The rating was placed on CreditWatch with negative implications due to 'the
disarray in the Caldera administration's economic policies (and) the
deepening crisis in the financial sector'.
The move comes at a time when other Latin-American countries, such as
Mexico, are hoping that their ratings will be raised.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Canada issue to replenish its reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh volatility in European government bonds brought new issuance in the
eurobond market to a virtual standstill yesterday, the only deal of note
being a Dollars 2bn issue of three-year eurobonds from Canada.
Syndicate managers said that while the pricing of the issue was correct,
they feared that the market would have difficulty in absorbing the bonds in
view of the latest sell-off in the markets and worries about the dollar.
They also questioned whether there was enough retail demand for short-dated
dollar bonds to ensure swift placement.
The Canadian finance ministry said the size of the offering would enable it
to become the new three-year benchmark in the eurodollar sector and would
ensure a liquid secondary market. The proceeds will replenish the country's
foreign exchange reserves following its recent sales of US dollars in the
foreign exchange market to protect the Canadian currency.
Lead managers Deutsche and UBS reported steady sales to investors in the Far
East and Europe. However, syndicate managers expected loose bonds coming
back into the market, especially from banks within the syndicate, to cause
the yield spread on the bonds to widen, even though the joint leads would be
under pressure to defend the spread. At launch the bonds were priced to
yield 17 basis points over three-year Treasuries and when they were freed to
trade the spread remained unchanged.
The market is looking ahead to Fannie Mae's first global bond offering, due
to be launched tonight to coincide with Tokyo trading hours. Pricing of the
Dollars 1.5bn issue of 10-year bonds is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon
London time. They are likely to be priced to yield around 23 basis points
over Treasuries.
Later in the week, UCB Group, a subsidiary of Compagnie Bancaire of France,
is likely to raise Pounds 250m to Pounds 300m through an offering of
mortgage-backed bonds through its special-purpose vehicle, Leo 2. J. P.
Morgan is believed to be handling the issue.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the international rating agency, has affirmed the
long-term debt ratings of Barclays Bank and its units (double-A for senior
debt, double-A minus for subordinated debt and single-A plus for junior
subordinated perpetual debt) and removed them from CreditWatch, where they
were placed in March. The rating outlook is stable.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Strong demand for Hungarian
offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary's largest initial public offering so far this year opened yesterday,
a 29 per cent state-owned tranche in pharmaceuticals producer Egis.
Part of the Dollars 44m issue is available on preferential terms in exchange
for 'compensation coupons,' special state securities granted to victims of
communist expropriation.
The issue met strong demand from local investors. Some compensation coupon
holders and speculators had begun queueing last Friday and police had to
intervene yesterday in Budapest to prevent scuffles and restore order to the
queues.
Foreign institutional investors, for whom 16 per cent of Egis is earmarked,
have also shown keen interest.
Although subscriptions for cash payment only begin today, early indications
are that the foreign component will be two to three times oversubscribed.
Egis shares have been priced at about half the Budapest Stock Exchange
average, at just 7.3 times forecast 1994 after-tax earnings of Ft1.87bn
(Dollars 18m).
The London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development bought a
30 per cent stake in Egis in December last year and the purchase price is
linked to the flotation value of the pharmaceutical company.
The EBRD will therefore pay Dollars 45m for its shareholding, bringing the
total raised in the privatisation of Egis to Dollars 89m and making the
complete transaction the largest so far in Hungary this year.
Egis will also become the second largest company on the Budapest Stock
Exchange when it gains a listing in the middle of July.
Lead manager for the Egis transaction is CS First Boston, the international
investment bank. CSFB and CA Securities, a subsidiary of Austria's
Creditanstalt group, have dominated Hungary's new issue market this year.
The Egis IPO is one of a series of equity issues by Hungarian drugs groups,
a sector in which the country is traditionally strong. Shares in Chinoin and
Pharmavit go on sale later this week.
Richter Gedeon, Hungary's largest pharmaceuticals company, is expected to
follow Egis on to the stock market next month in a transaction of comparable
value.
Schroders, the UK merchant bank and CA Securities are advising on the sale
of about 30 per cent of the company.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Goodman Fielder predicts
long-term margins growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Goodman Fielder, the large but ailing Australian foods group, should achieve
'long-term margins on sales of 9 to 10 per cent, across the business,' Mr
Barry Weir, chief executive told shareholders.
In a letter to investors, made public yesterday, Mr Weir said the target had
not been achieved. In the half-year to end-December, for example, GF
recorded sales revenues of ADollars 1.94bn (USDollars 1.49bn), and profits
before interest and tax from continuing operations of ADollars 130.3m for a
group margin of about 6.9 per cent.
But Mr Weir, who took over as chief executive six months ago, rejected the
notion there was a quick solution. He added that the problem could not be
solved simply by the 'straightforward cutting away and disposal of one or
two of our major business groups.
'Our closer analysis shows it is primarily a few specific geographic or
product segments within each major group which drag down overall
performance,' he said.
Mr Weir acknowledged that many industry observers saw GF as a
commodity-based food group - with products such as flour, bread, gelatine
and poultry, placing it at the competitive, lower value-added end of the
industry.
Therefore he acknowledged that making higher margins was more difficult to
achieve.
Mr Weir argued that the group needed to use 'innovative branding and
marketing' as well as concentrating on low-cost production, if it is to move
towards its target margins.
He outlined a four-point plan including:
Further 'non-core assets disposals,' although Mr Weir claims the bulk of
this process is complete;
Organisational restructuring, including integration of milling and baking
operations and moves to improve efficiency on the poultry side;
Encouraging industry rationalisation in particularly competitive areas, such
as baking;
Targeting Asia for long-term expansionary growth. Existing Asian businesses
will be brought under a single regional office, and several new ventures are
being 'evaluated'.
More generally, he added, Goodman was still looking for 'bolt-on'
acquisitions.
Mr Weir's letter follows a series of management departures from the food
group over the past year.
There has also been talk of large disposals or a takeover of the
underperforming group, but to date no suitors have emerged.
Goodman shares stood at ADollars 1.36, just cents off their 52-week low.

<TEXT>
Saudi Hollandi Bank, the Riyadh-based joint-venture bank 40 per cent owned
by ABN-Amro Bank, has won approval from the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority
to double its capital to SR420m (Dollars 113.5m), according to the official
Saudi Press Agency.
The bank said it would issue 2.1m bonus shares to existing shareholders,
paid for by the transfer of SR210m from reserves into the bank's capital.
Saudi Hollandi is set to become the last of Saudi Arabia's commercial banks
to recapitalise since the end of the Gulf war - during which period most
commercial banks have tapped a large influx of repatriated Saudi money in
the local stock market to issue new shares.
Saudi Investment Bank, the Kingdom's smallest, last week announced its plan
to double capital to SR180m through a bonus share issue.
Saudi Hollandi, which is completing a reorganisation and expansion, last
year reported a 34 per cent rise in net profits at SR180m.
Total assets at the end of the 1993 financial year stood at SR15bn.
Mr Sheldon Boege, the bank's managing director, recently forecast a 10-12
per cent rise in earnings in 1994.

Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest publicly quoted company, said yesterday Qatar
Fertilizer Company (Qafco), in which it holds a 25 per cent stake, is
planning to spend about Dollars 500m to nearly double capacity for ammonia
and urea production in Qatar.
Hydro and Qatar General Petroleum Company (QGPC), which holds the remaining
75 per cent of Qafco, are to expand annual ammonia production capacity to
1.3m tons from 750,000 tons and urea capacity to 1.55m tons from 820,000
tons.
The Oslo-based company said it had agreed to become project manager for the
expansion project.
Hydro said that a technical assistance agreement with Qafco had also been
extended for a 10-year period.
Qafco and Hydro also signed a 10-year marketing agreement, giving Hydro
marketing rights for ammonia and urea in China and East Africa where the
Norwegians are upgrading their sales and distribution network to meet
increasing demand.
'This expansion and related agreements combine QGPC's policy of increased
industrial development of Qatar's vast natural gas resources with Hydro's
requirement for a reliable product source destined for the growing
fertiliser markets in China and Africa,' Norsk Hydro said.
Norsk Hydro said its NKr4.74bn rights issue was oversubscribed, but it did
not yet know by how much, Reuters reports from Oslo.
'There is a clear oversubscription. This we can say already,' financial
director Mr Georg Stoermer told the agency.
The issue totals NKr23.68m ordinary shares at a price of NKr200 per share.
The subscription period in Norway was set from June 3-17.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Increasing cross-border competition within Nordic banking has led four of
the region's top banks to break up a 10-year-old co-operation deal.
The four - Unibank of Denmark, Union Bank of Finland, Den norske Bank of
Norway and Sweden's Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken - had handled each other's
interests in their respective markets under a venture called Scandinavian
Banking Partners.
At the height of the accord, they opened a joint venture in London called
the Scandinavian Banking Group, but this was bought out by SE-Banken in 1990
and merged with its existing London operation. Since then, the partnership
has been slimmed down to focus on a small range of business areas.
SE-Banken's move to open its own branches in Oslo and Helsinki, part of an
increasing trend among Nordic banks to move into neighbouring markets,
precipitated the decision finally to disband the partnership.
SE-Banken said no financial settlement was involved in the decision.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kvaerner profit up 36% despite
weak oil unit
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kvaerner, Norway's second largest stock market listed company, has increased
pre-tax profits by 36 per cent to NKr590m (Dollars 84.2m) in the first four
months of 1994 against the same period a year earlier.
The performance was aided by an upturn in unrealised foreign exchange gains
which almost doubled to NKr133m.
Operating revenue rose by 11 per cent to NKr8.7bn while operating profit
increased by 10 per cent to NKr399m.
But the results fell short of analysts' expectations of NKr500m.
Mr Erik Toenseth, president, predicted that profits for this year as a
whole, before unrealised currency items, would be on a par with last year's
NKr1.5bn.
The shipbuilding division lifted pre-tax profits to NKr406m from NKr246m on
turnover of NKr3.63bn, against NKr2.56bn.
The oil and gas division saw pre-tax profits more than halved to NKr57m from
NKr135 on revenues up to NKr2.47bn from NKr2.33bn.
The oil and gas division made an operating loss of NKr3m after a profit of
NKr116m last time, and is expected to post a weak overall result. Kvaerner
warned that the division was suffering losses on the Norwegian North Sea
Troll oil project.
The mechanical engineering division turned in a pre-tax profit of NKr16m,
against a loss of NKr33m, on sales which rose to Nkr1.62bn from NKr1.5bn.
Pre-tax profits of the pulping division tumbled to NKr25m from NKr53. The
shipping side lifted pre-tax profits to NKr95m from NKr21m on revenues which
increased to NKr395m from NKr337m.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Australian directors face share
register call
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities Institute of Australia, representing professionals working in
the nation's securities industry, has called on the Australian Stock
Exchange to set up a register of directors' shareholdings 'so that the
market can publicly track the stockmarket dealings of company directors'.
Directors of Australian companies are now required only to notify the
company involved if they buy or sell its shares, and there is no formal
requirement for them to tell the stockmarket generally.
The SIA is proposing that Australia follows the US model and places a legal
obligation on directors to notify the stock exchange of any share dealings.
The proposal is the latest in a series of moves by local fund-managers, the
ASX, and other market professionals, aimed at improving the corporate
governance and disclosure standards of the Australian market.
Mr Kerry Packer's Sky Channel has signed an agreement with the Australian
Jockey Club, allowing the former to beam Australian horse racing into Nevada
casinos from next month.
Mr David Dodds, Sky's managing director, said there will be a 90-day trial
of the satellite broadcasts, and linked betting operations. Racing in the US
ends in the early evening and the notion is that, because of the time
difference, Australian races could take over.

non-core sell-off

<TEXT>
Eli Lilly yesterday spelt out details of plans to shed its
non-pharmaceuticals businesses, including an initial public offering later
this year for a new medical devices company with sales of Dollars 800m.
In January, the US drugs company had indicated that it planned to group six
of its devices businesses into a single company for later sale. Under the
plan announced yesterday, though, one of these six, Ivac, would be sold
separately.
Lilly said this was because the company operated in a different market than
the others, and that it would benefit more from being bought by another
company. It added that it was in talks for the sale of the business, but
refused to name a potential buyer.
The remaining five businesses, all of which operate in the area of
cardiovascular or minimally invasive systems, will be floated in the fourth
quarter of this year, Lilly said. The intention is to sell 20 per cent of
the shares in this new company, to be known as Guidant, with the remaining
shares being distributed to Lilly shareholders within the following six
months.
This would either be done by issuing shares in the new company to existing
Lilly shareholders, or allowing Lilly shareholders to exchange some of their
shares for shares in the new company.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: IBM unveils large disk drive
products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines yesterday announced a family of innovative,
large-scale computer memories which it hopes will regain it the initiative
in the big disk drive business.
The world's largest computer manufacturer invented disk storage more than 30
years ago but its revenues from storage systems have been declining,
although it is still the dominant supplier. It is also facing fierce
competition.
IBM's latest storage systems are designed for mainframe computers and
feature high security and protection against failure. Called the Ramac Array
Family, they use a technology called Raid (redundant arrays of inexpensive
disks). IBM claims the drives are the first high-end disk storage systems
coupling high performance with fault tolerance.
A Raid system is a set of small low-cost drives which appears to the user as
if it were a single, expensive drive. The IBM drives have been developed to
the highest level of performance and reliability, known as Level 5.
According to IBM, the new drives take up only one-third the floor space and
use half the power and cooling of conventional mainframe disk storage.
The technology involved in Raid drives, while simple in principle, is
complex in practice. Storage Technology has only just launched its own Raid
system code-named Iceberg after several years of delayed development.
'While other storage vendors have sought to develop systems aimed at high
availability or high performance, we have taken the lead in providing what
our customers need by providing both,' said Mr Bill Nelson, director of
marketing in IBM's storage systems division.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: High-speed steels group rolls
toward flotation - Kenneth Gooding examines Eramet's plan for a year to
remember
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is a year to remember for Eramet, the French group which is the world's
biggest producer of both ferro-nickel and high-speed steels.
It has just put the finishing touches to a FFr2bn (Dollars 360m), five-year
investment programme and Mr Yves Rambaud, chairman and chief executive, says
that, as long as there is no collapse in share prices, Eramet will be listed
on the Paris bourse before the end of 1994.
A meeting on June 15 made the changes necessary to permit Eramet's
shareholders - ERAP, the French state holding company, with 70 per cent, Elf
Aquitaine of France and IMetal, the Paris-based industrial holding company,
with 15 per cent each - to reduce their holdings.
Eramet has embarked on a series of roadshows and Mr Rambaud says he expects
the first tranche, of up to 20 per cent the group, to be placed privately
with European institutional investors.
Banque Paribas has been retained for this exercise which he hopes will be
followed by full flotation in Paris. This would involve the present
shareholders selling at least another 10 per cent of Eramet to the public.
However, ERAP will still retain majority control of Eramet. This, says Mr
Rambaud, is to give comfort to the 2,000 people Eramet employs in New
Caledonia, the South Pacific island which contains the heart of Eramet's
nickel operations.
'The French government does not wish to give the impression it is ready to
desert them,' he says. In all, the group employs 3,400.
Dominating New Caledonia's economy is SLN (Societe Metallurgique Le Nickel),
82 per cent owned by Eramet. SLN dates back to 1880 and owns nickel mines
and a smelter on New Caledonia. Its new FFr800m Nepoin-Kope mine was
formally opened last month . While the mine was being developed, annual
capacity at SLN's smelter at Doniambo was boosted to 50,000 tonnes. Mr
Rambaud says that by spending modestly to remove bottlenecks, its capacity
could rise by 2,000 tonnes to 60,000 tonnes
Last year Eramet, ranked third among the world's nickel (as distinct from
ferro-nickel) producers with 8 to 10 per cent of the market, lifted output
from a depressed 40,750 tonnes to 46,310 tonnes. This year's output should
be between 48,000 and 50,000 tonnes.
A long-term relationship between SLN and Nisshin Steel has recently been
strengthened at the Japanese company's request. By October Nisshin will have
paid about FFr400m for 10 per cent of SLN and for a contract guaranteeing
Nisshin 10 per cent of SLN's output at a fixed price.
Mr Rambaud points out, however, that, although the Nisshin deal apparently
indicates a value of FFr4bn for SLN, the supply contract confuses the
arithmetic.
Nickel operations contributed 68 per cent of Eramet's total sales of
FFr2.63bn last year. World demand for nickel has been growing at more than 2
per cent a year, driven mainly by its use in stainless steel - a material
for which annual demand is growing by 4.3 per cent.
Stainless takes 62 per cent of all the nickel produced but accounts for 80
per cent of Eramet's output. Despite consistent demand, nickel prices last
year were the lowest for 20 years (with the exception of 1987) because the
market was distorted by a sudden surge in Russian exports to the west, up
from 40,000 tonnes a year in Soviet days to 120,000 tonnes.
Eramet's sudden emergence as the world's biggest producer of high-speed
steels - which have a value four times as great as stainless steel - dates
back to decisions in 1989 when, like other producers, it benefited from
extraordinarily high nickel prices.
The group decided to invest part of the proceeds in the New Caledonia
expansion and modernisation programme while beginning a search for a 'second
leg' or a logical industrial and geographic diversification. First it bought
Commentryene in France in 1991 and quickly merged it with Kloster Speedsteel
of Sweden. The total cost was FFr900m.
Mr Rambaud says Eramet found that the French and Swedes can work well
together.
The high-speed steels business has prospered under new ownership and a
unified international marketing team is doing better than when Kloster and
Commentryene were in competition separately.
The steel operations use no nickel to make their metal - employed for such
things as high-speed cutting tools. Eramet wanted to make sure it did not
compete with its customers, says Mr Rambaud.
Last year Eramet was one of the few nickel or steel groups to remain
profitable, if only just. It made net profits of FFr120m, down from FFr229m
in 1992 when there was an extraordinary gain of FFr100m.
More important, in Mr Rambaud's view, is that Eramet's cash flow remained
stable last year at FFr356m. The group's balance sheet remains strong, with
cash and near-cash of FFr1.3bn, compared with financial debts of FFr635m.
As the expansion programme has been completed, capital expenditure will come
down from last year's FFr531m (following a record FFr614m in 1992) to about
FFr300m in 1994 and even less next year.
Mr Rambaud says the nickel operations are in good shape - the group has at
least 40 years of reserves in New Caledonia and costs were reduced last year
by 15 per cent to 1980 levels in real terms.
Eramet last year could break even with the nickel price at Dollars 2.78 to
Dollars 2.80 a lb when the London Metal Exchange price averaged Dollars
2.40.
Eramet is likely to use its cash to add a third industrial 'leg'. Like the
high-speed steel operations, this will have to have technology and customers
with which the group's management are familiar but does not compete with
Eramet's present customers.
Mr Rambaud says that no list of likely candidates has yet been drawn up. He
explains: 'Our first priority is to arrange a smooth change in Eramet's
shareholders.'

Banca del Gottardo, the Lugano-based bank specialising in asset management,
is planning to raise new capital through a rights issue of 100,000
participation certificates.
Gottardo also said it was in talks with Sumitomo Bank of Japan, which holds
a controlling interest in the bank, about its wish to convert all its
participation certificates into bearer shares in 1996.
Conversion would mean that Sumitomo would have to make an additional
investment in Gottardo equity or see its holding diluted to under 50 per
cent.
Sumitomo holds 55 per cent of Gottardo's voting bearer shares and 12.4 per
cent of the non-voting participation certificates. This represents 44 per
cent of the bank's total equity capital.

<TEXT>
Caterpillar, the US heavy equipment maker, last night said the United Auto
Workers had rejected the company's offers to resume labour contract
negotiations and its offer to arbitrate a labour dispute.
The company also said the UAW was planning to call a strike at its plants
tonight.
Caterpillar made the announcement after talks on labour practice disputes
broke down between the two parties in Indianapolis.
It said the UAW demanded that the company reinstate workers who had been
discharged for what Caterpillar called illegal behaviour in some cases.
Mr Bill Casstevens, UAW secretary-treasurer said the union was still willing
to meet Caterpillar officials to resolve labour complaints.
The UAW's 14,000 workers at Caterpillar plants have been operating under a
company-imposed contract since they returned to work in April 1992 after a
163-day strike. Pressure within the union to resume the battle has increased
recently, as Caterpillar's profits and share price have risen.
The union last month rejected a new contract proposed by the company,
insisting on job guarantees.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Domos seeks partners for Mexico
telecoms venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Grupo Domos, the private Mexican company, plans to invest Dollars 4.3bn over
five years in Mexico's telecommunications sector in partnership with one or
more international telephone carriers. The group last week agreed to
purchase 49 per cent of Cuba's national telephone monopoly.
Domos will create a subsidiary in alliance with an international carrier and
domestic investors, according to Mr Pedro Sepulveda, chief executive. He
said Domos was in talks with four international carriers, one of which was
Bell South of the US.
The Domos subsidiary intends to build a long-distance telephone network in
Mexico, if granted a licence by the government. This would account for the
bulk of the Dollars 4.3bn investment. The company also plans to start a
basic wireless telephone system, and invest in mobile telecommunications,
value-added telephone services, and subscription television.
Mexico will open up its lucrative long-distance telephone market - currently
controlled by Telefonos de Mexico, the national telephone carrier - to
competition from August 1996. So far Banamex with MCI, Iusacell with Bell
Atlantic, and Grupo Alfa have indicated they will apply for long-distance
licences.
Grupo Financiero Serfin is in talks with Domos. Serfin, Mexico's third
largest bank, last week agreed to merge with Inverlat, the fourth largest.
Mr Javier Garza Calderon, the owner of Domos, is a shareholder and director
of Serfin.
Mr Sepulveda said an announcement on which foreign partner Domos had chosen
could be made in the next 10 days. Bell South already works with Domos in
wireless telephony in Mexico, and has shown interest in participating with
it in long-distance in Mexico, Domos chairman Mr Calderon Garza told Mexican
news service Infosel.
Mr Garza Calderon is a member of the wealthy Garza family in Monterrey, and
narrowly lost out in his bid to acquire Telmex from the government nearly
four years ago. Domos is believed to be well capitalised and, after recently
selling its stake in a cellular business to Motorola, has plenty of cash.
Last week Domos agreed to pay some Dollars 1.5bn over several years for 49
per cent of Emtel-Cuba, an investment which includes the cost of expanding
and modernising the island's dilapidated telephone network. Domos is looking
for a foreign partner in Cuba to provide telecommunications technology.
In the 1980s, Mr Garza Calderon's father unsuccessfully sought to seize
control of Grupo Visa, one of Mexico's largest conglomerates, from his
cousin, Eugenio Garza Laguera, in a family squabble that turned into a
bitter takeover battle. The father subsequently sold his stake in Visa to
the Garza Laguera family.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Goodyear spells out strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Goodyear chairman Mr Stanley Gault yesterday spelt out a new five-year plan
for the US tyre company, including a dividend policy under which it will pay
out between one-fifth and one-quarter of the previous year's earnings.
Mr Gault, who recently agreed to stay with the company until the end of 1995
rather than retire at the end of this year, has been behind a strong
recovery since joining Goodyear three years ago.
Targets set at that time have been met ahead of plan, allowing the new
financial goals.
Goodyear has lifted its dividend from 5 cents a quarter in 1991 to 15 cents
now, after a share split last year. At the current level, it will pay out
Dollars 120m in dividends this year - close to a third of last year's net
income of Dollars 388m, and ahead of the new dividend policy spelt out
yesterday.
With the US automotive industry performing strongly, though, Goodyear's
after-tax earnings are widely expected to rise to between Dollars 560 and
Dollars 570m this year.
Targets set yesterday include a reduction in the company's gearing, from 40
per cent to 25-30 per cent by the end of 1998. Goodyear's debt has already
come down to Dollars 1.4bn, from Dollars 3.7bn in 1991.
Sales are targeted to grow at between 4.5 and 5 per cent a year until the
end of 1998, twice the projected rate of growth in the tyre industry as a
whole, Mr Gault said.
Goodyear's shares lost Dollars 1 1/4 on the day.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Smart card standards agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three leading international payment card organisations yesterday agreed the
first of three sets of common technical specifications for 'chip' or 'smart'
cards.
The payments groups - Europay international, Mastercard International and
Visa International - plan to agree full specifications before the end of the
year.
The move marks a further step towards the introduction of chip cards that
operate across borders and systems. It enables manufacturers to begin work
on microprocessor chips in payment cards.
Yesterday's agreement covers the electrical and mechanical specifications
for making chip cards and for point-of-sale terminals. The second part will
define how the chip card and terminal will together deliver the services to
the card-holder, while the last phase should deal with how a transaction
would be completed.
The initiative stems from the organisations' decision in December to work on
developing global standards for chip cards.
Separately, Visa has agreed with a number of bank-led groups to try to
devise international standards for 'electronic purse' cards.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Lotus issues warning of sharp
drop in earnings
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Lotus Development, the US software company, are expected to come
under pressure today following a profits warning issued late yesterday.
It said earnings per share in the three months to the end of June were
likely to be 20-25 cents, compared with 34 cents a year ago (before a
one-off charge.) Analysts had been expecting earnings of nearly 50 cents a
share for the latest quarter.
Lotus blamed the revision on delays in upgrades to a number of its products.
These upgrades will now be released in July and August, the company said,
leading to what it predicted would be a strong performance in the second
half of the year.
For the year as a whole, Lotus predicted earnings per share of Dollars
1.80-Dollars 2, lower than its previous forecast of Dollars 2-Dollars 2.15.
The company's shares have already fallen sharply in recent months, closing
on Monday at Dollars 51 3/8 , having lost 40 per cent of their value since
the middle of March.
Although first quarter earnings were up by nearly three-quarters on a year
before, sales growth in the first three month of the year was below market
expectations, adding to fears that the company was losing out to Microsoft
in applications software sales.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Comcast to pay Dollars 1.27bn
for Maclean Hunter unit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Comcast, the US telecommunications group, has agreed to buy the cable
television operations of Maclean Hunter, the Canadian communications and
media group, for Dollars 1.27bn in cash.
The acquisition is the latest big deal in the consolidation of the US cable
TV market, which is becoming rapidly dominated by a few large operators. Two
weeks ago, Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises paid Dollars 2.3bn for Times
Mirror's cable TV unit.
Comcast is buying the cable interests of Maclean Hunter, which include
services and operations for about 550,000 subscribers in New Jersey,
Michigan and Florida, from Maclean Hunter's parent, Rogers Communications,
Canada's largest cable TV group.
Rogers bought Maclean Hunter three months ago for Dollars 2.2bn. Rogers said
then it would sell Maclean Hunter's US cable operations.
The purchase will make Comcast the third largest cable TV operator in the US
with 3.5m subscribers, behind TCI, which has 10m sub-scribers, and Time
Warner, with 7m. Comcast also provides cellular telephone services to more
than 7.4m people.
Mr Brian Roberts, president of Comcast, said: 'For some time, we have
considered Maclean Hunter's systems to be a logical strategic extension of
Comcast's cable business. The acquisition allows us to increase our presence
in three of the top 15 television markets.'
Comcast's purchase, however, has several regulatory hurdles to overcome. Not
only is the deal subject to US government approval, but Rogers' acquisition
of Maclean Hunter is also awaiting approval in Canada, where the federal
Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and the Bureau of
Competition are likely to scrutinise the merger between the country's two
largest cable TV operators.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Krupp Hoesch breaks up steel
side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Krupp Hoesch, Germany's second biggest steelmaker, has broken its steel
division into several independent companies in a further effort to push the
business back into profit.
The decision was approved at an extraordinary meeting of the supervisory
board on Sunday, in spite of protests by the IG Metall union. It is angry
that workers will have less say in the running of the business.
Three new companies will be created for special steel flat products, special
heavy sections, and long products. A fourth unit - tin plate - will become a
joint venture run by Thyssen, Germany's biggest steelmaker.
Ostensibly, the changes fit the strategy outlined by Mr Gerhard Cromme,
chief executive, who has repeatedly argued that separate companies were
needed to manage the various steel products, because their market conditions
were so different.
However, sources said the changes would also make further jobs cuts easier,
as the independent companies would no longer be subject to the rules of
Montanmitbestimmung, a form of workers' co-determination in the German coal
and steel industry. The system is seen as an obstacle to faster
restructuring of the industry.
Managers at the independent companies have already indicated they will need
far fewer staff to service overheads. This means that up to 1,000 of the
3,600 people working in administration at the existing steel division will
lose their jobs.
Management is also likely to be more effective. 'Each company will have to
meet their own costs,' said Mr Jurgen Claasen, the Krupp Hoesch spokesman.
'In the past, everything in the steel division went into one big pot and it
was difficult to tell what was working well and what was not.'
Krupp first mounted an unusually secretive bid to take over Hoesch, its
long-standing rival, in 1992. The dust had hardly settled on that
acrimonious merger when it was decided to close the integrated steelworks at
Rheinhausen, prompting massive union protests and further job cuts.
The going is still tough in spite of the overhaul. The steel division is one
of six divisions within the Krupp Hoesch group, representing about 35 per
cent of external sales. However, the DM780m (Dollars 481.5m) loss it
reported last year was its biggest, and it is expected to incur another
deficit this year.
Diluting workers' rights is likely to make life easier for management. The
extensive workers' rights which exist in the German steel industry is the
main reason why Riva, the private Italian group, pulled out of its planned
purchase of Eko Stahl, the ailing east German steelmaker.
The law says Montanmitbestimmung can only exist in companies whose primary
purpose is to make steel. It, therefore, does not apply to companies who are
merely 'processing' steel, as Mr Claasen puts it.
IG Metall, however, says its lawyers are checking the decision with a view
to taking the company to court. It argues that workers' co-determination
must be guaranteed in companies which operate any form of warm production or
rolling mills.
The German steel federation said yesterday steel production in the first six
months of 1994 had risen 9 per cent above the that for same period the year
before. Orders were up 12 per cent.
However, it warned that much of the new steel was being used to fill
stockpiles, or was being exported. It said steel consumption in the
all-important German market - which accounts for about 60 per cent of
production - had risen just 1.5 per cent in the first six months.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Forestry group makes turnround
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kymmene, the Finnish forestry group, returned a FM176m (Dollars 32.5m)
profit after financial items in the four months to the end of April, a sharp
turnround from a FM164m loss (restated) made in the same period last year.
The improvement was partly due to lower financial expenses stemming from
reduced interest charges. Net financial expenses fell to FM460m from FM657m.
Sales moved up to FM5.94bn from FM5.64bn, while group operating profit
reached FM604m, compared with FM491m last time.
The figures for last year were restated to conform with a shift to European
Union-based accounting principles.
Kymmene said markets for forest products had 'clearly improved' during the
first four months, with prices increasing for fine papers and chemical pulp.
It added that it expected improvements in earnings in chemical pulp, panels
and sawn timber by the year end.
The company said operating profits for the full year would be ahead of last
year's FM1.58bn surplus.
Kymmene spent FM295m on capital projects during the first four months and
expected capital investment in production facilities to reach FM1.3bn for
the year as a whole.
The projects include two oxygen bleaching plants, an expansion of plywood
output, the rebuilding of a paper mill and anti-air pollution projects at
two chemical pulp mills.

telecoms race
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Grupo Domos, the private Mexican telecommunications company, plans to apply
for a long-distance telephone licence in Mexico as part of an alliance with
Grupo Financiero Serfin, Mexico's third largest bank, and a large
international telephone carrier. Domos last week agreed to purchase 49 per
cent of Cuba's national telephone company.
Bell South already has an alliance with Domos, and it may be the
international carrier with which Domos is now negotiating.
Domos and its partners plan to form a new subsidiary which will invest more
than Dollars 4bn in Mexico's telecommunications sector, Mr Javier Garza
Calderon, company chairman, told the Mexican news service Infosel. Apart
from applying for a long-distance telephone licence in Mexico, the company
is considering investing in a basic wireless telephone system in the
country, in mobile telecommunications, value-added services, and in
subscription television.
Mexico will open up its long-distance telephone market - currently
controlled by Telefonos de Mexico, the national telephone carrier - to
competition from August 1996. So far, Banamex with MCI, Iusacell with Bell
Atlantic, and Grupo Alfa have expressed interest in applying for a licence.
Bancomer, the second largest bank, is reported to be looking for a foreign
partner before declaring its interest.
Although Domos has plenty of money, having recently sold its cellular
interests in the north of Mexico to Motorola, the US company, its ambitious
investment plans will almost certainly need a substantial injection of new
capital.
Domos is controlled by Mr Garza Calderon, a member of the extremely wealthy
Garza family in Monterrey and a director of Serfin. In the 1980s, Mr Garza
Calderon's father unsuccessfully sought to seize control of Grupo Visa, one
of Mexico's largest conglomerates, from his cousin, Eugenio Garza Laguera,
in a family squabble that turned into a bitter takeover battle.
Last week, Domos agreed to pay some Dollars 1.5bn over several year years
for 49 per cent of Emtel-Cuba. The investment includes the cost of expanding
and modernising the island's dilapidated telephone network. Domos is looking
for a foreign partner in Cuba to provide telecommunications technology.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Repola back in black with FM737m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Repola, Finland's largest industrial group, swung to a pre-tax profit of
FM737m (Dollars 135.7m) in the four months to end of April from a loss
(restated) of FM13m in the same period in 1993. The result consolidates a
recovery that took hold last year.
The improvement stemmed in part from a fall in financial expenses, to FM441m
from FM851m, as interest charges tumbled.
Repola, whose operations include forestry, forestry machines and other
associated production, said reduced financial expenses would help drive a
considerable improvement in full-year profits from last year's pre-tax
figure of FM29m. Repola restated its 1993 figures to reflect accounting
changes made to conform with EU directives.
Group sales were barely changed in the first four months at FM9.16bn,
compared with FM9.14bn last time.
Turnover was held back by a strengthening of the Finnish markka this year,
and restructuring moves in 1993. Overseas operations accounted for 86 per
cent of sales.
Operating profit, however, was well ahead, reaching FM1.1bn against FM838m.
Much of this was attributed to unexpectedly better profits at United Paper
Mills, the forestry unit. UPM sales were up 4 per cent at FM6.12bn, but
operating profit moved up more sharply, to FM906m from FM756m.
Repola said although economic recovery in Europe was strengthening demand
for paper, prices were still restrained by oversupply. Meanwhile,
manufacturers would face rising raw material costs for paper and sawn timber
production towards the end of the year.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Daf's bank creditors likely to
get full pay-out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Bank creditors to Daf NV, the Dutch truckmaker which collapsed in 1993, have
received nearly 90 per cent of what they were owed and are likely to be
compensated in full.
A report by the Dutch receivers said it was realistic to assume that Daf
NV's 11 bank creditors would receive the full Fl 732.5m (Dollars 400m)
claimed. On May 1, they had received Fl 645.7m, or 88 per cent of the total,
after three payments.
Daf sought protection from creditors in February 1993. It was later
resurrected in slimmed-down form as Daf Trucks NV, that excluded Leyland
Daf, the former Daf's UK business. Shareholders in the old Daf NV were left
holding worthless shares.
The money raised for bank creditors has been generated mainly by the sale of
assets owned by three Daf NV subsidiaries. These assets, pledged as
collateral to the banks during Daf's financial crisis, have been sold to Daf
Trucks.
The second main source of money is the transfer of funds from the UK
receivers of Leyland Daf. Holders of a bond issued by Daf NV in 1988 have
lodged claims of Fl 157m, and they have sought, unsuccessfully, to win a
share of the assets belonging to these subsidiaries.
Daf's largest bank creditor, ABN Amro of the Netherlands, had received Fl
294.6m of its claim of Fl 32.6m by May 1 1994, the receivers' report said.
Among UK bank creditors, Lloyds Bank had received Fl 48.5m out of Fl 54.8m
claimed, NatWest Fl 37.8m out of Fl 42.5m and Barclays Fl 25.5m out of Fl
28.8m.
The receivers' figures, published in an interim report, are exclusive of
interest and facility fees.
The debts of the Daf Finance Group, the former Daf financing arm, have been
reduced to Fl 1.06bn from Fl 1.86bn, reflecting the strategy of gradually
selling the finance company's portfolio.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Glaxo faces further challenge to
Zantac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The challenge to the world's best-selling drug, ulcer treatment Zantac, made
by the UK company Glaxo, intensified yesterday when a second company said it
would launch a generic version of the drug at the end of next year.
Canada's Novopharm has applied to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
for approval to sell a version of Zantac, whose patent expires in December
1995.
Glaxo said it may file a patent infringements suit against Novopharm.
At stake are the Dollars 2bn a year revenues that Zantac makes in the US
alone. Total Zantac sales are Dollars 3.5bn a year.
The active ingredient, ranitidine, exists in two versions. The older Form 1
is patent protected until December 5 1995 in the US but is unstable, says
Glaxo. Zantac is made of Form 2 under patent protection until 2002.
In April Glaxo filed a lawsuit against Geneva, a US subsidiary of Swiss drug
company Ciba, which like Novopharm plans to market Form 1. It alleged
infringement of Form 2 patents in both the manufacturing and the final
product.
Mr Leslie Dan, president of Novopharm, said that there were several ways of
making ranitidine. Novopharm's was different from that used by Glaxo and 'we
checked out that there was no production of Form 2', he said.
Novopharm filed its application with the FDA on June 10. If Glaxo takes
legal action within 45 days of that date, the launch of the drug can be
delayed for 30 months.
Mr Dan said Novopharm and Glaxo lawyers were in talks. He would not comment
on whether Novopharm had devised or would manufacture the Form 1 version.
Novopharm is still awaiting the outcome of court action surrounding Form 2's
patent. One of the company's arguments was that Form 1 could not be made
without producing Form 2, which therefore should not have separate patents.
Glaxo filed suits in April against Union Quimico Farmaceutica, a Spanish
subsidiary of Holliday Chemical Holdings, a UK distributor.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: P&amp;P lifts Bridge Oil bid as
another suitor enters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The bidding war for Bridge Oil, the Australian oil and gas group, sprang
into life yesterday, when Texas-based Parker &amp; Parsley increased its offer
from 70 cents to 80 cents a share - and was promptly trumped by a new
suitor.
The new bidder, whose 85 cents a share offer values Bridge at ADollars
356.7m (USDollars 262m) and was recommended by the Bridge Oil board, is a US
partnership called Joint Energy Development Investments. Jedi, in turn, is
owned by US-based Enron, the rapidly growing natural gas company, and the
California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), one of the biggest
public pension funds in the US.
Jedi, using a newly-formed company called Gantry as its bid vehicle, entered
the fray within minutes of the announcement of the increased offer from
Parker &amp; Parsley yesterday morning.
P&amp;P, whose opening bid for Bridge was announced last month and which holds a
4.2 per cent interest in its target, had been widely expected to raise its
terms. Announcing its new offer, P&amp;P said it was waiving all conditions to
its bid.
However, within minutes of the news, the rival Jedi offer was unveiled, and
Bridge shares quickly rose to the new bid price of 85 cents. Jedi did not
own any shares in its target ahead of the announcement, but Macquarie
Equities, the equities division of Macquarie Bank, the Sydney-based
institution, is understood to have picked up about 10m Bridge shares in the
market - about 2.5 per cent of the oil and gas company's equity. Macquarie
Bank is advising Jedi.
P&amp;P said all options remained open. 'We were serious in our intent and we
remain serious,' Mr Herb Williamson, executive vice-president, commented.
'Any and all options remain open . . . price being one of them.'
The Bridge board is recommending the Jedi bid in the absence of any higher
offer, in spite of the fact that a valuation of the company by Grant Samuel
put Bridge Oil shares at between 95 cents and ADollars 1.13.
Jedi was set up in 1993 with capital of USDollars 500m. Ownership is split
equally between Calpers and Enron, although the latter, via a subsidiary
company, is the general partner.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Cautious steps in a new
direction - Andrew Hill outlines Cariplo's plans to come to the stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cariplo, Italy's contender for the title of the world's largest savings
bank, looks the part. Its headquarters is one of the most imposing buildings
in central Milan and its chairman, Mr Sandro Molinari, is of equally solid
construction.
This is just as well, because from July 11, Cariplo is hoping that investors
will stump up as much as L1,650bn (Dollars 1bn) for new shares in the bank,
taking it on to the stock market for the first time since its foundation in
1823.
However, Mr Molinari, who launches a European investment roadshow to promote
the issue this Thursday, knows he will need to offer more than a firm
handshake and a century and a half of history to get potential investors to
open their cheque books.
He took over as chairman in April after his predecessor stepped down facing
corruption charges. That allowed Mr Molinari, 61, to become the first
fully-fledged banker-chairman of the Milan-based group. He joined Cariplo in
1954 and rose through the ranks. All his predecessors and their deputies
were political appointees, mainly Christian Democrats.
What is more, Mr Molinari knows that if his sales pitch falls flat this
time, it will be particularly difficult to push through the sale of a second
tranche of shares, in the form of a convertible bond issue expected before
the end of this year.
Cariplo is the latest bank to take advantage of 1990 legislation which
allows public-sector banks - many owned by charitable foundations - to
restructure and float up to 49 per cent of the capital of their banking
operations. The two-stage issue should raise well over L2,500bn and reduce
the Cariplo foundation's stake in the bank to about 78 per cent.
With total assets of L150,893bn, and deposits of L122,536bn, the Cariplo
group is bigger than the next five biggest Italian savings banks put
together. But analysts stress that it is a high-quality bank. In the
fast-changing Italian banking field it can no longer be compared only with
small savings banks, they say, but counts as a full-service universal bank,
competing with, for example, the newly privatised Banca Commerciale Italiana
and Credito Italiano.
Geographically, Cariplo - short for Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie
Lombarde - is dependent on the wealthy Lombardy region, which accounts for
some 70 per cent of the bank's 700 or so branches. But it has taken
advantage of its knowledge of the savings bank sector to build strategic
alliances with its counterparts in other regions.
By buying minority stakes in about 15 savings banks throughout the country,
Cariplo has gained access to a further 700 branches. Through these it can
sell its insurance, fund management and mortgage products nationwide. The
group has bought a stake in Imi, the recently privatised financial services
group, raising expectations that the two companies might link up in due
course to offer home-grown competition to Mediobanca, the powerful Milan
merchant bank.
For now, analysts prefer to compare Cariplo with conservative counterparts
such as Lloyds Bank in the UK - which has also concentrated on retail
business, and links between banking and insurance - or Credit Agricole in
France, which has a similar mix of businesses.
They underline Cariplo's cautious lending policy. The Milan bank was one of
the first into the Italian personal loan market, picking its risks very
carefully, while certain competitors launched themselves into business
lending with abandon, and are over-exposed to big, bad corporate loans.
Although unknown on international equity markets, Cariplo is recognised
outside Italy as an issuer of high-quality debt, and has one of the best
credit ratings among Italian banks, equal to that of the Italian republic.
'We never looked for results at all costs, but gradual growth,' says Mr
Molinari, about the strategy he has supervised since 1983 as deputy chief
executive, chief executive and chairman. It is a strategy, which has brought
results - group net profit last year rose 4.2 per cent to L323bn - and the
admiration of analysts for the straight-forward approach. 'They're very
plain vanilla about their market,' says one.
The bank is clearly upset, therefore, that its plain vanilla attitude should
have got mixed up with the rather more exotic flavours of Italy's widespread
corruption scandals. Mr Roberto Mazzotta, Mr Molinari's predecessor, stepped
down in February after Milan magistrates deepened their investigation into
allegations of phoney property transactions involving the Cariplo pension
fund. He has suspended himself from chairmanship of the bank's controlling
foundation, and is awaiting a decision on whether he will stand trial.
His successor firmly rejects any suggestion that the affair will have
knock-on effects on the bank or the fund. It is a personal, rather than
corporate problem, says Mr Molinari. Moreover, he points out that Cariplo's
internal investigation, aided by outside experts, produced no evidence that
procedures for valuing property had been infringed, or that the bank or
pension fund had suffered any damage.
As for the legacy of political control, Mr Molinari is adamant that 'the
structure of the bank and the staff of the bank were never politicised'. To
underline his desire that the bank should remain apolitical, the new
chairman has rebuffed Mr Umberto Bossi, the strident northern politician,
who has suggested that his federalist Northern League could now step into
the shoes of the Christian Democrats and adopt Cariplo as the pet financial
institution of a more autonomous northern Italy.
In theory, the League could achieve this ambition, if it were to consolidate
political power in its northern heartland, because directors of Cariplo's
controlling foundation are appointed by local and regional Lombard
authorities. These rules used to allow local parties to reward the faithful
with boardroom seats, and direct the foundation's statutory charitable
contributions towards clubs and associations with party links.
In practice, the League's support is wavering in the north, and in any case,
local authorities have tended in recent years to nominate neutral directors,
such as professors.
If that means a Cariplo chairman is free to manage the bank, then Mr
Molinari's satisfaction at rising from branch level to the top job will be
complete.

deal

<TEXT>
Gas Natural, the Spanish domestic natural gas distributor which is
controlled by the partially-privatised Repsol energy and chemicals
conglomerate, has completed the delayed takeover of Enagas, Spain's
government-owned monopoly gas importer.
The acquisition, priced at Pta51.2bn (Dollars 379m) for 91 per cent of
Enagas, turns Gas Natural into a leading participant among European gas
companies.
The takeover had first been signalled nine months ago but had been delayed
over pricing disagreements - the government had sought Pta80bn-Pta120bn for
the sale of Enagas - and by Repsol's insistence that it would not take on
the burden of a pipeline that Enagas was constructing between Spain and the
Algerian gas fields.
To complete the deal, Enagas has put the Pta300bn pipeline project into a
separate company that remains under public ownership and which Gas Natural
has an option to buy in 2000.

FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Improving market lifts Imry to Pounds 18.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imry Holdings, the property company that was taken over by Barclays after
one of the biggest debt write-downs in corporate history, yesterday
announced a return to profitability.
It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 18.3m for the 12 months ended March,
compared with a loss of Pounds 24.5m last time.
Net assets increased by 26 per cent from Pounds 71m to Pounds 89.3m, while
gross property assets rose from Pounds 290m to Pounds 367m.
Mr Martin Myers, chief executive, said he believed that 'Imry is well placed
to take advantage of a generally improving market, which I expect to
continue for the next few years'.
Mr Myers said Barclays did not intend to continue to own Imry in the long
term, although there were no immediate plans to float the company. 'We are
not really thinking about it. We are too busy building up the company,' he
said. Barclay's involvement in Imry stems from 1989 when it financed a
leveraged takeover.
During the year, Imry bought Pounds 145m of property, while sales totalled
Pounds 39.6m. The largest deal - in partnership with GE Capital - was the
acquisition of 77 properties for Pounds 112m. This was funded by loans from
GE Capital, Barclays Bank and Imry Property Holdings. It also bought 13
development properties for Pounds 5.9m from General Accident.
Following the year end, Imry has reached agreement with Southampton City
Council to develop a 30 acre site in the centre of the city into retail
warehouses and a 500,000 sq ft retail scheme.
No dividend is proposed.

FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Growth by successful targeting - Andrew
Bolger looks at how Castrol has expanded worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Can Castrol keep it up? The famous brand is the centre of the lubricants
business which is mainly responsible for the buoyant performance of Burmah
Castrol in recent years.
While the group's chemicals, liquified natural gas, fuels and energy
businesses have all suffered during the recent recession, Castrol's profits
have maintained a compound annual growth rate of 14 per cent since 1985,
except for a flat patch in 1990 caused by the Gulf conflict.
Operating profits from the lubricants side increased last year by 22 per
cent, and now contribute two thirds of group profits. This steady growth has
helped offset disappointment over Burmah's purchase in 1990 of the
metallurgical chemicals businesses of Foseco for Pounds 260m.
The group has admitted - with hindsight - that it paid too much for a
business which had to be shrunk after the foundries it services plunged into
recession. In spite of this, Burmah Castrol's shares have outperformed the
market by 44 per cent since the beginning of 1992.
Castrol has increased sales at a compound annual rate of almost 6 per cent,
although the world lubricants market has been relatively flat over the last
10 years.
The group has a high marketing spend, sponsoring rallying, Formula 1 racing
and the Indy Car Series in the US. Television adverts encourage motorists to
cosset their engine by paying a bit more for the 'liquid engineering' of
Castrol's high-margin GTX brand, rather than a standard lubricant.
One of its greatest marketing successes has been in the US, where over the
last 10 years Castrol has raised its share of the DIY lubricants markets
from 5 per cent to more than 15 per cent - just behind the market leader,
Pennzoil.
Castrol has also spent Dollars 20m (Pounds 13m) on launching a synthetic
motor oil in the US, targeted at the enthusiast and the more technically
advanced end of the American market. In spite of selling at nearly four
times the price of ordinary lubricants, Syntec has been well received and is
expected to move into profit this year.
Although such products may never gain a large share of the market, the
establishment of 'flagship' products allows Castrol to create gradations in
the market of two or three products at intermediate prices.
Castrol has operations in 50 countries and sells to 100 more. Some of its
greatest successes have been in developing countries, where economic growth
has fuelled consumption. Last year Thailand came sixth in Castol's profits
league - one step above the UK.
In Asia, Castrol is targeting what it calls the 'have somes' - consumers
with annual incomes of more than Dollars 18,000 per household. It estimates
there are currently 56m to 60m in this category, and the figure could swell
to 300m by the end of the century.
Castrol says this group has emerged as the real middle class in Asia and has
typical middle class aspirations - it wants to buy houses, cars and consumer
durables. Right under this level are the 'near haves', which could be as
many as 600m by 2000.
Mr Ian Pringle, Castrol's Asia director, says: 'The 'have somes' are key to
Castrol because they buy vehicles. But so too are the 'near haves' because
this group are likely to buy a motorcycle as their first vehicle'.
Mr Pringle says one of the most striking features of consumer demand in Asia
is what he calls leapfrogging: the rapid assimilation of technology which
allows people to go from having no telephone to a mobile cellular phone; or
from no radio to owning a compact disc hi-fi system.
He also believes that a certain degree of brand loyalty remains with
consumers when the 'near haves' graduate to cars. It is because of this that
Castrol has made the motorcycle market the nucleus of its entry strategy in
Thailand and Vietnam.
Castrol started modestly in Thailand in 1972 in a joint venture with a local
distributor, but was inhibited through the seventies and much of the
eighties by government price controls. It therefore concentrated on
establishing a distribution network, and on building its image among the
motorcycling population, despite the profit restrictions.
When, during the late eighties, the number of motorcycles in Thailand leapt
from 1m to 5m, Castrol was well positioned and now holds the leading share
of the motorcycle market. The number of cars doubled between 1980 and 1990,
and Castrol has the biggest share in the franchised workshop business.
Hanging on has also proved a lucrative strategy in India, now Castrol's
third most profitable market after the US and Germany. Castrol established a
branch office there in 1919 and stayed on even when a wave of
nationalisation in the seventies caused all of its main competitors to quit.
It kept the Castrol name in front of the Indian public by floating 60 per
cent of the subsidiary's equity on the Bombay stock exchange and maintaining
management control.
When liberalisation came in 1991, Castrol was able to exploit its strong
image and distribution network. Volume has grown by 50 per cent in the last
two years and Castrol now has nearly 10 per cent of India's lubrication
market.
Mr Tim Stevenson, chief executive of Castrol, emphasises that Castrol is not
just about automotive products, although they do account for 78 per cent of
profits. The remainder comes from industrial and marine lubricants, both of
which are targeted for further growth.
Mr Stevenson told a recent meeting of institutions and analysts he was
confident that Castrol would 'prove wrong the sceptics who for years have
been arguing that Castrol is a maturing business, liable to get snuffed out
by the oil major dinosaurs'.

FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Eldridge Pope expands estate with Hovetop
buy

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eldridge Pope, the USM-traded brewer and wine shipper, is expanding its pub
estate through the acquisition of Hovetop, which runs 22 houses, mainly in
Bristol and along the Thames Valley.
The vendors are Mr Michael Collins, a director of Eldridge Pope, and Mr M
Jackson. Initial consideration of Pounds 2.6m in cash and shares will be
adjusted either way to between Pounds 2.15m and Pounds 3.3m depending on
Hovetop's performance in the 12 months to end-April 1995.
Mr Christopher Pope, chairman, said the purchase would increase the managed
estate by more than 20 per cent, enlarge its catchment area and increase the
food element. Some 40 per cent of Hovetop's turnover of Pounds 2.8m in the
year to April 2 comprised food sales.
He anticipated 'significant cost savings' within the Hovetop estate,
'particularly in the areas of distribution, administration and central
overheads'.
Eldridge Pope, best known for its Thomas Hardy and Royal Oak brands,
recently announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 606,000 for the half to March
31, on turnover of Pounds 17.3m.

Pilot Investment Trust, the smaller companies fund, reported a net asset
value of 141.6p per ordinary share and 107.8p per C share at the March 31
period end.

end some 80 per cent of this had been invested, the directors said.
The C shares were converted on May 31 1994 into 11.5m ordinary shares, which

Pounds 6.88m (Pounds 5.33m) for pre-tax losses down from Pounds 359,000 to
Pounds 90,000.
Its biggest activity is the provision of timber products to housebuilders.

Electronic Data Processing, the computing services company, reported pre-tax
profits down from Pounds 2.34m to Pounds 2.06m for the half year to March
31. Turnover fell from Pounds 7.35m to Pounds 7.18m.
The company attributed the fall to continuing pressure on hardware prices,
tough trading conditions and reduced interest income of Pounds 251,000

company is seeking to acquire compatible software businesses.

were dependent on a more 'realistic' attitude to pricing on the part of the

FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Chains side behind Renold's advance to
Pounds 6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renold, the chain and gear manufacturer, more than doubled its dividend
after reporting a fivefold increase in profits.
For the year to April 2, pre-tax profits were Pounds 6m on sales of Pounds
130m, up from a previous Pounds 1.2m on sales of Pounds 125m. The shares
closed yesterday up 4 1/2 p at 145 1/2 p.
Mr David Cotterill, chief executive, said the group had succeeded in
bringing in the profits and generating significant cash with little increase
in sales. At least Pounds 4m of the increase in sales represented currency
gains.
There were modest signs of recovery in Europe, which he hoped would lead to
increased volumes this year. 'There is some fire in the order book at the
moment,' he said.
The profits were struck after Pounds 1m of redundancy costs, mainly in
Germany, compared with Pounds 1.4m last time. They were helped by a
turnround in the Milnrow gears business after two years of losses.
However, chains remain the group's chief earner, accounting for 60 per cent
of sales. Productivity gains and marketing focused on higher margin goods
were behind the strong improvement in the UK, said Mr Cotterill.
The fact that most of the profits increase arose in the UK, where tax losses
are available, led to a substantially lower tax charge of 18 per cent,
compared with 50 per cent last time.
Capital expenditure was Pounds 3.5m, below depreciation of Pounds 5m. Mr
Cotterill said spending would increase to Pounds 5m this year, much of it at
Holroyd, which makes rotors used in air conditioning and refrigeration.
Holroyd has won a long-term contract with a leading US compressor
manufacturer, commencing next January.
Net interest payable fell from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 1.4m, and gearing was
reduced from 23 per cent to 2 per cent.
Earnings per share were 7.4p (0.9p). A recommended final dividend of 1.8p
gives a total for the year of 2.5p, up from 1p.

FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Redrow and A McAlpine combine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A plan to build a Pounds 145m housing development south of Northwich,
Cheshire, was announced jointly yesterday by Alfred McAlpine, the
construction group, and Redrow, the housebuilder which came to the market
earlier this year.
The companies have combined to acquire 220 acres of land, payment for which
is to be phased until 2001. The total cost of the land purchases, including
acquiring certain properties and constructing a spine road, is thought to be
in the region of Pounds 18m.
This would be equivalent to 13 per cent of the expected total value of the
development.
Planning permission for the development of about 1,800 homes over 10 years
has been granted by Vale Royal Borough Council. The development, to be known
as Kingsmead, will provide shopping and community facilities and more than
40 acres of open space and a new access road to Northwich town centre.
Construction is planned to start this autumn and will provide a range of
homes from social housing to low density executive homes.
Redrow raised Pounds 55.4m earlier this year to fund expansion. This formed
part of a Pounds 117m flotation with Mr Steve Morgan, the founder, raising
Pounds 62m on his own account. The shares, priced then at 135p, closed at
118p yesterday.

FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Filofax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four acquisitions in the last 12 months helped Filofax, the USM-quoted
personal organiser group, lift pre-tax profits by 48 per cent, from Pounds
2.2m to Pounds 3.26m, and total sales by 39 per cent.
Turnover from continuing operations rose from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 17.7m
while acquisitions contributed Pounds 2.37m in the year to March 31. Three
acquisitions, including Swedish and German distributors, helped continental
European sales rise by 84 per cent to Pounds 7m (Pounds 3.8m). UK sales
increased by 30 per cent to Pounds 7m and on a like-for-like basis by 20 per
cent to Pounds 6.5m.
A final dividend of 1p lifts the total to 1.75p (1.25p), payable from
earnings per share of 10.1p (7.7p).
The group ended the year with net cash of Pounds 2.41m (Pounds 3.35m) after
investing Pounds 4.9m in acquisitions.
Mr Robin Field, chief executive, said Filofax looked forward to increased
growth, particularly in continental Europe, where current sales represented
a 'small part of future potential'. He said the group remained alert to
opportunities for further acquisitions.
The UK market for ring binder organisers was growing, he said, and the group
had increased its market share to between 55 and 60 per cent.
The acquisition of Drakes in December had enabled the group to increase its
sales force in the UK. It also provided scope to develop new product lines,
such as the self-stick and carbonless paper products in which Drakes
specialised.
Mr Field said the group had moved to secure its own sales and distribution
networks in Germany and Sweden following the success of its sales subsidiary
in France where turnover had trebled.
He said the Filofax and Drakes brands would be launched in Denmark in the
current year.

Mr Bill Moss, chairman of Towles, the lossmaking clothing maker, said there
was nothing new in the offer document from London City, the Australian
investment group which has made a Pounds 4.22m cash bid for the company.
London City would have to offer an adequate price, he said, and advised
shareholders to take no action.
He also announced the sale of the Derby Road factory and premises, in

FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: British Steel sees future in the east -
Andrew Baxter on the company's long term growth possibilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tucked away in British Steel's results statement is a figure which could
hold the key to the group's long-term growth strategy as it grapples with
the maturity of its traditional markets and continuing confusion over
subsidies in Europe.
Turnover outside the UK and continental Europe, classified as other areas,
rose from Pounds 641m to Pounds 735m for the year to the end of March. As
British Steel says, North American and east Asian markets were strong.
Stripping out North America, turnover in the rest of the world was between
Pounds 350m and Pounds 400m, compared with Pounds 340m, of which Asia
accounted for Pounds 264m. The year before it had reached Pounds 390m as
British Steel, in the depths of the UK recession, desperately sought markets
where steel was in demand.
The figures are important because they encompass developing countries where
demand for steel is still growing fast, notably east Asia, and is set to
continue that way for a decade or more. But they also present a challenge to
British Steel, which accepts that the numbers cannot grow much more unless
it develops its presence in these markets.
British Steel has been one of the main beneficiaries of Asia's net deficit
in steel production, helped by a joint venture it set up with Jardine
Matheson of Hong Kong in 1986, and by a network of British Steel sales
offices. The latest one, in Ho Chi Minh City, is just about to open.
Among the record 30m tonnes of steel imported by various producers into
China last year were more than 100,000 tonnes of British Steel long products
used in construction.
The company has followed and supported British industry in the region. Its
structural steel has been supplied to big projects in Hong Kong, the
Philippines and Taiwan. It recently received its first order from Vietnam,
for 100 tonnes of structural sections.
But along with most of its European and US competitors, British Steel has no
mills in Asia, and most of the steel it sells in the region is exported from
the UK. The company is thus faced with heavy transport costs and the threat
from countries such as China and India which want to become self-sufficient
in steel or even net exporters.
'If you have not turned your export sales into domestic production, you will
lose out,' said Mr Edward Hadas, steel analyst at Swiss Bank Corporation.
'At some point that export market won't be there.'
British Steel's three-pronged strategy for the region and other steel
markets such as central and eastern Europe, recognises that it must have a
presence there, although it falls short of turning them into 'core'
strategic regions.
It believes it ought to be able to optimise revenues by being aware of
opportunities in these markets and becoming involved in projects when
something more than a commodity grade of steel is needed.
Having built up a worldwide marketing capability it has the necessary
shipping, financing and other skills to make a successful steel sale.
Thirdly, and most significantly, it is developing what it sees as a
'pathfinder' role, recognising the difficulty of predicting which markets
will have the strongest growth. The aim is to position the company within
individual markets to increase its knowledge, and identify possible
investment decisions and potential local partners.
Investments could be anything from a service or distribution centre to a
full-blown mill. For example, if British Steel was to become a large
supplier in flat-rolled steel markets in Asia, as demand for cars and
domestic appliances accelerates, it may have to make such investments.
Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel's chairman and chief executive, said the
company was more likely to invest to add value to the steel process rather
than manufacture raw steel. Characteristically, though, British Steel is not
rushing, and Mr Moffat said 'nothing is immediately imminent'.
However, some observers believe the company should not wait too long, or
risk being shut out by the expansion plans of indigenous producers -
especially the Chinese.
Mr Hadas said the rational strategy for British Steel would be to use any
excess cash flow to invest in processing or producing steel where demand
growth was higher.
Expansion outside Europe and North America should be at the top of the
company's list of strategic priorities, he said. The risks may be relatively
high, but the company had technical, management and marketing expertise to
offer.
Ultimately, the world's expanding steel regions look like providing a test
for Mr Moffat in one of his two key tasks at British Steel - finding ways to
grow its revenues. His prowess in the other task, continuing the fight to
contain costs and boost productivity further, is already proven.
Meanwhile North America is not being ignored. The company said it was
finalising a study to make a significant investment in Tuscaloosa Steel, its
Alabama subsidiary, to create a 'world competitive' mini-mill producing
steel plate.

FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Closure costs cut East Midlands Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
East Midlands Electricity is increasing its dividend for the year by 16 per
cent to 22.7p in spite of a sharp fall in profits due to the costs of
closing most of its contracting operations.
In May the company announced its decision to reverse its expansion into
contracting and to write-down the asset value of its home security and
retailing businesses.
This resulted in a total exceptional cost of Pounds 129.5m which reduced
pre-tax profits to Pounds 51.2m (Pounds 155.1m) in the year to March 31.
Turnover fell 8 per cent to Pounds 1.44bn (Pounds 1.57bn) following the
separation of the retail business.
Mr Norman Askew, the new chief executive, said the dividend rise from 19.5p,
with a recommended final of 15.9p, reflected the strength of the underlying
business. Operating profits advanced by 13 per cent to Pounds 182.8m (Pounds
162.1m).
Mr Askew also pointed to the strong cash inflow last year which cut net
borrowings from Pounds 141.4m to just Pounds 2m. More than half the inflow
was due to one-off factors with underlying cash generation improving to
Pounds 57.4m (Pounds 38.7m)
East Midlands is to seek shareholder approval for the purchase of up to 10
per cent of its shares in the market.
Mr Askew, who conducted a full review of the group following his appointment
in September 1992, said this was consistent with its new strategy of
focusing on its core electricity business.
He said: 'The first call on the group's cash is to invest in the core
business to get costs down. However, the surplus should not be left tied up
in the company but released to shareholders.'
The company had ruled out, for the time being, the idea of moving into the
provision of any other utility services, he added.
Operating profit from the electricity distribution business rose by 10.6 per
cent to Pounds 169.9m with the number of electricity units distributed up
1.7 per cent.
Last year's restructuring of the electricity business, which will yield
annual savings of Pounds 15m, resulted in the loss of 400 jobs and a further
100 have gone so far this year.
The retailing business, which was put into a joint venture with Yorkshire
Electricity, lost a total of Pounds 5.7m and Mr Askew said that further
restructuring was required in the electrical retailing market.
Earnings per share fell to 12.7p (53.3p) but before exceptionals rose to
63.7p (59.2p).
COMMENT
Given the slump in earnings the 16 per cent rise in the dividend might seem
over-generous. But it is still covered 2.8 times by earnings before
exceptional items and the balance sheet is in fine health despite the
diversification damage. Although East Midlands' distribution business is
already one of the most efficient in the sector the new team, with a wealth
of private sector experience behind them, believe there is still a long way
to go. For the moment all City attention is focused on the sector's new
price which the regulator will announce in August. Now yielding 5 per cent,
East Midlands shares appear to be discounting all but the worst possible
outcome.

FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hasbro may raise its 900p a share offer for
JW Spear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hasbro, the biggest US toy and games group, yesterday did not rule out
raising its bid in the battle for JW Spear, the British company which owns
the rights to the Scrabble board game outside North America.
So far Hasbro, which owns Scrabble in the US and Canada, has received no
acceptances for its 900p a share bid, launched at the end of last month.
Yesterday it extended its offer, which values Spear at Pounds 46.9m, to July
11.
Mattel, the rival US toy group which made a last minute bid for Spear,
yesterday posted its offer document to Spear shareholders, offering Pounds
10 a share in cash or loan notes.
Mr Nigel Hutton of Hasbro UK said the group was still considering all its
options, and would be looking at both the Spear defence document and the
Mattel offer document closely.
The Spear defence document is expected later this week. The board is not
expected to find either offer fair and reasonable, although the higher
Mattel bid will be preferred.
Hasbro, which already owns more than 26 per cent of Spear, launched its bid
after trustees of some Spear family trusts had given undertakings to sell a
further 24.9 per cent unless a higher offer was received in three working
days.
The Mattel bid was launched at five minutes to midnight on the last day.
Last week a High Court judge released the trustees from any obligation to
sell their shares to Hasbro, who had claimed that Mattel's late offer had
not been properly announced.

FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Electra's net assets improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Net assets at Electra, the venture capital investment trust, rose by 11.6
per cent to 380.9p per share over the six months to the end of March.
Total net assets stood at Pounds 659m at March 31, but have declined
slightly since then. Mr Michael Stoddart, chairman, said he viewed the
future with 'tempered optimism'.
Electra's portfolio consists of about one third listed companies and two
thirds unquoted companies or listed stocks where there are dealing
restrictions.
About 30 per cent is invested in the US. Most of the remainder is in the UK,
with a few small holdings in continental Europe. The fund does not currently
invest in east Asia, but said it had plans for the region.
The listed portfolio grew by 17.6 per cent over the half year, compared with
a 3.7 per cent rise in the FT-SE-A All-Share Index. The unlisted portfolio
grew by 7.2 per cent.
US growth lagged behind the UK because of declining US stock markets and
poor performance by a number of companies, including Atlantic Coast
Airlines, Sphere Drake Holdings and US Long Distance.
New unlisted investments, amounting to Pounds 71.2m, were split almost
equally between the US and the UK. Realisations of unlisted investments
brought in Pounds 29.3m.
During the half year, four companies in the portfolio were listed and since
the end of March a further three have floated. Two more, EuroDollar and
Pillar Property Investments, have announced plans to seek a London listing.
'Although we take advantage of market conditions to realise investments
through flotations, we are happy to retain our shareholding if the stock
market is not receptive to new issues,' Mr Stoddart said. Trade buyers were
also interested in several companies, he added.
Net available revenue for the half year rose to Pounds 6.94m (Pounds 6.05m)
and an interim dividend of 3.55p (3.45p) is declared from earnings per share
of 4.01p (3.5p).
Electra will shortly lose its position as the UK's largest venture capital
trust, with the flotation of 3i. Its results will be watched closely for its
possible influence on the pricing of the 3i issue, due to be announced
tomorrow.
Electra shares closed up 9p at 306p yesterday, a discount of about 19 per
cent to the latest net asset value of 378p.

FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Aer Lingus flies into fresh
turbulence

<TEXT>
Aer Lingus, Ireland's state airline, is again running into turbulence as
2,000 staff at Team, its aircraft maintenance subsidiary, yesterday rejected
new proposals on pay and working practices. Also 750 cabin crew are
threatening industrial action over new rostering arrangements.
The disputes come exactly six months after the European Commission approved
a IPounds 175m (Pounds 172m) equity injection by the Irish government into
the airline, to finance a restructuring package to return it to commercial
viability. Some IPounds 56m has been used on redundancies, while the
remainder is being used to cut debt.
After a year of tense negotiations and repeated threats of strike action,
last November the airline's 5,500 workforce finally agreed to 800
redundancies and significant changes in work practices, the overall effect
of which has been to strip some IPounds 50m out of annual operating costs.
However, trade union representatives for the cabin crews and the aircraft
maintenance staff say that the Aer Lingus management is now seeking further
pay cuts and new rostering arrangements which break last November's
agreement.
A transatlantic Boeing 747 flight was cancelled at the weekend following a
crew dispute, causing disruption for some 900 passengers who had to be
accommodated in hotels in Boston, Dublin and Shannon.
The cabin crews have voted by nine-to-one in favour of industrial action,
which will begin in two weeks' time unless agreement can be reached in the
interim, and will affect all Aer Lingus flights.
Mr Paul O'Sullivan, the union negotiator for the cabin crew said: 'The
strength of feeling can be gauged from the fact that cabin crews have never
in the past voted in favour of going it alone on industrial action.'
Management at Team have warned that unless the workforce accepts proposals
now before it, 850 compulsory redundancies will have to be made beginning
this week. Such a move would trigger strike action by the union. It is
thought this would rapidly spread throughout the Aer Lingus group.
Analysts believe that Team's financial problems will be compounded by the
airline's decision to replace its ageing Boeing 747s with European Airbus
A330s, the first of which recently entered service. Team is tooled up to
work on Boeing aircraft only.

FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Critchley 26% ahead at Pounds 3.85m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Critchley Group, the electrical cable accessories manufacturer, reported a
26 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.05m to Pounds 3.85m in
the year to March 31.
The outcome, achieved on turnover ahead 21 per cent to Pounds 28.9m, was
struck after a Pounds 750,000 provision to cover moving and other costs.
It was in line with forecasts made last month when the group announced plans
to buy Idento, a German cable identification products group, for DM27.5m
(Pounds 11m).
The acquisition was funded in part by a Pounds 10m open offer to
shareholders and was completed last week.
The Critchley Label Centre business acquired from BT in May last year
contributed Pounds 3.23m.
Earnings per share grew by 10 per cent to 21.1p (19.1p), held back by a
slightly higher tax charge rate and the dilutive effects of the shares
issued at the time of the flotation in November 1992.
The proposed final dividend is increased by 15 per cent to 5.5p, making a
total of 8.1p for the year. The shares closed up 6p at 444p.
Mr Ian McCallum, chief executive, said he was pleased with the results.
'Margins improved across the group and we are particularly encouraged by the
increase in sales overseas which represent nearly 40 per cent of the total,'
he said.
Operating profits increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 3.73m (Pounds 3m).
Organic growth accounted for about a third of the increase.
The core Critchley electrical cable accessories and identification business
reported only a modest domestic sales increase, reflecting the
discontinuation of some low margin products and the slow down in the
implementation of some large projects in the UK.
However, accessories sales improved from Pounds 17.4m to Pounds 20.4m,
helped by an 11 per cent increase in exports and the Critchley Label Centre
acquisition. Divisional profits increased by 6.3 per cent to Pounds 2.7m,
including a Pounds 237,000 contribution from Critchley Label Centre.
Net interest receipts fell to Pounds 120,000 (Pounds 152,000); the group
ended the period with net cash of Pounds 3.7m.

FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Emap approach rebuffed by Trans World
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Trans World Communications yesterday rebuffed an approach from
Emap, the media and exhibitions group, for a recommended takeover that would
have valued the commercial radio group at about Pounds 70m.
The statement came after last week's announcement that Emap, which already
owns 30 per cent of Trans World, had an agreement giving it until June 22 to
buy at 181p a share the 22 per cent stake owned by Mr Owen Oyston.
The six members of the 10-strong Trans World board who did not exclude
themselves from the decision concluded that the premium on offer was not
high enough.
The board also expressed concern that the deal could face a legal challenge.
A full Emap takeover of Trans World would breach the legal limit on the
number and size of commercial radio licences which can be held by one
company.
The Radio Authority, the industry regulator, has agreed 'an ownership
structure' that could be put in place for part of Emap's existing radio
interests to enable it to comply with the rules.
The directors of Guardian Media, publishers of The Guardian, which owns 20
per cent of Trans World, separately made it clear yesterday that it was
considering a legal challenge to the ownership arrangements.
The Trans World board said yesterday that the 181p price represented a
premium of 5 per cent over the 172.3p average of marked bargains on the day
before the Emap announcement.
The board also emphasised yesterday that under the City Code on Takeovers
and Mergers, Emap's statement that it would not increase its 181p offer was
now binding.
Emap declined to comment yesterday, although it is clear that if, as seems
likely, it decides to go ahead with its purchase of the Oyston stake before
tomorrow's deadline, it will hold a majority of the company.
That in turn could lead to considerable uncertainty if there is a legal
challenge.
For now the Trans World directors urged shareholders to take no action at
the moment.

FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Low orders push JFB into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Low order books pushed Johnson &amp; Firth Brown, the specialist engineering
group, into the red at the interim stage, with pre-tax losses of Pounds
842,000 to March 31 against profits of Pounds 2.07m last time.
Turnover rose from Pounds 63.3m to Pounds 64.7m while operating profits fell
from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 177,000.
The Firth Rixson Division - which includes alloys and castings - saw profits
halve to Pounds 749,000 (Pounds 1.55m) on turnover up from Pounds 38.9m to
Pounds 44m.
The light engineering division incurred operating losses of Pounds 219,000
(profits Pounds 1.71m) on sales down from Pounds 24.4m to Pounds 20.7m.
Mr George Hardie, joint group managing director, said JFB appeared to be
'turning the corner after a most difficult 18 months'.
Although margins remained depressed at Firth Rixson, order levels in the
rings and forgings businesses had improved.
Mr Hardie said there were plans to sell companies in the light engineering
division as part of the group's efforts to focus on core activities,
particularly rings and forgings.
He said he did not anticipate further lay-offs following the 10 per cent cut
in the workforce, net of the US acquisition, in the last 12 months.
The interim dividend is passed (1p). Losses per share of 0.9p compared with
earnings of 0.8p.

FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Signet chairman's pay jumps 78% to Pounds
512,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr James McAdam, executive chairman of Signet, the jewellery group formerly
known as Ratners, enjoyed a 78 per cent pay increase to Pounds 512,000 last
year, according to the annual report.
His total pay the previous year was Pounds 288,000. Signet said an increase
in Mr McAdam's basic salary from Pounds 240,000 to Pounds 300,000 reflected
his taking over the group chief executive's role from Mr Gerald Ratner, in
addition to the chairmanship, in November 1992. It had been reviewed by
external consultants.
Mr McAdam was also paid a Pounds 130,000 bonus, reflecting his success in
returning the group to an operating profit for the year to January 29, and
in meeting targets for control of borrowings and costs. His pension
contributions and other benefits increased from Pounds 48,000 to Pounds
82,000.

FT  21 JUN 94 / C&amp;G prepares to accept new savers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society is likely to announce before the
end of the month that it will reopen to accept savings from new customers.
Almost two weeks ago C&amp;G closed its doors to new customer deposits after the
High Court ruling which barred the terms of Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn
agreed cash bid for the society. C&amp;G said then that this was a short-term
measure to prevent people trying to make a speculative gain from the Lloyds
offer.
The society said yesterday that it would announce its plans for re-opening
for savings when it had further evaluated the judgment. It has played down
the financial impact of the closure.
While the court ruling would not allow new depositors to receive a windfall
benefit from the Lloyds offer, C&amp;G said some potential customers might
wrongly interpret the judgment in this way.
Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, said in his ruling that C&amp;G could
not make cash payments to more than 220,000 C&amp;G investors who had been
shareholding members of the society for less than two years. This would make
it difficult to win the necessary majority in favour of the deal.
C&amp;G's emphasis on the short-term nature of the move suggests that it does
not see closing the society to new members as a way of getting round the
terms of the judgment, by raising significantly the proportion of members of
at least two years' standing, and thus improving its chance of winning the
ballot of investing members.
Alongside producing a revised offer, the society also has to take a decision
shortly on whether to ask the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal against
Sir Donald's decision.
If C&amp;G seeks an expedited appeal it must launch the process within 28 days
of the original judgment - before the end of the first week in July. After
that date it could still seek leave to mount an ordinary appeal, but that
course would carry the risk of extending the timetable for the offer beyond
the end of this year.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Eurotunnel fall slims margin over rights price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Falling global stock markets created further difficulties for Eurotunnel's
underwriters yesterday, as the registered shares fell a further 5p to 283p.
This left a 7 per cent premium to the 265p rights price, with just two
trading days before the Pounds 858m offer closes.
Underwriters said this was 'enough to encourage an adequate take-up', and
the nil paid shares, which stopped trading yesterday, stayed at 10p.
Traders spoke of further short selling by hedge funds, and said that since
it had become all but impossible to borrow Eurotunnel shares, short sellers
would have to buy back in the stock market, pushing the share price higher.
Mr Jean-Michel Plou, first vice president at Banque Indosuez, which led the
French underwriting, said: 'I am more pessimistic than I was a week ago, but
there are still grounds for optimism.'
French investors, who account for the bulk of the bearer units - 75 per cent
of Eurotunnel's issued shares - are not recompensed through a placing of the
rump of the issue and their take-up is usually much higher.
The institution with the most to lose is Swiss Bank Corp. SBC has Pounds
100m of the French portion of the underwriting, which carries the greatest
risk, since institutional investors do not tend to sub-underwrite their
exposure.
The French underwriting syndicate was led by Banque Indosuez, and includes
Banque Nationale de Paris, Banque Paribas and Credit Lyonnais, while the
British syndicate was led by Morgan Grenfell and SG Warburg, and includes
Robert Fleming and Salomon Brothers.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Welcome back to Marlboro country: Miles's resignation at the
weekend is a victory for those who believe Philip Morris means cigarettes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone wanting a simple explanation for Mr Michael Miles's abrupt departure
from the top job at Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, at the
weekend need look no further than the 40 per cent fall in the company's
share price in the last nine months. The heads of many a US corporate giant
have recently rolled for less.
But the greater significance of Mr Miles's resignation is that it marks a
triumph for those within the company who are set on keeping cigarette-making
as the group's core activity in defiance of the powerful US anti-smoking
lobby.
Just 10 years ago, cigarette-making accounted for the overwhelming majority
of Philip Morris's revenues. But faced with the prospect of a long-term
decline in smoking, it decided to use the cash-flow from its tobacco
operations to finance a diversification into the food industry.
Under its then chairman and chief executive, the charismatic Mr Hamish
Maxwell, it made a series of big acquisitions, including those of General
Foods in 1985, Kraft in 1988, and Jacobs Suchard in 1990. By last year the
food operations had grown to the size where they were contributing nearly 50
per cent of group turnover (though only 34 per cent of group operating
profits).
When Mr Miles took over from Mr Maxwell as chairman and chief executive in
1991, he was the first person from outside the tobacco industry to lead the
group. As the former chairman and chief executive of Kraft, he had risen to
the top from the food side of the business, and some analysts say the
non-smoking 54-year-old seemed ill at ease in the role of Marlboro man.
He was not made any more comfortable when Philip Morris's US
cigarette-making activities started to come under increasing pressure -
first, through a loss of market share to low-price competition and second,
from the outbreak of an unprecedented wave of opposition from the US
anti-smoking lobby.
Mr Miles's response to the first threat came in April last year on a day
remembered as Marlboro Friday, when he horrified shareholders by slashing
the price of Marlboro cigarettes and Philip Morris's other premium brands to
win back market share. The move succeeded in boosting sales, but prompted a
price war in the US cigarette market and contributed to a fall in the
company's after-tax profits from Dollars 4.9bn to Dollars 3.6bn last year.
Since then, US cigarette prices have crept up a little and Philip Morris
looks set to claw back some of its lost profits this year. But two months
ago the corporate boat was rocked again when the Financial Times disclosed
that its top managers were considering a plan to hive off the troublesome
tobacco operations into a separate company.
Some investors cautiously welcomed the idea as a way of relieving Philip
Morris's share price from the depressive effect of its controversial
association with cigarette-making. But to people who had spent years
building up the company in its present form as a food and tobacco
conglomerate - notably the retired Mr Maxwell, still a highly influential
member of Philip Morris's board - it was anathema.
Matters came to a head at a rancorous board meeting last month. After more
than six hours of debate - which ranged, it is said, over Mr Miles's
performance as chairman and chief executive as well as the merits and
demerits of the restructuring scheme - the plan was rejected. Instead, the
board promoted Mr William Murray from chief operating officer to vice
chairman for world-wide food, and Mr Geoffrey Bible from executive vice
president to vice chairman for world-wide tobacco.
The significance of this move was that, although both men had spent time on
the food side of Philip Morris, both had strong backgrounds in the tobacco
side of the business, having joined Philip Morris long before the expansion
into food began. As such, they were very much Mr Maxwell's proteges. Their
elevation must have made Mr Miles's position even more uncomfortable than it
already was.
Three weeks later, Mr Miles has gone and the two Maxwell proteges have been
promoted again - Mr Murray taking over Mr Miles's role as chairman and Mr
Bible becoming president and chief executive. Mr Miles put as brave face as
possible on the turn of events: he said he left 'with full confidence that
the difficult decisions made over the past two years will be proven right by
our results in 1994 and beyond', and added that the recovery of Philip
Morris's US tobacco business and the continued growth in international
tobacco meant it made sense for someone from the tobacco side to take
charge.
The triumph of the smoking faction at Philip Morris means that the notion
splitting off the tobacco side of the business is almost certainly dead. Yet
the US stock market reacted well to the change in management, lifting Philip
Morris's share price Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 50 7/8 at yesterday's close.
Why? Stock market analysts such as Mr Gary Black at Sanford C. Bernstein, a
Wall Street brokerage, say the trouble with Philip Morris was not so much
the difficulties it was experiencing with its cigarette operations in the US
as a lack of leadership and a decline in employee morale.
Mr Miles was a notoriously low-profile chairman and chief executive,
declining to face the press and rarely meeting analysts. Investors hope that
a new and more aggressive leadership will be better at explaining to
analysts and the financial media why gloom about the future profitability of
the tobacco operations is wildly overdone - and that this will do more to
enhance shareholder value than any break up of the business could hope to
achieve.

FT  21 JUN 94 / British Steel lifts payout on return to profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel is raising its final dividend after returning to the black
after two years of losses.
Pre-tax profits for the year to April 2, were Pounds 80m, in the middle of
analysts' expectations and representing a sharp recovery from the previous
year's Pounds 149m loss - the company's worst result since privatisation.
The company is also close to deciding on investing Dollars 150m (Pounds
100m) in its Alabama subsidiary, Tuscaloosa Steel.
The shares jumped 5 3/4 p to 139p as the final dividend was increased from
1p to 1.5p, making a total of 2p (1p) for the year. Most analysts had
expected the final dividend to be held at 1p.
Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive, said the company had used its
product range, competitive cost base and marketing strengths to distance
itself from competitors. The continuing recession in western Europe meant
that trading conditions were not easy. There was some improvement in demand
in the UK but mainland Europe remained weak - although the downturn appears
to have halted.
Turnover at Pounds 4.19bn was down 3 per cent on the Pounds 4.3bn of the
previous year. Excluding the effects of the November 1992 merger of British
Steel's stainless steel interests into Avesta Sheffield, turnover rose 4 per
cent, reflecting higher sales volumes and improved average revenue per
tonne. Trading profit for the year was Pounds 116m, compared with a Pounds
113m loss, because of better selling prices and enhanced operating
performance.
Operating costs at Pounds 4.07bn were 8 per cent lower, with the stainless
steel merger accounting for three-quarters of the decline. The balance came
from such factors as higher sales volume and greater efficiency.
Offsetting this, the company has made a full provision of Pounds 24m for the
European Commission fine imposed in February relating to its involvement in
an alleged European cartel in steel beams. The company is appealing against
the judgment.
The Tuscaloosa plan, on which a study is due to be completed later this
summer, would create a 1m tonne-a-year 'mini-mill' producing steel plate in
coil and cut lengths. The Dollars 150m investment would be spread over two
years. Two direct reduced iron (DRI) units would be moved from Hunterston,
Scotland, to lift product quality.
Earnings per share were 3.45p, against a loss per share of 6.5p.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Tobacco men succeed Miles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Miles, the non-smoking chairman and chief executive of Philip
Morris, the US food and tobacco group, has suddenly quit following a
boardroom rejection of his plan to split the group into separate food and
tobacco companies.
He has been replaced by two men from the tobacco side of the business: Mr
William Murray, who becomes chairman, and Mr Geoffrey Bible, who becomes
president and chief executive. The changes take immediate effect.
Mr Miles was chairman and chief executive of Kraft, the US food company,
when Philip Morris acquired it in 1988, and became chairman and chief
executive of Philip Morris in 1991.
One of the most difficult periods of his tenure came in April 1993 when
Philip Morris cut the price of its best-selling Marlboro cigarettes and
other premier brands to regain market share from low-cost competition,
sending earnings and the share price into a tailspin.
Announcing his decision to go, Mr Miles said he left 'with full confidence
that the difficult decisions made over the past two years will be proven
right by our results in 1994 and beyond'.
However, he said, the recovery of Philip Morris's US tobacco business and
the continued growth in international tobacco meant it made sense for an
executive from the tobacco side to take charge.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Mediobanca is forced to delay its rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mediobanca, the merchant bank at the heart of Italian finance and industry,
was last night forced to postpone its L1,500bn (Pounds 620m) rights issue
after a further sharp decline in the Milan stock market cut its share price
by nearly 5 per cent in a day.
The postponement is particularly embarrassing for the merchant bank, which
has an unrivalled reputation in the Italian market. Mediobanca is adviser to
most of the country's biggest companies, and a shareholder in many of them.
Mediobanca's shares dropped L748 to L14,411 yesterday, closing for the first
time below the L15,000-a-share floor which the bank set for the rights issue
when it was announced in April.
After the market closed, the bank said it would 'define a new timetable for
the operation in the light of market developments'. The bank added that it
had received strong interest from abroad in the international issue, which
was intended to broaden its shareholder base and raise funds for investment,
particularly in Italian privatisations.
The bank seems likely to wait at least 10 days before considering a
relaunch. But a delay of more than three or four weeks would take it into
the slack holiday period, when an operation of this scale would be
impossible to carry out.
Its share price has declined nearly 24 per cent since the end of April.
Investors were unsettled by news last month that four top executives of the
bank were under investigation for alleged conspiracy to file false accounts
on behalf of Ferruzzi-Montedison, the industrial group which came close to
collapse last year. That inquiry is continuing, although Mediobanca has
denied that there is any substance in the allegations.
In the last two weeks, Italian markets have come under pressure as
international investors have begun to act on growing doubts about the new
right-wing government's handling of the economy. Milan's Comit index fell 4
per cent yesterday, wiping out the last trace of equity gains achieved since
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, won the March election.
Mediobanca's rights issue is one of the biggest of a shoal of bond and
equity issues which will hit the Italian market over the next month. In
total, the issues are expected to raise more than L10,000bn. Analysts are
already afraid that future trading will be affected if underwriters are left
with much stock.

FT  21 JUN 94 / British Steel plans legal action to stop subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel yesterday raised the stakes in its battle against state
subsidies to its continental European rivals by announcing it plans to begin
legal action later this week against the European Commission.
The company will ask the European Court to annul the Commission's
authorisation of further state subsidies to two steelmakers, Ilva of Italy
and CSI of Spain. The two companies received the lion's share of Ecu7bn
(Pounds 5.4bn) of aid approved by European Union industry ministers in
December and authorised by the Commission in April.
The move by British Steel steps up the pressure on the Commission, which has
been widely criticised by unsubsidised producers for allowing subsidies that
do not adhere to the strict rules of the steel aid code, part of the
European Coal and Steel Community treaty.
Earlier this month, the European Independent Steel Works Association, which
represents privately owned, independent steel producers, said it was also
taking the Commission to the court over subsidies to state-owned companies
in Italy, Spain, Germany and Portugal.
The association has asked the court to rule that the aid be suspended
immediately until the court has reached a final judgment on the legality of
the subsidies, a process that could take two to three years.
British Steel said it was acting because it had no other means remaining to
express its dissatisfaction about European steel subsidies. 'We cannot get
the politicians to address the problem, so we are forced to go to the
court,' Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive, said yesterday.
The company's assault appears to be a high-risk strategy, as it cannot be
guaranteed victory even if, as Mr Moffat said, 'the arguments are basically
with us'.
But British Steel made clear its aim was to stop any further aid by using
the Italian and Spanish subsidy approvals as test cases.
If British Steel wins, Commission officials would have a precedent to help
them turn down future requests for state aid. But Mr Moffat hopes the case
will cause member states 'at least to look more than once' at using Article
95 of the treaty, which allows state subsidies to be paid to companies but
only after unanimous consent from the Council of Ministers.
The Commission insisted yesterday it had acted legally under Article 95 of
the treaty.
British Steel made its own decision to begin the action, but it is
understood that the UK government was consulted.
British Steel's move coincided with its announcement of pre-tax profits of
Pounds 80m for the year ended April 2, compared with a Pounds 149m loss a
year earlier. The news helped the company's shares buck the trend in a
falling stock market, rising 5 3/4 p to 139p.

FT  21 JUN 94 / State cash needed to build new nuclear power station
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Substantial state support will be needed if the UK is to build another
nuclear power station, it emerged yesterday as Nuclear Electric, the
state-owned operator, published its evidence to the government's nuclear
review.
The company acknowledged the cost of producing electricity from a third
plant at Sizewell would be about 50 per cent higher than current market
prices if the plant was funded by the private sector.
Mr Bob Hawley, Nuclear Electric chief executive, said he expected this
year's market price of about 2.4p a kilowatt hour to rise in future years
but it would still 'take government commitment and support to build any new
nuclear power station'.
Nuclear Electric's submission, totalling more than 150 pages, pleads the
case for the 2,600MW Sizewell C on the Suffolk coast but also raises the
possibility of building a third, smaller plant at Hinkley Point. The company
already has planning permission for such a plant.
Hinkley C would be easier to finance than Sizewell C, due its smaller
capital cost, Pounds 2bn compared with Pounds 3.5bn at Sizewell, but it
would offer a slightly lower return on capital, said Nuclear Electric.
In its submission, Nuclear Electric confirmed privatisation was its 'top
priority'. Mr John Collier, company chairman, said: 'We need commercial
freedom to compete on equal terms and to develop our business.'
The company wants to sell its advanced gas-cooled reactor and pressurised
water reactor stations but it said its Magnox stations and their liabilities
should remain in the public sector. It backed its case for privatisation by
announcing sharp improvements in efficiencies, with operating losses cut to
Pounds 224m last year against Pounds 564m in 1992-93 and costs per unit of
electricity down from 3.6p to 3.1p.
In addition, it said, major progress in quantifying and reducing liabilities
for fuel cycle and decommissioning costs had largely removed the original
obstacles to privatisation.
Nuclear Electric's submission will be strongly contested during the review
which is likely to take up at least most of this year. Greenpeace, the
environmental pressure group, condemned the company's case as wishful
thinking.
Rival power generation companies believe the figures used by the company are
optimistic. They dispute its claim that it will soon become the UK's
lowest-cost producer of electricity.
Mr Mike Kirwan, finance director, said building Sizewell C would need
government help in securing long-term contracts.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Renewed doubt over housing recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, ANDREW TAYLOR and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh doubts about the recovery of the housing market were raised yesterday
when figures for net new mortgage lending by building societies last month
showed a sharp drop compared with the previous month.
According to figures released by the Building Societies Association,
societies' net new lending was Pounds 806m in May - a fall of 17 per cent
from the Pounds 974m in April. In May last year it was Pounds 896m.
However, in a more encouraging sign, there was a rise in last month's net
new commitments undertaken by societies - loans approved but not actually
taken up within the period covered. These rose by 4.6 per cent to Pounds
3.28bn, against Pounds 3.14bn in April.
There was also better news on personal savings as societies received a net
inflow of funds for the second consecutive month, after five months of net
outflows as they struggled against competition. Net receipts totalled Pounds
370m in May, although they are still just over half the Pounds 700m recorded
in May last year.
Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the association, said the lending
figures appeared 'to reflect some caution on the part of households, but
provide no firm evidence of a downturn in housing market activity'.
However, estate agents and housebuilders reported signs the upturn may be
stalling.
More than half of the 143 estate agents questioned in a survey published
today said sales during the three months to the end of May had 'either
flattened out or declined' compared with the previous three months.
The survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said agents
blamed tax rises and higher interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages for the
slowdown.
The institution denied that prices had fallen. Nearly three-quarters of
agents said prices remained stable, while 17 per cent said 'prices were
still edging upwards'.
Fewer than 10 per cent said prices had fallen compared with the previous
three months.
Housebuilders have also reported lower sales activity since the spring.
Builders say weekly sales are currently little higher than during the
corresponding period last year.
Earlier this year, industry sales were 10-15 per cent higher than at the
same stage of 1993. However, consumer confidence, which hit a four-year low
in April, is showing signs of recovery, according to the latest Gallup
survey. Asked how the financial position of their household would change
over the next 12 months, 17 per cent of respondents said things would get
better and 33 per cent said worse.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Government squares up for long rail dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government appeared to be digging in for a lengthy confrontation with
the RMT rail union yesterday as ministers repeatedly attacked the union's
'irresponsible' pay claim.
Amid angry Commons exchanges, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary,
condemned the strike planned for tomorrow and warned that some passengers
would not return to the railway.
It also emerged that Mr MacGregor has established a committee of senior
ministers to monitor the strike by signals staff and guide the government's
response.
The committee met for the first time yesterday to discuss the prospects for
further railway chaos if Aslef, the train drivers' union, also decides to
strike.
Talks aimed at averting a second 24-hour strike by signals staff were under
way last night at Acas, the conciliation service. The talks were delayed by
90 minutes when management of Railtrack, the state-owned railway
infrastructure company, arrived late. Union officials said they were
pessimistic about the prospects of ending the dispute.
In the Commons, Mr MacGregor said it was 'damaging to the railway for the
unions to undertake a series of strikes on an 11 per cent, no-strings pay
claim'.
He told MPs at question time that Railtrack wanted to achieve a settlement
based on talks on restructuring, which would be separate from the company's
2.5 per cent pay offer.
He also dismissed claims that Railtrack had spent more on refurbishing its
headquarters than the estimated cost of settling the strike.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, blamed the government for
intervening to order Railtrack to withdraw a proposed pay offer of 5.7 per
cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Electra Investment Trust has often been compared to 3i, the venture capital
group on the point of being floated. But 3i's advisers, who are to announce
the launch price tomorrow, will be hoping investors do not take the analogy
too far. Not that there is any reason to complain about Electra's underlying
performance. Its interim results - in particular, the 11.6 per cent rise in
net assets over the half year to the end of March - exceeded expectations.
It is rather that Electra is now trading on a 17 per cent discount to net
assets. The implied discount on its unquoted investments is even greater if
its quoted investments are valued at average market discounts. 3i is thought
to be looking for a 13 per cent discount.
There are, of course, real differences between the two groups. 3i invests in
smaller companies, which are expected to outperform larger companies at this
stage of the economic cycle. Moreover, many of 3i's stakes are valued on the
basis of earnings relating to the year to June 1993 or earlier. Since then
profits will, in most cases, have moved ahead strongly. It could also be
argued that Electra's discount to net assets is only so large because of
yesterday's sharp fall in the equity market. Its shares rose only 9p,
despite net assets per share exceeding expectations by about 30p. The snag
is that this point cuts both ways. 3i may have to accept a fractionally
larger discount, given it is being floated on choppy waters.

FT  21 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Philip Morris
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be too simple to blame Marlboro Friday for the sudden departure of
Mr Michael Miles from Philip Morris. True, Dollars 12bn was wiped off the
company's market value following its decision to cut the US price of its
leading cigarette brand. Shareholders are understandably concerned that they
will never see a decent return on that investment, but the shares had been
driven up by margins on Marlboro that were unsustainable. The bigger
mistakes came earlier, when the price differential between Marlboro and
cheaper brands was widened despite falling market share.
Since Mr Miles took charge in 1991, though, the bind was partly of his own
making. The episode underlines the fact that, despite its food interests,
Philip Morris faces bigger challenges in tobacco. It is no coincidence that
Mr Miles, who arrived with Kraft Foods in 1988, has been replaced by two
tobacco veterans. The margin squeeze experienced across the US industry
following Marlboro Friday is likely to change the competitive landscape. BAT
Industries' acquisition of American Tobacco in April may be a sign of
consolidation to come. The introduction of a new federal excise tax also
poses problems, although the sums being mooted are less fearsome than a few
months ago.
Against that background, Mr Miles' advocacy of plans to split food from
tobacco may have seemed like a distraction. While some measures to increase
shareholder value would be welcome, squeezing the most from the tobacco
business would be a good place to start.

FT  21 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It will be cold comfort to investors that yesterday's sharp fall in UK
equities was brought about by non-domestic jitters. The main trigger was
Friday's rise in the US commodities index, which fuelled inflationary fears
and savaged bond markets. There is also little comfort in the fact that UK
equities fell less far than continental markets. The FT-SE 100 index dropped
through the 3,000 mark with few signs of institutional buying. Trading was
thin, with most of the action in the futures market. Though it is now harder
to argue that equities are overvalued on fundamentals, institutions are
unlikely to move in until the market stabilises.
The main hope remains that shares will be carried higher as the strength of
the recovery in corporate earnings becomes apparent. But the higher bond
yields rise, the greater the scope for disappointment on this score too.
Profits will notonly be constrained by higher borrowing costs; the increased
cost of capital could curtail investment, leading to less robust growth than
currently anticipated. So far, the only indications of interest rates
curbing activity are in the housing market, where inflation forecasts are
being downgraded. But the government's need to plug its deficit seems likely
at some stage to crowd out corporate sector investment too. An anaemic
recovery would damp inflationary fears and so could be good for bonds. But
such an outcome would hardly be bullish for shares.

FT  21 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Steeled for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since British Steel's profits were more or less in line with expectations,
its heroic 4 per cent rise in yesterday's sorry equity market must have been
due to the doubling of its dividend. But investors may be optimistic if they
think such generosity is a harbinger of things to come. Quite apart from the
fact that the payout is covered only 1.7 times, the recovery will present
new challenges for British Steel which may limit the room for dividend
growth. As long as there are no real signs of the capacity problems in
Europe being resolved, the next downturn promises to be as brutal as the
last. The company must position itself to survive.
The primary task is to reduce its dependency on European markets. The
planned investment in Tuscaloosa is clearly part of such a strategy, but it
will mean an increase in capital spending which has been held down during
the recession. British Steel's balance sheet again contains net cash, but it
survived the recession as well as it did only thanks to the substantial cash
endowment with which it was privatised in 1988. It will need to maintain
that balance sheet advantage throughout the recovery.
European revival should see British Steel generating handsome amounts of
cash. Its UK plant, though, is already operating at between 90 and 95 per
cent of manned capacity. More capacity could be created with only relatively
modest spend on bottlenecks, but given its complaints about over-supply in
Europe, it would look odd for British Steel to add more production. For now
the recovery looks likely to be felt more in prices rather than volume. To
restore its peak dividend and cover it twice, British Steel's earnings would
have to rise five-fold. That may take longer than the market thinks.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Poverty trap with an exit: Is EU structural aid a black hole
of funding from Brussels, or an effective way of raising incomes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the centre of Syntagma, or Constitution Square, in Athens there is a big
black hole, emitting a 24-hour whine. It might work as a symbol for those
among Greece's European Union partners who regard its economy as a hopeless
case and its government's policy as little more than sustained pleading to
maximise revenue from the EU budget.
But the hole is, in fact, a main locus of the EU's most ambitious regional
and structural aid plan, agreed at the 1992 Edinburgh summit. Overall, this
plan has funds of Ecu156bn (Pounds 120.12bn) for 1994-99, more than double
the Ecu64bn spent on regional policy in 1989-93. Its admirers claim this is,
in real terms, more than twice the US-financed Marshall Plan which helped
reconstruct post-war Europe.
Syntagma itself is the hub of what will be the Athens metro - two 17.6km
lines from north-to-south and east-to-west, to help turn the traffic-clogged
and polluted Greek capital into a modern city. The permanent whine comes
from the ventilator in the tunnels, which are progressing slowly towards the
metro's completion in 1998, about a year behind schedule.
It is the largest EU structural aid project and, with the completion of the
Channel Tunnel, one of the biggest public works projects currently under way
in Europe. The two lines are expected to cost Ecu2.4bn, and if additional
branches are added later, another Ecu2bn will be needed.
The EU provides 50 per cent of the finance as a grant, a further 40 per cent
comes through long-term loans from the European Investment Bank, and the
Greek government puts up the 10 per cent remnant.
It is the grandest example of what the EU calls 'cohesion', transferring
money through the Union budget from the rich heartland of Europe to the poor
or run-down regions and the periphery, in an attempt to pull up their income
to average EU levels and make them attractive to investors.
At the Corfu summit of EU leaders on Friday and Saturday, hosted by the
current Greek presidency of the Union, there will be a good deal of
grumbling from the main net contributors to the EU budget - Germany, the UK,
France and the Netherlands - about whether the redoubling of the 'cohesion'
effort is worth it.
The German finance minister Mr Theo Waigel has warned several times this
year that Bonn, by far the EU's main paymaster, feels hard done by. In
March, the UK foreign secretary Mr Douglas Hurd told a Brussels audience
that some BFr300m a day went to Greece as part of 'very large flows' of EU
resources, 'but there are too many reports of that money being wasted'.
But is it? What is the quality of this spending, and does it, as intended,
pull up the average per capita income of the poorer countries and regions?
The only completely comparable figures for regional and national development
within the 12 states measure per capita income growth, against an EU average
of 100, between 1980 and 1991 - too early to register the full impact of the
1989-93 cohesion effort.
Of the four poorest, or 'cohesion' countries, Spain saw average earnings per
head rise from 71 to 80 per cent of the EU average; Ireland rose from 60 to
72 per cent; Portugal from 53 to 60 per cent; while Greece slipped back from
52 to 49 per cent.
Such bald figures do not provide the answer, however. They incorporate
Germany's eastern Lander for the first time, thereby raising everybody
else's average. They mask regional slumps from the Lorraine to the
Portuguese Alentejo. Most of all, there are no reliable figures which
disaggregate how much of this growth might have occurred anyway.
In Brussels, and in the governments in Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland,
there is general assent that these countries have been able to modernise,
particularly their road and railway infrastructure, much faster as a result
of EU help.
An examination of EU structural and regional spending in the poorer member
states, particularly Greece and Spain, suggests some preliminary
conclusions.
The quality of Brussels spending, on projects and programmes, is generally
high;
The volume of spending, the Brussels revenue collection system, and the
legal requirement that national and regional governments 'match' EU finance
with their own funds in varying proportions, puts additional pressure on the
budget deficits, not only of donor, but of recipient countries;
A great deal of EU cohesion money flows back to donor countries, whose
construction and engineering companies are best-placed to carry out funded
projects.
The EU aid is run from Brussels with parsimony and detail by the regional
policy commissioner Mr Bruce Millan, the former UK Labour government's
Scottish secretary. His DG16 directorate of about 240 is headed by a Spanish
Basque, Mr Eneko Landaburu, one of the Commission's most highly regarded
director-generals. These two have often been ruthless in witholding or
transferring money from projects they regard as dubious or lacking rigour.
One senior DG16 official says, in reference to southern Italy: 'My
impression is that much of this money went to the Mafia', referring to the
average Ecu13bn a year flowing to the Mezzogiorno in 1989-93, only 14 per
cent of which, however, came from the EU.
Brussels has withheld nearly Ecu3bn from southern Italy, apportioning some
of it to projects elsewhere in the country that can be monitored regularly.
Partly as a result, Rome now requires regions seeking national funding to
comply with EU criteria on regional aid. Using outside auditors, DG16 says:
'We can generally ensure the big projects are clean.' The Commission's
anti-fraud unit is, however, currently investigating a hydro-electric
project in Lazio where there is a dam but no water.
In Greece in 1989-93, Brussels withheld the bulk of finance earmarked for
large projects, regarding them as inadequately thought through and badly
managed. Scarcely 80km of motorway was built, for instance, because Brussels
objected to the Greek practice of parcelling out small stretches to
different companies, which regularly underbid to secure the contracts, and
thereby often failed to complete the link with other stretches.
The money was instead spread around smaller regional programmes, reducing
internal income disparities, but not boosting Greece's economy relative to
its partners.
But a sea-change in Greek government attitudes in 1991 - which the current
Socialist administration appears to endorse - has meant that a good deal of
the 1994-99 money, worth about Ecu19bn to Greece, will go to projects such
as the Athens metro and an Ecu2.5bn 550km gas pipeline being built from the
Bulgarian border to Athens.
The metro is the showcase for the change. Commission pressure for
strengthened management brought in Bechtel, the US civil engineer, to set up
the Attika Metro company, overseen by a six-strong board of Greek business
figures. Bechtel has a contract for Ecu16.9m to manage the project. A
25-company consortium known as Olympic Metro, led by Siemens of Germany and
Interinfra of France, is doing the building.
Squabbling within the consortium, and recurring rich archaeological finds,
are the main source of hold-ups, which the Bechtel team dismiss as
insignificant in comparison to, say, the Channel Tunnel, or metros they have
been involved in building from the US to Taipei.
Mr Bill Stead, the Bechtel man put in as chief executive officer of Attika
Metro, says: 'I've never received less public pressure, or as close to zero
as you can get.'
Lack of a similar integrated management structure has helped to hold up the
half-built Greek gas pipeline, where the project manager, PLE, a subsidiary
of Ruhr Gas, has been 'bolted on' to more dispersed contractors, rather than
integrated on the Attika Metro model.
Moreover, having contracted with Russia for the gas, Athens, in the Brussels
view, has yet to decide fully what it will be used for. The Commission
believes the project needs a low pressure network for domestic gas users to
be viable, and is proceeding cautiously with fund disbursement. 'This could
be the first (EU-funded) cathedral in the desert' if it does not get such a
network, one senior Brussels official warns.
While successful projects leave something of lasting value, there is little
doubt contractors from donor countries get big shares of the business
generated.
On the Athens metro, non-Greek companies supply everything from the tunnel
boring machines (designed by Mitsubishi and assembled by Framatome of
France), to the rolling stock (Siemens, AEG and GEC/Alsthom), and the
signals and communications systems (Siemens and Alsthom). The factory which
makes concrete segments for the tunnels was assembled in France. Inside it,
only the labour and the cranes are Greek. One senior Attika insider says
German contractors supply even the wire mesh for the concrete segments,
first 'setting the specifications to ensure the Greeks can't compete
fairly'.
The imported content of the total project is estimated by Attika to be 75
per cent. 'I would say that most of the D-marks go back,' one senior officer
says. A Commission study shows that four out of every 10 Ecus for Portugal -
which gets roughly the Ecu19bn Greece gets - flows back to donor member
states.
The EU flows strengthen recipient countries' capital accounts, but worsen
their trade accounts and fiscal position because governments have to put up
public money to qualify for the EU finance.
In Spain, the biggest nominal recipient of about Ecu36bn in 1994-99, a
senior Treasury official says that 'the synergy' of the cohesion idea, 'once
translated into Spanish, means that we buy from Siemens'.
Apart from the import content of the high-speed train (AVE) from Madrid to
Seville, this is an exaggeration; Spanish construction companies are not
only competitive at home, but currently involved in building the Toulouse
metro. Spain's particular gripe is different.
As column four of the table shows, the poor countries make above-average
gross contributions to the EU budget, which is raised more from VAT receipts
than on the basis of relative prosperity. Even though they are net winners
after EU spending is distributed, gross outlays are made by the central
government and much of the EU inflow returns to local authorities, leaving a
hole in the central budget. 'This is a diabolical mechanism for our budget
deficit,' the Madrid treasury official says, and obliges governments to keep
public spending high.
So far the EU has provided only about 10 per cent of Spanish infrastructure
spending, rising to 15 per cent in 1994-99, but this official fears the EU
flow could still induce spending on unnecessary projects.
EU rules channel most funds towards the poorest areas, to try to iron out
regional imbalances rather than reinforce relative comparative advantage in
more developed areas such as Madrid, Valencia, Catalonia and the Basque
Country.
The Pta600bn Madrid-Seville AVE link - to which the EU contributed more than
Ecu400m - fits in with this policy, even though starting with a link from
the French frontier to Madrid, which Spain will largely have to fund itself,
would appear more logical.
The benefit of this and new road links to Spain's depressed south has yet to
translate into significant investment, much less jobs. But as Mr Jose
Borrell, Spain's minister of public works, says: 'You may not have industry
in Andalusia and Extremadura, but you have the chance of putting some there;
without roads and rail links you haven't'
The link runs through Castilla-La Mancha, the land of Don Quixote, where
Ciudad Real, a slumbering backwater now only 50 minutes instead of nearly
three hours from Madrid, has become a dormitory town for the capital and
alternative investment site for companies based there. 'It's been a sort of
unexpected miracle,' says Mr Jose Bono, Socialist president of the regional
government.
In his office in Toledo - once the Emperor Charles V's bedroom - Mr Bono
says EU funding amounting to 40 per cent of his budget is bringing the
region into the 20th century. Roads, electricity and telephones, modern
sewage plants and more rational irrigation, new schools and hospitals, have
drawn in more private investment since Spain joined the EU in 1986 than in
the previous half-century.
He and other Spanish officials acknowledge that Spain might have grown
faster by funding its more dynamic regions, but only at the cost of
'disarticulating' the country. 'That debate has been resolved for us by the
European model,' Mr Bono says, with gratitude and feeling.
