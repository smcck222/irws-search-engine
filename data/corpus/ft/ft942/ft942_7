FT  21 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Agency dangers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The creation of executive agencies has been one of the successes of the
Conservative reforms of the civil service. More than 60 per cent of civil
servants now work in more than 80 agencies, providing services such as the
payment of social security benefits, the management of prisons and the
testing of heavy goods vehicles. By allowing managers to focus on the
delivery of a particular service, the agency approach has improved the
efficiency and effectiveness of government services.
The success of agencies has also encouraged managers to adopt a more
entrepreneurial approach to the businesses they manage, seeking ways of
developing and expanding them. In some cases, the result has been to squeeze
the agency's assets - for example, by encouraging more foreign tourists to
visit historic royal palaces. In others, new business has come from
'value-added' services at premium prices, such as testing heavy goods
vehicles on operators' premises to improve fleet utilisation.
There are dangers, however, in this new entrepreneurialism if it brings
agencies into competition with the private sector. This is what appears to
be happening at HMSO, the agency that publishes government legislation such
as acts of parliament, statutory instruments and codes of practice. Legal
publishers have complained that HMSO is using its power to license the
reproduction of crown copyright texts to freeze them out of the market.
For example, HMSO will no longer license the reproduction of some
legislative source materials that are available under its own imprint. And
it is demanding royalties at full commercial rates for electronic
publishing, while itself entering the business through joint ventures. The
publishers say that the more restrictive approach dates from the conversion
of HMSO to an agency in 1988.
In any other line of business, such behaviour would soon fall foul of the
competition regulators. Yet as part of government, agencies are not covered
by the legislation on restrictive practices. While the Office of Fair
Trading would investigate a complaint, there is no legal remedy it could
take to stop anti-competitive behaviour against a crown organisation such as
an agency.
HMSO's new approach to licensing crown copyright materials indicates that
stronger supervision is needed to stop agencies using their privileged
position to damage potential competitors. If government bodies are
encouraged to trade and compete for business, they should be subject to the
same regulatory regime as the private sector. And if agencies are in a
position to compete with the private sector, they should be at the top of
the list for early privatisation.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Much as the US and Europe worry about their ability to compete, they lead
the world in the business of studying competitiveness. Indeed, the issue has
been so extensively analysed recently that there might seem little left to
say. To its credit, yesterday's report on the subject by Unice, the European
employers' federation, manages usefully to advance the frontiers of the
debate.
As well as making predictable calls for more flexible labour markets, lower
social costs and action to help small business, Unice embraces a more
radical idea. It is that the governments to which the report is addressed
are mainly responsible for the problems they are being called on to solve.
The only way out, it suggests, is to reduce permanently their traditional
roles, particularly in respect of public expenditure.
Unice's argument is not just that public spending is becoming increasingly
difficult to finance, but that much of it retards, rather than enhances,
productive economic enterprise. It urges more ambitious privatisation and
rigorous appraisal of future government investment, to ensure that it
contributes to economic welfare and does not squander resources on
activities which could be performed more efficiently by a competitive
private sector.
Such notions, though dear to British ministers, are far less widely shared
elsewhere in Europe. Among many continental governments, EU policymakers and
left-of-centre politicians generally, there remains a strong conviction that
increases in public expenditure are self-evidently a good thing, while cuts
are almost always economically and socially regressive.
They would do well to read the World Bank's latest World Development Report,
published this week. It mounts a devastating case against governments'
record as investors, citing widespread evidence of waste and economic
distortion, particularly in infrastructure projects. True, Europe's
performance has been superior to that of most developing countries. However,
that makes no less valid the Bank's central argument that public investment
focuses too much on increasing the stock of infrastructure for its own sake,
and far too little on the quality of services delivered. The unambiguous
message is that if the investment is to serve productive ends, the state
must make way for market forces.
That conclusion will not be easy to sell politically in Europe, nor to
implement. Unice's report, at least, offers a starting point. It also
provides timely support to Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister,
who says he wants to use his government's EU presidency in the second half
of this year to lead a crusade in favour of deregulation.

The news that Airtours, which specialises in ferrying the sun and sangria
crowds around the Mediterranean, is encouraging customers of its new cruise
ship venture to dress for dinner, reminds Observer of an old tale of a
wealthy scrap metal merchant who took his wife on a round-the-world cruise.
Two days out of Southampton, the retired couple were invited to dine at the
captain's table.
'Certainly not]' snapped the wife. 'We didn't pay all that money to eat with

<TEXT>
Now that the Thais have found a purpose for redundant Thames river-buses,
perhaps Britain's rail commuters might follow their practice regarding rail
networks.
In provincial Thailand, people use rail tracks for their personal transport,
improvising their own rolling stock from wheels placed under a
tea-tray-sized platform. Standing, they punt their way briskly down the
line, with the help of a long pole.
How many have not yearned to be their very own train driver? Imagine the
advantages: fitness addicts would take to it like ducks to water.
It might take a day to get into the City from Tunbridge Wells. But on
Wednesdays at least it would avoid sitting in traffic jams . . .

Mohammed Nashashibi, Palestine's new finance minister, was not in his office
yesterday. Not surprising really, as he doesn't have an office, a telephone,
or a secretary. He may or may not - depending on who you talk to - have a
home in Jericho, the fledgling capital of Palestinian self-rule.
Mohammed Shaker, the only man officially allowed to talk to the press on
behalf of the Palestinian administration, said the minister's whereabouts
were unknown.
He may have gone to Nablus, or east Jerusalem, or perhaps was indeed
somewhere in Jericho.
Nashashibi has said that his finance ministry would be the 'most important
department' of the new Palestinian administration. If he had a secretary,
that message could probably be passed on to his fellow officials.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's President Carlos Menem rarely misses a chance to embellish his
image of playboy, sportsman, racing car-driver and hob-nobber with
glitterati.
So when Oliver Stone sought his support for a film version of the musical
Evita, he agreed to open the doors of the Casa Rosada presidential palace -
the famous pink house in Buenos Aires that was the scene of Juan and Eva
Peron's greatest triumphs 40 years ago.
But he soon realised that the rank and file of his Peronist party - which
still worships the Perons - abhorred the notion of a Yankee film-maker
desecrating the image of Evita.
The president is even more interested in getting re-elected next year, so he
just as quickly pulled out again. Bitter tears from Oliver.

Who is Jill Rutter, the shadowy member of the prime minister's Downing

Surely she is not the same Jill Rutter who, as a Treasury civil servant, was
seconded to the team which dreamed up the poll tax? Many regard her as one
of its real architects.
If they are one and the same, then her presence behind the scenes at
Railtrack strengthens the suggestion of the late Robert Adley MP: that rail
privatisation is a 'poll tax on wheels'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the second world war, Brits grew accustomed to - if not exactly in love
with - that culinary miracle, the powdered egg. But has anyone spotted the
beer drinker's equivalent of a doodlebug?
The reason for asking is the news that somewhere in central Europe powdered
beer will soon be hitting the street. It is being launched by Jan Oliva, a
Czech brewer who hails from the land which gave us the original Budweiser.
Oliva, like many Czechs, is keen to break into the Russian beer market but
has been hindered by high transport costs. Hence his recipe for powdered
beer. Far from feeling shameful at committing such sacrilege, Oliva stoutly
defends his product: 'It looks like beer, it tastes like beer and it has a
head, too,' he says. It also has the big advantage of costing the equivalent
of 8p a pint.
Initially he is selling 40 tons of beer powder to the Russians. But who
knows how long it will be before British pubs are ringing to the cries of a
'pint of your best powder, Landlord]'

FT  21 JUN 94 / Leading Article: The left in disarray
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French Socialists' decision to ditch Michel Rocard is hardly surprising,
after their miserable score in the European election. But it would be sad if
this marked the end of Mr Rocard's political career. For 20 years he has
been the leading spokesman within the party for the arguments of reason, of
economic as well as political liberalism, and indeed of reality. He has been
handicapped throughout by President Mitterrand's ill-concealed, and on the
whole ill deserved, resentment.
In pure politics Mr Rocard was never Mr Mitterrand's equal, and the fact
that he has failed to revive his party's fortunes after its landslide defeat
in last year's parliamentary elections can hardly be denied. It seems that
Mr Jacques Delors may have a better chance of success. But it is also clear
that the crisis of French socialism, indeed of socialism Europe-wide or even
worldwide, goes well beyond questions of personality.
The existence of such a crisis is only loosely connected to the fall of
communism in eastern Europe. It was already visible well before 1989. The
central doctrine of socialism, namely collective ownership, had been seen to
be inefficient. More modest goals - the levelling of economic differentials,
the welfare state, the right of workers to organise and defend their
interests collectively within the workplace - had long since been accepted
in principle by most European conservatives. The latter challenged them only
at the point where they they became difficult to defend: where
redistributive taxation put too great a burden on the taxpayer, where
deficit-financed public spending threatened national bankruptcy and
hyperinflation, or where trade union power became a serious obstacle to
economic growth.
In Britain and Germany, during the 1980s and early 1990s, socialists have
failed repeatedly in their attempts to regain power, and have been driven to
accept more and more of their opponents' policies. In France and Spain
socialist parties were able to remain in power through most of this period,
but only because voters trusted them to blunt the sharper edges of a policy
shift towards economic freedom, which the socialists themselves acknowledged
as necessary and were prepared to carry out. But in the recession of the
early 1990s they found themselves unable to deliver on that promise, and are
now paying the electoral price. Fairness might seem to require that British
and German socialists should now be given a chance. But, on last week's
showing, German voters may not be ready to take that risk come October;
while British voters will not have the opportunity to do so for at least
another two years.
The European left may find encouragement in the efforts of President Bill
Clinton to elaborate a new agenda on such issues as healthcare and welfare.
But that has to be tempered by awareness that espousing policies similar to
those of Mr Clinton would involve a shift to the right far greater than most
European social democrat parties are prepared to contemplate. In much of
western Europe, the left has ceased to exist as a clear alternative to
conservatism or neo-liberalism. That may be a good thing in as much as the
old left's economic policies were misguided and ruinous. But in as much as
democracy is supposed to be about choice it is rather troubling. Disgruntled
voters may be tempted, as in Italy, to plump for the unknown.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No conflict in investigating
accountants becoming receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DERRICK S WOOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to Andrew Jack's article,'Debate Reopens on Accountants'
Insolvency Role' (June 16) which refers to Mr John Jackson's letter
published the same day. Mr Jackson 'launched an attack on the process by
which investigating accountants appointed by banks are permitted to take on
the receivership of the business they examine'.
I am a partner in Levy Gee, chartered accountants. We carry out a
significant number of viability reports on behalf of a good cross-section of
lending bankers. Each assignment commences with an agreed letter of
engagement which makes clear that our duty of care is owed to the lending
banker and not to their customer. A recent legal judgment stated that it is
not possible to owe a duty of care to more than one party.
A bank will not appoint a receiver if there is a viable alternative and any
insolvency practitioner who recommends this course, simply to improve his
fees, will soon see his work flow dry up.
Lending banks are reluctant to lose customers. What is rarely emphasised by
banks and accountants is the substantial amount of diligent work each does
in rescuing companies and businesses. About half of the cases we handle do
result in a receivership appointment. Therefore, the other half do not, and
I hope benefit from our involvement promoting better communication and
understanding between banker and customer.
Costs and efficiency is an important factor. Where receivership is
unavoidable, it is clearly cheaper and more efficient to have the same firm
conduct the viability assignment and the receivership. They will be familiar
with the company's situation and be able to 'hit the ground running'. A
fresh receiver would have to waste valuable time bringing itself up to speed
with the situation which could lead to higher costs and a slower result.
We do not agree with Mr Jackson that there may be some dangerous conflicts
of interest where he perceives that a reporting accountant can exercise
considerable economic power. Consider the case of the surgeon or barrister.
If they recommend surgery or proceedings to trial is it envisaged that they
would have to say 'sorry, please go to another surgeon/barrister as I have a
perceived economic power in pursuing your case and therefore you need to go
to somebody else to take the matter further'.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Vodafone valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICK EARLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re Lex's comment on the relative valuation of Cellnet and Vodafone
(Securicor, June 13). The valuation would be more comparable if it took
account of two important factors. First, the differing levels of debt in the
companies; Vodafone has more than Pounds 100m of net cash while Cellnet has
several hundred million pounds of capitalised finance leases.
Second, unlike Cellnet, Vodafone has substantial international investments
which could be worth Pounds 1bn. If these factors are taken into account
Cellnet would be valued at 65 per cent of Vodafone's UK operations, rather
than 45 per cent contained in Lex. The higher percentage seems a more
reasonable level; as Lex pointed out, Vodafone has double Cellnet's cash
flow and operating profit.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Bretton Woods - 50 Years: Recapturing a lost spirit - Ronald
McKinnon in the first of a series marking the anniversary of Bretton Woods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD MCKINNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Half a century after its signing in New Hampshire in 1944, the Bretton Woods
Agreement on currency convertibility and exchange rate stability holds its
mystical allure.
In the industrial countries today - with resurgent protectionism, recurrent
over- or under-valued exchange rates, high unemployment, and slow growth -
people talk wistfully of recapturing the spirit of Bretton Woods. It seems a
noble quest. But is the 1944 agreement the right starting point for
international monetary reform today?
After 1945, currencies in western Europe and Japan remained inconvertible
and in inflationary disarray. Trade remained bartered, narrowly bilateral,
and so limited that output in Europe and Japan stayed unnaturally depressed
well into 1948. Furthermore, either because its mandate was incorrectly
drawn or its financial resources were too slender, the International
Monetary Fund did nothing to relieve this currency impasse and the post-war
economic crisis.
The great rescue operation was engineered not by the IMF but by the Marshall
Plan, from mid-1948 through early 1952, in Europe, and by the 1949 Dodge
Plan in Japan. By 1951, the virtual elimination of inflation in western
Europe and Japan was followed by 20 years of stable (some would say unduly
rigid) exchange rates based on the US dollar - whose purchasing power over
tradeable goods also remained constant until about 1968. What can be called
the 'Marshall-Dodge fixed-rate dollar standard' led a healthy life until
1971, when President Nixon insisted that the dollar be devalued, to avoid
disinflating the American economy.
Both the Marshall and Dodge plans depended on direct dollar assistance from
the US. But surprisingly strong conditions - the elimination of fiscal
deficits and inflation, and the step-by-step elimination of currency
restrictions on current trade - were attached. In Europe, the capstone was
the European Payments Union (EPU), established in September 1950 for
securing full multilateral clearing among central banks of 16 western
European countries.
To ensure credibility, the US dollar was enthroned both as the unit of
account and means of settlement within the EPU. European governments
declared exact dollar parities, to facilitate clearing international
payments and secure a 'nominal anchor' for their war-ravaged financial
systems. Similarly, Japan fixed the yen at 360 per dollar, as an anchor for
its successful disinflation in 1949-50. To maintain their dollar parities,
European countries and Japan subordinated their domestic monetary policy to
their fixed exchange rates.
In what ways did the 1950-1970 Marshall-Dodge standard differ from the
spirit of Bretton Woods? Marshall-Dodge imposed a common monetary standard
on the industrial countries at the outset of the policy of fixing exchange
rates. Participating industrial countries experienced roughly the same low
rate of price inflation in tradeable goods - about 1 per cent per year - as
the US.
Why deny that the negotiators at Bretton Woods in 1944 wanted a stable
common monetary standard, or at least wished for something similar to
Marshall-Dodge? Keynes, who dominated the thinking of the conferees, drew up
the Bretton Woods articles to give each national government flexibility in
choosing its own macroeconomic policy, to secure full employment.
Remembering the failure of the international gold standard in the inter-war
period, Keynes did not want to establish any common monetary standard. Nor,
because of his concern with 'hot' money flows in the 1920s and 1930s, did he
want an unrestricted world capital market. He and his intellectual heirs
subscribe to the principle of national macroeconomic autonomy. After the
war, both Keynesians and monetarists rejected the idea that monetary
autonomy be limited by international obligations.
However, the Bretton Woods negotiators did want to restore normalcy in
foreign trade on current account. Continual exchange rate fluctuations, and
prolonged misalignments that upset a country's macroeconomic equilibrium,
were to be avoided. A new par-value system restricted short-run exchange
rate fluctuations within 1 per cent on either side of 'parity'. Exchange
parities would be easy to enforce as long as capital controls remained in
place. With economies insulated from each other on capital account, the main
criterion for the IMF to agree exchange depreciation would be whether a
country had an ongoing net trade deficit.
Thus did the negotiators of 1944 imagine they had reconciled the principle
of national macroeconomic autonomy with limitations upon exchange risk in
international trade.
With hindsight (and Milton Friedman), we now know inflationary national
monetary policies cannot sustain higher levels of employment. But that was
not the prevailing view at Bretton Woods in 1944. Despite its great success
in practice, the 'accidental' advent of the Marshall-Dodge standard was a
conceptual anathema to most professional economists in the 1950s and 1960s -
with echoes to the present day.
How does this potted history matter for reforming today's international
monetary system?
First, because international capital markets are now fully open, a trade
deficit no longer warrants an exchange depreciation - which the old spirit
of Bretton Woods encouraged. For example, the ongoing US current-account
deficit has encouraged the American government to cajole the Japanese into
two serious episodes of yen overvaluation - in 1986-87 and again in 1993-94.
In both cases, a slump in private investment, because of the exchange
overvaluation, caused a sharp downturn in the Japanese economy with no
reduction in its current account surplus.
Second, as with the Marshall-Dodge standard, securing more stable exchange
and interest rates must proceed simultaneously with the international
harmonisation of national monetary policies. The keystone must be a low or
zero rate of inflation in a broad basket of tradeable goods.
A second-best technique for providing a common nominal anchor is to turn the
job over to a single dominant country whose own internal price level has
been relatively stable. In some unusual historical circumstances, this may
work well for a while. Yet any such asymmetrical standard remains vulnerable
to upheavals in the centre country. Far better to negotiate a fully
symmetrical agreement among hard-currency countries - like Japan and the US
in the 1990s - for anchoring the price level of the group in a manner
consistent with keeping nominal exchange rates stable into the indefinite
future.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Ghosts of Labour past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world has turned. The British Labour party, founded by the trade unions,
is no longer wholly their creature. This is about to be demonstrated,
perhaps conclusively, during the leadership election. It is a historic
change. Some of us have long believed that Labour would not form another
government until it made itself as institutionally separate from the unions
as the American AFL-CIO is of the Democratic party. In Britain we are
nowhere near that happy state, but the management of the party by powerful
trade union leaders has become so diminished as to be a mere irritant.
It did not seem like that in 1992, when the late Mr John Smith was elected
leader with heavy and visible union support. Progress was made at last
year's conference, when one-member-one-vote was adopted for the selection of
parliamentary candidates, but it looked then as if the price Mr Smith paid -
a speech appearing to offer the unions favourable legislation by a future
Labour government - was too high. Now it can be seen that the most
celebrated decision of that conference was worth the effort expended in
engineering it. For the new method of voting for a leader, Mr Smith's
successor, is closer to genuinely democratic than anything in the party's
history.
The electoral college is divided into three: Labour representatives in the
Westminster parliament and the European assembly; constituency Labour party
members; and trade unionists who are also Labour supporters. Most, but not
all of the 3.75m or so individuals entitled to vote in the union section may
make their decisions without benefit of guidance or pressure from union
leaders. Of Britain's big five unions only the T&amp;G - the Transport and
General Workers - has recommended a candidate, Mrs Margaret Beckett. Yet all
five will send Labour's standard ballot forms to members' homes. These will
be accompanied by a leaflet produced by Labour party HQ, with each candidate
allowed a photograph and short election address. The last page will invite
recipients to join the party as direct members.
With fond memories of my long service in direct mail, that sounds convincing
to me. Yet if Labour is turning postal-democratic, it is the Tories who must
take some of the credit. Two companies, the Electoral Reform Society's
ballotting subsidiary and Unity Security Ballotting Services, will
scrutinise, and count the returns. They have had much practice as a result
of Conservative legislation obliging unions to consult their members every
other afternoon.
Nothing is perfect. The T &amp; G will stuff its envelopes with a statement
urging recipients to vote for Mrs Beckett. It may regret that. When its
general secretary, Mr Bill Morris, was elected there was a 24 per cent
return. Perhaps with all the publicity there may be 30 per cent this time.
That suggests that only the most politically aware in the T &amp; G will
participate. There is no telling how much those who do bother to mark their
ballots and send them in the reply-paid envelopes will be swayed by their
union's leaflet as against all the other influences on their thinking, but
there has to be some bias in favour of Mrs Beckett. There had better be a
bit, or Mr Morris and his executive will be seen to be as politically
impotent as in truth they have become.
The big five will account for something like three-quarters of the vote.
Some of the smaller unions have stated a preference for Mr John Prescott.
One is the railway union, the RMT, to which Mr Prescott offered strong
support yesterday. It will conduct a full postal ballot of 80,000 of its
members. Another, the GPMU printers' union, will hold workplace ballots for
97,000 political levy-paying members. Naturally it expects a higher turnout,
perhaps 75 per cent. We can be sure that these voters will be influenced by
the union officials who distribute and collect the papers, and may even
watch while the choice is made.
Such wrinkles aside, the national primary that is now being conducted should
produce a result that reflects the views of Labour supporters, or at least
those interested enough to vote. Some expect that proportion to reach 40 per
cent, on the grounds that the winner may well be the next prime minister.
Whatever the figure, the process will set union influence where it belongs,
on the margin of party affairs. Sooner or later the union block vote at
party conferences, already diluted, will be swept away, thus concluding the
divorce between party and 'movement'. Everyone should now be able to see
that coming.
What a pity, then, that none of the three leadership candidates - not even
Mr Tony Blair - has yet had the courage to say directly and in trenchant
terms that the RMT does no service by bringing its members out on strike. In
1964, when an unofficial stoppage shut down London's underground railway
during election week the then Mr Harold Wilson described it as
'intolerable', and went on to win with the greatest swing to Labour since
1945. In the current, official dispute the RMT has done everything by the
book. The management has played the government's hand badly. There is some
sympathy for the railway workers. That is still no reason for Labour's
putative leaders to be mealy-mouthed about an action that causes great
inconvenience to many people.
Such fearfulness of the spirit of union power past is Old Labour talking. It
still burbles. When the BBC went on strike on the night of the
Euro-elections the party ruled that none of its leaders should cross picket
lines. That was plainly absurd. Over the weekend Mrs Beckett contrived to
show that she was more sympathetic to secondary picketing, that scourge of
the 1970s, than either of the other two candidates. Mr Prescott neatly
stepped aside from that one, but he was not so robust as Mr Blair, who has
made it clear that his programme for labour legislation would not start with
a clear-out of the Thatcherite union laws.
The ideal Labour leader would replace the habit of supporting all official
strikes with a less predictable approach. Yet Mrs Beckett and Mr Prescott
evidently believe that they need the unions' approval. That may be why Mr
Blair, the likely winner as leader, and the most robust on unions, has
declined to state a preference for deputy. He must find it difficult to
choose between a millstone and an albatross.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No evidence of need for London
council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr GRAHAM M LOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Would international business be more likely to come to London, and,
that already here, stay if the capital had an elected council for the whole
of the built-up area grounded in the English system of local government? The
study London Factor ('London's image at risk, says report', June 16) argues
precisely that. The report says financial service companies feel London is
drifting aimlessly in the absence of such a council, and is destined to lose
out to other cities. I framed and did the interviewing for the study, but
feel obliged to dissociate myself from this interpretation.
Businesses with a high clerical component reduce operations in London
because costs and managerial complexities are too great - things a
London-wide council would not mitigate. Foreign banks that leave do so
because London is over-banked. International companies remaining have seen
London become more important recently to global business strategies revised
in the wake of the worldwide recession; but costs and potential returns will
loom ever larger in future in their locational decisions and may lead some
to move business away. A London-wide council would have little impact on
either factor. Those interviewed felt London's standing specifically
vis-a-vis Europe would on the whole not be significantly reduced by
financial centres and a central bank developing on the mainland - though
again, some work would inevitably move that became more suited to a European
location.
Problems mentioned by businesses interviewed - manpower, training,
transport, regulations - could be noticeably reduced through higher quality
decision-making and administration in existing local, central, and
institutional governments. None raised would appear to be better addressed
through a new local authority for Greater London.
It is important - unquestionably - to sustain London's image and its unique
status among world metropolises. Special, and highly flexible, arrangements
have to be found to bring real strategic thinking regularly to bear on big
issues. Systems of city-wide government elsewhere, and continual failure in
London's past to orchestrate land-use planning successfully as between
housing transport and jobs, show us what to avoid, not what to repeat. A
London-wide local authority has been superimposed on the London Factor
study. I fear it does not emerge from the evidence.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Concorde, but not Cleveland fallacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRUCE STEVENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Once again your Leader writer devalues a well-argued examination of the
failings of the Local Government Review ('Councils and the Concorde
fallacy', June 14) with the repetition of the myth that there is case for
abolishing a conurbation-wide authority in the Teesside area because
Cleveland County is 'unpopular'.
Fact: Results of Mori opinion polls for the Local Government Commission show
the level of community identity with Cleveland is above average, higher, for
example than Lincolnshire, Dorset, Wiltshire and Gloucestershire - and twice
the level of Avon with which you seek to bracket us.
Fact: When Harris Opinion Research surveyed local people on behalf of the
Institute for Local Government Studies it found satisfaction levels with
Cleveland County services among the highest recorded for any local authority
in recent years.
Fact: Cleveland County Council has not argued for its own survival, but for
the recreation of a Teesside-wide authority, with a separate authority for
Hartlepool. The Mori survey figures show that the identity level of
Teessiders with a Teesside-wide authority is one of the highest recorded
anywhere in the country.
You are quite right to compare this ill-fated Review with the 'Concorde
fallacy'. But please - stop repeating the 'Cleveland Fallacy.'

for deaf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From STUART ETHERINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your excellent supplement on Telecommunications in Business (June 15)
omits to mention one group of citizens who have more than most to benefit
from the information technology revolution.
Britain's 7.5m deaf and hard of hearing people stand to profit from a great
break through in communications, especially as video-phone technology
becomes common-place in the home and office. For deaf people  - whose first
language is British sign language - video phones allow independent access to
the telephone network for the first time, as current trials at the RNID are
proving.
The IT revolution, which is changing all of our lives, will end generations
of exclusion and second-class status for deaf people in Britain.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Arts: Hung, but by its own petard - This is not art but a
product marketed as such
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In their very different ways, the two exhibitions now filling the Anthony
d'Offay galleries say much the same thing of the present avant-garde, at
least in its high commercial aspect. None of it is shocking, any more, and
goodness knows it must sell very well or it would hardly be where it is. In
one sense, at least, it makes very good sense indeed.
But while none of us objects to the successful turning of an honest crust,
we are left with a legitimate question hanging in the air: what has any of
it to do with art? For what seems to be on offer here is not art as such but
a product marketed as art, which is not quite the same thing. Perhaps it is
but the cynical exploitation of a gullible market - but need we weep for
those in a position to be thus exploited? No: a fool and his money, and all
that. Only when it begins to take itself seriously, to seek to justify
itself in high and abstract terms, does the cynicism betray itself.
Of the two artists on show, Georg Baselitz is at once the more interesting
as an artist and, in consequence, the more seriously dispiriting. For here
is the once powerful and original painter who, in the late 1970s, adopted
the bare formula of turning his pictures upside-down. He has never looked
back. At the Venice Biennale of 1980 he showed a monstrous reclining and
gesticulating figure. It was rudely carved but possessed even so a raw
energy and primitive authority. His sculpture, like his painting, has grown
ever more crude and perfunctory in both image and execution ever since.
In this latest show are three large wood-carvings, though hacked rather than
carved would be a better description. One is a monumental head, faintly
reminiscent in its profile of the Indian tradition. The others are one-armed
torsos, of which the larger retains what passes for a head. All three are
presented in their raw state, but for the selective application of bright
red paint to breasts, eyes and mouths. Again, to say the paint is applied is
generous, for in truth it is slapped on, to stick where it hits.
This is what Heinrich Heil has to say in his catalogue note: 'Baselitz is on
the move, a man possessed . . . he crisscrosses the quarry of past forms,
preparing the way for his pandemonic will to return in ever new formations .
. . Heathenry pervades the entire body of Frau Paganismus (Mistress
Paganism) - instilled in her by Baselitz, the intellectual iconoclast, not
in order to cast out the Alien but to find the Other beneath the gashed
smoothness of sacred sculpture.' Is it only such rubbish as this, that would
have us take it so seriously, that gives cynicism its bad name; or do Heil
and Baselitz themselves believe in it?
The thought that Baselitz is not a cynic at all, but a true believer, would
be a matter for real and lasting despair. Whichever the case, the tragedy is
that he remains the artist in potential he always was. Even as they stand,
these carvings are possessed of a remarkable physical presence for being the
lumps of wood they are. What Baselitz offers us in such things, alas, is
only the proposition of image and idea, never the resolution.
Jeff Koons could never be accused of not taking things far enough. In the
face of his excesses, how we wish he could. His mystery lies only in how he
has advanced so far in his reputation as an artist at all. We are back to
Marcel Duchamp again, and, with his urinal and bicycle wheel, to his
ironical play on the nature and status of the work of art  - only the poor
old innocent was not to know that his ready-made would become the byword for
all that is mindless and facile in late 20th century art.
Koons has made his fortune by it, first declaring himself as an artist, some
10 years ago, by showing squadrons of brand-new Hoovers in gallery cabinets,
and floating basket-balls - eat your heart out, Damien Hirst  - in tanks of
water. So he has progressed, as we can see, through model railway engines in
stainless steel; St John the Baptist with a pig and penguin in porcelain;
naked children; a pile comprising a pig, goat, two dogs and a bird in
painted wood; a bear and a policeman; to vases of carved wooden flowers, and
wooden poodles. Only the works from the 'Marriage Made in Heaven', to Ilona
Staller, 'la Cicciolina' - now on the rocks - are missing.
Here then is the celebration of the kitsch and the banal, with its circular
and self-serving justification that goes back to Dada, though the wit gets
ever thinner - object, and you have missed the point: accept, and still you
have missed the point. What does Koons have to say about it all? 'I believe
that taste is really unimportant: salesmen are today's great communicators:
I believe artists must exploit themselves, and they must also take the
responsibility to exploit their viewers: I am completely adaptable. In the
art world I have always found everyone very weak. The art world really has
been up for grabs.' He at least is an open cynic.
Georg Baselitz: Frau Paganismus; until July 30: Jeff Koons: A Survey; until
August 18. Both at the Anthony d'Offay galleries, Dering Street, W1.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Arts: Measure for Measure - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fortunes of Shakespeare's lesser-known plays cast a fascinating light on
social attitudes. The modern age tunes in clearly to the wavelength of
Troilus and Cressida, for example, with its bleak cynicism towards romantic
love and bilious vision of ruling classes bickering over war as they would
at croquet. Now comes a Measure for Measure which underlines our current
obsession with the private weaknesses of public figures, homing in on the
outward puritan who burns with inner lust.
Angelo's hypocrisy is less important than his abuse of power as ducal deputy
to gratify his lust. Unlike today's British popular press, the Elizabethans
distinguished between the domestic habits and the professional abilities of
their rulers. They would not automatically agree that a bureaucrat is
unfitted to negotiate defence contracts, say, because he wears panty-hose at
home, when indeed the reverse might well be true.
Cheek by Jowl has toured its new version through such exotic localities as
Tokyo, Rio, St Petersburg and Darlington. At the Lyric, Hammersmith, for a
month, Declan Donnellan's updated production begins ominously. With Peter
Lilley's hairline and John Gummer's devoutness, the sleekly-suited career
politician Angelo portends heavy-handed satire. Will the well-meaning but
out of touch Duke be played as Prince Charles? When he yells 'Supply me with
the habit]' is he demanding a monkish gown or a quick fix?
The production is not that crass. Over the years Cheek by Jowl has evolved a
style that might be defined as the unthinking man's Jonathan Miller. This
can result in freshness and vitality or the overegged pudding of a Twelfth
Night when almost every line was re-interpreted, even working in an implied
affair between a weepy Feste and a hunky Texan Aguecheek. The suspicion
lingers that the company's main aim is to show A-level students that the
classics can be cool.
The new Measure for Measure avoids such excesses. It skips through the
low-life scenes with restraint (Mistress Overdone is modelled on a Dora
Bryan chirpy tart, c1950). It inspires some excellent acting. It oddly makes
little of the central dilemma - should Isabella sleep with the man who can
spare her brother's life? - and leaves a moral puzzle at the play's heart.
For Stephen Boxer's Duke, incognito among his subjects and foiling his
deputy's tyranny in the nick of time, is seen as a melodramatically
excitable and really rather silly protagonist of a silent-screen
cliff-hanger. He is cut down to size as a meddler who toys with people's
lives. The final scene of retribution, reconciliation and mercy finds the
assembled company grim-faced with resentment. The Duke has played God and we
live in a secular age. This is 20th-century editorialising; if you accept
the Duke, not Angelo, as the (unwitting) villain of the piece, it paints a
desolate picture of a society with no point of moral reference.
It also turns Lucio into a romantic hero. The 'fantastic', a louche
man-about-town, parasite and name-dropper, is brilliantly seen as a
gossip-columnist figure. One of life's free lunchers, he blossoms in
scabrous anecdotage about his alleged familiarity with the great. In Mark
Bazeley's performance, a near-schizoid awareness gives glimpses of
self-loathing.
In this climate of rottenness even the most blameless character is reduced
to status of bawd: the jilted Mariana is a cackling drunk, though when
allowed to Marianne Jean-Baptiste shows a moving dignity. Yet even in this
corrupt Vienna, there are two performances that would fit magnificently into
a traditional production.
Anastasia Hille's Isabella, long-eyed and with the wide mouth of a Greek
tragic mask, begins as fluttery, uncertainly bossy as she pleads for her
brother, meeting Angelo's pedantry with her own. Her eventual focus on rage,
shock and grief is almost painful to watch. Adam Kotz lends Angelo tragic
stature: the dry, bloodless inhumanity that can blaze helplessly into
passion. Even in sexual blackmail, his bureaucratic logic remains: he
rightly makes 'Who will believe thee, Isabel?' the most chilling line in the
play.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Arts: Francesca da Rimini - Opera in concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Riccardo Zandonai's Francesca da Rimini may not be a first-rate opera, but
it is one of the best pieces of its kind and the Chelsea Opera Group, which
places us all in its debt with regular concert performances of neglected
works, made a good case for it at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Saturday.
Operas by Puccini's younger and lesser contemporaries have received a bad
press here recently - Giordano's Fedora at Covent Garden got a decided
critical unwelcome last month - but Francesca, a more deserving cause than
any of Giordano's operas, does not seem to have had a chance to prove itself
in England since it reached Covent Garden just five months after its Turin
premiere in February 1914. Francesca has fared better elsewhere: it is done
from time to time in Italy, the Metropolitan Opera revived it ten years ago,
and it turns up next month at the Bregenz Festival.
D'Annunzio's late-Romantic elaboration of the story from Dante's Inferno
gave Zandonai (who died 50 years ago this month) rich scope for atmospheric
writing. Francesca is thickly scored - consistently colourful, seldom
cloying - and the orchestra rose to it, despite some tentative playing in
the 'silent love duet'. The chorus projected the battle music - irrelevant,
but a spectacular diversion - effectively. Though the lush score substitutes
melodramatic gesture for dramatic urgency, Nicholas Braithwaite conducted a
lively, loving performance.
In the title role, Hannah Francis gave an expressive performance, using her
creamy soprano to make the most of the character's surprisingly undramatic
music. The three brothers in the plot were all clearly characterised: the
tenor Richard Berkeley-Steele (ENO's recent Lohengrin) sang Paolo, the
handsome brother with whom Francesca falls in love, with plenty of unforced
tone; the brutal Gianciotto, who Francesca is tricked into marrying, was
taken with vivid power by the bass Phillip Joll; and the unpleasant
Malatestino, who out of jealousy alerts Gianciotto to the lovers, was sung
with tenorial venom by Gareth Lloyd. Two soprano ladies-in-waiting, Jillian
Foster as Garsenda and Helen Astrid as Biancofiore, stood out from the rest
of the large cast for their lively performances.

The last in ITV's impressive series 20 Miles From Piccadilly Circus follows
the final weeks in the life of 86 year old Flo Martin whose family have
lived and worked in Eynsford for two centuries (7.30). Television's love
affair with all things royal is now such that there is rarely a week when
'unprecedented access' is not being given to one sycophant or another in
order to slide another great slab of Windsor PR on to the screen. Next week
Prince Charles gets two and a half hours to himself, be warned. Today BBC1
manages a 'rare opportunity' to go inside The Other House Of Windsor: the
one in Paris occupied by the former King Edward VII and Wallis Simpson
(8.30). Given the way that South Korea managed to score twice and force a
draw in the last few moments of their match against Spain, who knows what
may happen when Spain play Germany tonight in World Cup 94 (8.30 ITV). There
will almost certainly be more excitement in the final episode of Quantum

third episode in a rather good drama series about local government: Little
Napoleons (10.00).

FT  21 JUN 94 / Arts: 'The Rake' renewed - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Hockney has done some repainting for Glyndebourne's celebrated
production (from 1975) of The Rake's Progress, and in the new house his
designs look more brilliant than ever: witty, imaginatively apt, visually
sensational. John Cox has come back to direct it again, and with the odd
bright new detail the whole conception rings true. This is an unforgettable
staging.
Musically - well, it is nearly as good. Andrew Davis takes the London
Philharmonic through Stravinsky's score with his usual lively intelligence,
and due care for his singers. The darkest, sternest passages are a touch
lightweight; the soft-edged attack that Davis cultivates so appealingly in
Richard Strauss alternates here with nervy brittleness. I found myself
wishing that he could swop places with Elgar Howarth at the Garsington
Opera: Davis to lavish more unashamed tenderness upon Strauss's Capriccio,
Howarth to emphasise the tough muscle in the Rake.
Tom Rakewell himself is sung by an interesting American tenor, Stephen
O'Mara (his first time): a nice edge of hysteria, genuinely moving when
ruined, but too much tight tone and too often unintelligible in the
Auden/Kallman words. Promising, though; and so is Christiane Oelze's sweetly
frail Anne Trulove, though she misses the brave resolve of her climactic Act
1 aria. It is left to Steven Page's potent, saturnine Nick Shadow - the
Mephisto-figure - to wield the full weight of his character, and thus to
dominate the evening.
It was only two years ago that this latecoming star essayed the role for
Glyndebourne's young touring company; but Page should expect an
international demand for his Nick in many future seasons. Besides the
advantage of imposing height, he is a sharp and subtle actor, in towering
command of his words and his music.
For Baba the Turk, the Rake's rash choice of a circus-wife, Jane Henschel's
throaty comic delicacy matches her luxuriant beard, more plausible than any
I've seen on a Baba. Cox has given her an affecting moment when she plucks
out a hair of it - at some evidently painful cost - for one of her admirers.
On a cameo scale Robert Tear's ripe, preening auctioneer is perfect too,
lending a vital theatrical charge to the post-prandial third act (specially
important at Glyndebourne, as the audience is liable to drift off). Frode
Olsen makes a fine, upstanding Trulove pere, and Angela Hickey a cheery old
trout as Mother Goose, the brothel-mistress. In the brothel scene and
everywhere else, I missed more of the eager Glyndebourne chorus's words than
expected.
As with O'Mara's Tom, however, I was unsure whether the fault lay with them
or with the tricks of the acoustic. For Figaro three weeks ago I sat in the
rear stalls, a bit higher, and heard almost every word; nearer the stage
this time, I lost many more of them. That may be one of the uncontrollable
accidents of the theatre, and in any case the losses were marginal compared
to the persuasive certainties of the production.
Revival sponsored by British Airways; in repertory until August 14

FT  21 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Transatlantic alliance - Robert Rice
considers the implications of a US-UK legal merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Transatlantic mergers between law firms are back on the agenda. After a lull
of three years - the result of recession on both sides of the Atlantic -
commercial lawyers in the UK and the US will today wake up to the news that
two firms are joining forces: Titmuss Sainer &amp; Webb, a medium-sized City of
London firm will throw in its lot with Dechert Price &amp; Rhoads, a large
Philadelphia-based US firm.
The new partnership will be known as Titmuss Sainer Dechert. Dechert's
London office will close and its London partners will become partners of the
new alliance while remaining partners of Dechert in the US and in Brussels.
What most City lawyers will want to know is whether the alliance represents
the start of the long-expected rush to form transatlantic partnerships, or
whether it is merely the extension of the type of exclusive mutual referral
of work which has been the basis of several transatlantic relationships,
such as that of Los Angeles-based O'Melveny &amp; Myers and City solicitors
Macfarlanes.
Mr Michael Smith, senior partner of Titmuss, and Mr Eddy Kling, the partner
in charge of Dechert's London office, say the arrangement is a merger in all
but name. Together the two firms will have more than 450 lawyers in eight
locations enabling them to advise domestic and international clients on a
broader range of UK, European and US issues. Certainly, Mr Smith and Mr
Kling believe, the arrangement goes beyond any of the current referral
arrangements between US and UK firms.
In the heady period of the late 1980s there had been much talk of mergers
between large US and UK practices to form multinational law firms capable of
meeting the challenge of providing legal services on a global scale. But the
economic slowdown in the US and the UK put such plans on hold. As the two
economies move out of recession and firms look to expand once more,
transatlantic mergers are being actively considered again.
Firms which struggled during the recession are busy pondering what they
should do to regain market share. With significant over-capacity in the
domestic legal markets in Europe and the US, expansion overseas is one
obvious option. But funding international offices is expensive for all but
the most profitable law firms. A merger with a strong US law firm could
provide the answer for medium-sized European firms.
Does the Titmuss/Dechert alliance fall into that category? Mr James Wyness
senior partner of City-based international law firm Linklaters &amp; Paines says
the market would interpret the Titmuss/Dechert alliance as, in effect, a
takeover of Titmuss by Dechert.
Dechert is by far the bigger of the two. Dechert, ranked 47th by size in the
US, had 136 partners and 336 lawyers according to the American Lawyer
magazine's 1993 league table of America's top 100 law firms. Titmuss, in
contrast, is ranked 39th by size in the UK with 48 partners and 147 lawyers,
according to Legal Business magazine's 1993 top 100.
There is also a big difference in the financial performance of the two
firms. According to American Lawyer Dechert was ranked 56th by gross
revenues in 1993 with a turnover of Dollars 108m for the 1992-93 financial
year. It was ranked 67th in profitability with profits per partner of
Dollars 315,000. According to Legal Business Titmuss had a turnover of
Pounds 19.8m in 1992-93, placing it 39th in the UK top 100 law firms with
profits per partner of Pounds 158,000 (36th).
In spite of these differences, Mr Wyness says that the link-up still falls
short of a full merger. 'For a start it doesn't involve full profit
sharing,' he says. 'Yet it is more than an arrangement to refer business to
one another.'
In effect, Titmuss is taking on Dechert's London and Brussels partners. The
arrangement will give Dechert a stronger English law capability and Titmuss
a strong US referral stream, a Brussels office and a transatlantic
dimension.
Both firms have assessed the impact of the loss of referral work from other
law firms and the impact on their existing client base and concluded that
their link-up would lead to an increase in turnover, an improved image and
better services to clients, Mr Wyness says.
The firms say they are keen to secure a bigger slice of the global legal
services market and believe they would be better placed to achieve this as a
single unit.
Most legal observers say the alliance is unlikely to have a big impact on
the legal services market, largely because the two firms are both
medium-sized in their respective markets. 'It's not a blockbuster', Mr
Wyness says. The big shake-up will come when two top firms - such as
Freshfields and Davis Polk Wardwell - decide to form an alliance.
Medium-sized London firms which compete head on with Titmuss may be more
shaken by the alliance, he says. 'A number of them may well say 'why don't
we do the same'. But they will have to ask themselves whether they are
better able to serve their clients independently or in an arrangement such
as this. A lot may be tempted by the idea that such an arrangement might
enhance their image,' says Mr Wyness.
What do the clients of Titmuss think about the arrangement?
Mr Darren Clayton, company secretary of Travelex, the international bureaux
de change operator which has been using Titmuss for some 16 years, said his
initial reaction was 'very positive.' The law firm's approach squares with
Travelex's entrepreneurial style, he says. Last year Travelex opened up
bureaux at airports throughout the US and has a considerable demand for US
legal services.
In the US, Travelex has traditionally used New York-based law firm Milbank
Tweed Hadley &amp; McCloy. But Mr Clayton recalls that on several occasions when
he has needed advice on a US matter, he was unable to get it immediately
because of the time difference between London and New York. With the new
Titmuss-Dechert arrangement, Mr Clayton should be able to get first-hand
advice on US issues in London without having to wait until New York wakes
up. 'That's a superb benefit,' he says.
Milbank is also a large firm, he adds, and although Derchert is big by US
standards its style appears closer to that of Titmuss, a factor that appeals
to Mr Clayton. So will Travelex use Dechert in the US?
Mr Clayton says he will decide after meeting the partners in Dechert's New
York office next month. Ideally, he would like to use Dechert in the US.
'I've had very good feed-back from the US about them so I can see no reason
not to. We are an international company, so for our chosen law firm to
become more international can only be good.'
But will Dechert's long-standing US-based multinational clients feel the
same way about using Titmuss in London? Mr Wyness suggests that Dechert's
US-based clients, accustomed to being referred to leading City firms on big
transactions, may raise eyebrows if they are suddenly steered towards a
(medium-sized) London firm they have never used before.
'I wonder whether the arrangement will bring Titmuss deals it would not have
otherwise got,' Mr Wyness says.
That will be the litmus test. If the link-up does bring Titmuss more global
work, then other City firms could also start to dust off their own
transatlantic merger plans.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Nicholson gets its Butler - Legal
Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholson Graham &amp; Jones, a medium-sized City law firm has appointed Mr Jim
Butler, former senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick, as a non-executive
member of its partnership board. Mr Butler is chairman of European Passenger
Services and a non-executive director of British Rail, Tomkins, the
conglomerate, and Camelot, the consortium put together to run the UK
National Lottery. His role at Nicholson will be to advise on management
issues and act in an ambassadorial capacity.
Mr Michael Johns, Nicholson's managing partner said the firm was looking for
a non-executive with a professional services background to take an objective
look at the partnership. By appointing Mr Butler the firm was 'trying to say
we're ambitious, that we want to be seen to be different and that we are
flexible', he said.
Nicholson is not the first firm to take on outsiders in a non-executive
capacity. Freshfields has two non-executive members of its partnership
board. Mischon de Reya also has a non-executive chairman. But Nicholson is
the first medium-sized City firm to take-on a non-executive and Mr Johns
believes Mr Butler's appointment could spark a trend. Management is an issue
for all law firms at the moment, he says.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Commission loses in PVC cartel case -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Court has dismissed the European Commission's appeal against the decision of
the Court of First Instance in a case involving an alleged cartel in the
European chemical industry. The ECJ annulled the Commission's decision for
procedural irregularity because it failed to authenticate the decision in
accordance with its rules of procedure.
However, the court set aside the CFI's ruling of 27 February 1992 on the
grounds that it had been wrong to decide that the Commission's decision was
non-existent.
In December 1988, the Commission adopted a decision ordering several
chemicals companies to terminate an alleged cartel agreement in the plastics
sector and imposing fines totalling Dollars 27.5m. Fourteen PVC companies
appealed to the CFI. In the course of the court proceedings, the Commission
admitted that it could not produce a copy of the original decision signed by
the president of the Commission and the executive secretary as required by
the Commission's internal procedural rules.
The CFI also found breaches of the Community law principle of the
unalterability of Community decisions. Differences existed between the
various legally binding language translations of the decision published in
the Official Journal and notified to the parties after adoption by the
Commission in December 1988.
The CFI decided that the lack of authentication of the decision by the
Commission was so serious that Community law required the Commission's
decision to be declared non-existent.
The Commission appealed against the CFI's ruling to the ECJ. It relied on
four grounds. The ECJ only considered one, since it found in favour of the
Commission and set aside the CFI's decision of 27 February 1992 because it
contained an error of law.
The ECJ agreed with the Commission that a procedural defect such as the
Commission's failure to authenticate a measure in accordance with its
procedural rules had to be of sufficient gravity before it could be treated
as legally non-existent.
The ECJ said acts of EU institutions are in principle presumed to be lawful
and accordingly produce legal effects, even if they are tainted by
irregularities, until such time as they are annulled or withdrawn.
By way of exception to that principle, acts tainted by an irregularity whose
gravity is so obvious that it cannot be tolerated by the Community legal
order must be treated as having no legal effect and as legally non-existent.
The purpose of the exception, it said, was to maintain a balance between two
fundamental, but sometimes conflicting, requirements with which the legal
order must comply, namely 'stability of legal relations' and 'respect for
legality'.
The ECJ went on to state that when it sets aside a decision of the CFI, it
had the power to give final judgment in the original appeal where the state
of the proceedings permitted.
The court only dealt with the argument raised by the PVC companies relating
to the Commission's failure to comply with the authentication requirements
in its own rules of procedure. They stated: 'Acts adopted by the Commission,
at a meeting or by written procedure, shall be authenticated in the language
or languages in which they are binding by the signatures of the president
and the executive secretary.'
The ECJ said that contrary to the Commission's claims, the authentication
rule was not a mere formality but was intended to guarantee legal certainty
by ensuring that the text adopted by the College of Commissioners became
fixed in the languages which were binding. In the event of dispute, it could
then be verified that the texts notified or published corresponded precisely
to the text adopted by the college.
The ECJ, therefore, annulled the decision for infringement of essential
procedural requirements, ordering the Commission to pay costs. On 15 June,
the Commission stated in a formal press release (IP/94/538) that it intended
to adopt the decision again without any procedural defects.

FT  21 JUN 94 / People: DTI enlists the great and the good for its
governance committee
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry has announced its committee of the
Great and the Good to examine whether relations between investing
institutions and UK corporations can be improved.
Committee chairman is Paul Myners, the sometimes outspoken chairman of
Gartmore, the fund management company, who is viewed as a hawk on matters of
corporate governance. Discussing the committee's role, Myners takes a
diplomatic stance: 'I think it is primarily an issue of communication
(between shareholders and corporate management). But it can mean that
managers are hesitant about committing capital to long-term projects.'
However, whether the committee offers a radical solution to the perceived
problems of short-termism in investment remains to be seen. The members,
drawn from leading corporations and investment houses, can come up with
meaningful suggestions. 'The challenge will be for us to produce something
interesting,' concedes one member.
Other members are Hugh Collum, finance director at SmithKline Beecham, who
has served there since the early 1980s and is credited with helping restore
the company's fortunes. He is also a former chairman of the influential 100
Group of Finance Directors which at times has been at loggerheads with
shareholders over corporate governance issues.
Also on the committee are Bernard Harty of the Chamberlain Corporation of
London which advises local authority pension funds, Huw Jones, director of
corporate finance at Prudential Portfolio Managers and chairman of the
Association of British Insurers Investment Committee. Also present are James
Joll, finance director of Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, and Richard
Lapthorne, currently finance director at British Aerospace who came to his
post from Courtaulds following BAe's ousting of its former chairman Roland
Smith.
Other committee members are Colin Lever, head of the investment division at
actuarial consultants Bacon and Woodrow, Geoff Lindey, head of UK
institutional investment at JP Morgan Investment Management and chairman of
the National Association of Pension Funds investment committee, and William
Stuttaford, chairman of the European division of Invesco, who formerly
headed Framlington, the fund management company.

FT  21 JUN 94 / People: Fraser to coax investors to Britain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Invest in Britain Bureau, now a separate division within the UK's
department of trade and industry responsible for internationally marketing
Britain as an investment opportunity, has created a new post of chief
executive. Andy Fraser, 43, will be the first incumbent, as from July 4.
Fraser's background is solidly within the world of international
advertising. Born in Kuala Lumpur, since April 1992 he has been managing
director of CDP Europe, the advertising agency now 43 per cent-owned by the
Japanese agency Dentsu.
Before that he was executive vice president and director of business
development for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising worldwide. He spent 1976-80 in
Thailand, where he was managing director for McCann-Erickson. A graduate of
Sussex University, where his degree was in English and American studies,
Fraser's first job in advertising was with Young and Rubicam, which he
joined in 1972 in London.
In the past financial year more than 300 foreign projects worth an estimated
Pounds 1.3bn and generating more than 56,000 jobs have been attracted into
the UK via the operations of the IBB, which is the UK government's main
inward investment promotions agency.
By tempting a well-paid and successful marketing executive from the private
sector to take up this new post, the DTI appears to be signalling a
determination to make the IBB, which was first set up in 1977, a more
flourishing, outward-bound entity.
Three core tasks await Fraser: furthering the cross-fertilisation between
the DTI and business, both British and foreign; stimulating greater inward
investment by a more vigorous marketing campaign which preaches the virtues
of the UK's economic base; and establishing the IBB firmly in the minds of
would-be investors as the first stop for advice and assistance.
The current director of the IBB, Christopher Priston, who has been a civil
servant since 1973 after working for Fisons, Courtaulds and others, will
become deputy chief executive.

He ran away from home at Cloonmore in west Ireland at the age of 16 to
travel to Sheffield where his uncle reluctantly agreed to employ him and
rose rapidly as the company expanded. It was under Jack Gleeson that the

FT  21 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Quality under fire -
Richard Gourlay on a broadside attack against BS5750
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quality in management, manufacturing and the provision of services is a bit
like motherhood and apple pie; everyone these days is in favour. How this
elusive goal is best pursued, however, is increasingly contentious.
Last week the quality industry, which has sprung up in the UK around the
BS5750 quality standard, received a broadside from the heart of the British
scientific establishment. In a 100-page report, the Science and Engineering
Policy Studies Unit, a body whose parents are The Royal Society and The
Royal Academy of Engineering, accuses the national quality 'industry' of
being inward-looking, insufficiently focused on the customer and attracting
its 'share of cowboys'.
It says the BS5750 quality standard is but a small part of total quality
management and that it tends to enshrine existing practices rather than
encourage continuous improvement. Sepsu argues for greater recognition for
companies doing their own quality assessments and says UK competitiveness
needs more award schemes such as the UK Quality Award launched earlier this
year.
'The quality assurance business is run largely by . . . assessors,
certifiers, accreditors, consultants,' the Sepsu report says. 'It is not run
by its customers. Indeed, there is a temptation for the assessors etc to
regard each other as their customers with the real customer nowhere to be
seen.'
Sepsu's criticism comes just two months after Brussels entered the debate
with a European Commission document called Elements of Community Quality
Policy. This paper aims to put ISO 9000 - the European equivalent of BS5750
 -in perspective as part, but only part, of the quest for competitiveness.
Elements of the Sepsu report are likely to be endorsed in the autumn when
they are incorporated in a Department of Trade and Industry document called
Managing in the 90s.
Looming largest in Sepsu's sights is the British Standards Institution,
which not only sets quality standards but, through its BSI Quality Assurance
arm, certifies more than 50 per cent of companies seeking BS5750. Describing
BSI's domination of the accreditation market as 'unhealthy', the Sepsu
report says: 'There is thought to be too much scope for partiality between
the quasi-legislative BSI, which is under constant pressure to increase the
income from non-government sources, and its commercially successful
offshoot.'
Derek Prior, director of communications at the BSI, agrees some of the
infrastructure that has sprung up around BS5750 certification does need
over-hauling. He rejects the report's suggestion that BSI's certification
and standards-setting functions should be split. And he also doubts whether
self assessment could ever replace external assessment by certification
bodies.
The report reviews existing research into quality management and draws on
interviews with 12 companies and 58 witnesses, including the quality
assurance director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK and representatives from
the Confederation of British Industry and the DTI.
'We are putting ISO 9000 in its place, it has a place but it is not the
whole game,' says Peter Collins, Sepsu director. The two standards address
only a small fraction of what companies need to manage if they are pursuing
a total quality approach, he says. 'If unimaginatively implemented, ISO 9000
can easily become a tool for codifying and freezing current practice; total
quality management is much more concerned with continuous improvement.'
Sepsu contrasts the scope of the BS5750 standard with the nine areas the UK
Quality Award seeks to examine - a definition of quality that was originally
taken from the acclaimed Baldrige Award in the US. In focusing on processes,
BS5750 addresses only one of the nine areas that the award's architects
consider contribute to excellence. The other eight, which are largely
ignored, are leadership, people management, policy and strategy, resources,
people satisfaction, customer satisfaction, the impact on society and
business results.
Collins says more than 1m copies of the Baldrige Award questionnaire have
been sent to companies, simply because they are useful tools for
self-assessment.
The report questions BS5750's place in smaller companies. While few small
businesses would not benefit from adopting its basic principles, the costs
of obtaining third party accreditation may be inappropriate.
It suggests the government could provide funds to spread the idea that
self-assessed quality management programmes are a powerful catalyst for
sustained improvement in performance.
The British Quality Foundation could also consider developing another
quality award category for companies with fewer than 50 employees. Quality
awards, the review says, have proved an effective stimulus to change. 'The
value of Baldrige, the European Foundation for Quality Management and the
British Quality Foundation awards is that they are sophisticated tools for
self-assessment, rooted in experience,' Sepsu says.
The review also makes recommendations about the people and organisations
behind BS5750.
As a minimum measure, certification bodies should employ only registered
assessors.
The encouragement of mergers between the 34 certification bodies should be
considered by the government. The fact that some certifiers are themselves
not accredited by the National Accreditation Council for Certification
Bodies weakens the whole BS5750 system.
The government should ensure that consultants used to help businesses
prepare for certification meet the most rigorous standards if they are to be
used by companies subsidised by DTI schemes.
The report also questions the wisdom of the DTI's decision to reject a
suggestion that BSI and its certification arm, BSI Quality Assurance, be
split. The DTI has instead already asked BSI to reinforce the ring-fencing
of functions.
At the heart of Sepsu's recommendations is the assertion that truly enduring
quality improvement programmes originate within an organisation and are not
imposed from outside.
It is one view. The 'external' certification industry, worth Pounds 80m a
year to consultants and assessors, according to one estimate, not
unexpectedly has another.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Barclays calls for
business 'Tessas' - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank is calling for the introduction of tax-exempt business savings
accounts to promote long-term investment in the small business sector.
These business 'Tessas' would operate in the same way as their personal
sector equivalent. Businesses could invest retained profits in a special
account which would be tax-deductible over a set period (three to five
years). The funds could then be used for approved purposes such as capital
investment, R&amp;D or training.
Barclays' research shows that 78 per cent of businesses prefer retained
profits as a source of funding rather than bank overdrafts or venture
capital. Some 87 per cent would re-invest more of their profits if the tax
system were altered.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Checklist for staying
solvent - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many insolvencies could be avoided if company directors were aware of
mistakes made by other businesses.
London consultants Ringrose have produced a checklist for directors based on
a review of 250 insolvencies during the recession.
More than a third of these companies could still be trading had they taken
measures included in the checklist early enough, it is claimed.
The list includes questions and skeleton solutions. It asks directors to
plot 12 months' gross profit and fixed costs and see if the lines are
converging; it asks whether directors always draw up cashflow forecasts to
quantify the effects of accepting a large order; it suggests simple
calculations of stock turn and trade receivables: if these fail to pass
muster, it recommends management time be dedicated urgently to stock control
and collection of bills.
Checklist available from 071 383 4142.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Small cheques, big
problems - Exporters owed tiny amounts face steep bank charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago Colefax and Fowler, the up-market UK fabric and wallpaper maker,
was facing a revolt in continental Europe. Export sales were increasing from
its fabric division, but distributors and retailers were up in arms because
of the amounts their banks were charging for the large number of small
cheques Colefax required.
Faced with this, customers tended to wait until they had received a number
of invoices before paying; and in return Colefax and Fowler had begun
threatening legal action. Worse, many customers were paying with foreign
currency cheques written on their local banks which took up to 28 days to
clear in the UK.
The revolt came to a head at last July's annual distributors' meeting.
Without knowing how to achieve it, David Green, Colefax and Fowler's chief
executive, promised a solution by September.
Colefax and Fowler's experience is by no means unique. All UK exporters
making large numbers of relatively low-value sales will have met the
problem. When French or German customers pay Franc or D-Mark cheques the
banks can charge the equivalent of at least Pounds 15.
If, as with Colefax and Fowler, each invoice is only Pounds 96 on average,
these bank charges stack up. Telegraphic transfer is no cheaper and even if
payment is made directly to foreign currency accounts at a UK bank the banks
will still take up to 28 days to clear each cheque.
Colefax and Fowler found a solution that would not be necessary in a genuine
single European market. With help from the Bank Relationship Partnership, a
London-based consultancy that helps cut the cost of banking, Colefax and
Fowler set up local currency bank accounts in each country where it has a
significant customer base.
Customers now pay directly to Colefax and Fowler's local account, for which
the charges are minimal and where payments are quickly cleared. The next
stage is the clever part.
Instead of sending bank statements to the UK, the local bank in Germany
sends them daily to the local office of EDM, a Netherlands-based agency that
handles the collection of huge quantities of small payments for companies
such as National Geographic, Newsweek and New England Journal of Medicine.
EDM then faxes Colefax and Fowler details of what they have received that
day, enabling the company to credit the customers' accounts. When cash
balances reach a reasonable size, the money is transferred to the UK.
The saving is not only at the customer's end. Colefax and Fowler says that
on export sales of Pounds 4m a year, it has saved about Pounds 45,000 on
lost interest while its foreign cheques were clearing.
The company says this may indirectly have increased sales; some customers
were being denied credit not because they had not paid old invoices but
because their cheques had not cleared.
Because the customers were no longer hoarding invoices before paying, export
creditor days have fallen from 86 to 73 days. And as some customers were
also deducting their bank's charges from the invoice amounts, Colefax and
Fowler also saved bank charges.
'It has enhanced our customer service immensely,' says Denise Walker, chief
financial accountant at Colefax and Fowler. 'They can buy more and it is
very satisfactory from an administrative point of view.'
Walker says the company's own bank, Midland, were 'either apathetic or just
didn't have the service'. Midland said it could set up foreign accounts or a
lockbox - a variant of the system put in place for Colefax and Fowler. 'But
that was the last we heard of it. They were not interested at all.'
Green missed his September target by a month as opening bank accounts in
some countries proved to be easier said than done. But the company says many
more exporters are likely to use this kind of service.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Technology: A cross-border people project - Staff at Hoechst
were thoroughly involved in the introduction of a new system / Software at
Work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gerhard Storch, financial director of Hoechst UK, is well-versed in
promoting the idea of a global accounting system. He has a prepared
presentation, complete with slides. The project has an inspirational name,
Apollo, with its own sunrise logo. Stories about it appear regularly in the
Hoechst newsletter.
Storch is clear about the objectives for Hoechst's system. 'First, it is not
an accounting project. We are looking to improve customer service. Nor is it
a Gerhard Storch project - it involves everyone in the Hoechst group in
Europe. The system we are looking for is likely to improve the service to
our European subsidiaries in the area of information delivery.'
Global systems, especially global accounting systems, are cost effective,
enforce standards and bring together different information sources. The
German-based Hoechst group is far from alone in its desire to implement such
systems across national borders, but few companies can have looked into the
idea so thoroughly, and done so much to prepare the ground - and the people.
With annual sales of DM46bn (Pounds 18.4bn), Hoechst ranks among the world's
chemical industry leaders. Founded 125 years ago, it was the originator of
the vivid dyes that brightened clothes fabrics in the late 19th century.
Now, it has interests in chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fibres, polymers and
paints. Its operations in 120 countries include research laboratories in 15
of them, and it employs 170,000 people worldwide.
'We have a target that our European business should operate in a seamless
way in its information flow,' says Storch, 'whether it comes from marketing
information or in the process of receiving orders, planning, processing and,
ultimately, delivering to the customer. People need accurate, up-to-date
information to know that they can deliver to the customer on time.'
There are problems to surmount in introducing such compatibility: agreement
on aims and universal requirements in-house; choice of software; the weaning
of people from their trusted software packages; and, finally, the
development of new approaches.
Choice of software was relatively straightforward. Many suppliers claim to
offer software that is global, multi-currency, flexible and capable of being
customised to the degree Hoechst needed. But Hoechst found few real
contenders, especially as it had not yet moved to open systems and was still
planning to use its mainframe computers. However, one German division was an
enthusiastic user of the German-originated SAP accounting software.
The group was thus convinced that this modular package offered the most
flexible and full-function solution available. It chose SAP's R/2 software
for international use on its IBM 3090 and 9021 mainframes. (SAP now offers a
Unix-based package, R/3, which arrived too late for Hoechst.)
There were a few deficiencies, made good by developments in SAP's own
software language. For example, Hoechst needed a credit management module
and undertook a joint development with SAP in the UK to replace a Pounds
500,000 in-house software project. In spite of lower functionality, this
write-off was a sacrifice worth making for the integration with other SAP
modules. Altogether, the investment from the UK, which piloted the
development, was roughly Pounds 3m; with seven other European countries
involved - France, Austria, Spain, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and
Germany (co-ordinator) - the total cost was thus around Pounds 21m.
A Hoechst man for 33 years, Storch did not underestimate the difficulty of
weaning users from their existing systems, some of which had been
international. These included a bespoke sales order processing system used
in the UK, France, Italy, Spain and South Africa, and the mainframe
accounting software that MSA (now Dun and Bradstreet) implemented in the UK,
Spain, and South Africa 10 years earlier.
Storch was keen to transfer his company-wide vision to the people who would
use the software. He set up committees in each of the countries contributing
to the development. 'We felt that a public relations effort was the only way
to get it off the ground by a corporate agreement, not a central directive.
It was essential that it be led by national companies. A global strategy for
information systems has to rely on co-operation and communications, not
imposing or prescribing.'
Each team had subcommittees, chaired by the division director. Some
countries provided specialist expertise: Spain and Italy on re-valuation of
assets, for example, and Belgium on VAT rules. Meeting every six weeks or
so, the committees wrestled with the details of what turned out to be a rich
but complex solution. Some extra modules - cost accounting, and a transport
system for dangerous goods - were a part of the UK pilot.
'It's very complex. It requires a great amount of know-how in development
and in presentation. Also, it is complex for users, and needs a lot of
training. People have to learn as they go along, but we have also had to
cope with differences in language and culture,' says Storch.
IT organisation manager John Haywood was part of the change management
committee. 'We have had to train 400 users in the UK, some of whom have
never seen a terminal,' he says. 'We implemented the scheme through a series
of workshops, mixing IT people and end users, so that they learned on the
hoof about business processes.'
Even so, there were logistical problems - some to do with warehousing
control and computerisation and others with employees' inexperience.
The live switch was thrown on the entire system, including three new
modules, on the May bank holiday weekend this year. Some 409 users are
spread across the UK headquarters west of London in the accounting,
chemicals and pharmaceuticals divisions.
'After a couple of weeks live with 409 UK users there were comparatively few
problems. But we are in the hands of one central software developer -
through seven national suppliers in the countries, with the master
development in Germany,' says Haywood.
SAP, inevitably, has its own agenda. Product updates and releases cause
problems to companies such as Hoechst, even though such maintenance is done
centrally. SAP's new R/3 software is still going through implementation in
its first live sites.
Other companies agree on the extremely rich functions available with SAP,
even though, according to Storch, 'only 25 per cent of the functionality is
exploited by any one company'.
Mike Demetriou, group chief accountant, has been using SAP software since
the first implementation of bought sales and general ledgers two years ago.
The newly implemented modules for production costing and sales, RKK and RKE,
bring a fresh dimension to his job. They integrate all the information
entered in sales and production to produce a detailed analysis at any level.
This means he can take a detailed view, by date, customer, invoice and
product, of any data. 'I log on daily looking at, for instance, total
company performance at the end of the month. If I see a result I don't like,
I can go into the hierarchy and look at major divisions, starting to select
the route - for example, pharmaceuticals.
'You don't need anyone else to make an inquiry for you - you can do it all
yourself, working right down into the detail. If a senior manager doesn't
like what he sees in the pharmaceutical budgets, for example, one keystroke
will show all the costs that contributed: salaries, travelling, right down
to specific transactions - someone's foreign trip. He doesn't have to call
in anyone else, so long as he's trained.'
Business managers now have a broader knowledge of accounting, and
accountants have a broader view of the business. Hoechst's main investment,
as Storch constantly emphasises, is not in the system but the people.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Technology: Evening primrose in cancer fight - James Buxton
on promising trials with a dietary supplement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A pharmaceutical plant in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland is being expanded
to produce commercial quantities of new drugs, one of which is already
extending - in clinical trials - the lives of sufferers from a particularly
deadly cancer affecting the pancreas.
The location of the plant, at Callanish on the island of Lewis, is unusual;
so is the fact that it makes its products not from synthetic substances but
by extracting the active ingredient of the evening primrose plant.
The expansion of Callanish, costing Pounds 4.5m, is the latest step in a
long process of discovery and development led by David Horrobin, a scientist
and entrepreneur whose company Scotia Pharmaceuticals last year raised
Pounds 37m in its London stock exchange flotation.
Horrobin has been exploring the contribution to human health made by
essential fatty acids, an area of medicine on which the big pharmaceutical
companies have not focused heavily. He has found that sufferers from a wide
range of illnesses often have a deficiency of EFAs.
Scotia makes products aimed at making up this deficiency. Since 1979, it has
sold evening primrose oil as a dietary supplement under the name Efamol and
used the proceeds to finance the development of pharmaceuticals based on
EFAs. It has four licensed drugs, to treat breast pain and skin diseases.
It is also at different stages of developing drugs to treat a range of
diseases, from cancer and diabetes to rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's
disease and schizophrenia. Horrobin has found that a common thread in
sufferers of all these diseases is a deficiency in EFAs.
Scotia's basic research is carried out in Nova Scotia with further work done
in Carlisle and Dundee. In 1986, it acquired for Pounds 300,000 a plant at
Callanish.
Since then, Callanish has perfected a process for extracting from evening
primrose oil its most important element - the EFA named gamma linolenic
acid.
The evening primrose itself is not grown commercially on the windswept
islands; the oil comes from a Scotia plant at Lincoln which processes seeds
grown by farmers in different parts of the world.
The remoteness of the Western Isles is not a problem, says Chris Corden, the
plant's manager. 'We use relatively small volumes of evening primrose oil,
and we benefit from the very high calibre of scientists and skilled
personnel on Lewis.'
The expansion at Callanish is intended to step up production of two
products, DLMG for diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage caused by diabetes) and
EF13 for cancer.
Horrobin is quietly excited about EF13. 'Most cancer drug treatments are
unsuccessful, prolonging survival time by only 10 to 15 per cent,' he says.
'Chemotherapy might increase a patient's life expectancy from five years to
5.5 years. And these treatments are highly toxic, causing nausea and
vomiting.' By contrast, he says, clinical trials of EF13 (phase II trials)
have shown encouraging results.
'Pancreatic cancer is the most devastating of all cancers,' Horrobin says.
Ninety per cent of cases are inoperable on diagnosis and life expectancy is
only three months. But patients given EF13 have found their survival time
increased four to sixfold, in other words from three to up to 18 months.
Horrobin says that the patients treated improve more the bigger the dose
they receive, while side effects are nil. The product is now moving on to a
randomised phase III trial which by the end of 1995 will involve about 30
hospitals in Europe and more than 400 patients. The next stage is to qualify
for a license.
Laboratory trials show that about 30 human cancer strains are killed by EF13
without harming normal cells, and beneficial effects are reported from phase
I and phase II trials on patients with breast, colo-rectal, brain, liver and
melanoma cancers. And a team at St Bartholomew's hospital in London has
found that EF13 selectively kills white blood cells infected with HIV, the
Aids virus.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Fears on quality of some coffee
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Agriculture is preparing to investigate sales of instant
coffee after government scientists found that 15 per cent of instant coffee
samples tested contained material other than ground coffee beans.
The adulterated coffee probably included coffee plant husks, skins, stems or
stalks added before roasting the beans, the ministry said.
It said it would probably launch a fuller investigation.
The brands could not be named, because the number of jars examined was too
small to be representative of any one product, it added, noting there was no
danger to health.
Mr Stephen Locke, policy director at the Consumers' Association, said the
survey 'suggests consumers are being bamboozled and conned. It's a matter of
misleading trading practices.'

FT  21 JUN 94 / CBI says London should be better run
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weaknesses in the way London is governed are damaging its reputation as a
centre of world business, the Confederation of British Industry said
yesterday, John Willman writes.
In a a business plan for the capital, it says London lacks a 'board and
management' that could create a vision for the future and implement the
decisions necessary to sustain London's role as a world city.
There are 'fundamental weaknesses', the CBI says, in 'the complicated and
unco-ordinated way policy is determined, services are delivered and
taxpayers' money is spent'.
The CBI report has been submitted as the business contribution to the London
Pride prospectus, being drawn up at the government's request by London
First, the business-led organisation to promote the capital.
It says that London's aim should be to become the most successful city in
Europe for business by the year 2020.
The report includes 120 steps needed to achieve this vision, including the
CrossRail line, a high-speed Channel tunnel rail link, more bridges over the
Thames and improvements in public transport.
London already contributes a Pounds 10bn surplus to the UK's balance of
trade, said Mr Ian Reeves, the CBI's London regional chairman. 'But instead
of receiving the investment it needs, it is being stripped of its assets,'
he added.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Nuclear Electric urges commercial freedom: Obstacles to
sell-off 'largely overcome' - Concern over Magnox costs / Estimates attacked
as optimistic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Privatisation of Nuclear Electric would complete the government's programme
for electricity privatisation started five years ago, the company said in
its submission yesterday to the government's nuclear review.
The company, which operates the nuclear power stations of England and Wales,
called for commercial freedom to compete with National Power and PowerGen.
'The original obstacles to privatisation have been largely overcome,' it
says.
'The company has been transformed since its formation in 1990, increasing
output by almost 45 per cent and doubling productivity by March this year.
Market share has risen from 16.7 per cent in 1989-90 to more than 23 per
cent last year.
'The company's five advanced gas-cooled reactor (AGR) stations are among the
best-performing in the world. This achievement, coupled with the successful
completion of Sizewell B within the committed programme and below budget,
provides assurance that Nuclear Electric has a sound commercial base on
which to operate profitably and competitively in the market.
'The AGR stations and Sizewell B (the pressurised-water reactor station)
will be profitable without government subsidy. Risks over liabilities and
uncertainties over income of these stations have been greatly reduced to the
point where the majority of risks for the AGR and PWR stations can now be
considered transferable to the private sector.
'The expected lifetimes of the (six) Magnox stations have been exhaustively
reviewed. Nuclear Electric is confident that they may continue to operate
economically into the next century. However, the risks associated with their
back-end costs, resulting from decisions taken decades ago, would not be
acceptable to the private sector.
'To achieve a successful privatisation, the risks and liabilities to which
investors are exposed must be appropriately allocated. One approach would
involve Nuclear Electric divesting its operations to a new subsidiary, whose
shares would be sold to private investors and which would then take forward
the electricity generating of Nuclear Electric. The unprivatisable risks and
liabilities would be retained by government.
'The new privatised company would own and operate the AGR and PWR stations,
taking responsibility for related nuclear and other liabilities amounting to
some Pounds 6bn. (It would not own the Magnox stations which would remain in
state hands, but it might operate them.) Government would take a last-loss
position on risks and would be paid premiums for doing so by other parties
to the agreement.
'This option would transfer to the private sector the majority of the
commercial risk in nuclear electricity generation; create opportunities to
introduce competition to the management of long-term nuclear liabilities;
give the private sector financial responsibilities for the company's
investment decisions; and create substantial income for the government from
the sale of shares.
'Privatisation could be completed within 18 months, without the need for new
primary legislation.'
Environmental and
strategic benefits: 'The electricity market is not structured to respond to
environmental and strategic needs. Nor does it take full account of the
environmental effects of different forms of generation. The polluter does
not pay.
'Adjusting the market framework to deliver the government's energy and
environmental policy objectives would involve creating incentives to
generators to invest in non-pollution technologies.
'Nuclear generation is alone among major technologies in accounting for and
dealing with the effects of the entire fuel cycle. This is because it
internalises the costs involved in waste management and decommissioning. The
fact that the equivalent environmental costs of fossil-fuelled generation
are ignored produces an imbalance in their relative costs and lead to market
distortion.
'Nuclear Electric's current operations save the emission of more than 60m
tonnes of carbon dioxide and 840,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide annually
compared with a conventional coal plant. Of the options open to government
to reduce gaseous emissions, nuclear energy is the most effective. It is
controllable, certain in its effect, sustainable and can be achieved in a
relatively short time without requiring a change in public lifestyles.
'Nuclear power also offers national benefits to the balance of payments, to
employment and the export of technology. The industry employs 40,000 people
directly. Building Sizewell C would provide 20,000 jobs during peak
construction.
'A successful bid for a Taiwanese power station by the Westinghouse
consortium, of which Nuclear Electric is a part, would create 5,000 jobs in
British engineering over five years.' New plant construction: 'Nuclear power
is more capital-intensive than combined cycle gas turbine stations which are
being developed rapidly, but fuel costs are much lower. The cost of nuclear
generation is therefore far less sensitive to fuel price movements, which
many experts expect to rise significantly in real terms over the next few
decades.
'In order to exploit fully the substantial national investment in Sizewell
B, it is important to proceed with construction of a further plant as soon
as possible. Nuclear Electric's investment appraisal of Sizewell C and
Hinkley Point C (a Sizewell B replica for which the company has already
gained planning consent) has indicated that on current expectations about
gas prices, the projected annual return to investors would lie in the range
of 5 per cent to 9 per cent.
'Price Waterhouse, advising the company, do not consider that sufficient
private capital could be attracted unless the internal rate of return of a
project exceeded 11 per cent in real terms.
'Government action is required to bridge the gap between the expected
returns and market requirements.
'To ensure that the majority of risk is transferred to the private sector, a
substantial private-sector consortium would have to be created to take
responsibility for construction. Government support would be needed in three
areas: security for lenders during construction; long-term electricity
purchase contracts; and share of regulatory risks. Financing would be easier
if the project sponsors included a privatised nuclear generating company.
'Income security could be provided by means of a new non fossil-fuel
obligation order (which would oblige regional electricity companies to take
a certain amount of nuclear power). This may require primary legislation.'
Mr John Collier, Nuclear Electric chairman, said the review was about
whether the UK wanted nuclear power to wither away, or whether it wanted to
recognise its role in providing market competition, long-term electricity
supplies and environmental balance.
Mr Bob Hawley, chief executive, said that unless the government took action,
Sizewell B could be the only nuclear power station operating in the UK in 30
years.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Future of Sizewell C rests on 3.7p claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK nuclear review will help determine whether Britain will invest
billions of pounds more in the industry. But the debate will swing on an
argument over only 3.7 pence.
That, says Nuclear Electric, the England and Wales power generator, is about
what it would cost to produce a kilowatt hour, or one unit, of electricity
from the twin reactor power station it wants to build with private-sector
funds at Sizewell on the Suffolk coast.
The company's problem is persuading investors and the government that 3.7p
is achievable. Sizewell C opponents say it is wildly optimistic.
The construction of the 2,600 MW Sizewell C is one of the central issues of
the review.
The nuclear industry hopes a new station, probably Sizewell but possibly
Hinkley Point C in Somerset, would be the first of a series of plants to be
built in the next century. Either would be based on the design of the
Sizewell B station, which Nuclear Electric expects to start operating later
this year.
There is virtually no chance of Nuclear Electric's being able to build new
stations while it remains in the public sector, which is one of the reasons
it wants to be privatised.
It may just be able to build another plant if it can convince the private
sector to contribute towards building Sizewell C. That in turn will depend
on its ability to persuade potential investors that the figure suggested is
achievable.
In its submission the company gives a range of possible figures for likely
unit costs at Sizewell C, but Mr Mike Kirwan, the finance director, said
yesterday that 3.7p was the most likely outcome given the company's
assumptions on the capital costs (Pounds 3.5bn), plant operating efficiency
(85 per cent) and an 11 per cent return on capital demanded by the private
sector.
Even the 3.7p might present potential investors with problems. Only a few
months ago the company was talking about 2.9p. Nuclear Electric said the
change was not a climbdown. The lower figure would apply if the plant were
to be built in the public sector, where an 8 per cent return on capital was
considered the norm.
Another difficulty is that the 3.7p figure is more than 50 per cent above
the 2.4p price of electricity this year in the wholesale electricity trading
pool for England and Wales.
Nuclear Electric says market prices will rise by the time the new station is
built. But it does not dispute that a gap is likely to remain and it is
partly for this reason that 'government commitment and support' will be
needed.
Details of that support have still to be formulated, although Nuclear
Electric stressed yesterday that it may not lead to actual expenditure but
could involve government guarantees or setting aside a proportion of the
market for nuclear power.
Ministers' willingness to make such commitments will depend on their
judgment of Sizewell C's unit costs.
According to the Consortium of Opposing Local Authorities, a pressure group
against nuclear power, an approach likely to be taken by the private sector
investor would result in an estimate of 5.8p. This could rise to 7.4p if the
investor is assumed to be risk averse.
Part of the explanation for the gulf between Nuclear Electric's figure and
those of others is that the history of nuclear power is littered with
examples of cost over-runs.
Nuclear Electric says it has revised only once the Pounds 2bn cost (in 1987
money) of building Sizewell B and that was because the government decided
against building other plants in the series and so economies of scale were
lost.
However, the Central Electricity Generating Board, from which Nuclear
Electric was spawned in 1990, revised Sizewell B costs several times, never
downwards. Doubts about Nuclear Electric's Pounds 3.5bn estimate are raised
because the figure is only about Pounds 700m above the present-day money
cost of building Sizewell B, which is less than half its proposed size.
Similarly, nuclear industry opponents are sceptical of its assertion that
Sizewell C can operate at 85 per cent of its potential capacity.
But perhaps the biggest doubts centre on Nuclear Electric's belief that 11
per cent will be considered an adequate return on capital by the private
sector.
PowerGen, Nuclear Electric's fossil-fired generation company in the private
sector, says it uses a rate of return of at least 10 per cent on its
gas-fired plants. The risk on gas-fired plants is considerably less than
with nuclear because they are cheaper and quicker to build.
Mr Kirwan said yesterday that the government's involvement could lower the
risk for nuclear power. Nonetheless the onus is on Nuclear Electric and Mr
Kirwan to persuade the government to participate. Even then they may
struggle to persuade the private sector to follow the state's lead.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Smokers' damages cases begin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Smokers who believe they have been seriously injured as a result of the
negligence of tobacco companies have been 'unlawfully and irrationally'
denied legal aid to pursue their claims, the High Court was told yesterday.
Mr Michael Beloff QC was launching 28 test case actions relating to a total
of 227 claims.
He said the group action, potentially worth more than Pounds 20m, could not
go ahead without legal aid because the alleged victims - mostly from
Liverpool but also from London and the south-east - lacked funds to fight a
legal battle for compensation.
Gallaher, Rothmans, Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and British-American
Tobacco are accused of negligence in failing to take steps to minimise the
dangers of smoking, carrying out or publicising research into the risks, or
giving adequate warnings of those risks.
Mr Beloff said 110,000 people in the UK died prematurely each year as a
result of smoking and hundreds of thousands more were damaged. Leading
lawyers had estimated individual potential claims ranged between Pounds
50,000 and Pounds 250,000.
Many of his clients were seriously ill and three had died since the first
application for legal aid had been made.
The Northern Area Legal Aid Committee had 'killed' claimants' hopes of
obtaining redress.
It decided last year that the tobacco companies were prima facie in breach
of the duty to take reasonable steps to minimise the risk of harm and give
reasonable warnings.
But committee members were not persuaded that any single individual in the
group action, who suffer from a range of smoking-related diseases, could
establish that he or she fell ill as a result of that breach of duty.
The committee also decided that the cost of taking on the tobacco companies
'was not worth the candle'.
Mr Beloff described both decisions as 'curious and unreasonable' and asked
Mr Justice Popplewell to quash them and to order a fresh hearing before a
different committee.
The hearing continues today.

Finance companies which mislead the public by taking the name of an
unrelated dealer or manufacturer could lose their consumer credit licences,
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, warned yesterday.
He has asked trade associations for their views on proposals that companies
whose name or trading style misled customers should have their licences
suspended, revoked or varied.
He also proposes not to issue new licences to such companies or to vary
existing licences to add names which could be misleading.
Sir Bryan said the recent probe into photocopier selling practices and the
office equipment leasing industry had revealed widespread use of misleading
names by the subsidiaries of finance companies.
'These subsidiaries effectively take over the reputation of the trading
company for which they are named,' he said.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Post Office makes record profit: Royal Mail contribution of
Pounds 296m to total Pounds 306m exceeds government target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Post Office yesterday reported record pre-tax profits for the year to
March 31, but claimed its future was nonetheless in serious jeopardy because
of the government's failure to reach a decision on privatisation.
At Pounds 306m, pre-tax profits were 8 per cent up on the 1992-93 figure of
Pounds 283m.
The Post Office's core Royal Mail delivery business contributed Pounds 296m
 -far ahead of its government target of Pounds 225m.
However, Mr Michael Heron, Post Office chairman, said the 'prolonged waiting
game' over privatisation was causing 'planning blight which leaves us
totally in limbo'.
Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive, highlighted investment shortfalls and a
'worrying' dip in pillar-box mail as further evidence of the need for a
sell-off.
Although mail volumes reached a peak of 64m items delivered daily, a 2.6 per
cent rise on the previous year, the increase was caused by a surge in
pre-sorted bulk mail. The volume of posted and franked mail fell by 1 per
cent, its first decline for more than a decade.
Although it retains a monopoly over the delivery of addressed mail priced at
less than Pounds 1, the Post Office claims it faces strong competition in
the distribution of pre-sorted bulk mail, particularly within large cities.
Mr Cockburn warned: 'Some of our major customers are being targeted by
foreign post offices.'
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is expected to publish a
green paper setting out privatisation options early next month.
Post Office Counters, which comprises high-street post offices run by the
Post Office and the village sub-post offices run on a franchise arrangement,
made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 25m, ahead of its government target of
Pounds 15m.
However Parcelforce, the parcel-delivery service, made a loss of Pounds 19m,
Pounds 6m more than the previous year. Mr Cockburn said that at least Pounds
10m of business had gone to competitors, and blamed a shortfall in
investment.
More than 91 per cent of first-class letters were delivered the day after
posting, slightly below the Post Office's target of 92 per cent but far
ahead of its 74.5 per cent record four years ago.
Mr Heron said no stamp price increases were planned.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Scots investment at 13-year peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scotland had an outstandingly successful year in securing inward-investment
projects during 1993-94, Locate in Scotland, the inward-investment bureau,
said yesterday.
Its annual report, published yesterday, showed that 95 inward-investment
projects were committed to Scotland, the highest number since 1981. Total
investment of Pounds 587m was planned, which would create 7,688 jobs and
safeguard a further 3,384 jobs.
This compares with investment of Pounds 352m secured in 1992-93, which
involved 65 projects and created or safeguarded more than 8,000 jobs.
Mr Allan Stewart, Scottish Office industry minister, warmly welcomed the
figures, but the Scottish Office said: 'Not all projects proceed exactly as
planned. On average around two-thirds of planned direct jobs are achieved.'
Last year's performance will help rebut sceptics who have argued that
Scotland is declining as a magnet for inward investment in face of
competition from the Irish republic, Spain and eastern Europe.
Some 62 per cent of the total planned investment for 1993-94 comes from the
US, and of that, 85 per cent was reinvestment in existing plants, such as a
Pounds 7m expansion by the computer manufacturer Compaq, creating a further
250 jobs.
Some 22 per cent of new investment came from continental Europe and
Scandinavia, 11 per cent from the rest of the UK and 4 per cent from Japan
and Asia.
Almost half of all new investment was in the electronics sector, followed by
chemicals and engineering.

Finance companies which mislead the public by taking the name of an
unrelated dealer or manufacturer could lose their consumer credit licences,
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, warned yesterday.
Sir Bryan has written to trade associations asking for their views on
proposals that companies whose name or trading style misled customers should
have their licences suspended, revoked or varied.
He also proposes not to issue new licences to such companies or to vary
existing licences to add names which could be misleading.
Sir Bryan said the recent investigation into photocopier selling practices
and the office equipment leasing industry had revealed widespread use of
misleading names by the subsidiaries of finance companies.
'These subsidiaries effectively take over the reputation of the trading
company for which they are named rather than that of their finance industry
parent,' he said.
'The result is that a customer, believing he has a contract with the finance
subsidiary of a supplier, then finds that it is actually with an unrelated
finance company.'
Customers had a right not to be misled in this way and to know who would
take responsibility if there was a problem with the service or product.
The practice of leasing companies using similar names to those of dealers
was condemned by the Court of Appeal in March.
Sir Bryan added that unless he heard a convincing reason why finance company
subsidiaries should be 'dressed up in the colours' of unrelated dealers or
manufacturers he would use his licensing powers to put a stop to the
practice.

FT  21 JUN 94 / BT ban poses monopoly risk, says Carsberg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, raised fears yesterday
about the impact of a lengthy continuation of the ban on British
Telecommunications carrying entertainment services.
Sir Bryan told a Financial Times conference in London that the ban 'may
create local (telecommunications) monopolies in the shape of cable
television companies'.
'If continued for too long, it may deny BT the opportunity to make its
competitive contribution,' he added. The tone of his remarks was in sharp
contrast with those of ministers and Mr Don Cruickshank, his successor as
head of Oftel, the telecommunications regulator.
The government's ban on BT extends until at least 2001, although Oftel is
empowered to report on the desirability of lifting it from 1998. When
imposed in 1991 its aim was to encourage cable companies - mostly US-owned -
to invest in local cable networks, providing telecommunications services in
competition with BT.
BT claims the ban is constraining it from investing in the UK, since it
would need revenue from interactive entertainment services to justify
upgrading its local network.
Pointing to the cable operators' success in attracting more than 400,000
telecoms customers within two years of launch, Sir Bryan said the ban looked
set to be 'quite successful'. However, he pointedly looked forward to ending
the ban to ensure effective competition. 'In this matter, timing is
everything,' he said.
Mr Cruickshank last month played down the prospect of even a review of the
BT ban before 2001, and expressed little sympathy with BT arguments that
local cable monopolies would result from delay.
Mr Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has taken a similar position.
Earlier this month he rejected a Labour party proposal to lift the ban in
return for BT agreeing to make the investment - estimated at about Pounds
15bn - necessary to extend fibre-optic cables into its local network.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Ministers back move to revive CrossRail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers are giving discreet support to an initiative by a Tory MP to
revive the CrossRail project, in the belief that it now represents the best
chance of the east-west underground rail link in London.
As concern grows at Westminster over the future of CrossRail, the government
is backing an initiative by Mr David Lidington, the Tory MP for Aylesbury,
who is hoping to table a Commons motion this week calling for a
parliamentary committee to re-examine the project.
Legislation to build the rail-link, which has the backing of British Rail
and London Underground, suffered a surprise rejection last month when a
four-strong committee of MPs on the private bill committee turned it down.
However, ministers believe that Mr Lidington, who is drawing up a petition
to back his case, may persuade the Speaker to consider a motion calling for
the bill to be sent back to the committee for reconsideration. It is
understood that more than 100 MPs have endorsed the petition.
At the same time, Mr John MacGregor, transport minister, has rejected a
proposal that he and his Labour counterpart, Mr Frank Dobson, should make a
joint plea to the deputy speaker that the bill should be sent back to the
committee.
He is also understood to have rejected alternative ways of resurrecting
CrossRail, including a new bill or summoning an independent inspector to
examine the project.
By quietly backing Mr Lidington, the government is determined to avoid a
clash with the bill committee.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Insolvency firms attack 'aggressive' watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading insolvency practitioners have been putting pressure on their
regulatory body to dilute the tough approach planned for inspections of
their firms.
Board members of the Joint Insolvency Monitoring Unit, the self-regulating
body which begins full operation next Monday, debated possible changes to
its approach at a meeting earlier this month.
They discussed concerns over the tone and nature of the information sought
by the unit's inspectors, which they believed to be excessively aggressive.
Their demands included requirements in 'pre-visit questionnaires' issued to
firms before inspection that they list any failures to comply with
regulations - which some firms believed could be self-incriminatory and
could breach concerns over confidentiality.
Mr Malcolm London, president of the Insolvency Practitioners' Association
and a partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said yesterday: 'This was not the sort
of monitoring we were anticipating.'
'We are more concerned with assisting our members to get themselves properly
organised to comply with the rules,' he said. 'Our main concern is not to
discipline them.'
Ms Kay Linnell, chief executive of the unit, said: 'We are not modifying
anything. There is no point in us going in firms with a blindfold on.
'This is an overreaction by quite senior people in the profession. We are
human beings and will use a light touch. Practitioners have got to realise
they are getting a free independent peer review.'
She said firms' internal control systems ought to be able to pick up
compliance breaches. She added that a number of larger firms had 'so many
layers of management' that they were unable to provide comprehensive
information even on their current workload.
She said she had prevented the firms trying to influence which consultants
temporarily hired from their competitors would be allowed to conduct
inspections.
Mr London said of Ms Linnell: 'She is quite single-minded and strong-minded
and not easily persuaded to change her mind.'
The Joint Insolvency Monitoring Unit was set up under pressure from the
Insolvency Service at the Department of Trade and Industry, because the
Insolvency Service did not believe there was adequate supervision of members
of the insolvency prof-ession.
It submits reports to the licensing bodies of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales, its counterpart in Scotland and the
Insolvency Practitioners Association. It is these bodies that determine any
disciplinary action of the practitioners they represent.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Employers short of school leavers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decline in recruitment of 16-year-old school leavers has been halted,
but employers are facing growing difficulties in finding appropriate youths
because so many are staying on at school, says an Industrial Relations
Services survey.
The survey of 167 organisations found that one in six employers recruiting
16-year-olds was experiencing difficulty. 'Even at this stage of the
economic recovery, a significant proportion of recruiters is finding it
difficult to find suitable school leavers,' say the authors.
Almost 70 per cent of 16-year-olds now stay on in full-time education and
employers say that they face a shrinking pool of potential recruits who will
be progressively less well-qualified.
Employers are beginning to return to the school-leaver market but the
increase in activity is small. According to the survey, 45 per cent of
respondents said they would be recruiting, compared with 38 per cent in the
1993 survey.
On average, school leavers will be offered starting salaries of Pounds 6,381
a year. Jobs with training provided tend to be less well paid.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Upturn 'far short of rip-roaring boom'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank and building society lending bounced back in May from April's low
levels, according to Bank of England figures yesterday.
But taken with subdued growth of broad money, the latest seasonally adjusted
lending data continued to point to a steady and unspectacular economic
recovery.
Ms Ruth Lea, chief UK economist of Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank,
said the May money and lending figures were 'a salutary reminder that the UK
is not experiencing a rip-roaring boom'.
The Bank's figures, the first to incorporate a new monthly system of
seasonal adjustment, showed bank and building society lending to the private
sector rose by a provisional adjusted Pounds 1.5bn in May.
This was below the City's consensus expectation of Pounds 1.9bn growth in
such so-called 'M4 lending' but higher than April's Pounds 735m increase,
which was revised upwards because of the new method of seasonal adjustment
from an earlier announced Pounds 470m.
Figures from the British Bankers' Association also pointed to unspectacular
lending growth. Its seasonally adjusted data, which is broadly consistent
with Bank figures, showed the nine leading UK banks increased lending by
Pounds 928m in May. This more than reversed a fall of Pounds 501m in April
but was still below the average rise of Pounds 1.08bn in the previous six
months.
Lord Inchyra, the association's director-general, said: 'Demand for bank
lending from the corporate sector remains elusive.' Consumer credit from the
banks remained weak but their mortgage lending increased by Pounds 610m last
month, a rise of 9 per cent on April.
Meanwhile, the Bank reported that M4, its broad measure of money supply that
includes bank and building society deposits and cash in circulation,
increased by a seasonally adjusted 5.3 per cent in the year to May, down
from revised year-on-year growth of 5.5 per cent in April. The May figure
was below City expectations of a 5.8 per cent rise and well within the lower
half of the government's 'monitoring range' of 3 per cent to 9 per cent
annual growth for M4.
The new system of seasonal adjustment also prompted the Bank to revise down
its earlier estimates for growth of M0, comprising mainly notes and coins in
circulation, to 6.9 per cent in the year to end-May against 7.1 per cent
previously.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Bectu calls off strike threat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bectu, the main technical union at the BBC, yesterday called off the threat
of immediate further industrial action and decided to enter up to eight
weeks of detailed talks with the management.
The union warned that if the talks did not bring results it would re-ballot
its members with the intention of taking further industrial action in the
autumn.
Yesterday's decision finally removes the threat to coverage of major summer
sporting events such as Wimbledon, which began yesterday.
The National Union of Journalists decided on Friday to enter the new
negotiation process hammered out last week at Acas, the conciliation
service.
The decision made it likely Bectu would move in a similar direction.
The BBC wants to meet the unions at Acas in late August 'to confirm the
detail of the whole package on which the trade unions could respond'.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Strike ballot at National Grid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions representing 4,500 workers at National Grid, which runs the
electricity transmission system, have rejected a 'final' pay offer and will
hold a ballot on industrial action, David Goodhart writes.
The company offered a general pay rise of 2.6 per cent - the rate of
inflation - as well as lump sums varying from Pounds 200 to Pounds 700. Last
year National Grid gave a rise of 3.9 per cent, well above the inflation
rate, but that included a move towards single-table bargaining and a new pay
system.
Mr Danny Carrigan, national officer of the AEEU craft union, said: 'This
offer is unacceptable in view of the huge increases in productivity and
profitability since privatisation. The company has also recently announced a
15 per cent increase in dividends and a rise in pre-tax profits of Pounds
150m.'
The other unions involved include the EMA management union, the GMB and TGWU
general unions, and Unison, the public-services union.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Accountants urged to watch liability limits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accountancy firms are being encouraged to limit their liability when
producing new-style 'compilation' reports on the accounts of smaller
companies, under draft guidelines issued by the Auditing Practices Board
yesterday.
Proposed guidelines were issued by the board to flesh out regulations issued
by the Department of Trade and Industry which are designed to lessen the
burden of the annual statutory audit for smaller companies.
Yesterday's document says: 'The reporting accountant may wish to agree with
the directors a limit on any liability arising out of the work.'
One effect may be to restrict the level of scrutiny by accountants in
producing the compilation reports, in the knowledge that any settlement
following legal action will be limited.
The recommendation comes at a time when the larger accountancy firms, backed
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, are lobbying
for a limit on their liability when conducting audits.
A number of firms are already restricting their exposure in the event of
litigation arising from consulting, tax or other work conducted for clients,
but they are currently expressly forbidden by section 310 of the 1985
companies act from limiting liability on audits.
Mr Michael Foulds, a partner with accountants Foulds &amp; Grant and chairman of
the working party which produced the guidelines, said: 'This is not an
audit. It is the furthest thing removed from an audit. Firms are entirely
free to negotiate limits on non-audit services.
Earlier this month the institute warned that reporting accountants examining
companies' figures under the new smaller company audit rules might need to
carry out additional work because of ambiguities in the requirements for the
compilation report and the fact that its application had not been tested in
the courts.
However, Mr Foulds said the compilation report should require less work than
auditors are currently required to carry out on full audits.
Under the government's relaxations - due to come into force in August -
companies with a turnover of Pounds 90,000 to Pounds 350,000 will be
required to have a compilation report in place of a full statutory annual
audit.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Lawson sceptical of solution to boom-bust
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pledges by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the Bank
of England governor, to avoid a repeat of the boom-bust scenarios of the
past are 'somewhat premature', Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, said
yesterday.
'As experience throughout the world makes clear, abolition of the economic
cycle is simply not within the power of any government to deliver,' Lord
Lawson said in a lecture organised by the Social Market Foundation and the
London School of Economics.
Instead of focusing on the short-term vagaries of the business cycle, about
which policy-makers could do very little, they should concentrate on
boosting long-term performance by improving the supply side of the economy,
said Lord Lawson, Britain's longest serving post-war chancellor until his
resignation in 1989.
'The plain fact is that the economic cycle is endemic - which means,
incidentally, that all the current talk of no return to 'boom and bust is
somewhat premature to say the least'.
Lord Lawson, delivering his verdict on the government's economic record 10
years after his keynote Mais speech, which became the blueprint for the
Thatcher years, repeated his criticism of the government's reluctance to
grant independence to the Bank.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Labour calls for new procedure on complex bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour is pressing the government to remove the technical aspects of Budget
legislation from the finance bill as part of an overhaul of parliament's
antiquated legislative procedures.
The proposal, put forward in talks with Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the
house, would split the finance bill, which implements the budget, into two
parts.
The main bill, dealing with the principle of changes in the level and scope
of taxation, would be debated by MPs on the floor of the Commons in the
traditional way.
The technical aspects of proposed changes would be tabled in a taxes
management bill, which would be debated by a committee with powers to take
evidence from experts.
This split could also be used with the technical aspects of other complex
bills such as legal reforms, housing and local government measures and
privatisation proposals.
The proposal has emerged as one of the main prospects for changes in
parliamentary procedure in talks between Mr Newton and Mr Nick Brown, the
shadow leader of the house.
Mr Newton, who has not yet accepted Labour's proposals for technical bills,
has argued for a system of formal timetabling of all legislation, which
would rule out any delaying action by the opposition.
Labour remains implacably opposed to formal timetabling, but has indicated
that it might accept more discussion between the two front benches on the
approximate amount of time needed for bills to pass through the Commons.
Both parties want to reach agreement quickly on implementing parts of a 1992
report on parliamentary procedure produced by a select committee chaired by
Mr Michael Jopling, a former Tory chief whip.
The Jopling report's main recommendations included sitting in the morning
one day a week, completing business by 10pm on most nights, and ending the
system of carrying sick MPs through the division lobbies for critical votes.
Mr Jopling claimed in the Commons yesterday that agreement was being held up
by traditionalists in the Labour whips' office who fear procedural changes
would weaken the opposition's ability to force government concessions by
delaying bills.
Labour has also indicated some sympathy for separate proposals put forward
by Mr John Major to reform the twice-weekly prime minister's question time
by allowing MPs to table topical questions 24 hours in advance.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Retail planning test case to open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A test-case public inquiry likely to affect out-of-town shopping centres
begins today.
The Church Commissioners, who own the MetroCentre, Europe's largest
out-of-town retail and leisure development, have disagreed with Gateshead
borough council over whether the complex, with 350 retail units, should be
treated as one unit or 350 for planning purposes.
The local authority argues that any change of use of individual units in the
centre and any change of shop front require its permission.
The Church Commissioners maintain that the MetroCentre is one building and
that internal changes should not need consent.
Local authorities are not consistent on planning policy. Some follow
Gateshead's line while some require planning applications only for change of
use, and some do not require any applications for internal changes.
The MetroCentre disagreement has arisen since its Enterprise Zone status,
which conferred a simplified planning regime, ended in 1991.
Mr Chris Moore, for the Church Commissioners' managing agent, said: 'What we
are trying to do is clarify the planning legislation.'
The commissioners said the issue is one of principle: 'It is
administratively inconvenient for us and for the tenants. We also want to
reaffirm our ability to control the centre.'
But Mr Jerry Barford, Gateshead's director of planning, said the council
wished only to exercise its statutory responsibilities. The commissioners,
he said, seemed puzzled that the council sought to exercise planning
control.
Mr Peter Gates, chairman of the centre's tenants' association, said
retailers were concerned at any measures which might increase costs.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Mayhew hints at resurrecting internment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday gave his
strongest hint yet that the government is considering internment as part of
its response to the upsurge in sectarian violence in the province.
His comments came as the UK government signalled that a meeting between Mr
John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister, this week could give new impetus to efforts to forge a lasting
settlement in Ulster.
Downing Street made clear it had not ruled out reaching a framework
agreement on new constitutional arrangements in time for the next
Anglo-Irish summit next month.
On Friday Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, gave a gloomier
assessment, warning that the document was unlikely to be completed in time
for the summit.
As the first victims of the latest outbreak of sectarian violence were
buried, Mr Gerry Adams added his voice to those urging republicans not to
retaliate for Saturday night's shooting in which six Roman Catholic men were
killed by loyalists.
The president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, appealed to 'those I
represent' for calm and restraint. He said republican leaders would
reconvene to discuss Sinn Fein's response to last year's Downing Street
Declaration 'within days'.
With pressure again mounting on London and Dublin to show that their efforts
are making headway, officials representing the two governments are
understood to be working from the same draft of the proposed framework
agreement.
But important differences are said to remain over what the document will say
on future north-south institutions and Dublin's constitutional claim over
the province.
This is seen in Whitehall as the main trade-off that will be at the core of
any agreement. Although London is anxious to encourage Dublin to move
further towards rescinding its territorial claim, officials see little point
in granting concessions on north-south relations that would be rejected out
of hand by unionists.
The two sides are also divided on whether the document should simply provide
a starting point for new political talks, in line with London's wishes, or
set out a specific blueprint for the province's future.
Mr Reynolds used a speech in the US yesterday to underline Dublin's
readiness to back constitutional changes, provided this was part of 'a
balanced constitutional accommodation'.
Questioned in Lisburn, where the British army in Northern Ireland is
headquartered, Sir Patrick said it was 'not for nothing' that the government
asked MPs to renew a provision for internment every year.
He said the provision had been retained because the government believed
circumstances could be 'envisaged' in which it would be 'necessary to use
that power'.
Ministers have come under pressure from unionists and Tory backbenchers to
intern suspected terrorist ringleaders as part of their response to
Saturday's shooting.
Government insiders believe such a move is still some way off, however, not
least because of the difficulties it could present the Irish government,
whose co-operation would be required if the exercise is to be effective.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Underwriter 'told lies' over Names' losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former underwriter with the Gooda Walker agency was yesterday accused of
lying to Lloyd's agents over the likely losses to be sustained by syndicate
298 after the Piper Alpha oil platform disaster.
Giving evidence during the High Court action brought by 3,095 Lloyd's Names
 -individuals whose wealth has traditionally supported the market - Mr
Stanley Andrews was accused of misrepresenting the syndicate's losses to
agents and the Gooda Walker board.
Mr Jonathan Gaisman, for the Names, said that between January and August
1989, Mr Andrews had repeatedly insisted the syndicate's likely losses would
be below the Dollars 104m level at which 298 had arranged reinsurance. He
had then continued to tell agents he expected the syndicate to break even,
Mr Gaisman said.
In April 1989 Mr Andrews reported losses of Dollars 74m, in line with the
losses projected in the 1988 audit. The reported figure was Dollars 100m by
July and stayed at this level until September.
Mr Gaisman said that Mr Derek Walker, the former chairman of the Gooda
Walker managing agency, then looked at the syndicate's books and discovered
the losses were Dollars 125m. Mr Andrews had manipulated the figures and
given untrue figures for projected losses and results to agents, Mr Gaisman
said. 'You had not been telling the truth about these figures for months.'
The claim was denied by Mr Andrews, who said he had always reported the
latest figures available.
Mr Gaisman said Mr Andrews had also misled the board about the scale of the
losses. Mr Tony Gooda, the former chairman of the members' agency, had told
others in early 1989 that Mr Andrews was predicting the syndicate would
break even or make a small profit. Mr Andrews said he had never told Mr
Gooda that the syndicate might do any better than break even.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Rise in high-street rents forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High-street shop rents will start growing at the beginning of next year,
says a report by chartered surveyors Erdman Lewis.
Rents are static in town centres, although there has already been a
reduction in incentives offered by landlords from an average of 18 months'
rent to six months' rent. But tight retail margins and intense out-of-town
competition means that rental growth is unlikely to exceed inflation in the
short term.
'Retailers, while dusting down limited expansion programmes, show no
enthusiasm to pay higher rentals. Overheads remain their paramount concern,'
the report says.
Outside town centres, there has been strong demand for property as retailers
strengthen their operations and new traders join the market. However, some
larger units remain empty because they are poorly located and require
sub-dividing to achieve successful lettings.
Rents for out-of-town retail units, excluding food, rose by 4.3 per cent in
the year to May 1994. Erdman Lewis expects that out-of-town retail units
will continue to show rent increases above inflation if the consumer-led
recovery continues.
The level of money being poured into the sector has produced the lowest
yields for several years and record levels for retail warehouses. Investor
demand for out-of-town stores has pushed yields down by at least 2 per cent
to 6 per cent.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sports, arts and heritage groups will be able to apply for revenue grants to
help run capital projects funded by the proceeds of the National Lottery, Mr
Peter Brooke, the National Heritage secretary, said yesterday, Raymond
Snoddy writes.
The announcement marks a new flexibility on how the money raised by the
National Lottery can be spent.
Critics were worried that hundreds of millions of pounds might be spent on
new capital projects but that the money would not be available to run the
new projects successfully.
Mr Brooke made clear yesterday that while the proceeds, which could be
Pounds 9bn over seven years, will be mainly for capital projects it will be
possible to apply for revenue grants.
He said: 'After consultation with the distributing bodies, I have agreed to
allow them greater flexibility in the awarding of endowments and revenue
grants to help cover, in some instances, the revenue costs of lottery-funded
capital projects.'
The distribution bodies which will allocate the money raised by Camelot, the
consortium chosen to operate the lottery, are the Arts Council, Sports
Council, the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the Millennium Commission and
the National Lottery Charities Board.

FT  21 JUN 94 / MoD and Treasury battle on cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A tussle was under way yesterday between the Ministry of Defence and the
Treasury over forthcoming cuts in military spending, as unrest mounted on
both sides of the Commons.
The MoD is understood to have completed its Front Line First proposals,
designed to shave at least Pounds 750m a year from the defence budget,
mainly by trimming expenditure on support services. Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
defence secretary, said in April he was seeking savings from support
spending, and might use the spare funds to beef up the forces' frontline
capability.
However, the Treasury is now understood to be challenging this. Mr Rifkind
is expected to confirm several procurement decisions around the time of the
announcement of the decision - expected in mid-July - to soften the
political impact of the spending cuts and up to 25,000 job losses.
At Westminster, Mr Julian Brazier, chairman of the Tory backbench defence
committee, was one of a number of Conservatives who attacked plans to cut
support services.
He said: 'I understand there are likely to be cuts in the medical capability
of the forces, which we would need if we ever went to war, and they are also
talking about further cuts in spares and ammunition, which we found we
didn't have enough of in the Gulf.'
At the same time, Labour stepped up its campaign to preserve the Rosyth
naval base in Fife, amid fears that it will be closed with the loss of more
than 4,000 jobs. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor - whose constituency
contains the naval base - urged Mr Rifkind to make a statement on Rosyth's
future before publication of the report next month.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Davenport Brewery building saved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birmingham City Council has halted plans to knock down the offices of the
old Davenport Brewery, Paul Cheeseright writes.
The offices incorporate a Georgian house which provided the design for other
offices built between the world wars. Limewood Developments, the property
arm of the Greenalls leisure group which owns Davenport, wanted to demolish
the offices while it cleared the site (above) for a retail and housing
development. The planning application for the shops and homes has been
withdrawn. The council wants the office buildings retained but is anxious to
bring life back to a site that is just off the city centre and next to the
old accident hospital, which is to be converted into student accommodation.

FT  21 JUN 94 / MPs probe Mersey Tall Ships losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merseyside Development Corporation yesterday appeared before the Commons
public accounts committee to defend its involvement in the lossmaking 1992
Tall Ships regatta on the Mersey, and the associated operatic concert.
Mr Chris Farrow, corporation chief executive, said the event had been a
one-off, and the corporation had not known the extent of the losses until
the events themselves. He told the committee: 'I know of no other event in
the region which has lost this kind of money.'
Carroll Communications, the public-relations company set up to mastermind
the events, was, he said, 'totally viable. The projections were viable.'
It was not until the events themselves that the shortfall in ticket sales
because of poor marketing became apparent. Ticket revenue was between Pounds
470,000 and Pounds 500,000, Mr Farrow said.
This left a shortfall at the end of the day of Pounds 375,000. Much of this
was met by the publicly funded development corporation.
He agreed the promotion and hospitality budget at Pounds 202,000 had been
heavily overshot.
Mr Andrew Turnbull, the permanent under-secretary at the Department of
Environment, told the committee that events such as the Tall Ships regatta
would receive more clear guidance in future; that there would be more
careful monitoring of expenditure, and that prospectuses would be more
adequately vetted.
The 1992 regatta, watched by more than 1m people, was the culmination of the
Tall Ships Race across the Atlantic and back.

FT  21 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Chinese authorities urge restraint
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
China has told World Cup fans to turn their TVs low and stop shouting
'Goal]' late at night. China did not qualify for the finals, but millions of
soccer followers are staying up late to watch matches live on state-run
television.
In a front-page commentary, the Communist Party's People's Daily told fans:
'Keep the TV down low. When you see a great goal, keep your emotions under
control. Don't shout loudly or applaud.' Fans were urged to 'guard against
accidents happening (at work) because of lack of sleep.'
The time difference between China and the US means that many of the matches
are broadcast in the small hours of the morning.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If they beat Spain today at Soldier Field, Chicago, defending champions
Germany could become the first of the 24 World Cup teams to advance to the
second round.
'We don't have a team that knows how to play for a draw,' said coach Berti
Vogts. 'We are an offensive team and that's how we'll play.' Vogts gave no
clue whether that meant a recall for veteran striker Rudi Voller.
Germany beat Bolivia 1-0 in the Group C opener last Friday, while Spain
wasted a 2-0 lead against South Korea, drawing 2-2. Worse for Spain was the
sending-off of captain Miguel Angel Nadal for an untimely tackle. Nadal was
later given a two-match suspension.
Spanish coach Javier Clemente has criticized Fifa, soccer's governing body,
for penalising Nadal more harshly than the usual one-match suspension. 'I
think it's totally unfair and out of proportion,' he said. 'I don't
understand it.'

Rai hit the first penalty of the 1994 competition and Romario scored his
first World Cup finals goal as Brazil beat Russia 2-0 last night at Stanford
stadium near San Francisco.
Barcelona striker Romario turned in a corner from strike partner Bebeto in
the 27th minute and Rai fired home a spot kick in the 53rd after Romario had
been fouled.
A sellout crowd of 81,061 saw the Brazilians create many more chances in a
one-sided game in which Russia's goalkeeper, Dmitri Kharin of Chelsea, made
two stunning stops.
The Russians, depleted by the absence of overseas stars such as Manchester
United's Andrei Kanchelskis following a dispute with coach Pavel Sadyrin,
also had their captain, Viktor Onopko, missing through suspension.
Following their victory, Brazil were installed as 9-4 favourites to win the
tournament with both William Hill and Ladbrokes bookmakers.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Ecuador land protests grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Protests by Ecuador's indigenous population have closed some of the
country's main motorways, hitting commerce and isolating several cities.
The protests, entering their second week and becoming increasingly violent,
were sparked by a land reform law approved by President Sixto Duran Ballen
on June 13 which critics say halts popular land redistribution programmes.
In the central highlands, roadblocks have virtually cut off Ambato and
Cuenca, Ecuador's third and fourth largest cities, resulting in supply
shortages and price increases. The Pan-American highway has been blocked by
protests from some 200 indigenous communities at several junctions in
Cotopaxi Province.
About 40,000 indigenous people gathered in the provincial capital Rio Bamba
to demand annulment of the legislation. In Ecuador's Amazon region several
access roads to oilwells are also reported to have been blocked. Last week a
protester was shot dead by a motorist trying to crash the barricades.
Clashes between irate motorists and Indians armed with machetes have left
dozens wounded.
Some governors are asking President Duran to declare a state of emergency;
others say they would annul the so-called agricultural development law.
Critics of the law say it ends 25 years of land redistribution. Indigenous
peoples, making up 40 per cent of Ecuador's population, are now denied
communal land and water rights, they add.
Government and indigenous leaders were due to hold their first talks late
yesterday. Yet prospects for an immediate solution are dim; the government
has said it will not repeal the law.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Colombian poll victor may shift course: Sarita Kendall on
Samper's election win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Colombians opted by a narrow margin on Sunday for a continuation of Liberal
party rule, but the new president-elect Ernesto Samper is viewed as likely
to shift the emphasis of government economic policy.
In the second round of the election, Mr Samper polled just 1.8 percentage
points more than his rival, the conservative Andres Pastrana.
Abstention was unexpectedly low at about 55 per cent and, with 98 per cent
of the results in, Mr Samper had polled 3.7m votes. In his victory speech,
he told supporters he had received a 'social mandate' - a reference to the
priority he gave to increasing social investment throughout his campaign.
As he spoke, he was joined by two former Liberal presidents - a reminder
that the Liberal party is the most powerful machine in Colombian politics.
Mr Samper, 43, who started as a Bogota city councillor and moved to the
senate, built himself a strong supporting faction along the way. When he
starts his four-year term as the third successive Liberal president, on
August 7, there will be a Liberal majority in both Houses of Congress.
Early in his career Mr Samper headed the National Association of Financial
Institutions, a kind of economic think tank, and produced a document arguing
for the legalisation of marijuana. But when Colombia's Supreme Court
de-penalised drug use last month, he was quick to warn of the dangers of a
massive growth in consumption in a country where drugs are so cheap and easy
to obtain.
Like the present administration, he sees Colombia as a victim of the
drug-consuming countries and says he will continue with the current policy
of encouraging traffickers to surrender in exchange for reduced sentences.
In 1989, when car bombs were exploding in city centres and political leaders
were being assassinated, Mr Samper was hit by more than a dozen bullets and
was lucky to survive. Four bullets are still there. This, he says, made him
feel he had been given a second chance and increased his determination to
become president and try to bring peace to Colombia. Mr Samper is a moderate
with a strong populist streak and a sense of humour that was suppressed
during the campaign.
For the first time, Colombia will have a vice-president: Humberto de la
Calle, a former cabinet minister who is likely to be an active partner,
particularly on international issues.
In his victory address, Mr Samper paid tribute to President Cesar Gaviria in
whose government he served as minister of economic development. He said the
president's 'vision and valour have given Colombia a great modernising drive
which we shall continue with decision.'
However, his own programme is centred on tackling some of the problems
associated with the opening up of the economy over the last five years, such
as the gap between rich and poor and city and country.
Colombia's economy grew by 5.3 per cent in 1993 and, with the recent
improvement in coffee and oil prices, this year's growth rate should be
similar. But construction and services have been doing much better than
agriculture, industry and mining; non-traditional exports have risen very
slowly while imports are soaring. Mr Samper's plans to create 1.5m new jobs
includes an export promotion programme as well as industrial modernisation
and the rehabilitation of the countryside.
Although Mr Samper says he will continue to work towards Latin American
integration, he favours a stronger state role on sectors such as
agriculture. Badly-needed investment in roads, bridges and ports, are also
on his agenda. The extra income due from the Cusiana oil reserves from 1995
on will provide great opportunities but Mr Samper is aware of the potential
problems and is concerned to prevent further revaluation of the Colombian
peso.

FT  21 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Nigeria could be Africa's last hope - Simon
Kuper in Boston finds the African challenge led by the continent's more
stable countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON KUPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We are here to win the World Cup,' says Nigeria's Dutch coach, Clemens
Westerhof. No coach of an African World Cup side has ever been able to make
that boast, and Westerhof may be proved right.
His team are making their first appearance in the finals, and are expected
to beat Bulgaria in a Group D first-round match in Dallas today. But despite
the hype, African soccer may be getting worse, not better.
Certainly Nigeria look the strongest African side ever to make the World Cup
finals, stronger, certainly, than this year's Cameroon and Morocco. I do not
wish to exaggerate, but the Nigerian players are all intelligent giant
sprinters with tremendous skills, particularly their two strikers, Daniel
Amokachi and Rashidi Yekini.
For various reasons, no Nigerian defender has played league soccer recently:
one player was suspended for six months for calling a Belgian referee a
racist. But the team captured the African Nations Cup in April, and some
European pundits think the Nigerians will do extremely well in the US.
European pundits have always loved to say that an African side will win the
World Cup one day. The prediction sounds grandiose, cannot immediately be
disproved, and is kind to the Third World.
But Africa gets poorer by the year, and African soccer suffers too. 'The
scissors of European and African football will separate even further,'
predicts Joachim Fiskert, the German manager of Congo. The World Cup is the
main sporting event - perhaps the main event, full stop - for most African
countries, yet over 20 of them failed to enter the current competition.
The obstacles were famine or civil war or lack of funds (or all three),
while Libya could not travel due to a UN air embargo. Zambia did enter, but
its players died when the ancient military aircraft carrying them to Senegal
fell into the Atlantic. The Zambian FA had been unable to afford a regular
airline.
Or take Ethiopia, one of the African countries which managed to play all its
qualifying matches for this World Cup. The Ethiopians' first match was in
Morocco. The team flew via Rome, where their five key players sought
political asylum. That left eight players to contest the match.
The reserve goalkeeper, the assistant manager and a friend filled in, and
Ethiopia began the game with 11 men. By half-time, however, two of the
volunteers had dropped out exhausted, and Morocco led 5-0. Early in the
second half, three more Ethiopians gave up. With just six players left
standing, the referee ended the game. Ethiopia did not make the finals.
The three African teams that are here, Morocco, Cameroon and Nigeria, are
among the continent's richer countries, though Nigeria and Cameroon are
slipping fast: both had to ask their fans to help pay for their World Cup
preparations.
History shows that except for Zaire in 1974 - and they failed horribly  -
only relatively rich, stable African countries have qualified: Tunisia,
Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria and Cameroon.
That Cameroon is becoming less stable shows up in this year's squad. The
country's president, Paul Biya, has repeated his 1990 feat of personally
picking Roger Milla for the national team. This time Milla is 42 rather than
38 years old, and the French coach Henri Michel does not want him along, but
President Biya has been unloved since the elections in 1992, and was obliged
to try something. Milla had predicted a 'revolution' were he not selected.
Political interference is the norm in African soccer. When I asked Niger's
sports minister whether he picked the national team, he replied: 'It comes
with the job.' King Hassan of Morocco is said to have a direct telephone
link to his team's bench. Nigeria's military rulers wanted their team to
reflect 'the Nigerian federal character' - players from each main tribe,
please - though most of the time Westerhof is his own man.
'Cameroon did very well in Italy,' he says. 'But we want to do better here
and I know we can.' When Cameroon reached the quarter-finals in Italy in
1990, the world's bookmakers were shocked. They should not have been.
In 1978 Tunisia beat Mexico 3-1 and were unlucky to draw 0-0 with West
Germany. Four years later Algeria beat West Germany and Chile, and Cameroon
gained three draws in three games, while in 1986 Morocco won England's
group. At each World Cup the Africans do well, and each time it is said that
the African game is finally coming of age. In reality, it has not advanced
much in the past 16 years.
All over Africa you will find boulevards, squares and even churches re-named
after Roger Milla, the continent's hero of 1990. The World Cup matters more
to Africa than to any other part of the world. Only in sport, explains the
Cameroonian writer Celestin Monga, 'is the African really perceived by the
big western media as a man . . capable of making a valuable contribution to
the history of humanity.'
Every quartier in Africa will be spending the next month around a TV set.
Let us hope Westerhof was not just not boasting.

The first World Cup game played by a US team on American soil was watched by
a surprisingly large domestic television audience, according to preliminary
ratings.
Although the US-Switzerland game at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan,
last Saturday started as early as 11.30am, it attracted a 5.8 rating on the
ABC network in the 29 largest US television markets. One rating point is the
equivalent of 941,000 homes.
The US national team's World Cup opening game ended in a 1-1 draw. In
comparison, ABC's broadcast later the same day of the third round of the US
Open golf tournament - traditionally a strong draw among sports fans -
earned a 5.0 rating.
The 5.8 rating for US vs Switzerland was an average for the two-hour
broadcast. The data showed that as the game progressed, more people turned
on their sets to watch it, with the final 30 minutes earning a 7.2 rating.
ABC, which normally does not broadcast sports programming so early on a
Saturday, was surprised by the strong rating for the US-Switzerland game.
Mark Mandel, director of sports information for ABC, said the network was
'very pleased . . . particularly as the game was on so early.' He added:
'We're off to a great start.'
Corporate sponsors of the tournament were also delighted with the rating for
the first US game. Eric Kraus, a spokesman for Gillette, which is
advertising heavily on television during the tournament, said: 'The high
rating shows that there is a great deal of enthusiasm for World Cup soccer
in the US, and that it is really catching on.' Jackie Woodward, director of
sports marketing at McDonald's, another big advertiser, said: 'We're
thrilled.'
Although the US-Switzerland rating proved the pessimists who said Americans
were not interested in the World Cup wrong, it is still too early to judge
whether enthusiasm for the tournament is broad-based, or sustainable.
The preliminary ratings for the weekend games shown on ESPN, the cable
sports channel which is sharing World Cup coverage with ABC, are not yet
available, and the real test for ABC will come when it broadcasts a game not
involving the US team.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Proposals by a House of Commons committee to reform Canada's controversial
Goods and Services Tax (GST) will form the basis for an overhaul of the
country's retail sales taxes, Mr Paul Martin, finance minister, said
yesterday.
The suggested reforms fall far short, however, of promises by the now-ruling
Liberal party during last year's election campaign to scrap the 7 per cent
GST, which was introduced by the former Progressive Conservative government
three years ago in the face of a public uproar.
The Commons finance committee was asked to draw up alternatives shortly
after the Liberals took office last November. Among its main recommendations
is a proposal that the GST, to be renamed the National Value Added Tax,
should be made less visible by including it in the retail price of goods and
services, rather than adding it at the cash register.
The most politically sensitive part of the report is likely to be a proposal
that the federal tax be harmonised with retail sales taxes levied by nine of
Canada's 10 provinces. Mr Jim Peterson, the committee's chairman, described
the present system as 'the worst sales tax jungle in the world. We have 10
different systems using different bases, different rates, different
reporting periods and different bureaucracies.'
With the exception of Quebec, the provinces have so far resisted Ottawa's
efforts to roll their taxes, which vary from 7 per cent to 12 per cent, into
the GST. The GST was introduced in January 1991 to replace a manufacturers'
sales tax, and accelerate a shift from direct to indirect taxation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said
yesterday that he was 'troubled' by a growing number of reports of
derivatives-related losses at US mutual funds.
In letters to the chief executives of large mutual funds and to the
Investment Company Institute, Mr Levitt said SEC inspection staff had found
reasons 'to raise questions' about the derivatives activities of some mutual
funds.
'It is apparent that at some funds derivatives risks may not have been well
managed, and that resulting losses may have been unexpected by fund
management and fund shareholders,' said Mr Levitt in a letter to Mr Matthew
Fink, the ICI president.
The SEC chairman's expression of concern comes in the wake of reports of
large declines in the value of some mutual funds because of their use of
derivatives instruments.
Mr Levitt is particularly worried about the derivatives activities of money
market and government bond funds because the conservative-minded investors
who choose those funds might not be fully informed of their exposure to the
instruments.
In his letter to the ICI, Mr Levitt said he wanted to know what mutual fund
managers had done to address the risks involved in their use of derivatives.
He also asked several questions about the industry's derivatives activities,
including whether funds were setting and following limits on the use of
derivatives and whether all managers were sufficiently expert in derivatives
to use the instruments properly.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Unitary tax ruling ends 17-year battle: But implications of
court decision on California method are unclear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Supreme Court's decision yesterday in favour of California ends a
17-year legal battle by Barclays Bank and a host of other foreign
multinationals and governments against the state's worldwide unitary method
for assessing corporate income taxes.
The decision, by a 7-2 majority of the nine-member court, removes an
immediate cloud from California's overcast fiscal horizon: the state will
not have to refund more than Dollars 1.4bn it has already collected under
unitary assessments, and is likely to be able to collect another Dollars
500m next fiscal year in assessments that have been frozen for the last 10
years because of the litigation.
That is no small windfall for California, which has yet to pass a budget for
the fiscal year that begins next week. But the implications for the future
of the unitary method of taxation are less clear.
Although the Supreme Court decision apparently leaves the way clear for
states to adopt the method, practical politics are likely to deter most from
accepting the invitation.
Last year, the British government set its wheels in motion for retaliation
against Californian companies by the denial of a tax credit, a move which
was partly responsible for the state's decision to change its tax law in a
way that essentially gives foreign companies the right to opt out of unitary
assessments.
The UK legislation authorising retaliation remains in effect.
'The state of California should be under no illusion,' said Mr Peter Welch,
who heads the unitary tax campaign, a UK business coalition that has battled
the tax for years, 'that if British business should be penalised in the
future or if any other state should damage the interests of British
companies by the imposition of worldwide unitary tax, then there will be a
tidal wave of pressure upon the UK government immediately to institute
effective retaliatory measures.'
There are, in fact, many cases where foreign companies can benefit from
unitary assessments, if their profitability in California is higher than
elsewhere.
This is particularly true under the current California system, which allows
taxpayers to choose between unitary assessment and a method called 'water's
edge', which assesses only income within the borders of the US and which
comes close in its effect to the arm's-length method embraced in all
international tax treaties.
'What we now have is what I call the Burger King system of international tax
accounting: Have it your way,' said Mr Brad Sherman, chairman of the State
Board of Equalisation, California's tax authority.
Several multinationals operating in California choose the water's edge
method on principle, even though it costs them more, because of their
objections to unitary assessment.
The arm's-length method is based on the simple principle that only income
earned in a particular country or state should be taxed by that government.
Companies are required to account for movements of goods and services
between their subsidiaries at arm's-length transfer prices - the same as
they would charge to an unrelated company.
Its practical application, however, can be very complicated. Many
governments fear that multinational companies can change the amount of tax
they pay within a particular country by manipulating transfer prices.
Several US states have found the unitary method appealing because it is
easier for the collecting agency to assess: a company's taxable income
inside the state is calculated by multiplying its total worldwide income by
a factor based on the proportion of its property, payroll and sales located
inside the state.
But because it conflicts with the arm's-length principle used everywhere
else, unitary assessments can lead to double taxation, as a company may not
be able to deduct from its taxable income in its home country the unitary
tax assessed on it by a US state.
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Clarence Thomas, in dissenting from
yesterday's decision, cited the risk of double taxation.
The Supreme Court had already ruled in 1983, in the Container Corporation
case, that California's unitary system was legal when applied to US
companies, but expressly set aside the question of whether it could be
applied to foreign businesses.
The essence of Barclays' case was that unitary taxation, because it
conflicts with the arm's-length principle preferred in international tax
treaties, interferes with the federal government's right to speak for the US
with a single voice on matters of international commerce, and is therefore
unconstitutional.
But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the court, said that the
federal government had had the opportunity to prevent states from using the
worldwide unitary method, but had not done so.
'Congress has focused its attention on this issue, but has refrained from
exercising its authority,' Mrs Ginsburg wrote.
Colgate-Palmolive's case, heard in tandem with that of Barclays, was that to
exempt foreign but not domestic companies from unitary taxation would be
unfair. To win, it would have had to persuade the Supreme Court to
contradict its earlier Container decision, the sort of reversal that the
justices only rarely contemplate.

FT  21 JUN 94 / US health bill must cover all - Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday challenged Congress by saying it must pass
a health reform bill that covers all Americans - as his plan does  - instead
of a watered-down version, AP reports from Washington.
'We should not walk away from this Congress without a commitment to cover
everyone,' Mr Clinton said in an interview on NBC television.
The president spoke a day after Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of
the Senate finance committee, said there was no way that Congress would pass
a bill guaranteeing healthcare for all Americans. Mr Moynihan said it was
more likely that Congress would enact a scaled-down plan with the potential
of insurance for everyone within 10 years.
'It doesn't have to be done tomorrow,' Mr Clinton said. 'It ought to be
phased in over a period of just a few years, but we ought not to walk away
without a bill that provides health care to all Americans.'
Mr Clinton has made solving the healthcare crisis a top priority. More than
37m Americans have no health insurance, and Americans must spend a larger
amount of their income on medical expenses than residents of most developed
countries.
Some measures in Congress envisage insuring 91 per cent of Americans. Ms
Donna Shalala, health and human services secretary, has released a report
showing 17.2 per cent of Americans were uninsured in 1992, up from 12.5 per
cent in 1980. Most uninsured are middle class people, she said, hard-working
Americans 'who get up and go to work every day, yet, every day they must
live without the security of health insurance.'

<TEXT>
The US Supreme Court yesterday agreed to decide the constitutionality of
laws restricting the number of times members of Congress can run for
re-election.
In congressional elections over the past four years much has been made of
the public's anger with long-time incumbents, who are often perceived to be
out of touch with voters and the cause of corruption and political gridlock
in Washington.
However, incumbents are hard to defeat because they usually have political
and financial resources far exceeding their challengers.
The populist anti-incumbent movement has led to enactment of term-limit
amendments in 15 states.
At issue in the case the Supreme Court said it would hear is an amendment to
the Arkansas state constitution that prohibits senators who have served two
six-year terms and House members who have served three two-year terms from
appearing on the ballot.
An Arkansas court invalidated the law in March, citing a 1969 Supreme Court
decision that Congress cannot, except in the case of impeachment and
conviction, exclude any member meeting the constitutional qualifications -
minimum age, US citizenship and state residency.

Canada's Goods and Services Tax (GST), the value-added levy introduced in

the government accepts a report due to be tabled late yesterday.
However, the suggested reforms fall far short of promises by the now-ruling

The committee has also reportedly urged that the tax be broadened to include
groceries and prescription medicines. In this way, the rate could be reduced

FT  21 JUN 94 / UK reaction marked by frustration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government and companies with US operations reacted with
frustration to the Supreme Court's ruling against Barclays Bank in its
long-standing feud with the state of California over the imposition of a
system of unitary taxation.
The Confederation of British Industry said: 'We are extremely disappointed
to hear this news and are awaiting full details to understand its
implications.'
The Inland Revenue said: 'We are naturally disappointed and we are awaiting
further details.'
It appeared unlikely the government would enact legislation to permit
potential retaliatory action against US companies in the UK in the event of
a court decision supporting unitary taxation.
Many companies and professionals had expected the decision to go against
Barclays, and downplayed its ramifications now that companies could opt to
be assessed instead on a water's edge basis, which assesses only income
within US borders.
Others expressed fears that the Supreme Court's decision could trigger other
US states to impose unitary tax. It also permits California to reintroduce
the system.
Barclays said last night it was currently 'chewing over' the 'very long and
very detailed' text of the Supreme Court judgment.
The bank is believed to have already handed over up to Dollars 30m in taxes
assessed by California on the unitary basis in connection with its
operations from the mid 1970s up until 1983. As a result of the judgment, it
may have to hand over another Dollars 10m in taxes in dispute since that
time. Barclays withdrew its retail and most other operations from California
in 1988.
The company said last night: 'We naturally regret that the court has arrived
at this decision in relation to what is an important issue of international
taxation. It affects not only Barclays but also numerous other UK and
foreign-owned multinationals.
'Any weakening of the certainty provided by the internationally accepted
arm's length approach to taxation is likely to have adverse consequences for
world trade generally.'
Mr Tony Hughes, an international tax partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said:
'This decision is not unexpected because of the degree of political
pressure. I don't expect to see any retaliation because there is not much at
stake. But there would be a war if unitary tax was extended to other
states.'

Iran said that 25 people were killed and 70 wounded yesterday when a bomb
exploded in a crowded prayer hall in the north eastern Iranian town of
Mashhad.
The Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) said the worshippers had congregated
at the mausoleum of Imam Reza to observe the Islamic mourning day of Ashura.
The authorities in Tehran immediately blamed the Mujahadeen-e-Khalq, the
main Iranian opposition group, which in the past few years has been more
visible outside the country than within.
However, a statement issued from the Mujahadeen office in Paris 'strongly
condemned' the bombing. It added: 'Such criminal actions, which inflict
casualties on innocent people, only serve the interests of the mullahs'
regime.'
IRNA reported that several people had been arrested. An interior ministry
official quoted by the agency said several of the injured were critically
ill. Earlier the death toll had been put at 70.
Mashhad was the centre of rioting two years ago when official buildings,
banks and shops were attacked and several people killed in protests believed
to have been sparked by demolition of slum housing.
There have been reports of minor incidents in Tehran this year, but none
causing serious loss of life or damage to buildings.
But with last year's fall in oil prices, the government has fallen further
behind in meeting international debt obligations and, with inflation rising
sharply, senior Iranian officials have been aware of the risks of public
discontent. Parliament has refused to sanction price increases sought by the
government and President Rafsanjani's efforts to maintain other economic
reforms, such as a single exchange rate, have been abandoned.
An earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale struck southern Iran
yesterday killing two people, injuring over 100 and destroying or damaging
51 villages, official media said, Reuter reports from Tehran.

France ran into Third World opposition last night when United Nations
Security Council members first discussed proposals for unilateral French
military intervention in Rwanda, Michael Littlejohns reports from New York.
However, the plan is still expected to be approved.
Diplomats said a French resolution that would give the Council's blessing to
the operation was likely to gain acceptance, mainly because the UN cannot
deploy its own troops in substantial numbers for perhaps up to three months.
Ms Madeleine Albright, US delegate, said Washington was 'supportive' of the
French initiative. China, which has the power of veto, has not made its
position known. New Zealand was the severest Security Council critic,
arguing Paris should have offered troops to serve under UN command. Nigeria
expressed serious reservations.

Mr Kenneth Jarrett, a former executive of Elders IXL, the Australian
agriproducts group, has pleaded guilty to involvement in a ADollars 66.5m
(Pounds 33m) foreign exchange scheme which was allegedly fraudulent, and was
said yesterday to be willing to give evidence against his former boss, Mr
John Elliott.
According to Mr Brind Woinarski, Crown prosecutor, who is pursuing charges
of conspiracy and theft against Mr Elliott, Mr Jarrett and five other
individuals previously connected to the Elders IXL group in relation to
these forex dealings, Mr Jarrett has co-operated fully and intends to give
evidence against his former colleagues, including Mr Elliott.
Mr Jarrett pleaded guilty in the Melbourne Supreme Court to one count of
failing to act honestly as an officer of the company, between April 1986 and
June 1990. Mr Woinarski told the court the Crown was alleging Mr Elliott
decided who would be involved in the foreign exchange scheme and who would
benefit from it. It was also alleging Mr Elliott and Mr Peter Scanlon,
another Elders IXL executive, were the architects and instigators of the
scheme.
The charges against Mr Elliott, a prominent Melbourne-based businessman and
former president of the Australian Liberal party, Mr Jarrett and the other
individuals, were filed shortly before Christmas. The theft and conspiracy
charges related to two foreign exchange transactions, between Elders and the
Bank of New Zealand, and then between the Bank of New Zealand and companies
connected to executives of Equiticorp, the failed New Zealand-based group.
Elders is said to have apparently made losses totalling ADollars 66m on the
deals, with similar gains booked to the Equiticorp entities. The authorities
allege the transactions were used to funnel money to Mr Allan Hawkins,
Equiticorp's now-jailed former chief executive. Mr Elliott, released on
ADollars 450,000 bail, has consistently maintained his innocence.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Seoul signals end to curbs on Hyundai
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The South Korean government yesterday appeared ready to end its cold war
with the Hyundai conglomerate by signalling its willingness to drop
financial restrictions against the nation's largest industrial group.
The Korea securities dealers' association, which receives its guidance from
the government, said it would 'favourably consider' the registration of
three unlisted Hyundai subsidiaries on the over-the-counter market.
The government blocked the OTC listing of the three companies - Hyundai
Heavy Industries, Hyundai Elevator and Hyundai Housing and Industrial
Development - in 1992 and 1993, in apparent retaliation for the 1992
presidential bid by Hyundai's founder, Mr Chung Ju-yung.
Mr Chung's presidential campaign was the first political challenge staged by
a conglomerate against the government's traditional strict control over
industry.
Mr Chung, who finished a poor third to President Kim Young-sam, announced
his retirement last month from the group's management in an attempt to end
the government's hostility toward Hyundai.
The OTC listings would be the first step in ending all state-imposed
financial restrictions on Hyundai.
The government has prevented Hyundai from receiving soft industrial loans
from the state-controlled Korea Development Bank, issuing bonds in foreign
markets, and barred the listing of two other Hyundai companies - Hyundai
Merchant Shipping and Koryo Industrial Development  - on the Seoul bourse.
Hyundai claims that as a result of the financial restrictions it has had to
cancel or postpone some of the projects in its Dollars 5.6bn (Pounds 3.7bn)
investment programme this year.
Some of the projects affected include the construction of two car factories
by Hyundai Motor, the completion of a 16-megabit semiconductor assembly line
by Hyundai Electronics, and the construction of a Dollars 1.5m shipbuilding
dock and generator and turbine production facilities by Hyundai Heavy
Industries.
Government critics have argued that the financial restrictions were
detrimental to the economy's growth, since Hyundai is the nation's largest
producer of cars and ships.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Surge in growth rate seen for India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The reform process in India, begun in 1991, could enable growth rates to
surge to levels experienced by its East Asian neighbours, the World Bank
said yesterday.
In a report before the June 30 meeting of the Paris Club Aid India
Consortium, , the bank praised the 'remarkable' success at improving current
and capital external accounts. Growth rose from 2 per cent in 1991-92 to
about 4 per cent in the last two years and manufacturing, which initially
dipped, has recovered to a modest growth of 2 per cent.
Foreign investment has soared to an unprecedented Dollars 4.7bn (Pounds
3.1bn). But inflation, after declining to about 7 per cent in mid-1993, has
been rising again, the report said.
For India to fulfil its growth potential, however, it must strengthen public
finances and improve infrastructure. 'Reform should be broadened to include
sectoral ministries, public enterprises and state government while at the
same time intensifying efforts to strengthen social safety nets.'
The Bank warns that India must improve its fiscal performance. 'At 66 per
cent of GDP by the end of 1993-94, the central government debt (90 per cent
of the consolidated central and state governments debts) is relatively high.
Interest payments already claim over half of central government fiscal
revenues,' it said.
Improvement must be made in the finances of public enterprises and the
states. The bank said it was 'essential' India accelerate reform of public
enterprises, which generate one-fourth of the country's non-agricultural
GDP.
'Where restructuring exercises must precede large scale disinvestment,
public enterprises' managers need to be given the authority to mobilise the
resources necessary for financial restructuring, undertake large scale
retrenchment and associate interested private parties where possible.'

FT  21 JUN 94 / Critics of Indonesian nuclear energy plans oppose inactive
volcano site - Government says energy demand gives it no option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proposals by the Indonesian government to develop a nuclear power industry
are taking on an increasingly determined tone amid widespread criticism from
environmentalists and some opposition parties.
The proposals include the building of the country's first nuclear power
station near an inactive volcano Mount Muria on the northern coast of
central Java, an area also prone to earthquakes.
International tenders for the plant could be held next year and Indonesia's
leading environmental pressure group, Walhi, has stepped up its anti-nuclear
campaign.
A feasibility study for the construction of the plant was completed by New
Japan Engineering Corporation earlier this year but details of the study
have not been made public. If all goes as planned, Indonesia could have a
working nuclear power station by 2004.
Proponents of the nuclear energy scheme at Batan, the state's national
atomic energy agency, argue that soaring energy demand in the Java/Bali
grid, which is home to 70 per cent of Indonesia's 180m people and accounts
for 80 per cent of Indonesia's total energy requirements, leave the country
with no choice but to go nuclear. There are also proposals for 12 nuclear
power stations in Java and Bali over the next 25 years.
Batan predicts that at forecast rates of increased energy demand, Indonesia
faces becoming a net oil importer within the next 10 to 15 years. Although
the country has coal reserves for another 300 years, the environmental
impact of coal-fired electricity generation limits possibilities.
'We have to go nuclear one day,' says Mr Hartato, co-ordinating minister for
trade and industry. 'There is no doubt about it.'
'We believe it is not good to rely on a single source of energy,' says Mr
Soedyartomo Soentono, deputy director general for nuclear industrial
research and development at Batan. Critics retort that with so many
alternative supplies of energy in the country, including geothermal and
solar energy and gas resources, it does not make sense to make nuclear power
a priority.
Mr Soentono, however, says geothermal and solar sources of energy could not
generate enough power to satisfy the requirements of a rapidly
industrialising area. He also argues that Indonesia's huge gas deposits are
located too far from Java and Bali.
'The government's main policy is to diversify its sources of energy,' Mr
Soentono adds. Batan says that in 1992 86.1 per cent of the country's energy
supply came from oil and gas, 7.8 per cent from coal, and other sources
accounted for 6.1 per cent. By 2019, Batan predicts 6 per cent of the
country's energy supply will come from nuclear power stations, 54 per cent
from coal, 38 per cent oil and gas and 2 per cent other sources.
Opposition to the construction of the Muria plant has also been voiced in
Australia. Critics there argue that Indonesia's frequent earthquakes make a
nuclear power plant high-risk. In February this year an earthquake shook the
Indonesian province of Lampung in Sumatra, killing nearly 200 people.
Some Indonesian geologists argue that building a nuclear power station next
to an inactive volcano is gambling with luck. They point to Mount Pinatubo
in the Philippines which was dormant for 700 years before it erupted in
1992. Batan says the volcano in the Muria peninsula has been dead for
340,000 years.
'I would not call it a volcano, I would call it a hill . . . , says Mr
Soentono.
Environmentalists are also concerned at plans eventually to privatise the
Muria plant. Batan insists the government would continue to ensure safety
requirements are met even if the plant is sold off. The government says it
will create a nuclear regulatory authority.
It is estimated that the cost of building the Muria plant will be about
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn). Opponents of the scheme are angry that
Indonesia, which has a foreign debt of between Dollars 90bn and Dollars
100bn and an annual per capita gross domestic product of Dollars 660, should
invest in developing nuclear power stations when, according to them, there
are other more urgent issues, such as welfare.
Batan executives say they have conducted a cost evaluation for the project
which concludes that nuclear power stations are a cheaper source of energy
than coal. They do not give any figures.
Indonesia has three nuclear research reactors, all in Java, and has been
developing isotopes and radiation processing programmes since 1964. But
there is concern that Indonesia does not have the technical expertise to
manage a nuclear power station.
'We do not have a high-tech culture,' says Mr Muhammad Anung, programme
manager for energy at Walhi.
Opponents of the scheme will have to fight hard to be heard since support
for the development of nuclear energy comes from the government's highest
quarters. The proposal is one of the pet projects of Mr Jusuf Habibie,
Indonesia's enthusiastic minister for research and technology. President
Suharto has also indicated his support.
Mr Habibie has promised that the public will have the final say in
determining whether the Muria project goes ahead. Critics are sceptical.
'Habibie's statement is purely political,' says Mr Anung at Walhi. 'I think
they will go ahead and build it anyway.'

FT  21 JUN 94 / S Korea offers pre-summit meeting: Response by North will
prove sincerity of President Kim Il-sung's offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea yesterday proposed a working-level meeting with North Korea on
June 28 as the initial step in arranging the first summit between the
leaders of the divided Korean peninsula.
In Washington, President Clinton said yesterday there were 'hopeful signs' a
clash over North Korea's nuclear programme could be averted, but cautioned
that Pyongyang's offer to freeze the programme had to be verified.
North Korea's response to the South's proposal will provide an early
indication of the sincerity of last week's offer by the North's President
Kim Il-sung to meet President Kim Young-sam without any preconditions. The
working-level meeting will discuss the time and place of the summit.
'Results should be produced in the near future so that this preparatory
contact does not drag on or pose problems in procedure and agenda-setting as
in past contacts,' Mr Lee Hong-koo, the South's deputy prime minister for
unification, said. 'The sooner the summit occurs, the better.' But other
government officials cautioned it could take at least several months to make
preparations for the meeting.
The Seoul bourse reacted positively to the summit proposal, with the general
share index rising by 1.76 per cent to 942.50. A summit would guarantee that
South Korea will have a role in resolving the North Korean nuclear dispute
and complementing possible North Korean talks with the US and the
International Atomic Energy Agency on international nuclear inspections, the
foreign ministry in Seoul said.
The South Korean president said his main summit goal will be to secure
agreement on mutual nuclear inspections between the two Koreas as promised
in their 1991 non-nuclear pact.
'It is very important for the South and North to make mutual inspections in
the end,' Mr Kim said.
Disagreements over the issue led to the collapse of contacts between Seoul
and Pyongyang in late 1992. The North refused the South's demand for
inspections of suspected nuclear facilities, which would be more intrusive
than those requested by the IAEA.
Foreign ministry officials predicted that inter-Korean talks leading up to
the summit will progress in tandem with proposed discussions between North
Korea, the US and the IAEA.
This would prevent the North from using the summit as an opportunity to
disrupt Seoul's close co-operation with Washington on the nuclear issue. The
South is expected to offer economic co-operation to the North in return for
its agreement on nuclear inspections.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Egypt strong enough to say no to IMF: Reform success allows
Cairo to resist devaluation pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fact that Egypt and the International Monetary Fund are in disagreement
 -this time with Cairo resisting IMF pressure to devalue - has a familiar
ring to it. That Egypt is prepared to resist IMF recommendations out of
self-confidence in its economic performance, however, is a more novel
phenomenon.
The differences surfaced last week, when Egypt admitted that IMF approval
for the present stage of its economic reform programme faced a delay of up
to six months and that devaluation was the point of contention. Cairo had
otherwise hoped to win the Fund's approval by next month. That in turn was
to trigger relief of about Dollars 5bn of external debt under a 1991 deal in
which official Paris Club creditors said they would write off half Egypt's
then Dollars 40bn debt if it successfully undertook IMF and World Bank
reforms.
Egypt has already enjoyed two tranches of debt relief under this agreement,
having since 1991 undertaken 'remarkable and broad ranging reforms', in the
words last week of Mr Ram Chopra, director of the World Bank's Middle East
department. And senior Egyptian officials say they are confident of winning
the third and final tranche by the year's end. But they will do it, they
say, Egypt's rather than the Fund's way.
From near bankruptcy in late 1990, Egypt has cut inflation by a third to
less than 7 per cent, sliced its budget deficit from 18 per cent of gross
domestic product to less than 2.6 per cent, and padded reserves from two
weeks of import cover to more than 18 months. All this while liberalising
trade and the banking and capital market sectors and streamlining and
improving the tax system.
Egypt has also defied tradition by holding the Egyptian pound stable at
around EPounds 3.3 to the dollar for the past three years, underpinned by
the introduction in 1992 of positive real interest rates for the first time
in decades. This stability the government prizes as among its most cherished
achievements, one which ministers say does more than anything to establish
international confidence in the economy.
But the IMF now believes Egypt can no longer afford the cost to its export
competitiveness of an exchange rate it reckons may be 25 to 40 per cent
overvalued. It believes equally that Egypt cannot sustain indefinitely the
high real interest rates (three-month T-bills are at 12.2 per cent) without
constraining growth. So the Fund is urging more flexibility on both counts.
'We will never devalue,' Mr Atef Obeid, the public sector minister, said
flatly last week, describing such a move as 'destructive' and
'destabilising'.
Chief among Egyptian officials' reasons, perhaps, is that they fear
devaluation might jolt hard-won confidence in the currency and threaten both
to halt healthy flows of hard currency - much of it in remittances from
Egyptian workers - and to reverse the process of 'de-dollarisation' of the
economy. Today just 23 per cent of broad money supply is held in dollars,
against 57 per cent before the reforms.
Mr Obeid agrees the pound has appreciated in real terms, but says only
'modestly'. The government also appears convinced that this overvaluation is
correcting itself. Inflation, at 6.89 per cent year on year, is undercutting
IMF targets and should fall further during the next few months, eroding the
differential between Egypt's and its main trading partners' inflation rates
 -a differential of roughly 3 percentage points.
Officials suggest that the benefits to export competitiveness will not
outweigh the potential threat to confidence. While a devaluation might
directly improve the competitiveness of non-oil exports, recent rough and
ready figures suggest they are already rising by an annual 14 per cent. The
government claims, meanwhile, to be taking an axe to the forest of fees and
charges facing Egypt's small export industries, which some estimates suggest
can add 12 per cent to an exporter's costs.
The government can also argue that non-oil exports bring in only about 15
per cent of Egypt's hard currency earnings, the bulk of which come from Suez
Canal receipts, remittances and oil exports.
Senior officials also suggest that a greater impediment to export growth
than the exchange rate is the relative backwardness of Egyptian companies in
export experience. 'Our entire economic policy is geared towards the
tradeable sector,' says Mr Yousef Boutros Ghali, minister for international
co-operation. 'But I deeply believe the issue of competitiveness lies in the
technical competence of our exporters - this is what we need to worry
about.'
None of which provides much cheer for the IMF; neither for the numerous
bankers and businessmen who have long sought a devaluation - to perhaps
EPounds 3.8 or EPounds 4.00 to the dollar - and, perhaps more urgently, a
relaxation and re-alignment of interest rates. All believe the future of
Egypt's export sector - on which they also argue rests Egypt's economic
future - depends on improving competitiveness.
Officials do not appear to rule out a continued shaving of interest rates
and perhaps slight slippage in the pound-dollar rate. But the government
appears otherwise content that the main macro-economic variables are under
control. The reforms are at last becoming, some ministers believe,
'irreversible'.
There are signs in the last few months that growth has started to pick up
after the depressing effects of the stabilisation programme. Indicators such
as cement sales, holding companies' turnover, power consumption, rail
freight and others point to growth of about 2 per cent. Bank credit to the
public sector is up 21 per cent and to the private sector32 per cent. A
recent lull in attacks by Islamic militants might also lift some gloom from
the tourism industry.
So the government will sit it out for the next five or six months and hope
that inflation will fall further, exports will continue to grow and that by
the end of the year, it will have been vindicated. 'The numbers will bear us
out,' says a senior official.

FT  21 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Swedish call for more telecoms competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Per Westerberg, Sweden's minister of industry, yesterday called for a
rapid introduction of competition in the provision of telecommunications
networks across Europe.
Addressing an FT conference in London on European telecommunications, Mr
Westerberg said the liberalisation of telecoms services, as agreed by the
EU, was insufficient to give Europe a competitive edge over the US.
'Competition in the infrastructure is also necessary,' he said. Pointing to
the potential for a new generation of multi-media services using fibre-optic
networks, he argued that prices had to be cost-based.
'For this to happen I believe there must be competition in infrastructure as
well as in all kinds of service.'
Sweden, whose application to join the EU now rests with a national
referendum, already allows infrastructure competition. Within the EU only
the UK has adopted the same course.
The European Commission has yet to announce its proposals on the issue, but
appears to be leaning towards infrastructure liberalisation.
Mr Wim Dik, chairman of KPN, the recently privatised Dutch posts and
telecoms company, supported the liberalisation of infrastructure, saying he
'welcomed' the prospect of competition at home.
He stressed the importance of alliances between national operators to the
future of Europe's telecoms industry as international competition advanced.
'If there is more competition in your home market, you have to go abroad,
and multinationals are driving the international market,' he said.
KPN has formed an international joint venture, called Unisource, with the
state telecoms operators of Sweden and Switzerland. Telefonica, the Spanish
operator, is an associate member.
Mr Candido Velazquez-Gaztelu Ruiz, chairman of Telefonica, told the
conference that Telefonica was set to join Unisource as a full member next
month. 'We share its philosophy' he said.
The addition of Telefonica will strengthen Unisource in its current
negotiations for a partnership with AT&amp;T, the largest US operator. AT&amp;T is
anxious to enter the European telecoms market after the success of its
smaller US rivals MCI and Sprint in forging alliances with the larger
European operators.
However, Mr Dik and Mr Ruiz clashed over the question of universal service
obligations on national telecoms operators, an issue slowing progress
towards full telecoms liberalisation in the EU.
Mr Dik said market forces should broadly determine telecoms service levels,
with any subsidies thought desirable for rural dwellers paid directly to the
subscribers.
However, Mr Ruiz argued that national operators should continue to receive
subsidies to provide telecoms services to poorer or rural communities. They
should either be allowed to subsidise such services from other activities,
or competitors should be obliged to pay them a fee to cover loss-making
social obligations.
The issue is controversial in Spain, which has recently agreed to forego an
EU concession allowing it until 2003 before licensing 'voice' telecoms
competitors to Telefonica. Competition in Spain will start in January 1998,
as in most of the rest of the EU.

FT  21 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Big oil find off Vietnam - Production of
about 130,000 barrels a day expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mitsubishi Oil of Japan yesterday announced the discovery of what could be a
significant oil find off the coast of Vietnam, an area which has proved
disappointing for a number of international oil companies.
The find was in shallow water near the mouths of the Mekong River, well away
from disputed areas further offshore. The exploration block, known as 15-2,
is adjacent to the Bach Ho, or White Tiger field, which produces about
130,000 barrels a day.
Officials yesterday said they 'strongly expect that the discovery will . . .
lead to production on a similar scale to the Bach Ho field.' Oil from the
newly discovered well is also expected to be of a similarly high quality,
the company said.
The Japan Vietnam Petroleum Company, a Mitsubishi subsidiary, said the
10,346 barrel a day flow rate from the exploratory well was 'one of the
highest flow rates from a single production test in south-east Asia'.
Another exploratory well is due to be drilled in the area, but Mitsubishi
and PetroVietnam, the Vietnamese state oil company with which it has a
production sharing contract, have decided to begin a feasibility study on
the possible development of the field.
Analysts say its proximity to the coast and shallow water depths should help
to keep development costs down.
Mr Gavin Law, who monitors oil developments in south-east Asia for Wood
Mackenzie, the Edinburgh brokers, said there had been 'a lot of eagerness'
on the part of the Vietnamese authorities to get another significant
offshore discovery.

<TEXT>
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry yesterday moved closer
to lifting restrictions on oil product imports with the publication of a
report recommending the deregulation of the oil industry.
In an interim report submitted to the trade minister, a government advisory
panel called for the abolition of a special law on oil product imports which
has restricted imports to refiners.
The report says the restriction has helped perpetuate substantial price
differentials between domestic and overseas petrol prices, and recommends
the easing of rules on petrol station construction.
The panel's recommendation, which will form the basis for Miti policy, comes
as prime minister Tsutomu Hata has urged ministries to come up with further
deregulatory measures to resuscitate the sluggish Japanese economy.
The Japanese government will compile a package of deregulatory measures by
the end of this month to present to the Group of Seven summit in Naples next
month as part of its efforts to meet international criticism that it must do
more to stimulate its domestic economy and trim its current account surplus.
Wide-ranging regulations covering the oil industry have come up for special
criticism recently as responsible for shoring up the price of petrol.
At the same time, Miti has been keen gradually to lift its protective shield
over the oil industry, to strengthen the industry's competitiveness.
Abolishing the special law would encourage trading houses and agricultural
co-operatives to import oil products from regions such as the Middle East,
Singapore and the US.

<TEXT>
Mazda, the Japanese carmaker, yesterday said negotiations had resumed, after
a year's suspension, on possible European co-operation with Ford, the US
carmaker.
Ford has a 24.5 per cent stake in the Japanese company and earlier this year
strengthened its representation on the Mazda board. It had been expected
that Ford and Mazda might renew discussions on the possible production by
Ford in Europe of Mazda badge cars for sale in European markets.
However, Mazda said no specific projects or details of co-operation had been
decided, and Ford of Europe executives insisted that no fresh initiatives
had been launched.
Senior Ford executives said earlier this year that European production for
Mazda would be one of the priority issues to be examined as a result of the
closer relationship between the two companies.
The prospect of Mazda being drawn into closer collaboration with Ford has
also been revived following the 'globalisation' programme announced several
weeks ago by Ford.
Ford is restructuring its operations into 'world' car divisions in which
Europe is taking the lead in designing and developing small and medium-sized
cars for production worldwide.
Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman, has held out the prospect of Mazda becoming
part of these world operations.
European collaboration talks between Mazda and Ford were suspended in March
last year after the two companies decided a co-operative deal being
discussed at that time was not to either's advantage.
Co-operation between Mazda and Ford then was considered within a certain
framework and focused on a specific car model, Mazda said. For that
particular model, the companies decided a deal was not attractive.
However, talks have restarted on a different basis and a variety of options
are likely to be discussed, including joint venture manufacturing and
own-equipment manufacturing in which Ford would make cars to be sold by the
Japanese car company with the Mazda badge.
Mr Yoshihiro Wada, president of Mazda, however, denied speculation that
Mazda will commission Ford to assemble small cars in Europe at Ford's UK
manufacturing plant.
The Japanese car company, which has seen its European sales battered by the
high yen, has been eager to find a way of making its cars in Europe.
'The European market follows the US market in importance to Mazda, so local
sourcing is crucial,' Mazda said.

The Japanese government is to extend its first ever sovereign loans to South
Africa. The credits will be part of a package of measures expected to be
unveiled by the prime minister, Mr Tsutumo Hata, at next month's summit of
leaders of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in Naples.
Foreign Ministry officials said a mission would leave for South Africa later
this week to look at specific projects for infrastructural investment. The
total value of the loans on offer would be decided after the mission's
report. Likely areas for investment included telecommunications, medical and
educational facilities.
The package of measures will also include up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 329m)
in trade and investments insurance over the next two years, according to the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti).
Miti officials said the decision is in response to a recent US request that
industrialised nations increase aid to Pretoria for its economic
rehabilitation programme under the presidency of Mr Nelson Mandela.
The move comes at a time of growing interest by Japanese companies in South
Africa. Several utility companies and trading houses have established
trading links since sanctions were lifted in 1991. Last month Sumitomo
Corporation, one of Japan's leading trading companies, established a joint
venture with Associated Manganese Mines to exploit new mines.
Japan is South Africa's fourth largest trading partner. Until recently the
country was one of the few in the world to have a bilateral trade surplus
with Japan. But the slump in Japanese domestic demand has been reflected in
a sharp fall in imports from South Africa. Last year, Japanese exports
totalled Dollars 2bn while imports were Dollars 1.9bn.

FT  21 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Argentina 'backs' Brazil to lead WTO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazilian diplomats said yesterday that the Argentine government had
underlined its support for Brazil's candidate to head the World Trade
Organisation.
According to the diplomats, the support for the Brazilian finance minister,
Mr Rubens Ricupero, came in a letter sent by the Argentine foreign minister,
Mr Guido di Tella, to his Brazilian counterpart, Mr Celso Amorim, at the
weekend.
The letter follows the cancellation by Brasilia of a proposed visit later
this month by the Argentine finance minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo. That came
after reports that Argentina - along with other heads of government at the
Ibero-American summit last week - had backed Mexican President Carlos
Salinas to head the WTO.
The diplomats said that Mr di Tella's letter said there had been a
misunderstanding about the summit discussions in Cartagena, Colombia, over
the new WTO head - which took place after Brazil's president, Mr Itamar
Franco, had left to attend a funeral.
Mr di Tella said the Argentines had not understood the talks to be seeking a
consensus, and had believed the Brazilians had been consulted beforehand on
the issue.
Mr Salinas, who does not leave office until the end of the year, has not yet
formally declared his interest in the job as head of the WTO, which is to
succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year.
Only one candidate from Latin America is expected to be considered by the
new body. Brazil has insisted that Mr Ricupero, the only person to have
officially put his name forward, remained a 'viable' candidate.

Belgium is on course to meet this year's target for the public sector
deficit of 5.7 per cent of gross domestic product, Mr Philippe Maystadt, the
finance minister, said yesterday. Presenting the Treasury's seventh annual
report on the public deficit, Mr Maystadt said he was confident the federal
government would be able to stick to its goal, even though it was too early
to say how well Belgium's three regional governments had performed. Mr
Maystadt also announced that Belgium was to introduce a new clearing system
that would enable private retail investors to hold government Treasury bills
and linear bonds (OLOs), previously only held by banks and institutional
investors. Individuals would be allowed to hold the debt instruments in a
special bank account. The report said that consolidated debt represented
66.6 per cent of the federal government's total debt at the end of May this
year, compared with 69.5 per cent a year earlier.
Sweden's May trade surplus rose to SKr5.5bn (Pounds 462m) from SKr4.5bn a
year earlier, the Central Bureau of Statistics said yesterday. Analysts
polled by Reuters had forecast a SKr6.7bn surplus.
Registered businesses in Hungary rose to 92,314 in May from 91,004 in April,
the Central Office of Statistics said.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Baltic states' varied roads to freedom: Philippe Legrain
reviews the economic records of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania since
independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPE LEGRAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Estonia flouted the International Monetary Fund's advice and ditched
the Russian rouble, its leaders did so in the conviction that a stable
national currency was a cornerstone of their country's hard-won
independence. But two years on, their initial success - inflation was held
to 36 per cent last year compared with nearly 1,000 per cent in Russia - has
been undermined by recent price surges.
Latvia's consistently better inflation record underscores Estonia's setback
and has called into question its northern neighbour's approach to monetary
policy. The Bank of Latvia, while allowing the lat to float, has adopted a
'strong lat' policy and maintains high interest rates to stamp out
inflationary pressures. Estonia, on the other hand, runs a currency
board-like system which leaves policy on 'autopilot'. The kroon, which is
pegged to the German D-Mark, is fully backed by foreign currency reserves
whose ebbs and flows determine the size of the money stock.
Large capital inflows, fuelled by foreign aid and investment and balance of
payments financing, have sent Estonia's money supply rising fast.
Consequently, inflation has shot back up to an annualised 66 per cent in the
three months to May, compared with 20 per cent in Latvia.
Renewed inflation has also increased the kroon's overvaluation, sucking in
imports and stunting export growth. Estonia's trade deficit widened to
EEK1.3bn (Pounds 66m) in the first three months of this year, equivalent to
a third of export volume or about 20 per cent of estimated first quarter
gross domestic product.
By contrast, thanks to its superior inflation performance, the lat has not
appreciated as much in real terms as the kroon and Latvia's current account
has remained in surplus - Dollars 125m last year, equivalent to 5.7 per cent
of GDP.
Despite these drawbacks, a recent study by Professor Jeffrey Sachs of
Harvard University and Mr Ardo Hansson of the Bank of Estonia defends the
currency board system, arguing that it gives the kroon much needed
credibility. The authors point to the shift in trade from east to west -
Finland has replaced Russia as Estonia's main trading partner - to back up
their case.
But Latvia has achieved a similar re-orientation. Although Russia is still
its main trading partner, like Estonia's, about a quarter of its trade is
with Russia.
On April 1 the third Baltic republic of Lithuania, often considered the
laggard in economic reform, plumped for the Estonian way. After a furious
debate involving accusations of betraying the motherland, the government
pegged the newly-issued litas to the US dollar. Inflation had stabilised at
an annualised rate of 36 per cent in the three months before the decision.
Lithuania recorded a 300m litas (Dollars 75m) deficit last year and trade
remains angled towards former Soviet republics.
Growth prospects for all three countries remain murky. Although industrial
output growth is still flat, the Baltic states are hoping for growth this
year for the first time since regaining their independence in August 1991.
Estonia seems to have the edge but evidence is patchy.
Estonia has also led the way in attracting foreign investment. Finnish and
Swedish companies have piled in more than half the EEK906m - equivalent to
4.3 per cent of GDP - that flowed into the small country last year.
Latvia is catching up, having overcome a legislative logjam which led
prospective investors to delay committing funds. While only about Dollars
60m (2.7 per cent of GDP) was invested in Latvia in 1993, Dollars 100m is
expected this year, according to the Latvian Development Agency. The
UK-based multinational Cable &amp; Wireless and Telecom Finland have announced a
Dollars 1.3bn plan to modernise Latvian telecoms, Dollars 40m of which has
already been invested. Kellogg, the US breakfast cereals giant, has set up a
Dollars 22m plant near the capital Riga.
Lithuania has attracted little foreign investment to date but is furthest
down the privatisation road. More than two thirds of the companies slated
for sale have been privatised, and more than half the workforce is now in
the private sector. However, allegations of corruption and of Soviet-era
'red directors' buying their companies on the cheap have nearly halted the
process.
Estonia has opted for the East German model, having set up a privatisation
agency modelled on the Treuhandanstaldt. Of more than 500 earmarked for
sale, 52 companies had been sold by the start of the year, with a new wave
of auctions under way. But the volume of receipts (Dollars 24m) and impact
on the economy have so far been minimal.
Privatisation has barely got off the ground in Latvia. A quarrel between the
newly set up privatisation agency and government ministries over
responsibility for the sell-offs and whether to opt for hard currency or
voucher sales has hindered progress. Although Latvia aims to sell about 200
companies a year, only 85 out of a list of 703 have actually changed hands
so far.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European business leaders yesterday called for a sweeping overhaul of the
public sector, including privatisation of postal services,
telecommunications, energy and transport, in order to recover
competitiveness and tackle Europe's unemployment crisis.
In a move aimed at lobbying Europe's political leaders before this week's EU
summit in Corfu, Unice, the employers' federation, appealed to governments
to set targets for cuts in public spending as a proportion of GDP and to
take steps to reorganise the welfare state.
Mr Francois Perigot, the leading French industrialist and newly-appointed
Unice president, said it was time to reduce the burden of the state on
business and roll back the public sector. 'We have kept our eyes closed for
20 years. We can't go on like this.'
The Unice report - Making Europe more competitive: Towards world class
performance - is business's most detailed response to the White Paper on
competitiveness, jobs and growth launched last year by President Jacques
Delors, president of the European Commission. The report sets out several
areas for action to shrink the public sector through deregulation and
privatisation so that Europe can compete more effectively with the US and
Asia:
Reducing the cost of healthcare, through the introduction of new 'market
type' mechanisms to match supply more closely to demand. This would involve
bringing private companies into the health care market.
Trimming the costs of pensions. This would provide a 'basic' state pension
for everyone who has worked, with an optional complementary pension financed
by companies and/or individuals.
Reducing the costs of unemployment benefits by limiting the period of
entitlement and enforcing tougher criteria for eligibility.
Reducing the costs of sickness and disablement benefits, with responsibility
for additional insurance transferred from the public sector to companies and
individuals.
In addition, the report urges more flexibility in labour markets, through
reductions in minimum wage levels, lowering the costs of employing people,
and reducing the cost of protection against dismissal. Unice also wants much
small business to be freed of red tape, both from Brussels and national
capitals. Mr Zgymunt Tyszkiewicz, Unice secretary-general, acknowledged the
recommendations implied Europe was moving toward US-style deregulation at
the very moment the Clinton administration was looking to the European
social model for inspiration.
Mr Perigot said that Unice was not advocating the dismantling of the welfare
state, rather it was seeking new incentives for companies and individuals to
reduce their reliance on the state.

toughness as he tackles his new task. Elected as provisional leader of the
French Socialist party on Sunday, following the resignation of Mr Michel
Rocard, he inherits a party deep in crisis, facing an uphill struggle to
forge unity and win back dis-enchanted voters.
His election represents a shift to the left by the Socialists as they seek
to rebuild from a hammering in this month's European elections and to
recover in time for next year's presidential election. Mr Rocard, defeated
in a vote of confidence which he had called following his party's meagre
14.5 per cent support in the European polls, himself admitted that the party
suffered from 'uncertain political and strategic positions, confirmed
isolation, and an absurd means of operation'.
Mr Emmanuelli's task will be to try and overcome the divisions in the party
while it addresses its problems and searches for a credible candidate for
next year's presidential poll. After defeating Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a
former industry minister, by 140 votes to 64, Mr Emmanuelli said it was
necessary to consult with militants in the party to ensure cohesion. 'The
error of the Socialist party has been that it has been unable to position
itself to defend the workers against the threats they face concerning labour
protection and social security,' he said, demonstrating his left-wing
credentials.
A former president of the National Assembly, the 49-year-old Mr Emmanuelli,
started his career at the Banque d'Edmond de Rothschild in 1969. The deputy
for Landes in south-western France has since established a reputation as an
uncompromising figure within the Socialist party. 'He holds very strong
views and is a tough opponent,' says one party official.
This reputation could complicate his task of steering the Socialists through
a delicate transition period. He may be helped, however, by the fact that he
is not considered a presidential candidate in his own right. Party officials
said he will head the party until a party congress is held, due by the end
of the year, and until a presidential candidate can be decided.
Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, is clearly
favoured by many within the party. A CSA poll published on Saturday
suggested that 74 per cent of Socialist supporters want the former finance
minister as their presidential candidate.
A CSA poll of voters of all parties yesterday put Mr Edouard Balladur, the
prime minister and head of the centre-right coalition, on 48 per cent, one
percentage point ahead of Mr Delors, whose support has increased four points
in a month. Mr Jacques Chirac, head of the Gaullist RPR party, is on 38 per
cent.
Mr Laurent Fabius, the former Socialist prime minister and bitter rival of
Mr Rocard, said on Saturday that Mr Delors was the person 'best placed' to
lead the Socialists into April's presidential contest. Mr Delors, however,
has remained enigmatic on his possible return to French politics. Nor is he
the only potential candidate. Mr Jack Lang, the former culture minister, has
expressed his interest in standing for the presidency.
Whoever emerges as the presidential candidate, the daunting challenges
facing Mr Emmanuelli and his colleagues are already clear. In addition to
the factionalism that has long bedevilled the party and which erupted with a
vengeance last weekend, there is the equally fundamental problem of
restoring the party's tarnished image.
The disenchantment with the Socialists, and their weak appeal to young
voters, were clearly demonstrated in the European elections. The Mouvement
des Radicaux de Gauche, headed by the beleaguered businessman Mr Bernard
Tapie, won 12.3 per cent of the vote, largely at the expense of the
Socialists.
Whoever runs on the left may need at least the tacit support of Mr Tapie.
The backing of President Francois Mitterrand would also be valuable. Many
French commentators see Mr Rocard's downfall as the result of a long-running
feud with the president. This sentiment was expressed in a front-page
cartoon in Le Quotidien which showed Mr Mitterrand being presented with Mr
Rocard's head on a plate.

<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, is in two minds
about entering the race to succeed Mr Francois Mitterrand as president of
France.
For at least 12 months, Mr Delors, 68, has disavowed presidential ambitions.
The battle to ratify the Maastricht treaty on European union drained him. He
has shown more interest lately in a retirement devoted to intellectual
pursuits. 'I've been working for almost 48 years,' he has said, 'it's time
to hand over to the younger generation.'
The resignation of Mr Michel Rocard as head of the French Socialist party
changes the picture. Mr Delors has always made clear that he would not run
against Mr Rocard and split the Socialist party. Mr Rocard's defeat in a
vote of confidence at the weekend thus removes a precondition for an attempt
on the presidency.
It does not, however, answer the question of whether Mr Delors really has
his eye on the Elysee Palace after 10 years in the top Commission post in
Brussels - period in which he has helped to set the political agenda for the
Continent. Those close to Mr Delors believe that he would find it difficult
to resist a call from the Left to become presidential candidate, especially
if there was no-one of stature to challenge either Mr Edouard Balladur,
prime minister, or Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader, on the Right.
Most likely, Mr Delors would seek to avoid being candidate of the Socialist
party alone (he prides himself on cross-party appeal with his Christian
socialist credentials and fiscal orthodoxy). He would be in a strong
position to dictate terms to his party comrades.
One worry is how he would react to a presidential campaign. Mr Delors is
notoriously thin-skinned about criticism. No wonder aides were stressing
yesterday that he would serve out his final term until January 5, 1995. It
keeps him in his Brussels power-base, storing up energy for what would have
to be a short, sharp campaign.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Germany spells out Europe vision

<TEXT>
The European Union must take another big step in 1996 towards a federal
future, under strict democratic control, and with clearly defined powers, a
top-level German think-tank urged yesterday.
It set out an agenda for the inter-governmental conference which is intended
to complete the work of the Maastricht treaty, and lay the foundations for
an expansion of the EU to include member states in central and eastern
Europe.
In a report which reflects widespread thinking at the highest levels of the
German government, the group spelt out proposals for a bi-cameral system
which would put the European parliament and the European council of
ministers on an equal footing.
Such an idea would almost certainly pit the German government against the UK
and France, which have strenuously resisted any effort to give the European
parliament equal powers to the council.
At the same time the report called for precise definition of the competences
which should be exercised at European level, and those which should be
maintained by national governments, in an effort to curb the process towards
centralisation in the Union.
The experts involved in the report include Mr Joachim Bitterlich, who is
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's personal adviser on foreign affairs and above all a
specialist on European affairs, Prof Ernst Benda, former president of the
federal constitutional court in Karlsruhe, and Prof Werner Maihofer, former
federal interior minister.
Their aim is to start a debate now, on the eve of the German presidency of
the EU, and well before the 1996 deadline for the next inter-governmental
conference on the EU, which is supposed to complete the work of the
Maastricht treaty.
In spite of their determination both to resolve the conflict between
European integration and the preservation of national identity, and to
resist the trend to European centralisation, their federal vision seems
certain to arouse hostility from anti-federalists, above all in countries
such as Britain, Denmark and France.
The self-styled European structural commission, financed by the wealthy and
influential Bertelsmann foundation, says the greatest challenge for the EU
is to win public acceptance for a European system, which must be simplified,
more transparent, more democratic, and more strictly controlled than
hitherto.
The experts admit that the Maastricht treaty underlined the widespread
public fear over an excessively centralised and bureaucratic EU. It also
represented the high water mark for the transfer of sovereignty to Brussels,
they suggest.
'Europe cannot be built against the interests of its nations,' they said.
'But the opposite is also true: without problem-solving at a European level,
national interests cannot be protected.' The authors stop short of any
suggestion of a two-speed or multi-speed EU, saying that such a solution
would only be necessary only if there were a big expansion of the current
(enlarged) membership. It calls for a new single European treaty to combine
the existing three-treaty basis of the European Community and the European
Union.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Twelve agree on foreign workers
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union justice and interior ministers agreed yesterday on a joint
approach to keeping foreign workers out of the EU, and that no member state
should relax this policy without reference to its partners.
At the same time, the ministers shelved discussion on a European Commission
proposal that non-EU nationals legally resident in one member state should
be able to seek work in other member states, a central Brussels proposal to
help integrate foreign workers.
The ministers, operating under the so-called 'third pillar' of the
Maastricht treaty - concerning home and justice affairs - noted that none of
the 12 was pursuing an active immigration policy.
Yesterday's move was therefore a first step towards ensuring that all member
states were going about barring entry to foreign workers in compatible ways.
Mr Louis Tobback, the Belgian interior minister, warned the measure would
project an image of 'Fortress Europe' to the world. But Belgium joined its
partners in unanimous agreement, confining its reservations to a statement
in the minutes.
The Luxembourg meeting also voted to go ahead with a feasibility study on
setting up a so-called EURODAC network. This is a long-mooted system for
finger-printing asylum-seekers and suspected illegal immigrants at point of
entry.

Due to the introduction of the Single Market, EC countries are
currently changing to a new system of compiling trade statistics. All
trade figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series
and the German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting
the visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are
calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and
Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance
and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown

FT  21 JUN 94 / Risk of deadlock in Corfu on Brussels presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears were growing last night that this week's European summit in Corfu
would be unable to break the deadlock over the succession to Mr Jacques
Delors as president of the European Commission.
A stalemate risks putting Europe's political leaders on a collision course
with the new European Parliament which had hoped to scrutinise the choice of
Commission president at its opening session next month.
It would also be a sharp diplomatic setback for the outgoing Greek
presidency of the Union.
Prospects of a deadlock have increased in recent days as Mr Ruud Lubbers,
the Dutch prime minister and one-time favourite, has refused to bow to
Franco-German pressure in favour of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime
minister, who formally entered the race last Friday.
Germany, which takes over the presidency of the EU on July 1, now appears to
take a relaxed view of the danger of reaching a deadlock on issue at Corfu.
Senior German government officials now believe such an outcome may be
inevitable, even if regrettable, and are preparing for the possibility of
having to call an emergency summit. This would probably take place in the
early autumn.
'The federal government hopes that (the summit) succeeds in deciding the
question,' Mr Dieter Vogel, the German government spokesman, said. 'If not,
we will have to do it later. It is important that we decide this soon.'
Senior diplomats in Brussels, Madrid and London agreed that it was unlikely
that Greece would be able to broker a compromise during the Corfu meeting.
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, was also said to be unwilling to drop
Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, in favour of Mr Dehaene.
Mr Antonio Martino, the Italian foreign minister, who was in Bonn yesterday
for talks with Mr Klaus Kinkel, his German counterpart, also said later that
he thought a deadlock on the Commission presidency was probable.
The German government has hitherto expressed concern that everything should
be done correctly by the member states to respect the new powers of the
European parliament, which intends to put the future Commission president,
and his individual commissioners, through a parliamentary vetting and
approval procedure.

<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Dieter Schulte, the new chairman of the German
trade union federation, met yesterday with other European trade union
leaders to discuss Germany's forthcoming presidency of the European Union,
writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. Mr Kohl promised that plans for EU-wide works'
councils in multi-national companies would be a priority, along with
measures to fight unemployment and promote faster growth.
The union leaders called for promotion of further measures on social
protection, including for part-time workers, and to ensure that trade
liberalisation was accompanied by provisions for better social standards in
low-wage cost countries. The unions are concerned at Bonn's stress on
deregulation and greater flexibility in labour markets as a principal way of
creating jobs.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Solvent emission cut may hit output, warns Saab
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Saab Automobile, the Swedish car maker, warned yesterday it would cut
production and slide back into losses if it was forced to meet demands that
it sharply reduce solvent emissions from the paint shop at its manufacturing
plant in the city of Trollhattan.
Environmentalists are calling on the state body which sets industrial
pollution limits to force Saab, jointly owned by General Motors of the US
and Sweden's Saab-Scania, to adjust immediately to solvent emission levels
of 550 tonnes a year officially set for its plant instead of the
concessionary limit of 850 tonnes Saab currently operates within.
'If we cannot get a deferral we must reduce our production drastically to
stay under the emission limit, which would lead to a loss this year,' Mr
Peter Moller, Saab's development and production chief told a public hearing
held by the Concessions Authority.
The authority, which is also considering emission levels for Volvo, Saab's
Swedish rival, said it would rule on the issue in August. Swedish companies
face some of the toughest environmental regulations in Europe. The big
forestry industry has been forced to spend heavily on reducing effluent
emissions over the past decade.
Saab is on target to make a profit this year for the first time in six years
thanks in large part to the success of its new 900 model launched in 1993.
But this depends on increasing production significantly. Total unit sales,
the vast majority produced at Trollhattan, are projected to rise to more
than 90,000 in 1994 from 73,600 last year.
The company is planning a SKr1bn (Pounds 84m) investment to install a
water-based paint factory which will bring solvents emissions down to the
government target of 275 tonnes a year by 2000. But it insists it cannot
bring down emissions immediately without slowing or stopping production.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Call for overhaul of public sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European business leaders yesterday called for a sweeping overhaul of the
public sector, including privatisation of postal services,
telecommunications, energy and transport, in order to recover
competitiveness and tackle Europe's unemployment crisis.
In a move aimed at lobbying Europe's political leaders before this week's EU
summit in Corfu, Unice, the employers' federation, appealed to governments
to set targets for cuts in public spending as a proportion of GDP and to
take steps to reorganise the welfare state.
Mr Francois Perigot, the leading French industrialist and newly-appointed
Unice president, said it was time to reduce the burden of the state on
business and roll back the public sector. 'We have kept our eyes closed for
20 years. We can't go on like this.'
The Unice report - Making Europe more competitive: Towards world class
performance - is business's most detailed response to the White Paper on
competitiveness, jobs and growth launched last year by President Jacques
Delors, president of the European Commission.
The report sets out several areas for action to shrink the public sector
through deregulation and privatisation so that Europe can compete more
effectively with the US and Asia:
Reducing the cost of health care, through the introduction of new 'market
type' mechanisms to match supply more closely to demand. This would involve
bringing private companies into the health care market.
Trimming the costs of pensions. This would provide a 'basic' state pension
for everyone who has worked, with an optional complementary pension financed
by firms and/or individuals.
Reducing the costs of unemployment benefits by limiting the period of
entitlement and enforcing tougher criteria for eligibility.
Reducing the costs of sickness and disablement benefits, with responsibility
for additional insurance transferred from the public sector to companies and
individuals.
In addition, the report calls for more flexibility in European labour
markets, through reductions in minimum wage levels, lowering the costs of
employing people, and reducing the cost of protection against dismissal.
Unice also wants much small business to be freed of red tape, both from
Brussels and national capitals.
Mr Zgymunt Tyszkiewicz, Unice secretary-general, acknowledged the
recommendations implied Europe was moving toward US-style deregulation at
the very moment the Clinton administration was looking to the European
social model for inspiration. 'We are both trying to learn from each other.
We need adjustment on both sides,' he said.
Mr Perigot said that Unice was not advocating the dismantling of the welfare
state, rather it was urging political leaders to produce new incentives for
companies and individuals to reduce their reliance on the state. There must
also be 'adequate' protection for the employed, and support for the low-paid
and unemployed.
Mr Perigot added that he was worried that the incipient economic recovery in
Europe might diminish the appetite for radical reform. 'Will we spend (this
extra) growth on employment, wages or social security? We face a terrible
problem,' he said.
Unice presented its report to Mr Delors at a meeting in Brussels yesterday.
The Commission president will report on governments' progress in
implementing his White Paper at the Corfu summit. He stressed the importance
of new information technologies in creating new jobs.

FT  21 JUN 94 / EU ministers agree on foreign workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union justice and interior ministers agreed yesterday on a joint
approach to keeping foreign workers out of the EU, and that no member state
should relax this policy without reference to its partners.
At the same time, the ministers shelved discussion on a European Commission
proposal that non-EU nationals legally resident in one member state should
be able to seek work in other member states, a central Brussels proposal to
help integrate foreign workers.
The ministers, operating under the so-called 'third pillar' of the
Maastricht treaty - concerning home and justice affairs - noted that none of
the 12 was pursuing an active immigration policy.
Yesterday's move was therefore a first step towards ensuring that all member
states were going about barring entry to foreign workers in compatible ways.
Mr Louis Tobback, the Belgian interior minister, warned the measure would
project an image of 'Fortress Europe' to the world. But Belgium joined its
partners in unanimous agreement, confining its reservations to a statement
in the minutes.
The Luxembourg meeting also voted to go ahead with a feasibility study on
setting up a so-called EURODAC network. This is a long-mooted system for
finger-printing asylum-seekers and suspected illegal immigrants at point of
entry. The information would then be circulated among member states to
enable them to detect illegal immigrants travelling inside the supposedly
border-free EU.
A contract to study how best to set up the system was awarded yesterday to
an international consortium made up of Bossard Consultants, Team Consult,
and Organotecnica. Yesterday's restrictions 'may not be relaxed by member
states in their national legislation', which must conform to them by January
1996, the resolution states.
There are several exemptions from the harmonisation principles.
These cover nationals of European Free Trade Association countries that are
party to the European Economic Area free trade zone which came into effect
this year; refugees and asylum applicants; personnel transferred within
companies operating in the EU; investors; and a range of people covered by
'youth exchange' schemes ranging from au pairs to training programmes.
Mr Jurgen Storbeck was confirmed by yesterday's meeting as the head of the
Europol anti-drugs squad, the only unit the Europol cross-border police so
far operating.
The force is being set up by the 12 to combat organised crime within the
border-free internal market. The appointment places the German policeman as
likely future head of Europol as a whole.

FT  21 JUN 94 / US judges dismiss Barclays' challenge on unitary tax law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Supreme Court rebuffed international pressure to outlaw California's
controversial worldwide unitary system for assessing corporate income taxes
yesterday, dismissing challenges brought by Barclays Bank of the UK and
Colgate-Palmolive of the US.
Californian fiscal experts do not expect the state, which has introduced an
opt-out, to force companies to use the unitary method, but British companies
and tax professionals were concerned that the decision might prompt other US
states or other countries to impose the system.
Under unitary assessment, tax is calculated on a proportion of a company's
worldwide income instead of only on income earned in the state.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in an opinion written on behalf of the 7-2
majority, said Barclays had not demonstrated that the tax discriminated
against foreign commerce, nor that it imposed an undue compliance burden on
foreign companies.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said last night he was 'disappointed'.
'The government has always strongly opposed the imposition of worldwide
unitary tax on UK-owned companies and supported Barclays throughout this
litigation.'
He gave a warning that the UK would retain its retaliatory powers in case
the US took steps that might harm UK companies.
The ruling embraced two actions, one by Barclays and another by
Colgate-Palmolive, the US consumer products company, which challenged an
earlier ruling that the unitary method could also be applied to US
companies.
Barclays, which has waged a 17-year legal battle against the unitary tax
system, expressed disappointment at the decision but said it was still
'chewing over' the 'very long and very detailed' text of the judgment.
The ruling comes as a huge relief to California, which is in the middle of
one of its perennial budget crises and had counted on a favourable decision.
Although tax officials expect that only about Dollars 500m will actually be
collected, the ruling means California will not have to refund Dollars 1.4bn
it has already taken.
Although unitary tax conflicts with the tax method embraced by the US
federal government and by international tax treaties, the court said
California's use of the method did not infringe Congress's sole right, under
the US constitution, to 'regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among
the several states'.
Legal experts said the decision showed the court's determination to leave
matters of policy up to Congress, even when, as in the Barclays case,
Congress has indicated its stance only by rejecting Administration requests
to legislate against unitary tax.
'I think the lesson of this case is that unless a tax is clearly unfair in
its application the court is going to defer to Congress,' said Mr Jerome
Libin, a partner in the law firm of Sutherland, Asbill &amp; Brennan, which
represented the UK government against the unitary tax.
California last year passed a new tax law which essentially did away with
compulsory unitary taxation by allowing companies to choose instead a
'water's edge' assessment, in which only income within the US is taxed.
Mr Tony Hughes, an international tax partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand in
London, said: 'I don't expect to see any retaliation because there is not
much at stake.'
California governor Pete Wilson's budget package had counted on a favourable
ruling.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Lawson scorns plan to beat boom-bust cycle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Lawson yesterday derided the government's plans to end the UK economic
cycle of boom and bust, arguing that economies always move in cycles
irrespective of attempts to abolish them.
In a thinly veiled rebuke of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Lord Lawson
said: 'The plain fact is that the economic cycle is endemic - which means
that all the talk of no return to boom and bust is somewhat premature, to
say the least.'
Mr Clarke recently pledged that the government would not steer Britain's
economic recovery into a new boom and bust cycle.
However, Lord Lawson, in a lecture organised by the Social Market Foundation
and the London School of Economics, said: 'I have no sympathy whatever for
the more ambitious notion that the objective of macroeconomic policy should
be to iron out the business cycle.' Lord Lawson, Britain's longest-serving
postwar chancellor, until his resignation in 1989, said all attempts by
governments to steer economies 'along an impossibly straight line' by
macroeconomic policy had failed.
His comments angered the Treasury, but it declined to comment publicly.
However, in private senior officials suggested Lord Lawson was wrong to
argue that 'the government could not and would not end the boom-and-bust
cycle that had bedevilled past governments'.
Lord Lawson went on to say that recent events demonstrated the power of
financial markets to impose their will on national governments suspected of
financial imprudence.
Instead of focusing on the short-term vagaries of the business cycle, about
which policymakers could do very little, he urged the government to
concentrate on boosting long-term performance by improving the supply side
of the economy.
He suggested a significant extension of the UK family credit system to
provide top-up payments to all those in work on very low pay, fitting in
with a system of workfare  - making the payment of benefit conditional on
community work.
Lord Lawson also repeated his criticism of the government's determination
not to grant independence to the Bank of England.
'The half-way house alighted upon by the present government, of publishing
the minutes of the regular monetary meetings between the chancellor and the
governor, is an interesting innovation,' he said.
But when it came to raising interest rates, if the minutes represented an
honest account, they could have a detrimental effect on the credibility of
the authorities' decisions in the financial markets. That, he argued, would
outweigh any advantage derived from the new arrangement.

FT  21 JUN 94 / World markets fall sharply: Fears of further rise in US
rates - FT-SE 100 closes below 3,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
World bond and stock markets took a hammering yesterday as concern about
inflation and the direction of interest rates in the US and Germany
continued to upset investors.
Sentiment in Europe and Asia was depressed by falls in the US bond and stock
markets on Friday, which were prompted by a rise in the Commodity Research
Bureau index and in gold and oil prices. Those signs of inflationary
pressure, allied to a weak dollar, increased fears that the US Federal
Reserve might be forced to induce a further increase in interest rates.
The dollar turned in a weak performance overall again yesterday, finishing
lower over the day in New York at DM1.5995, more than 2 pfennigs off its US
close on Friday. In London, it had lost more than a pfennig on yesterday's
opening to finish at DM1.5986, bringing to more than 3 pfennigs its fall
since the Friday close in London.
It moved similarly against the Japanese currency, finishing at Y101.85 in
New York, after losing Y1.5 to Y101.97 in London.
Analysts said that no single factor was responsible for yesterday's bond and
equity declines. 'It's like Chinese water torture,' said Mr Edmond Warner,
head of strategy and economics at Kleinwort Benson. 'A drip, drip of poor
sentiment has accumulated to wear down the markets.'
Asian stock markets set the tone for the day with the Nikkei 225 index in
Tokyo falling 351.27 points to 21,152.03, and in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng
index dropped 115.78 points to 8,998.18.
In Europe, the German stock market suffered most with the DAX index plunging
81.9 points, or nearly 4 per cent, to close at 1,968.82. In Milan, shares
fell by 3.9 per cent. Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, postponed its
L1,500bn (Pounds 620m) rights issue after its share price fell by nearly 5
per cent.
The pan-European Eurotrack 100 index closed 41.97 points lower at 1,308.37,
a fall of 3.1 per cent. In London, the FT-SE 100 fell 85.3 points to 2,937.6
at the day's low but partially recovered to close at 2,971.1, down 51.8.
Wall Street also opened lower and by the close the Dow Jones Industrial
Average was down 34.88 at 3,741.90. Despite a rally in the afternoon,
European bond markets also suffered with UK, German and French bonds all
falling by more than three-quarters of a point.
Yesterday's declines in stock and bond markets come towards the end of a
half-year which has seen little but bad news for holders of paper assets. US
economic strength, allied to signs of recovery in Europe, have turned
investors' attention towards physical assets such as copper.
With commodity prices on the rise recently, bond markets have been hit by
inflation fears and by worries about the supply of bond issues from
governments and the private sector. Equity markets, which had risen
alongside bonds in 1993, have fallen with them in 1994. Yesterday, US
commodity prices showed a sharp decline, but Treasury bonds failed to rally
amid the dollar's continued weakness.
Many investors entered 1994 in optimistic mood about the prospect for lower
interest rates around the world. But first the Federal Reserve prompted a
rise in US interest rates in February and then the mood changed about the
likely direction of German rates.
Signs of economic recovery and still high money supply growth means that
many analysts now think German interest rates have reached a low, causing
investors to favour the D-Mark over the dollar.

FT  21 JUN 94 / Rail strike on after Acas talks fail to bring deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crisis on Britain's railways deepened last night after seven hours of
negotiations at Acas, the conciliation service, failed to break the deadlock
in the signal staff dispute.
Tomorrow's second 24 hour strike by signals staff will now go ahead, causing
massive disruption to the railway network.
Mr Vernon Hince, chief negotiator for the RMT rail union, said that
Railtrack, the state-owned railway infrastructure company, had not dealt
with the union claim for an 11 per cent interim payment for past
productivity improvements.
'No negotiations had taken place,' he said. 'We are no further forward than
we were 12 days ago.'
Railtrack chief negotiator Mr David Armstrong said the company had offered
the signal staff productivity pay rises of between 16 and 26 per cent which
would involve a new grading structures and acceptance of new working
practises.
The improvements would produce benefits worth Pounds 4.3m. This is addition
to the 2.5per cent pay offer already on the table.
The government had earlier appeared to be digging in for a lengthy
confrontation with the RMT as the last-ditch talks aimed at averting the
24-hour strike by signals staff began last night.
Ministers repeatedly attacked union's 'irresponsible' pay claim and, amid
angry Commons exchanges, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary,
condemned the strike planned for tomorrow. He warned that some passengers
would not return to the railway.
It also emerged that Mr MacGregor had established a committee of senior
ministers to monitor the strike by signals staff and guide the government's
response.
The committee met for the first time yesterday to discuss the prospects for
further railway chaos if Aslef, the train drivers' union, also decides to
strike.
The start of the Acas talks was delayed by 90 minutes when managers from
Railtrack arrived late.
In the Commons, Mr MacGregor said it was 'damaging to the railway for the
unions to undertake a series of strikes on an 11 per cent, no-strings pay
claim'.
He told MPs at question time that Railtrack wanted to achieve a settlement
based on talks on restructuring, which would be separate from the company's
2.5 per cent pay offer. Shouting down claims by Labour MPs that the
government had engineered the strike, Mr MacGregor said the restructuring
talks would have to offer 'value for money'.
Mr MacGregor dismissed claims that Railtrack had spent more on refurbishing
its headquarters than the estimated cost of settling the strike. Mr Frank
Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, said the dispute could have been
avoided if the government had not intervened to order Railtrack to withdraw
a proposed pay offer of 5.7 per cent.

FT  20 JUN 94 / UK Company News: ICL to spread the load of its pc
distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sluggish sales and frustration among customers have forced ICL, the UK-based
computer manufacturer owned by Fujitsu of Japan, to abandon a controversial
personal computer marketing strategy which left responsibility for pc
distribution throughout Britain in the hands of one company.
Technology, a wholly owned ICL subsidiary, has been relieved of its
responsibility for UK-wide pc distribution. A new sales and marketing
organisation, ICL Client-Server Systems Trading, is being established to
supply ICL pcs and servers (medium power computers) to distributors, dealers
and systems houses.
The abrupt change of strategy underlines the difficulties faced by full-line
computer manufacturers as they struggle with the economics of a market
dominated by inexpensive, low profit margin personal computers. Given
adequate technology, success in this market is tied to low cost distribution
to retailers, dealers and value-added resellers who add software and
services to the basic hardware.
ICL's answer was the purchase two years ago of Technology, then one of the
UK's largest pc distributors. It was a controversial decision because it
meant Technology would be distributing ICL pcs alongside competitive
products from International Business Machines, Digital Equipment, Compaq and
Sun. IBM, for a time, terminated its distribution contract. ICL's UK pc
market share, however, has remained stubbornly stagnant at about 5 per cent.
Mr Nigel Croisdale, who has been appointed to run the new distribution
company, believes it has to double its UK market share to be a credible
performer.
Giving Technology exclusive distribution rights put intolerable strains on
the company's physical ability to handle the volume of business.
'Frequently, we did not have enough inventory to meet demand. We were
failing to meet delivery dates and this upset customers,' Mr Croisdale said.
Technology took on the roles of agent, reseller and distributor which
significantly reduced the amount of credit in the system. This is important
for many resellers who depend on credit from their distributor.

FT  20 JUN 94 / SBC sacks 6 for unauthorised trades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss Bank Corporation has sacked three foreign exchange dealers and three
of their supervisors from its Zurich trading centre for unauthorised trades
that turned sour and could cost the bank up to SFr100m (Pounds 47m).
The punishment is unusually harsh and rapid for a big Swiss bank, but Mr
Georges Blum, appointed SBC chief executive a year ago, has made clear that
he aims to tighten management controls throughout the bank.
Swiss banks have had a reputation for handling staff lapses gently. SBC
acquired a reputation for slack management in the early 1990s when it got
caught out with large bad loans to several prominent collapsed groups,
including Maxwell, Olympia &amp; York, Omni and Polly Peck.
Mr Blum said sacking was the best way to handle infractions of dealing
limits set by the bank's directors. 'We have a big trading machine, and the
culture in that field is different from that in investment banking or
private banking,' he said.
It was not just the traders but also their supervisors who had to bear the
responsibility for limits being broken, he said.
The irregularities occurred in common spot and forward foreign exchange
contracts, not in the exotic future and option products which have been
attracting the concern of central banks and other regulatory authorities.
SBC is one of the largest and most successful international banks in the
derivatives field. The foreign exchange transactions in this instance were
made with a troubled Turkish bank a few months ago.
When it came time to settle the contracts, SBC fulfilled its payment
obligations. Because of the time difference between the two centres where
the deals were made, it was unaware that the Turkish bank would not complete
its side of the deals.
An SBC spokesman confirmed that the failed deals could cost the bank up to
SFr100m, but Mr Blum said it was too early to talk about specific figures.
The bank has been in discussions with the Central Bank of Turkey for two
months aimed at achieving a satisfactory settlement, he said.
Even in the worst case, the loss would not be particularly damaging to SBC.
It achieved profits before taxes and provisions last year of SFr4.5bn, and
indicated in April that it expected the business trend for the remainder of
this year to be satisfactory.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Media Futures: Designers fear Ladas on the superhighway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wanted: a top designer to champion the cause of excellence in commercial
multimedia. Fears are mounting among designers and creative directors that
the future of multimedia could be blighted unless programming quality is
improved. There are worries that the technologists, 'tekheads' in
mediaspeak, are dominating developments, while the designers, 'creatives',
languish on the sidelines, frightened and confused by the new possibilities.
The danger, according to Steve Hinchliffe of Module Communications and
multimedia adviser to the Designers &amp; Art Directors Association, is a
pedestrian approach: 'The information superhighway will be cluttered with,
figuratively speaking, Skodas and Ladas.'
He is dismayed that too many early attempts at multimedia - encyclopaedias
and catalogues on compact disc, for example - simply turned text on paper
into text on screen.
By comparison, the mail order retailer Freemans has been demonstrating a
multimedia version of its catalogue on interactive CD. It was developed with
the help of Barclays Bank multimedia unit (see accompanying article) and a
grant from the European Union.
In Freeman's multimedia catalogue, models display the clothes on offer in
full motion video; colours can be changed at the press of a button. The
discs have been distributed free to registered owners of CD-I players as
part of the trial.
The D &amp; AD's chairman, Anthony Simonds-Gooding of Still Price Lintas, and
Hinchliffe are campaigning to raise awareness of multimedia among its
members, arguing it must have a dramatic influence on the design community
in the next five years.
The Freemans catalogue demonstration was part of a multimedia show they put
on as part of this year's D &amp; AD festival of excellence held in London to
stimulate collaboration between tekheads and creatives.
'But it will have to be driven from the top,' says Simonds-Gooding. 'We need
a figurehead.'

FT  20 JUN 94 / Infrastructure investments worth Dollars 200bn bypasses
poor, report finds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank will report today that Dollars 200bn a year of donor nations'
infrastructure investments in the developing world have brought the benefits
of water, electricity and transport overwhelmingly to wealthier households
and bypassed the poor.
'In developing countries, the poor use kerosene or candles rather than
electricity for lighting, they rely on private vendors or public standpipes
rather than in-house connections for water supply, and they are infrequently
served by sewerage systems,' the bank notes in its annual world development
report.
In Ivory Coast, the bank found that among the richest 20 per cent of the
population, 62 per cent had access to public water supplies, 57 per cent to
sewers and 75 per cent to electricity. Among the poorest 20 per cent, only 2
per cent had access to public water, 3 per cent to sewers and 13 per cent to
electricity.
Mr Lewis Preston, World Bank president, says that 1bn people in the
developing world have no access to clean water and 2bn no access to
electricity.
Infrastructure investments have often failed to provide needed services, he
says, and the emphasis must now move from building more power plants and
waterpipes to making sure that existing infrastructure is properly
maintained and efficiently operated.
'Basic issues such as efficiency, maintenance and cost recovery have been
too often neglected,' he says.
The bank found that infrastructure subsidies in Bangladesh were six times as
large to the rich as to the poor.
Even though the poor usually consume water and use sanitation more than they
do electricity or telephone services, the bank found that the richest 20 per
cent received 1.3 times as much subsidy for water and sewer services as the
poor in Costa Rica, 1.5 times as much in Chile and 2.8 times as much in the
Dominican Republic.
The report recommends restructuring subsidies so that they reach the poor
more effectively: increasing block tariffs, for example, where a
particularly low 'lifeline' rate is charged for the first part of
consumption, perhaps 25 to 50 litres a person a day in water supply, and
higher rates for additional blocks.
'This block tariff links price to volume and it is more efficient at
reaching the poor,' the report says.
An even more useful approach can be to subsidise access to infrastructure,
rather than its price. Heavy initial connection charges are particularly
burdensome to the poorest sections of the population, and countries such as
Colombia have successfully targeted poorer households with subsidised
connection charges for water mains.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (9): Coal squeezed between
gas and nuclear - Britain is a battleground between rival fuels for power
generation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central European countries can only dream of the range of fuels available to
the UK for electricity generation.
But they are less envious of the political problems which result for a
government determined to let the market decide on which fuels should be
used.
There were times in 1992 and 1993 when the very survival of the government
seemed threatened by the furious reaction to its decision to close three
fifths of the nation's 50 remaining coal mines because of a lack of markets
for their products.
With that crisis apparently overcome, the government's difficulties in power
generation this year centre on a nuclear review which it promised five years
ago but has been reluctant to start.
It will have to deal with the demands of Nuclear Electric, which with
Scottish Nuclear provides virtually all of the UK's nuclear power, that it
be privatised and be allowed to build new power stations.
Meanwhile, the growth of the use of gas in power production is continuing.
Although changes in prices in the England and Wales power trading pool have
delayed the building of some stations, gas could take more than 30 per cent
of the market by the end of the century, compared with almost nothing in
1990.
Some forecasts see gas taking almost all of the market by the year 2001.
Many European countries would rule that out because of its implications for
security of supplies. The government shows no signs of doubt, saying that if
corrections are needed in the fuel supply balance then the market will have
plenty of time to make them.
Its confidence in its abilities to sort out any problems will have been
immeasurably boosted by its resolution of the coal closures crisis which was
politically adept.
With the closures programme now largely completed - at least while the
industry remains in state hands - Britain now has only 16 deep mines (three
fewer than were envisaged in its mishandled plan two years ago) aemploying
fewer than 10,000 men. That compares with 50 pits and 50,000 men two year
ago.
Ministers got away with it because their white paper of March 1993 appeared
to offer so much. They indicated that several hundred million pounds were
available to keep the mines open, but in the event almost nothing has been
paid out.
What the white paper did was to buy time. Since then a succession of pit
closures have been announced, but because they have closed in ones and twos
rather than in one large operation there has been far less publicity.
The government's defiance of public feelings about pit closures stems in
part from its determination to privatise an industry that it believes would
be much better run in the private sector. Privatisation is expected to be
completed later this year. At its previous size the industry would have been
unsellable; the markets were simply not there. The main reason was that the
two largest generators in England and Wales cut purchases from 65m tonnes in
1992-3 to 40m tonnes in 1993-4 and 30m tonnes for the following four years.
However, the government's argument that the tonnage decline was dictated by
the free market is not wholly convincing. The coal is being displaced mainly
by new gas plants which will produce electricity at higher prices than
existing coal stations.
The coal lobby argues that the 'dash for gas' is due to the way the
electricity industry was privatised, with the creation of just two large
power generators in England and Wales.
This would have been less harmful if the government had created vertically
integrated generating and distribution companies as it did in Scotland. But
in England and Wales, the 12 regional electricity distributors were
desperate to lessen their dependence on what they consider to be a duopoly
of the two generating companies.
Their participation in the dash for gas, in which they helped to build new
stations, was prompted by a desire for alternative supplies.
National Power and PowerGen were forced to join the gas stampede or see
their markets severely squeezed, the argument goes. In energy markets
nothing is ever simple. The coal lobbyists tend to forget that the switch to
gas is partly prompted by environmental considerations; gas emits much less
sulphur dioxide than coal and without it the UK would struggle to meet
internationally agreed pollution targets.
Nevertheless the government did no favours to the coal industry when it
decided to privatise it after completing a sale of the power industry with a
less than fully competitive structure.
But perhaps the biggest test of the government's free market principles will
come in its attitude to the nuclear industry both in this year's review and
over the next few years. If the electricity market was truly free then
Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear would be told that that they could
never build another nuclear station unless they could produce power from it
at fully competitive prices.
But that would probably mean the beginning of the end for the nation's
nuclear power industry, with two companies retaining an ever dwindling share
of the market as they decommission ageing stations. Nuclear Electric
acknowledged recently that it could only build Sizewell C, its second
2,600MW pressurised water reactor station in Suffolk, if the state provided
it with 'material support'.
That does not necessarily mean direct aid. It could, for example, be
achieved by the government agreeing to meet unforeseen decommissioning
costs. Or the government could decide to set aside a specific proportion of
the power generation market for the nuclear industry. Any form of support,
however, would require the government or consumers to give assistance that
they will not be providing to other fuels after 1998.
In the review and beyond, the government will face arguments from powerful
lobbies, including some of the country's largest companies who want a share
of power station contracts, that nuclear power generation should be
supported, and soon.
If Nuclear Electric is unable to start work on Sizewell C soon, the
expertise gained in building Sizewell B, its forerunner, would dissipate,
they say. They also argue that Britain would be unable to meet future
environmental targets on sulphur and carbon emissions.
If the government accepts these arguments it will be accused of abandoning
the free market principles it clung to in the coal debate. An inconclusive
result to the nuclear review seems likely.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (8): Bonanza raises hackles
 -British utilities face profiteering charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four years after the England and Wales electricity system was privatised,
the companies created for the state sell-off are in a state of flux.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, director general of the Office of Electricity
Regulation, is reviewing price controls which consumers say have allowed the
regional distribution companies to make excessive profits.
He is threatening tough action following charges that their prices and
profits are too high, sometimes blatantly so.
National Power and PowerGen, the generating companies carved from the
non-nuclear assets of the Central Electricity Generating Board, have also
been under the regulator's scrutiny following claims, particularly from
large customers, that they have too much influence over the market.
In this, say critics, the generators are assisted by a trading system, the
wholesale electricity pool, which constitutes one of the most complicated
and arcane markets in the world and is in need of serious reform.
The judge and jury on the charges is Professor Littlechild, the industry
regulator who was appointed earlier this year for a second five year term of
office.
He cleared the generators of abusing their power, but nevertheless struck a
deal to temper their strength.
He is also increasing pressure for reform of the trading pool. One
possibility is that companies will be allowed to bypass the pool when they
trade in electricity; existing rules mean all power must be traded through
the pool.
The pool is also conducting experiments to allow buyers of electricity a
greater role in price determination.
With so much change in the air other countries must be wondering whether the
UK experiment in electricity privatisation has gone wrong.
Not surprisingly the electricity companies deny this. They argue that the
changes are evolutionary rather than revolutionary and are refining a system
that has, after all, kept the lights on and has reduced prices in real terms
for all but the very largest companies.
Consumer groups dispute the claim of price reductions, pointing out that it
depends which date you take as the start of privatisation.
But there is grudging recognition that the industry is more efficient and
more service-oriented than it was before privatisation. Occasional calls for
renationalisation attract little support and the Labour Party would be
unlikely to make it a priority if it won the next general election.
However, few people would deny that the government committed errors when it
laid the groundwork for privatisation at breakneck speed in the late 1980s.
Most industry analysts believe that the CEGB's non-nuclear assets should
have been broken up into a greater number of smaller bundles than the two
chunks allocated to National Power and PowerGen.
Even ministers acknowledge this as a mistake, pointing out it was influenced
by the original plan to include the commercially unattractive nuclear
stations in the sale.
The reasoning was that the stock market would not buy small power companies
that included nuclear stations. In the end, the government was persuaded
that investors would not buy any nuclear stations, whatever the size of the
parent company, and they were kept in the state sector.
By then, however, it was too late to split up National Power and PowerGen
without abandoning the timetable for privatisation. It was left to Prof
Littlechild to sort out the subsequent problems, and this was what he
attempted to do in his settlement with them earlier this year.
The deal is that the generators will endeavour to sell off 5,000 to 6,000MW
of generating plant by the end of next year; until then they have agreed to
adopt policies which will lead to reducing prices in the electricity pool.
In exchange, Prof Littlechild agreed he would not refer the generators to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for at least two years. By then,
competition will have grown as independently-owned power plants come on
stream.
The deal satisfied few, other than the large users of electricity including
Imperial Chemical Industries, who buy their power supplies at prices
directly related to the pool price.
However, the vast majority of consumers are unaffected by short term pool
price changes since their supplies are covered by long term hedging
contracts. They were, therefore, indifferent to Prof Littlechild's
settlement with the generators.
Independent generation companies, however, complained that the price cap
would deter them from setting up new plants. Given that the deal was
supposed to foster competition, this is a serious charge.
Another problem is that the settlement may turn out to be merely a temporary
fix. It is far from certain that the generators will be able to find buyers
for their plant at the kind of prices that they consider acceptable.
And even if they do, the plant they keep will probably continue to set the
price in the electricity pool. It is this power to set prices that most
offends free market champions like Prof Littlechild.
Little wonder then that he is pushing for the pool to accept bypass
arrangements. The more trade occurs outside the pool - that is between a
generator and a customer - the less important its prices become. However,
securing the industry's agreement for bypass arrangements will not be easy.
Some companies including regional electricity companies argue that the pool
is effectively bypassed anyway because of the hedging arrangements. They are
concerned that formal bypass arrangements would make the pool even less
transparent and would produce little savings for consumers.
Concerned though the regional electricity companies are about pool reform,
their over-riding consideration this summer is the distribution review which
Prof Littlechild is conducting. Leaks of a letter from his office to the
companies earlier this summer suggested that the companies may have to
reduce distribution prices by up to 20 per cent next April. Future increases
would be limited to inflation minus 4 per cent.
Several of the companies are warning privately that unless Prof Littlechild
softens his line then they will take their case to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
Most analysts think the regulator will compromise and allow the companies a
return on their assets which they can present to shareholders as at least
reasonable.
Undoubtedly the excessively good times are over for the distribution
companies. But the party is not about to end.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (7): Poland freshens the
tainted air of freedom - The bid to clean up Cracow's power plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the elegant, cobbled streets in the heart of Cracow, people cannot see
the power plant that supplies their electricity. But on an overcast day,
they can certainly smell it. After the huge steel works located just outside
the town, Cracow's Heat and Power plant is the biggest polluter of the
district's air.
That is just one of the legacies of the past which the plant's managers are
now trying to tackle. However progress so far has been frustratingly slow,
stalled by repeated shifts in government policies on foreign finance and
privatisation.
Mr Krzysztof Ebro-Prokesz, the plant's strategy and implementation manager,
stresses that the plant's success in achieving its hopes 'is important for
the whole Polish energy sector. This plant is the pilot showing the way to
bring in capital to modernise the sector'.
It will, though, be a long haul. Demand for electricity is currently running
below 1986 levels because of the slump in industrial activity as the economy
restructures, although the plant's managers expect it now to climb steadily.
While pollution from the plant has improved during the slump, it will rise
again as output increases. So too will the costs of the plant's pollution
permits. In 1993, it paid 44bn zlotys in fees to local environmental
protection agencies for the right to release gases into the air.
The plant's main environmental concern, according to Mr Janusz Danko, in
charge of environmental protection, is nitrogen oxides, known collectively
as 'nox'.
The gases can cause breathing difficulties and contribute to acid rain.
Poland has agreed with European Union countries that it will reduce nox
emissions sharply by 1998. At Cracow, they are keen to install low-nox
burners which would cut emissions by up to half.
Sulphur emissions - the other big cause of acid rain - are less of a
concern, as the plant burns Polish coal which is low in sulphur by European
standards. The managers are consequently unwilling to invest in expensive
flue-gas desulphurisation equipment, of the kind now being fitted to many
power stations in Western Europe.
But these improvements - of output and cleanliness - are near-impossible
without restructuring and more finance. The plant has already spawned two
subsidiaries to look after maintenance and transport, as a first step in
reducing its labour force.
In 1992, the managers began to explore the possibility of World Bank
funding, but the bank wanted the plant itself to make a financial
contribution. The plant's original plans for a joint venture with a foreign
company were shelved when the government indicated that it preferred to sell
a stake in the company, in order to raise funds for the Treasury as well as
enabling a capital injection into the company.
Instead, the managers turned to possible foreign partners, including
Electricite de France (EDF). However, government officials have also
suggested that the local government could be a partner.
Decisions on the plant's future ownership have now been suspended until
after local government elections on June 19. The plant is not short of
plans, but until the government's stance on the industry becomes clearer,
the finance for modernisation is tantalisingly just out of reach.

living things - Pollution reduction remains a high but increasingly costly
priority
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
European countries find themselves in a quandary about how to limit the
environmental damage from electricity generation.
Power stations are one of the main causes of air pollution in Europe.
Moreover, they cause a diplomatically troublesome kind of pollution which
can travel thousands of miles across national boundaries. The Green Party in
Germany grew out of public rage that acid rain from abroad was withering
Germany's beloved forests. The surge in public support for environmental
campaigns in the late 1980s across much of Europe was also stimulated by the
1986 Chernobyl nuclear explosion in Ukraine.
Public concern has prompted many attempts at curbing pollution from
electricity generation. However, these initiatives have proved
controversial; even those governments which most fervently support controls
have also been reluctant to relinquish their right to set energy policy
without reference to their neighbours.
According to the European Commission, around two thirds of emissions of
sulphur dioxide in Western Europe come from power stations or domestic
heating. Power stations also pump out about a fifth of emissions of nitrogen
oxides in these countries.
Both 'sox' and 'nox', as these collections of gases are known, can cause
acid rain. They can retard plant growth, and cause skin and eye irritations
and breathing difficulties in people.
Power stations burning coal, oil and gas are also responsible for about a
third of the emissions of carbon dioxide, one of the main gases implicated
in the threat of global warming.
Most European countries have signed up to two main rafts of regulation to
tackle these threats. The Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution Convention,
drawn up in 1983, is a package of protocols directed primarily at sox and
nox. Countries have negotiated separately on each of these protocols.
In addition, at the end of last year, the European Union collectively
ratified the climate change convention agreed at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit.
Under the treaty, the EU must bring emissions of carbon dioxide back to 1990
levels in the year 2000. That will mean a cut of some 12 per cent on
projected levels, the Commission estimates.
European countries have assembled a range of tools to try and reach these
targets. To combat sulphur emissions some such as Germany, and to a lesser
extent the UK, have fitted power stations with flue gas desulphurisation.
Before the Rio summit, European Union countries also drew up proposals for
an energy tax of Dollars 10 a barrel of oil-equivalent, weighted towards
those fuels with highest carbon content. However, the proposals have stalled
because of worries about the impact on international competitiveness, and
about political controversy. The UK government, which last year walked into
one of its stormiest political rows when it imposed value added tax on
domestic heating fuel, has been particularly unwilling to contemplate a
further, Brussels-imposed hike in the price of fuel.
France, which generates more than two thirds of its electricity from nuclear
power, has also protested that the nuclear power should be exempt from the
tax as it does not emit carbon dioxide, sox or nox.
European Union countries have also drawn up an energy conservation programme
called SAVE - specific actions for vigorous energy efficiency. The programme
wants to urge higher energy efficiency standards on the building and car
industries. However, momentum behind these has also slowed, partly because
recession reduced the rate of construction and new design, Commission
officials suggest.
Despite those obstacles, there has been improvement on some of the fronts.
However, there are many signs that this is due to wider industrial changes,
rather than the success of the anti-pollution measures.
While EU data is incomplete, Commission figures show a steady decline in
sulphur emissions during the 1970s and 1980s, by roughly 20 per cent
overall. In its 1992 overview of the state of the environment in the EU, the
Commission comments that this fall is 'due mainly to the energy-saving
measures taken in response to the 1973 and 1978 oil shocks and industrial
restructuring' as well as to adoption of new anti-pollution regulations. It
notes that 'since the mid-1980s emissions have been falling at a slower
rate'.
Nox has proved a tougher battle. While measures to control pollution from
power stations and other industry have had some success, 'the reductions in
emissions .. are more than offset by the increases in the number of vehicles
on the road. The net result is that nox emissions are still rising in many
countries,' the report says.
While carbon emissions have been growing more slowly than expected, for
instance in the UK, this is largely due to recession, environmentalists
warn.
Commission officials suggest privately that further improvements may follow
that pattern: due less to specific measures than to structural changes
within Europe, such as east German modernisation, or the UK's switch from
coal to gas in power generation. Equally, future energy policy changes - for
example, if the UK decided to phase out nuclear power in the
recently-launched review of the industry - could counteract the effect of
measures to curb air pollution.
The environmental impact of electricity generation is likely to continue to
be politically contentious. But while there may well continue to be
environmental improvement, the driving force is likely to be the economic
and industrial changes in Europe as much as purely 'green' concerns.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Spain - Banking, Finance and Investment (11):
Goldman gets ready to harvest Spanish profits / Merchant banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As European economies begin to recover and as governments across the
continent launch privatisation programmes, US investment banks are ready to
make strong Euro-related profits. In Spain, 1994 already appears to belong
to Goldman Sachs for it has picked up most of the big domestic business that
was available in the first quarter of this year.
'It has the best people working the Spanish patch,' says a senior executive
of a European merchant bank. 'They are clever and they eat, sleep and dream
Goldman.' A review of the New York bank's progress suggests that its Spanish
team will not have space on its shelves to accommodate the tombstones it is
accumulating.
Success has inevitably bred criticism and envy. Goldman's Spanish team is
accused of being, on occasions, too aggressive in its pricing. European
rivals also say Goldman is benefitting from an unhealthy fascination for all
things American in investment banking.
There have been deals initiated by others that Goldman joined once they were
under way. 'They have a technique of wriggling their way into a business,'
says a domestic banker.
The weight attached to US banks may be unwarranted on a domestic level -
Spanish banks, with their huge retail networks, are capable of delivering an
impressive book - but it is justified by the growing trend in Spain towards
international offerings dominated by a US tranche.
In Spain Goldman has a track record with government-controlled companies
thanks to a trail-blazing 1987 listing in New York that it co-ordinated for
Telefonica, the telecommunications monopoly, and now it is making its mark
on the private sector.
In February Goldman Sachs acted as global co-ordinator to Fomento de
Contrucciones y Contratas (FCC), a leading and highly diversified
construction company that made a Dollars 350m equity offering, one of the
largest to date by a private domestic group.
The initial groundwork for the FCC offering had been conducted by Schroders
and when Goldman took on the global co-ordinator mandate the New York bank
was accused of aggressively pricing the construction group and blamed for
the offering's disappointing results outside Spain.
There were similar fears over pricing when Goldman worked its way on to an
April Dollars 280m equity offering by Continente, a hypermarket chain
controlled by France's Promodes group.
The offering was co-ordinated by Societe Generale and Continente brought
Goldman on to the team as co-lead manager in order to consolidate the US
book.
Goldman rejects the aggressive pricing criticism (FCC's share price has
since recovered to the levels that Goldman had set) and points to the
fast-growing Cortefiel retail clothing group as an example of its increasing
ability to manage smaller offerings for the private sector. Cortefiel, in
which Goldman Sachs has a small shareholding, has hired the US bank to
co-ordinate its long-awaited equity offering within the next six months.
The Cortefiel placement could net a comparatively modest Dollars 88m but it
should lead to business with similar family-controlled domestic groups in
the retail fashion business.
Like other investment banks, Goldman has its eyes on Inditex, a group which
owns a highly successful youth orientated high street chain called Zara.
Goldman meanwhile remains strong in its more familiar territory of large
offerings by public groups. Last month the New York bank co-ordinated a
global offering worth Dollars 1.3bn by Endesa, the large state-controlled
electrical utility.
Goldman had already guided Endesa on to the markets in its 1989 partial
privatisation and prior to May's equity offering, it had advised the utility
on close to Dollars 1bn worth of asset purchases from regional and small
Spanish generators. Goldman is now hoping to take on the year's other big
public equity deal, the Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars 2.2bn offering by the
Repsol oil and chemical group.
Repsol, like Endesa, is a longstanding client of the New York bank. Goldman
helped to take the oil group to the markets in 1988 in its first encounter
with foreign institutions and it was its global co-ordinator in a second
major Repsol international offering last year.
Goldman was also on familiar territory when in late April it advised Pedro
Domecq, the Spanish-Mexican drinks group, on its Dollars 1.1bn sell out to
the UK's Allied Lyons. The previous big drinks sector disposal in Spain, the
1990 takeover by Guinness of the domestic Cruzcampo beer group, also had
Goldman advising the Spanish seller.
Together with the traditional business, at least one interesting innovation
has taken place. Earlier this year Goldman arranged Dollars 132m worth of
financing for a Barcelona city council hydraulic services company that is
branching into water treatment.
Finessing a loan structure that has been practised in the US and was being
introduced for the first time in Europe, the New York bank guaranteed the
financing with the future water cannon that the company will impose on
Barcelona consumers.
Why is Goldman so far ahead in Spain? One reason is that it entered forcibly
in the late 1980s when government-controlled groups started tapping the
markets. Its Wall Street listing for Telefonica attracted solid clients such
as Repsol and Endesa.
These relationships, with its analysis and distribution muscle and follow-up
expertise have served Goldman extremely well. 'Very few big deals are
decided on fees,' says a senior member of the US bank's Spanish team.
The existance of well established clients in what is essentially a recurring
business is, however, only part of the answer. Goldman, at least in Spain,
has provided continuity by keeping the same close-knit team working together
for more than five years.
It has also invested strongly in a 'door-opener' in the shape of former
junior economy minister Mr Guillermo de la Dehesa, the chief executive of
Banco Pastor, who also serves on Goldman's advisory board. A rival US bank,
worried that it was slipping in Spain, recently sent one of its most
experienced officers to Madrid with the mission of 'finding a de la Dehesa'.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Spain - Banking, Finance and Investment (10): A
flush of Euro-funds / Spain is attracting large amounts of capital
investment from the EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A visitor who ventures out of the urban environments of a Madrid or a
Barcelona and takes to the Spanish byways will soon come head on with the
circular constellation on a blue background that denotes European
Union-inspired bounty.
Anybody that is considering financial projects in Spain should first take
aboard the fact that the country is a prime target for massive capital
investment funds that, routed from Brussels, fall on the Spanish plain like
manna from the sky.
There is a growing business among those who match available funds with
borrowers and there is also increasing expertise among those potential
private sector investors who track the route blazed by Brussels' Ecus.
At the begining of this month the European commission approved structural
funds worth Ecu26.3bn for Spain between 1995 and 1999.
This sum represented more than half the total structural funds approved for
all the other 11 European Union members and it was more than double the
funding that Spain's regions received between 1989 and 1993.
Given such Brussels largesse it is not surprising that Spain should also be
the largest borrower from the Luxembourg-based European Investment Bank
(EIB).
Last year EIB loans to Spain totalled Ecu4bn, a figure that was 44 per cent
up on Spain's 1992 borrowing and which represented 22.6 per cent of the
Ecu17.7bn loans made by the Luxembourg institution to all of the EU members.
Sir Brian Unwin, EIB's chairman, claimed that the financing facilities
routed by the bank to Spain in 1993 represented the biggest ever loan total
made available to an individual EU member in a single year.
The flush of Euro-funds into Spain is held up with pride by the Madrid
government as a prize won by the negotiating skills of prime minister Felipe
Gonzalez in successive European summits and as a tribute to the Spanish
contingent's ability to drive a hard bargain in Brussels.
There are some intelligent complaints being made about the Ecu flow, notably
those that are voiced by economics Professor Pedro Schwartz of Madrid
University, an acerbic deregulation lobbyist and member of that rare breed,
the Spanish Eurosceptic.
Mr Schwartz likens the onset of funds to Faust's pact with Mephistopheles
and argues that the sudden arrival of a lot of structural funds to improve
Spain's infrastructure will not necessarily make Spain less poor.
A visitor to Spain cannot help noticing that while the Euro-financed highway
schemes might have ensured quick journeys between the provincial capitals,
they have also succeeded in by-passing largish towns between the departure
and destination points.
Service industries in such towns used to earn a great deal of income from
their proximity to the former national roads that the new beltways have
replaced.
The less acceptable face of the EU's lavish funding to Spain is that it
engenders a passive society. Because Europe is picking up the tabs for much
of Spain's infrastructure, the Madrid government is able to 'afford' an
unemployment level of 34 per cent of the working population in Andalucia.
The southern swathe of the country, Andalucia is the equivalent of Italy's
Mezziogiorno and it is also the chief political base of the ruling socialist
party.
Some 80 per cent of Andalucia's jobless population is now covered by
unemployment benefits.
Thirty years ago when there were no such unemployment benefits in General
Franco's Spain, and long before structural funds had been thought of and the
EIB created, Andalucia's jobless emigrated to work in the Common Market from
where they sent home remittances, saved and eventually returned home to set
up businesses.
Whatever the political, economic and even moral arguments that might
surround the sort of aid that the Madrid government receives, the fact is
that Spain is an ideal recipient for such funds.
It is a big country by European standards and it a poor one by that same
yardstick. Spain has reached an intermediate level of development that
requires the sort of specialised capital investment that the EIB provides
and it has the political clout that carries weight when the share-out of the
EU's structural funds is debated.
Spanish officials have learnt the tricks of the borrowing trade and they
have become adept at exploiting what in the EIB's case is a demand-driven
business.
'The Spaniards are really looking for finance,' an EIB official conceded.
There is also a great deal that requires financing in Spain. The Spanish
recipients of the EIB loans range from small and medium-sized companies
across the economic spectrum, to environmental initiatives, particularly in
the water treatment sector which has major domestic deficiencies, and to the
big infrastructure projects that deal with road and railroad transportation
and electric cabling.
It is no less true that the EIB is well below the ceiling it has set itself
for loans and has considerable room for providing greater financial
assistance in the years ahead.
Loans this year to Spain, judging from those already signed and from those
that are in the pipeline, are likely to be similar to 1993's record total.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Spain - Banking, Finance and Investment (12): In
the limelight / Profile of Argentaria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the game of Spanish banking, the players are waiting for the new arrival
to make the next move. Argentaria - the group which came on to the scene
three years ago, combining state banking operations and competing on an
equal footing with the main private-sector banks - was bitterly disappointed
by its defeat in April in the bidding to take over Banesto and equip itself
with a comprehensive branch network.
It had done more than its rivals to try to justify its participation in the
Banesto auction - controversial because of the government's role as
Argentaria's majority shareholder. But it last in the contest, outbid by
Banco Santander by a margin of almost 35 per cent.
The finance ministry was anxious that the bank should not do a bad deal. For
Francisco Luzon, Argentaria's chairman, the big constraint was the risk of
losing credibility, less than a year after launching Argentaria on the stock
markets. His team has since been reviewing the group's 'strategic focus',
keen to strengthen its international side but also to reinforce its retail
network of 1,500 Spanish branches, adding perhaps a further 500.
Argentaria is the prominently displayed brand-name of the more prosaically
entitled Corporacion Bancaria de Espana. Set up in 1991 it has majority
control of Banco Exterior de Espana, the large quoted bank which has
traditionally been the channel for Spanish export credit but lost its
monopoly in 1985.
Under the reorganisation, Banco Exterior absorbed the state's Banco de
Credito Industrial. Other state interests brought into Argentaria were
leading mortgage specialist, Banco Hipotecario; the post office savings
bank, Caja Postal; and two institutions dedicated respectively to the food
sector and local authorities, Banco de Credito Agricola and Banco de Credito
Local.
Because of the deficiencies of each inherited elements, managers jokingly
referred to them as 'four cripples and a one-eyed man'.
The group has since established itself among the country's top banks with
more than 500,000 shareholders and pre-tax profits rising 40 per cent over
the past two years. Last year it made two share flotations in six months,
both heavily oversubscribed, reducing the state's holding to just over 50
per cent and bringing in Pta296bn to the treasury.
A third stage of privatisation is planned later this year or early in 1995.
Mr Luzon's vision is of a modern, innovative bank able to hold its own among
the top Spanish groups, with a state holding of 20-25 per cent, with 30 per
cent of its business abroad and a strong presence in nearby markets of
Portugal, southern France and North Africa.

Domestic volumes dominate / A large stock of Spanish funds is emerging that

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
It was not surprising that Madrid's Bolsa index should have shot up to
record highs in January for the equity markets were performing strongly
almost everywhere. What was extraordinary about the gains in Madrid was that
the Bolsa's rally was driven by domestic institutions and not, as is usually
the case, by foreign investors.
To a great extent the foreign institutions had turned bearish about Spain at
the beginning of the year because they believed that the Banesto crisis,
which prompted the intervention of the Bank of Spain, would send tremors
through the financial system.
By a happy coincidence, domestic funds were able to take positions normally
occupied by the foreigners because they were growing strongly and also
because they were in the process of switching part of their fast growing
investment portfolio from fixed income investment to equities.
A footnote to the history of the Spanish stock markets in the first half of
1994 would read that non-residents, who had traditionally been so opportune
with their Bolsa investments, had for once missed their chance. By the time
the Banesto-induced panic was over, thanks to a support operation which
reflected great credit on Spain's financial institutions, the markets were
down and it was too late to reap profits.
The main market theme in the first half of this year is that the arrival, in
large volumes, of domestic funds on to the Bolsa constituted a major
development that both complemented and rivalled in importance the
'mini-bang' that the Madrid market underwent in the late 1980s.
The Bolsa reforms ushered in a stock exchange regulator, securities houses
to replace individual brokers and a continuous market. What the onset of
funds has done is to broaden the market and to provide it with an acceptable
domestic support base that had been lacking in the past.
But the sudden appearance of a domestic funds-driven Bolsa has implications
that go beyond the Spanish market's increased liquidity. The build up of
funds through the big branch networks owned by the domestic banks and
savings banks in Spain, together with the management of the funds by these
institutions and their investment by the in-house brokers of the same banks
and savings banks, forms an arguably incestuous relationship that might
raise eyebrows in the City of London.
'Warburg's Securities has to be more competitive than any one else in order
to get the business from Mercury Asset Management,' says a UK-trained
executive at a Madrid broking house. 'That doesn't happen here.'
Argentaria, the state-controlled banking corporation, for example, has been
capturing a big slice of the public sector's pension funds. Is this because
Argentaria is particularly good at managing funds or is the business merely
oiled by the mutual goodwill that exists in the old state company tie
network?
The traditionally strong bonds between Spain's main financial institutions
and domestic industry additionally begs the question of what sort of equity
investments the in-house brokers are likely to make.
It would be surprising if funds managed by investment units at Banco
Santander and at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the two biggest players in the
sector, as well as those managed by Banco Central Hispano, Argentaria and
the other leading banks, were not overweighted in the stocks controlled or
favoured by those same institutions.
No doubt over time a sophisticated market will emerge in which investors
will demand, and get, greater transparency, will pick and choose their funds
and will closely monitor their performance. For the present the big
institutions have it all their own way as they aggressively capture clients
through their networks and channel the resulting funds into their broking
units.
What is not in doubt, however, is the potential impact of the domestic
institutions as they flex their muscles in their own backyard. January and
February, when the presence of foreign institutions in Spain was noticeable
by its absence, provided a good indicator of what can happen when the
home-side bulls are running. During those two months the volume traded on
Madrid market increased by 122 per cent against January and February 1993.
Domestic funds invested an estimated Pta193bn in the Bolsa during January, a
huge sum considering that the average daily volume during the 20 trading
days that month was Pta42.2bn.
Two trends in Spain's fund industry have become evident in the past month.
First, it has grown rapidly thanks to tax incentives and to strong marketing
by the banking networks and also because recessionary periods spur the
public to save in instruments that will earn them most.
Secondly, the accelerated drop in interest rates have undermined the
traditional attraction in Spain exerted by fixed-interest investment in
general and government paper in particular. Spanish fund managers, always
extremely cautious about equities, have begun to look at the Bolsa with an
unprecedented enthusiasm.
During 1993 the total volume of mutual funds under management in Spain grew
from Pta6,627bn to Pta10,709bn, a rate of expansion that equalled the
accumulated growth of domestic funds in the previous two years. Just as
important as the growth was the changing investment trend. The CNMV, the
Bolsa's regulatory commission, estimates that in the course of last year the
percentage of total funds invested in equities rose from little more than 3
per cent to more than 5 per cent.
This year the pattern is one of more of the same; larger funds and
proportionally increased investment on the Bolsa.
The funds topped Pta12.00bn at the end of May and are forecast to total some
Pta14,500bn at year's end. The CNMV estimates that by the end of this year
the percentage of funds under management invested in equities could double
last year's figure to represent between 8 per cent and 10 per cent. Ahorro
Corporacion Financiera, the broking arm of a group of savings banks,
believes the year-end percentage on the Bolsa will be closer to 7 per cent.
There are two lessons that non-resident watchers of the Madrid market should
learn. One is that the Bolsa, for all its volatility, looks to be a more
mature stock exchange with a sounder liquidity than at any stage in the
past. The other is that for the first time there is the makings of a serious
volume of Spanish funds that can be tapped by outsiders.
The CNMV revealed in its annual report this year that domestic funds had
increased the weighting of foreign equities and foreign fixed income in
their investment portfolios during 1993 from 2.2 per cent to 5.7 per cent.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (4): Forward from 1935 -
Deregulation knocks at Germany's door
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Germany takes over the presidency of the European Union on July 1, Mr
Gunter Rexrodt, the country's economics minister, will try to place the
liberalisation and deregulation of Germany's energy sector high on the
agenda.
But the chances for pushing through any deregulation of the sector before
Germany's federal elections next October are slim. Mr Rexrodt conceded as
much during the recent congress of the Free Democrats, the junior partner in
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union-led coalition. 'I really
do not expect to get these measures through until after the election,' said
Mr Rexrodt.
Mr Rexrodt had already set out his plans for a new energy law in a bill
issued last October. It sets out to replace a law which has been on the
statute books since 1935.
Its aim is to allow Third Party Access (TPA)throughout the electricity - and
gas - sector.
Among other things, it states that operators of the electricity grid, upon
whom third parties are dependent for transportation, must not unreasonably
hinder those seeking contracts for TPA. However, any refusal to grant TPA is
permitted if the capacity for TPA is insufficient, if no appropriate
compensation for TAP is offered, or if the secure supplies to other
customers of the operators of the lines is deemed impossible through TPA.
Over the past few months, opposition to the Rexrodt paper has hardened. The
economics ministry itself is split. Mr Dieter von Wurzen, a state secretary,
is opposed to TPA on the grounds that it should be based on reciprocity by
other European Union countries, while Mr Johnann Eekhoff, a state secretary
and Mr Martin Cronenberg, an energy expert at the ministry, are anxious to
push through liberalisation.
The response from the environment ministry has been lukewarm. Officials
argue that the draft law does not go far enough in introducing environmental
improvements.
But it is the reaction from industry which holds the key to the success or
failure of any plans by the federal government to deregulate the energy
sector.
The umbrella body for big industrial energy users (Verband der Industriellen
Energie und Kraftwirtschaft, or VIK) has welcomed the proposals. This is
understandable. The organisation's current president is the chemicals
sector, including BASF, one of Germany's largest chemical groups, which has
long campaigned for cheaper electricity and gas prices. 'The electricity and
gas prices for industry in Germany are between 30 and 40 per cent, and in
some extreme cases, 100 per cent higher than in other European countries,' a
VIK paper recently noted, adding that the industry requires greater
competition.
Indeed, unlike some other European Union countries, Germany has no single
formal regulatory body overseeing electricity pricing. Distribution
companies - that is, the regional utilities - must agree their tariffs with
local municipalities, which in many cases, own part of the distributors.
Tariffs are normally based on the operational costs of the distributors.
Despite the high cost of energy, analysts at the German association of
German gas and water users (BGW) continue to oppose many aspects of the
Rexrodt proposals. A recent paper issued by BGW argued that the introduction
of TPA and the abolition of the principle of exclusive service areas will
create 'inequality of opportunity'.
It added that foreign gas companies would be able to supply the German
market while foreign markets would remain inaccessible to German gas
businesses. It added that TPA would lead to the expropriation of private
investment and, more importantly, the obligation to connect customers and
guarantee supply could no longer be met.
The BGW's views have been reinforced by the association of municipal
undertakings (Verband kommunaler Unternehmen, or VKU). Under present
legislation, the municipalities have the exclusive right to issue concession
contracts. If TPA were introduced, revenues earned from these concessionary
payments would be reduced. As it stands, the municipalities receive about
DM5bn each year in concession payments which help to finance public
services.
Yet the Rexrodt plan would give the municipalities the right to choose which
utilities supply its customers, or even take over the supply themselves by
buying the distribution grid. However, Germany's large utility companies,
which are grouped under the VDEW, the trade association which represents
them, would perhaps lose out. Currently, they enjoy the principle of
demarcation, which effectively amounts to a monopolistic structure.
The trade unions, particularly IG Bergbau und Energie, which represents the
mining and energy workers, also oppose the Rexrodt paper because social
services on the municipal level would be cut, and TPA and greater
competition could undermine Germany's heavily subsidised hard coal industry.
German coal prices are considerably higher than world coal prices. The
latter cost about DM80 a tonne, but electricty companies in Germany pay
DM280 per tonne for German coal in order to protect the industry. The
electricity utilities are allowed to collect a levy from the consumer,
called the Kohlpfennig, which helps to compensate them for using the high
cost of coal.
Despite this opposition, there is a growing consensus that eventually
Germany must open up the energy sector. For one thing, the Kohlpfennig is
supposed to be reduced or even phased out by 1996. In addition, many
concession rights for towns and cities expire by 1996, raising the prospect
of much greater competition in these sphere.
As an energy expert at BGW explained, 'we are already allowing in
foreigners. If we could get reciprocity, we would move ahead. But we cannot
go it alone. But we know we are under pressure.'

FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (5): Speed and diversity -
Portugal races to catch up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal is power hungry. Electricity consumption has risen at more than
twice the average European Union rate over the past decade as a result of
strong economic growth. Demand is forecast to increase significantly faster
than in most western European countries - at an annual rate of 2.5 to 3 per
cent to the end of the century and by 1.5 to 2 per cent a year from 2000 to
2020.
The electricity sector is being radically restructured in an effort to
satisfy this growing demand in the most cost-effective way possible for a
country with few energy resources of its own. The overriding aims of reform
are to reduce Portugal's heavy dependence on imported oil by altering the
energy mix and to improve efficiency through liberalisation and
privatisation.
'Restructuring is aimed at introducing flexibility, rationality and
competition into the power section to provide consumers with lower prices
and better services,' says Mr Joaquim Silva Correia, chairman of
Electricidade de Portugal (EDP), the state-owned power producer and
distributor. Electricity prices for industrial consumers in Portugal have
been reduced by 31 per cent in real terms since 1987 but remain the third
highest in the EU.
Portugal's energy imports, of which oil accounts for more than 90 per cent,
cost Es330.9bn in 1993, representing 8.9 per cent of total imports and 2.8
per cent of gross domestic product. This marks an improvement from a decade
ago when energy imports were the equivalent of 10.5 per cent of GDP. But
Portugal's reliance on imported oil is still so strong that a fluctuation of
one dollar in the price of a barrel has far-reaching effects on the economy.
Oil accounts for more than 70 per cent of primary energy consumption and
domestic resources, mainly hydroelectric power and biomass, only 12 per
cent. Diversification away from oil is being focused on natural gas and
coal. Portugal, the only EU country without a natural gas supply, is due to
lift 2,500m cubic metres a year from 1996 from the planned Maghreb-Europe
pipeline.
Officials forecast natural gas will account for 5-7 per cent of primary
energy use by 2000, subsequently climbing towards the EU average of 14 per
cent if it remains more competitive than coal. Coal is forecast to grow to
20 per cent of primary energy use from a current 16 per cent.
Portugal plans to expand its existing power generating capacity of 7,200MW
to 8,800MW by 2000. A natural gas-fired plant will account for 900MW of new
capacity, a coal-fired plant for 300MW, hydroelectric plants for 350MW and
wind-powered generation for 50MW.
Liberalisation of the electricity sector began tentatively in 1988 with
legislation permitting small-scale private production in the form of
mini-hydro plants. Until then power production had been an EDP monopoly.
The scheme proved a runaway success and EDP was flooded with applications to
build. Officials now estimate the potential of mini-hydro production could
exceed 250MW by the year 2000.
Portugal took its first step towards large scale private production in 1991
when a consortium led by Siemens of Germany won a contract to build and
operate a 900MW natural gas-fired power plant near Oporto in northern
Portugal. The plant is due to come on line in 1997.
In December 1993, EDP sold two 300MW coal-fired units at Pego, 130kms
northeast of Lisbon, to a group led by National Power of the UK. The first
unit began production in March 1993, the second is due to start in October
1995. Two further 300MW units may eventually be added.
The sector will make a further leap towards liberalisation in July when EDP
is to be unbundled into 10 separate companies. This will be followed by the
partial privatisation of power production and distribution. New companies
will be created to manage power production and the high-tension transmission
network. Distribution will be split among four regional companies. Five
service companies will also be formed. A holding company will coordinate
operations and strategy.
The new production company, Companhia Portuguesa de Producao de
Electricidade (CPPE), will take over all EDP's power plants, which are
estimated to represent about half the company's net assets of Es2,247bn.
Between 20 and 25 per cent of CPPE's capital is to be privatised by
mid-1995. Further tranches may subsequently be sold but the state will
retain a majority holding. The regional distribution companies will also
privatise a minority of their capital over the medium term.
But liberalisation will not go as far as the UK model. An independent
planning body is to be set up to determine policy on the building of new
power plants. 'Portugal is too small and too dependent on hydroelectric
production, which varies according to rainfall, to allow the market to
decide what plants are built,' says Mr Silva Correia. One of the new body's
first decisions will be whether the first large power plant to be built in
the 21st century should be fired by coal or natural gas.
A second independent body will be created to oversee prices and competition.
One of its main tasks will be to ensure that Rede Electrica Nacional (REN),
the new company that is to manage the national grid, buys from producers
strictly on a basis of lowest price first. Initially, all power producers
will have binding power purchase agreements with REN. But over the medium
term other producers will be allowed to produce directly for independent
customers, paying for use of the national grid if required. Regional
distributors will be permitted to purchase up to 15 per cent of their supply
from such producers.
'Our aim is to make a gradual transition from a vertically-integrated sector
to a more liberalised framework and to transfer the efficiency gains to
consumers in the form of lower tariffs,' says Mr Silva Correia. 'But the
special characteristics of Portugal mean that we cannot go as far as
countries such as Britain on the road to a free-market.'

FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Spain - Banking, Finance and Investment (6):
Foreign funds flow in / Takeovers are changing direction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two disposals in the past year - the sale of a 15 per cent stake held by the
March family in the construction and chemical company Uralita and the sale
by Banesto of its 34 per cent stake in the Acerinox steel producer - suggest
a new trend in inward investment.
In the past a Spanish company was simply the object of an outright foreign
takeover. In 1991, for example, Petromed, a Banesto-controlled oil company,
was sold to British Petroleum, and in 1992 J Bibby &amp; Sons, the UK subsidiary
of South Africa's Barlow Rand, bought Finanzauto, a construction services
group in which the March family had formerly been a major equity holder.
Large takeovers are far from over. This April, following the lead of
Guinness' 1990 takeover of Cruzcampo, Spain's leading brewery, Allied Lyons
acquired the Pedro Domecq wine firm, the last big domestically-owned sherry
producer.
But the Uralita and Acerinox disposals represented a new development. In
both cases fresh capital flowed into the Spanish companies in the shape of
foreign institutions. Mostly UK-based institutions replaced the March
family's holding - Corporacion Financiera Alba - in Uralita and mostly
largely US institutions bought the Banesto equity in Acerinox. The existing
management remained in place at Uralita and at Acerinox.
During recessionary cycles, this type of inward investment is common in
markets that have achieved a high level of maturity. As rates come down and
the markets become bullish, institutional investors are willing to pay a
market-driven value for equity that is above the conventional acquisition
price in an industrial takeover.
In Spain this is new because it was only at the end of the 1980s that the
Madrid market began to take on the sort of strength and liquidity that
attracts long-term investment from foreign institutions. In the early 1980s,
when the economy also dipped into recession, the foreign funds option was
precluded by the narrowness of the domestic stock exchange.
'For the first time we were able to employ Anglo-Saxon practices and seek
out institutions,' says Mr Santiago Eguidazu, head of corporate finance at
AB Asesores, the Madrid firm which advised and lead managed the Uralita
transaction.
Cyclically-exposed Spanish companies in need of fresh capital, such as
Uralita and Acerinox, are for the first time able to tap foreign
institutions that can be counted upon to anticipate the end of a
recessionary cycle.
Uralita, with its odd mix of construction and PVC-weighted chemicals, is in
addition a difficult takeover target. It would have to be broken up in order
to attract separate industrial buyers and even then it would have to await a
sustained economic upturn that would permit the appearance of potential
cash-flow rich acquirers.
Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management owns 10 per cent of Uralita's equity, having
recently increased its position in the company, and the Royal Bank of
Scotland controls almost 9 per cent of the stock including a 5 per cent
stake owned by Scottish Widows.
Foreign funds now control the 34 per cent of Acerinox equity formerly owned
by Banesto. The US investment bank JP Morgan, advised Banesto bank on the
sale of a 25 per cent of its equity, placing it in the US and AB Asesores
subsequently placed a further 9 per cent.
The Uralita investment is instructive because the company smoothed the path
towards the final deal and, by doing so, pointed the way for companies
seeking similar relationships with foreign institutions.
What Phillips &amp; Drew and Scottish Widows wanted and obtained from Uralita
was the right to name independent directors with a brief to exercise a broad
supervision of the company's management as well as a close control over
certain areas, such as the controversial issue of the board's remuneration.
These directors - there are three, all senior officers of big Spain-based
firms - maintain a fluid relationship between the Uralita's executive
management and the shareholder institutions that they represent. Such a role
is new to Spain.
'The funds can have a shot at influencing management decisions,' said a
banker close to the company. 'They can make telephone calls that carry clout
and they almost certainly won't have to make angry scenes at the AGM.'
In fact the institutions should have little cause for worry about their
investments in Uralita and in Acerinox. Both are on course to become the
sort of turnaround stories that gladden a fund manager's heart.
At Uralita, the effect of an intensive restructuring programme which was
started in 1991 is begining to be felt. Sales volumes in the group's main
division, refurbishing and housing, are up and PVC prices, the mainstay of
its chemical unit, are recovering strongly.
The group could break even this year - following losses of Pta7.5bn (Dollars
55m) in 1993 - pay a dividend next year and post profits of some Pta9bn in
1996.
Acerinox reports similar progress for its stainless steel business. The
company's net profits of Pta7.5bn last year are estimated to rise to
Pta10.7bn this year and are forecast to climb to Pta16.2bn in 1996.
Acerinox's board has approved a Pta6bn investment to raise its production
capacity and earnings per share are forecast to stand at Pta1,676 in 1996
against last year's Pta785.

Having second thoughts / Causes celebres, Suzuki
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anti-Japanese graffiti on the walls of the southern Spanish town of Linares
bears witness to one of the bitterest stories of foreign investment in Spain
over the past decade.
'On terms like these, we want no Japanese,' reads one of the milder slogans
outside the factory gate of Santana Motor, subsidiary of Suzuki.
The embattled car company has provided the most dramatic example of a
multinational venture having second thoughts about its investment in Spain.
The case is all the more telling because Suzuki's arrival on the scene is
relatively recent. Like Nissan, which also has problems at its Motor Iberica
subsidiary in Barcelona, it began producing in Spain shortly before the
country's accession to the European Union, with a view to creating a
competitive export base.
By suspending payments to creditors in February and proposing drastic job
cuts, Santana's Japanese management provoked an explosive reaction in the
Linares region, which is heavily dependent on the factory and its 30-odd
supplier companies.
Demonstrators mobbed the Japanese embassy in Madrid promising 'dynamite next
time'. The Spanish government, seriously concerned that other Japanese
investors would take fright, launched a propaganda campaign in Tokyo to try
to limit the damage.
Many of the 40 or 50 Japanese executives and technicians at Santana are
thought to have moved to the capital or to have left the country. Amid
general confusion in the industry about the company's intentions, the
management has repeatedly declined requests for interviews.
Three months after the suspension of payments the Socialist regional
government persuaded a reluctant Suzuki to back a milder cutback plan,
involving 900 instead of the 2,400 exmployees instead of the 1,500
originally proposed by the company, with the promise of a credit package.
The plan is an effort to buy time while a desperate search goes on for a new
owner.
The regional authorites are understood to have trawled the world's motor
companies for interest. Only two - BMW-Rover, which has a historical link
with Santana, and Hyundai of South Korea - are thought to have shown any
willingness even to look into it.
In its origins, Santana is typical of industrial ventures set up in the
Franco period to gain access to a protected market. Starting in the
mid-1950s, it made parts for farm machinery, gearboxes for 2CV Citroen cars,
and then Land Rovers under licence, selling to the Spanish and Latin
American markets, with the UK company as a shareholder.
But in the early 1980s Land Rover excluded the Spanish plant from its plans
for new models. From 1984 the factory began making Suzuki four-wheel-drive
runabouts as well, and in 1990 Land Rover sold its last shareholding,
leaving the Japanese company in effective control. However, Suzuki's
commitment was also lukewarm. Its current 84 per cent stake came by default,
because other shareholders would not subscribe to much-needed new capital.
'There has been no big investment in technology, either by the British or
the Japanese,' says Antonio Fernandez Siles, chairman of the works council,
recognising the difficulty of competing with other manufacturing sites.
Suzuki figures show labour costs at Linares accounting for almost 20 per
cent of sales compared with 7 per cent in Japan.
In the past three years the Spanish subsidiary showed losses of Pta21bn and
during this year's conflict it is reckoned to have been losing money at a
rate of Pta30m a day.
The irony is that Santana has become more of a household name in Spain the
past four months, because of the protest movement against job losses, than
it ever was because of the vehicles produced at the factory.

Closure costly / Causes celebres, Gillette
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After 27 years making razor-blades in Spain, Gillette of the US decided to
close its factory. Three months later, the Spanish authorities have yet to
accept the logic of it.
Gillette's announcement sparked a controversy out of proportion to the size
of the plant, just outside Seville, where the workforce had already shrunk
to less than 250.
There were three factors behind this. One was that Gillette was sacrificing
Seville in order to concentrate production for the European market in the UK
and Germany - much like Hoover's fiercely-contested decision last year to
move vacuum-cleaner production from Dijon in eastern France to Scotland.
Secondly, the closure announcement coincided with pre-election tensions in
the ruling Socialist party's stronghold of Andalucia, a region with a
fragile and under-developed industrial sector and high unemployment. The
Gillette workers' cause was immediately linked with that of the 'Santaneros'
at Suzuki's threatened Santana subsidiary. Both cases involve facilities
which flourished at a time of high import barriers but which have not been
adapted to meet the competitive demands of an open European market.
The difference between them - and the third factor fuelling the row - is
that Gillette has up to now been profitable. Alberto Morales, general
manager of the Seville subsidiary, says Gillette simply does not need the
factory. The technology there is obsolete, and its production can easily be
taken over by the other plants without expanding their capacity. 'The
machines we have here won't go to England or Germany because they have
enough,' he says.
Both the Madrid government and the regional authorities say that even under
the more flexible conditions of Spain's newly-revised labour legislation
Gillette lacks legal grounds for seeking redundancies through the normal
procedures. Gillette's only option for achieving its plan is a negotiated
deal for paying off its workers.
The labour reforms, aimed at removing disincentives to investment and job
creation, will make it somewhat easier for companies to adjust their
workforces, giving them more leeway to make reductions when necessary and
speeding up the red tape involved.
But redundancy compensation costs remain well above those in most other
European countries. Companies tend to offer the upper level of 45 days pay
per year of service in order to avoid costly court cases.
To achieve previous reductions, Gillette has paid this amount, plus a bonus
of Pta1m for every five years of service. But even so, it has had difficulty
finding takers because of the scarcity of alternative jobs in southern
Spain. Its closure plan is likely to be costlier still.

Banesto joins the crisis list / David White follows a drama few believed
could ever hit the top bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was the longest shareholders' meeting anybody in Spanish banking could
remember and at moments came close to anarchy. A succession of small
shareholders stood up to protest about being swindled.
About 6,000 people turned up to the exhibition hall outside Madrid for the
meeting, on March 26, although most had gone by the time it ended nine hours
later.
The outcome had been determined by proxy votes supporting the restructuring
plan for Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), opening the way for its sale
and the conclusion of the most spectacular crisis ever to hit a top Spanish
bank.
In the midst of this, protesters carried a banner through the lines of
chairs with a single word on it: 'Rumasa' - a reminder that, while the
authorities and the banking community were making a concerted effort to
treat the upset at Banesto as a unique case and prevent panic spreading to
other institutions, the symptoms of the case were not without precedent in
Spain.
In February 1983 the Socialist government, then newly arrived in power, had
also taken a deep breath and seized Rumasa, the country's largest
privately-owned holding group, to prevent a collapse that threatened to
shake the country's whole financial system.
There were clear differences between the two cases. Rumasa was expropriated
outright and sold off bit by bit while the Bank of Spain intervened in
Banesto with a view to re-launching the bank as quickly as possible under
new control.
There were also contrasts between the men at the centre of the two affairs.
Jose Maria Ruiz-Mateos is a self-made man, devout member of the lay
organisation Opus Dei, who built a small family sherry business into an
empire including hotels, stores, building, agrobusiness, insurance and 18
banks. The glamorous Mario Conde is a clever lawyer who sold his stake in a
pharmaceuticals company for a large sum and parachuted into the chairmanship
of Banesto at the age of 39 as it was fighting off a hostile takeover bid.
They do, however, have some things in common. Both are outsiders who have
tried to take on the banking establishment and the government; they are
ingenious financial manipulators who face allegations of irregularities; and
both headed groups in which banks and industrial companies co-existed in
complex relationships that went seriously awry when business conditions
became tough.
In Rumasa's case, it was the banks that belonged to the industrial group and
were used to finance it. In Banesto's case, industrial participations
belonging to the bank compounded the problems in its lending business.
Spain sometimes has a short memory, but it should know a bit about bank
crises. In the 15 years from 1978 there were 30 bank collapses, not counting
that of Rumasa. The series culminated in 1982/3 with several big names.
Apart from Banco Atlantico - Rumasa's Barcelona-based flagship, now
controlled by the Arab Banking Corporation - Banca Catalana and Banco
Urquijo were also brought down by industrial investments.
In Spain, the German model of leading banks at the centre of a web of
industrial interests has frequently been found not to work well.
At the time of the Rumasa expropriation, it was unimaginable that Banesto
should meet a similar fate. Banesto was still the top Spanish bank by the
size of its customer deposits.
Founded in 1902, it was for decades the epitome of banking in Spain, stodgy,
conservative, but solid and ultra-respectable.
Its pride in its retail network, reaching into the farthest corners of the
country, is recorded in bronze in the lists of branch names adorning the
outside walls of its old head office in central Madrid.
Ironically, Mr Ruiz-Mateos had tried, unsuccessfully, to get into Banesto as
a leading minority shareholder in 1982. 'I am convinced,' he wrote recently,
'that collaboration between Rumasa and Banesto would have been enormously
beneficial for the national economy, and would have avoided the great drama
of Spanish capitalism, the destruction of our industrial and financial
fabric.'
From the end of 1987, Mr Conde took Banesto on a new path of aggressive
lending. The bank's loan volume rose rose 109 per cent in the four years
from 1988 to 1991, twice the rate of growth in the rest of the banking
sector.
It had to pay a high price to finance this expansion, competing with Banco
Santander - its eventual new owner - in offering interest-bearing accounts.
The concentration of risks was accentuated by lending to recession-hit
companies in its industrial holding group.
Efforts to consolidate through provisions and a Pta95bn capital increase
last year proved insufficient. The Bank of Spain moved in on December 28,
overriding the plans which JP Morgan of the US had laid for bailing the bank
out. Auditors subsequently raised their estimate of the hidden losses at the
bank by 20 per cent to Pta605bn.
The rescue, including funds to cover non-performing assets and an
interest-free credit to offset current losses, will have cost the Bank of
Spain and the private banking system about Pta96bn each, taking into account
the profit made by selling newly-created shares at a premium to Banco
Santander.
The latter, which has declared its intention of holding on to at least a 40
per cent share, is setting about selling Banesto's industrial holdings and -
through Bankers Trust - the stakes which Mr Conde built up in newspapers and
TV stations.
To stop Banesto having a negative impact on its consolidated results, it
says it will need to recover some Pta300bn of dubious Banesto loans.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Spain - Banking, Finance and Investment (5):
Maintaining independence / A look at the degree of autonomy the Bank of
Spain enjoys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Luis Angel Rojo, the Bank of Spain's governor for the past two years, is
cautious when he talks about the autonomy statute that was legislated for
the institution by parliament last month. 'In theory we are now as
independent as the Bundesbank,' he says.
Modelled on similar legislative initiatives in France, Ireland and other
European Union member states, Spain's autonomy law gives Mr Rojo and the
bank the responsibility for setting a monetary policy that is compatible
with reducing inflation .
In line with the Maastricht Treaty's provisions on central bank
independence, the new law also prohibits the institution from financing the
Treasury or any other public entity. However, the Spanish government, as
elsewhere in the EU, has reserved for itself the responsibility for exchange
rate policy.
Theoretically, as Mr Rojo would have it, the goal posts have now been
changed on Spain's economic playing field. What remains to be seen is how
the game alters.
The consensus view is that is will not change a great deal, at least not in
the mid term.
The Bank of Spain's governor knows that a set of legal provisions does not
automatically create a code of public conduct. Whether the bank becomes a
recognisable Buba clone will depend on the firmness displayed by Mr Rojo and
the bank over time and on the backing that such independently-minded
decisiveness might receive from parliament and the public.
Mr Rojo argues that a certain amount of education is in order: 'The Germans
understand that price stability is important, the Spaniards understand this
less.' He also belives that at some future date there could be disagreements
with his ministerial masters because price stability 'is an objective that
hardly anyone in politics is interested in'.
So far the governor has been fortunate with his political overlords. Former
economy minister Carlos Solchaga, who appointed Mr Rojo governor, echoed Mr
Rojo's sentiments when he confessed in a bitter-sweet valedictory speech to
parliament that a real domestic problem was the fact that Spaniards had
never been sufficiently worried about high inflation.
Pedro Solbes, who replaced Mr Solchaga a year ago as economy and finance
minister, has put budgetary restraint at the top of his agenda.
Such political support has made Mr Rojo's job a lot easier. Having steered
the peseta through three devaluations in less than a year, following
Europe's monetary turmoil in the autumn of 1992, Mr Rojo asserts that he has
already been acting with the sort of independence which the autonomy statute
has now formally granted the bank.
Over the past few months Mr Rojo has almost halved the Bank of Spain's
benchmark intervention rate and brought it down to 7.5 per cent and he
claims that over the period he has not received a single instruction from
the economy and finance ministry on interest rates cuts.
In the same vein, the government has anticipated the new restrictions on
monetary financing by unilaterally relinquishing this instrument at the
begining of 1993. It did so shortly after the cabinet approved the draft
Bank of Spain autonomy law in December 1992, although legally it could have
continued to borrow from the institution right up until last month when the
law was finally enacted by parliament.
Treasury officials say they wanted to 'get into training' ahead of the ban
on monetary financing.
In the event the government went to the markets last year and obtained more
debt than it required; Spain's PSBR of some Pta15,000bn was overfunded by
Pta3,000bn and not a peseta of this total came from the Bank of Spain.
In addition, the Madrid Treasury negotiated last year a syndicated loan
facility with the UK's National Westminster bank, which led the syndicate,
that provides a multi-currency Pta750bn standby credit line over a
three-year period at Libor plus 0.075BP.
A year later the government has still not made use of this facility, one of
the largest available to an EU member, although there are suggestions that
some of the foreign banks in the syndicate are urging it to do so.
Should the going get tough the government has several options with which to
overcome the ban on monetary financing.
It can start to take up the Nat West's facility and it can, in addition,
negotiate a similar credit line with the domestic banks. It can also return
to short-term three- and six-month debt issues, a strategy which Madrid's
treasury, like its counterparts around the world, would prefer to avoid.
Arguably, the best option open to the treasury, particularly because there
are still expectations of further interest rate cuts, is debt stripping, a
strategy that originated in the US and which consists of the division and
separate marketing of a debt asset into its principal and its interest.
Debt stripping, which prompts a wider and more liquid secondary market, has
been developed elsewhere in the EU but has still to make an impact in Spain
in part because of the lack of specialised knowledge and in part because of
double taxation impediments that have still to be ironed out.
A main attraction for non-residents holding the interest part of a stripped
debt is that they are exempt from withholding tax.
Mr Rojo is therefore in the enviable position of working with 'hands-off'
politicians and with a resourceful treasury that has already come to terms
with non-monetary financing.
He can therefore concentrate on his pet project of raising domestic
awareness of inflation.
The governor plans to have the bank issue monthly reports on inflation and
he himself wants to address parliament's finance committee frequently on
price stability.
He also wants to follow the example of Bank of England governor Eddie George
and have regular meetings over monetary policy with the economy minister,
the minutes of which are subsequently made public.
Looking ahead, however, Mr Rojo's independence could be tested to the full.
Should the domestic economy begin the recover quickly - which it could do -
will Mr Rojo be tempted to push up interest rates in the manner of the Fed's
Alan Greenspan? And should Mr Rojo want to do so, what will be the reaction
of government?

FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Spain - Banking, Finance and Investment (2): The
boat starts to rock / John Gapper finds competition is growing in the
commercial sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the private banks which still dominate retail banking in Spain despite
growing competition from savings banks, this is already an unsettling year.
It started uncomfortably with the dismissal of Banco Espanol de Credito's
(Banesto's) management and shows few signs of short-term improvement.
The removal of Mario Conde as president of Banesto by the Bank of Spain and
the subsequent restructuring in which Banco Santander took a controlling
stake unsettled investors in the private banks. Shares in banks with
industrial holdings such as Banco Central Hispano suffered a loss of
confidence.
Six months on from the drama, which embroiled the US bank JP Morgan because
of its dual role as Banesto's adviser and an investor in Banesto through its
Corsair fund, stability has been restored. The central bank is generally
held to have wielded supervisory powers effectively if drastically.
Yet Banesto is likely to remain a weight on Santander, and therefore
influence the dynamics of retail banking, for at least two years. Santander
must prove that it is able to gain value from its bid of Pta762 (Dollars
5.52) per share for Banesto, a bid which was greeted with scepticism by the
stock market.
The acquisition of Banesto is a significant step in the process of the
consolidation of Spanish banking from the old 'big seven' banks to four big
banks - Santander/Banesto, Central Hispano, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and
Argentaria, the collection of former state-run banks that were partly
privatised a year ago.
One effect of the purchase is to move Santander closer to its ambition to be
a rival to banks such as Barclays and Deutsche Bank. That means a bank with
strong roots in retail banking in its home country, but with a strong global
and investment and commercial banking presence.
But in its home market, some rivals hope that it has at least bitten off
enough in Banesto to offset the effects of its sustained effort to raise
market share over the past five years. Its launch of high interest savings
accounts in 1989 was one of the formative incidents in increasing
competition.
Santander has chosen to keep Banesto as a separate group under the
management of Alfredo Saenz. In spite of the clearing of the immediate asset
problems caused by Mr Conde's expansion, other banks say that Mr Saenz has a
tough task to instill some vigour in the managers of Banesto's rural
branches.
They hope that the task will dampen the competition for assets -
particularly mortgages - and deposits, which intensified last year and early
this year.
Jorge Hay, Central Hispano's research director, says that net interest
margins narrowed 'quite sharply' at some banks in the first quarter.
This is a continuation of a long trend of narrowing margins following the
emergence of true competition among banks. But last year's fall was dramatic
 -private banks' average net interest margins fell by 0.5 percentage points
from 3.24 per cent to 2.74 per cent between 1992 and 1993.
That kind of fall is unsustainable. In 1993, it could be absorbed because
banks made up all the loss of profit on lending business through bond and
foreign exchange trading, including bond sale and repurchase. Profits were
virtually guaranteed by falling short-term interest rates.
The expectation of a further fall in interest rates caught banks out in the
first quarter. Some tried to gain mortgages by pricing them virtually at the
cost of funding, expecting margins to widen as interest rates fell. They no
longer had windfall trading profits to cover this squeeze.
Yet not all is gloom for the banks. There are hopes that the first half of
the year will mark the bottom of their fortunes for a number of reasons:
The shock of first and second quarter figures is likely to persuade banks of
the folly of competing too strongly in a static market for loans.
The second quarter fall from last year may be pronounced because the 1993
figure reflected windfall gains from the devaluation of the peseta.
Spain's recovery now appears entrenched. Central Hispano is predicting a
growth in demand for bank credit of 7 per cent this year, compared with a
fall of 1 per cent last year.
This should both improve volume, and ease pressure on margins from banks
competing for limited demand.
The fall in interest rates squeezed margins last year, but will gradually
ease the burden of non-performing loans. Banks should be able to release
provisions if the economy recovers sharply.
They will also have to pay less to finance loans on which borrowers have
suspended paying interest.
These factors should ease some of the short-term pressures on banks. But the
Banesto crisis and last year's squeeze on lending have raised long-term
questions about the development of the sector. These concern growing
competition from capital markets, and the future of banks' equity holdings.
One reason for the Spanish banks' traditional profitability is that there
has been relatively little 'disintermediation' - a bankers' term for the
elimination of banks as intermediaries between investors, and issuers of
financial instruments. This has been true of both wholesale and retail
markets.
Few large Spanish companies have easy access to commercial paper and
medium-term note markets to raise finance, but are instead heavily dependent
on bank finance. Similarly, retail customers have relied on bank and savings
bank deposits as short-term investments rather than equities and bonds.
However, there has been strong growth in bond-based mutual funds in the past
year, encouraged both by falling inflation and tax breaks to finance the
public sector deficit.
A switch from bank deposits in the long-term would put pressure on banks' to
rationalise their large branch networks.
Companies are also likely to rely more on capital markets. They may have to
do so, as banks such as Banesto and Central Hispano reduce equity holdings
to free capital. But Spain could face structural problems if banks switch
away from equity holdings before capital markets develop.
Rod Frew, Lloyds Bank's chief manager for Spain, says that the sector has
'seen the end of growth in industrial holdings'.
But he argues that banks could face equivalent problems if they simply
replace equity stakes in companies with lower-return debt finance.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (3): The whole of Europe and
a slice of Africa - Lucy Plaskett describes the remorseless expansion of the
international grid for electricity trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY PLASKETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within a decade, Spain could be exchanging electricity with Egypt to the
south and Russia to the east, both members of a vast intercontinental power
grid.
The increasing desire of utilities to trade with each other, coupled with
recent political and economic changes, is promoting the rapid growth of
interconnections between electricity grids.
With the exception of Ireland, which for the time being stands alone, most
countries in western Europe belong to one of three interconnected grid
systems: the UCPTE system, one of the largest in the world, covering 12
states in continental Europe; the much smaller system of Nordel, covering
Norway, Sweden, Finland and the eastern half of Denmark; and the British
system, linking England, Wales and Scotland. To the east, the power grids of
eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union are linked together
by the IPS/UPS system.
All four evolved as utilities increasingly saw the advantages of cooperating
together to improve the efficiency of their individual networks.
Within such interconnected grid systems, the transmission networks of member
countries are synchronised and work together to keep the overall system at
the same steady frequency. This not only helps to promote regular
electricity trade between grid members but provides a valuable back-up for
utilities when power is lost unexpectedly.
For example, if the Spanish grid suffered an unexpected loss of power,
endangering frequency levels, electricity would automatically flow from
other parts of the UCPTE grid to make up the gap. This reduces the amount of
generating capacity that each individual country has to keep in reserve,
allowing utilities to reduce their investment costs.
The four separate systems are also linked together - Britain with UCPTE via
a cable link with France, Nordel with UCPTE via Denmark and with Russia via
Finland, and three interconnections along the Austrian and German borders
providing a link with eastern Europe.
But such links are so-called direct current (DC) lines; while the
alternating current (AC) of the synchronised grids allows multi-directional
power flows to provide a constant back-up, DC lines are the 'railways' of
the system, allowing power to flow in one direction at a time, and only
affecting the power grids of the two countries concerned. They can also be
switched off if disturbances occur.
The main growth in DC lines has been to the north of Europe. Over the past
few years, a number of new DC lines have been proposed between the Nordel
and UCPTE grids.
The most advanced is the 600MW Baltic Cable being built between Sweden and
Germany by Swedish utility Vattenfall and Germany's PreussenElektra, due to
be completed by the end of this year. East German utility VEAG and eastern
Denmark's Elkraft are also linking their two grids via the 600MW Kontek
line, due in operation at the end of 1995.
Meanwhile, PreussenElektra has also teamed up with Norwegian utility
Statkraft to plan the 600MW Viking Cable between Norway and Germany for
later in the 1990s. And Norwegian utilities are also considering a DC link
to the Netherlands, as well as possible links to the UK.
These lines are being built by utilities eager to exploit the difference in
price and availability between Sweden and Norway's large amounts of
hydropower, and the mainly thermal-based electricity of UCPTE. Different
peak demand times also offer trading opportunities.
Nordic utilities plan to export hydro electricity to the UCPTE grid during
the day when prices are high, and then switch off their hydro plants at
night and import thermal power when prices are low. The links will also
allow them to import in the event of dry summers. Continental utilities
benefit from peak power without having to invest in new plant. Nordel has
always exchanged power in this way with thermal-fired plant in Denmark. But
such trade has been boosted in recent years by the increasing commercial
pressures of the EC internal market, the difficulties of siting new plant,
and weak domestic power demand which has forced utilities to look abroad.
Utilities are also looking east for trading opportunities. Vattenfall is
considering a DC submarine link to Poland, while Finnish utility IVO is
doing feasibility studies on a 500MW link to Estonia. PreussenElektra and
the Polish grid company are just finishing a study on the feasibility of a
2x2,000MW DC overland line linking Frankfurt to Smolensk in Russia, via
Poland and Byelorussia. Together, these three projects could form a 'Baltic
ring', offering utilities similar chances to exploit different fuel sources
and demand peaks.
Political change over the past few years has also raised the possibility of
further electricity trade with eastern Europe. But this is more complicated
since, as part of their economic integration into western Europe, the
countries of central and eastern Europe want to break away from the IPS/UPS
system and become part of the UCPTE synchronised network.
But before this can happen their grids need to be technically upgraded to
meet UCPTE standards.
This work is well underway. West German utilities hope to link the east
German grid system to UCPTE by 1995. While Poland, Hungary and the Czech and
Slovak Republics have formed a union, CENTREL, to look into the technical
aspects of joining the UCPTE.
According to a report by UNIPEDE, the International Union of Producers and
Distributors of Electrical Energy, the four have said that the necessary
upgrading will be done by 1997 at the latest, and could be completed as
early as next year.
Next on the list of future UCPTE members are Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey.
But this is complicated by the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, which has
severed the UCPTE link to Greece. Attaching this part of southern Europe
will either have to wait for the end of the conflict or will involve
upgrading of lines between Hungary and Romania.
For the longer term experts are also doing feasibility studies on linking
the CIS and Russian grids to the UCPTE, creating one vast synchronous
network over the entire European continent. Technically UNIPEDE believes
this is possible, concluding 'the size of a system will be governed by
geographical, economic, political or even organisational factors, rather
than by technical considerations'.
But some experts worry that the trading advantages such a huge grid would
offer, in terms of different fuels and peak load times, would be more than
offset by high transmission costs and a loss of system stability. 'It's a
philosophical discussion about where are the limits, who's winning and who's
losing,' commented UCPTE secretary Marcel Bial.
Expansion plans to the south are also well advanced. Spanish grid company
Red Electrica Espanola plans to have an AC line to North Africa by 1996,
linking UCPTE countries with the Maghreb grid of Morocco, Algeria and
Tunisia.
This is the first step in a wider project to connect the UCPTE grid
synchronously with the whole of the Mediterranean basin. And on present
plans, this is not far off. According to Mr Teoman Alpturk of the Turkish
Electricity Authority, work has already started on a AC line linking Turkey,
Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt, with completion planned by the end of 1996.
If Turkey is successful in linking up with the UCPTE grid by the late 1990s,
the only weak link in this circuit will be Libya. Feasibility studies are
already underway to linkthe Libyan grid to Egypt and Tunisia.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (2): Sparks fly in a high
voltage business - Andrew Baxter examines the international battle to equip
Europe's power stations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER

<TEXT>
One of the biggest controversies in the electrical industry over recent
years has been generated by the European Union's Utilities Directive, which
came into force at the beginning of last year and requires utilities to use
open, competitive, purchasing procedures for their equipment and services.
The directive sparked a big row between the EU and the US, because of its
Article 29 which said a purchaser may reject any bid that contains less than
50 per cent of the total value sourced from within the EU, and that, where
there is no more than a 3 per cent difference between the price of an EU and
a non-EU bid, the non-EU bid must be rejected.
Amid allegations that the EU was trying to build a 'Fortress Europe,' the
controversy was finally defused in April last year when it was agreed that,
for the electrical sector at least, Article 29 would not be applied for
works and services contracts. In return, EU companies would be exempt from
the Buy American Act when tendering for works and supply contracts from US
public utilities.
But the controversy does not end there. The broader question is whether the
directive will even achieve its aim of ensuring that consumers will benefit
from lower costs, through the application of competitive contracting under
which the lowest cost supplier wins.
The Commission has long believed that the tendency of public agencies in the
EU to buy equipment and services from domestic suppliers meant that costs
were higher than if contracts had been allocated on the basis of full and
fair international competition. Hence the Utilities Directive, which covers
equipment supply and works contracts for electricity - although not the
supply of energy or fuels for energy - and requires any contract over
Ecu400,000 for equipment and Ecu5m for works to comply with a series of
conditions that allow for the maximum degree of competition.
Broadly, there are three types of procedure permitted: open, restricted and
negotiated. The directive also covers water, gas, heat and transportation
services in the EU and is aimed at both public and private companies which
meet the criterion of public supply.
However, a report earlier this year by researchers at Sussex University's
Science Policy Research Unit suggests that, at least for electrical
transmission and distribution equipment, the directive could be
counter-productive and may even lead to higher equipment prices.
According to the authors, Mr Steve Thomas and Mr Francis McGowan, the
directive appears to be designed to overcome two particular pressures, for
utilities to favour national suppliers - whether in response to their
government's industrial policy or their own national chauvinism - and for
utilities to enter long-term arrangements with suppliers to minimise their
administrative burden even when such arrangements are not in the interests
of consumers.
But, they say, 'while there probably still remain vestiges of the practices,
which when viewed through today's perceptions of the need for free trade and
competitive bidding appear unacceptable, the line between non-competitive
procedures and sensible long-term strategies is often a fine one.'
For example, what might be seen as national chauvinism in procurement might
actually be a sensible policy of ensuring that the equipment supplier is
close at hand to provide back-up in the event of technical problems. And
what might be seen as wasteful procurement by not placing orders exclusively
with the most economically attractive supplier could be a far-sighted policy
which ensures a competitive industry is maintained for the long-term.
So measures that ensure that unacceptable practices cannot be continued run
a risk of proscribing policies which are in the long-term interest of
utility customers.
Most of the leading equipment suppliers, after all, are multinational in
character and are therefore much less likely to receive support from
national governments.
Also, the electric utility sector is in the middle of important
restructuring with the emphasis on allowing the forces of competition to be
brought to bear on it, so that it functions efficiently. In addition, there
has been considerable progress in adopting common standards in Europe which
will allow suppliers more easily to compete in all markets.
The authors point out that by making it more difficult for utilities to
enter into long-term agreements with suppliers to develop and purchase new
designs of equipment, it may be harder for them to stimulate the market to
produce the equipment with the necessary performance characteristics.
It also runs counter to the modern trend in supplier-customer relationships
in industry, where old-style adversarial relationships are giving way to
partnering and long-term co-operative agreements.
In the equipment supply industry, meanwhile, the process of rationalisation
over the past two decades has been promoted strongly by the European
Commission, but does bring dangers with it, according to the authors.
The presence of three large European companies in the electrical equipment
sector - Asea Brown Boveri, GEC Alsthom and Siemens - ought to ensure a
competitive market, they say. But if the market size is such that all three
can be comfortably supported, the pressure on suppliers to beat their
competitors might not be very strong.
In addition, they say, it is not hard to imagine circumstances in which the
field could shrink to two with the second tier of suppliers offering little
extra competition.
'While the old nationally-based structure tended to produce overcapacity,
the removal of national protection, together with the high barriers to entry
and the cyclical nature of demand mean that the new multinational structure
will tend to produce too small a supply network. Thus, any assumption that
the market will behave competitively without strong prompting must be
questioned,' they say.
In transmission and distribution equipment, they contend, there are few
suppliers outside Europe which could be used to maintain competitive
pressure. GE and Westinghouse are big players in power generating equipment
 -turbines and generators - but no longer supply the biggest items of
transmission and distribution equipment. The Japanese companies -
Mitsubishi, Toshiba and Hitachi - appear not to have made any 'concerted
effort so far to penetrate European markets.'
Overall, say the authors, the Commission's initiative on procurement may not
have paid sufficient attention to the actual structure of the market and the
nature of the relationship between the supplier and purchaser of equipment.
'Given the dangerously concentrated nature of the equipment supply industry,
a much greater threat to the economic welfare of consumers may be posed by
the non-competitive forces in the equipment supply industry than is posed by
the policies of the electricity supply industry.'

FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Spain - Banking, Finance and Investment (1):
Uncertainty a threat to recovery / Recent corruption scandals and the risk
of political instability are unsettling investors and could undermine
economic confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is ever a good time for a political crisis, it is not at the
beginning of a tentative economic recovery. But, as Felipe Gonzalez's
Spanish government has found out, arguing the need for stability in order to
rebuild economic confidence does not necessarily work on voters.
After almost 12 years of Socialist administration, political uncertainty now
has to be factored into the Spanish equation.
The risks of instability are of a different order from those experienced in
the early 1980s when the Socialists came to power, not long after an
attempted military coup and at a time when Spain was not yet anchored in the
European Community. However, events that have taken place over the past two
months have left the outlook unclear.
After a series of resignations from the government and parliament over
corruption affairs involving former top officials, the discredit to the
government was reflected in a resounding defeat in this month's European
elections.
Mr Gonzalez, who since last year no longer has an outright majority in
parliament, has been left to depend on a precarious arrangement with Catalan
nationalists, who are willing to support him subject to certain conditions.
When it comes to drawing up the 1995 budget, these conditions may prove
difficult to meet.
Spain could, therefore, face a new election period at any time from now. The
prospect has unsettled investors. The probable outcome - the advent of a
conservative Popular Party government determined to take a tougher line on
curbing the public sector deficit and to move faster on privatisation - is
one they would welcome.
However, the Popular Party has yet to clarify its economic programme. There
is also a danger that it could fall short of a governing majority and have
to rely - as do the Socialists but possibly with even more difficulty - on
alliances made with regionalist parties.
These jitters have magnified the impact in Spain of recent international
turbulence in the bond markets. The government's worry is that political
nervousness will interfere with the restoration of business confidence in
the aftermath of last year's recession, the worst Spain has experienced for
more than 30 years.
Expectations of a recovery led by exports and tourism - both benefitting
from a threefold devaluation of the peseta in 1992-93 - have been confirmed
by figures so far this year.
Holidaymakers are flocking back to Spain. The country is heavily booked for
what is expected to be a record year bringing foreign exchange revenues of
about Dollars 22bn.
Exports rose by a third in real terms in the first four months of the year
compared with the same period of 1993. However, imports have also started
rising more strongly than expected.
The most recent figures, for April, brought a setback to the improvement in
the country's balance of payments current account. However, some analysts
still expect the current account to come out of deficit this year for the
first time since 1986.
According to Bank of Spain estimates, gross domestic product rose 0.5 per
cent in the first quarter compared with a year previously, following
negative figures for the five previous quarters.
The OECD recently revised its annual growth forecast for Spain upwards from
0.9 to 1.2 per cent. Government planners expect that the rate will be closer
to 1.5 per cent, following negative growth of 1 per cent last year.
However, even the more optimistic forecasts are below the average growth
predicted for the rest of Europe. It is not clear how soon Spain can reverse
the rise in its jobless rate, which reached 24.6 per cent in the first
quarter, more than in any other European country.
The government believes that measures which came into force this month
introducing more flexibility in the labour market - although not as much
flexibility as industrialists would like - will help bring about an early
recovery in employment. Industrial production figures have been improving
since last November. However, in spite of lower borrowing costs, investment
is still slack.
The picture for foreign industrial investment, which accounts for about half
of Spanish manufacturing, has been overshadowed by recent problems at
companies such as Volkswagen's Seat subsidiary - which is due to receive
government aid - and Suzuki's offshoot Santana Motor.
Wage costs, which in the last few years have risen by about two points above
the annual rate of inflation, have eroded Spain's competitiveness as a
manufacturing base.
Pay increases this year, however, have been more modest, with settlements
averaging less than the government's 3.5 per cent inflation target.
Although this target looks unlikely to be met - given that consumer prices
have so far stubbornly refused to fall below a 12-month rate of 4.9 per cent
 -inflation is expected to ease off later in the year.
One of the more dramatic and potentially damaging side-products of recession
 -the crisis at Banesto, one of the country's leading banks - has been
successfully and swiftly dealt with.
From the Bank of Spain's summary intervention in late December to the sale
of a restructured Banesto took less than four months, with minimal
consequences for confidence in the banking system as a whole.
Banesto was the biggest bank to have run aground in a long series of Spanish
banking crises. Its rescue, a Dollars 4bn repair job to its balance sheet,
was one of the biggest operations of its kind mounted anywhere. And its
eventual sale by auction to Banco Santander for more than Dollars 2bn was
Spain's biggest takeover.
The result is that Banco Santander - formerly a middle-ranker among the main
Spanish banks - has taken over as the country's top banking group.
Nothing has changed more in Spain since the mid-1980s than the banking and
financial system. Instead of seven 'big banks' there are now four.
Two big private-sector bank mergers have taken place. State banking
interests have been brought together into the partially-privatised
Argentaria. And savings banks have undertaken a series of mergers, expanded
outside their regional fiefdoms, and taken over commercial banks.
A generational change has taken place among the leading bank chairmen.
Financial markets have been reformed, exchange controls lifted, restrictions
eased, the last fixed interest rates abandoned, barriers to foreign banks
removed, competition opened up.
Banks no longer have to keep a large proportion of their deposits in
compulsory reserves and low-yield state-directed investments.
What has not changed is the unmissable physical presence of banks on Spanish
streets. Spain still has more bank branches than France or Britain, and more
per head of population than anywhere else in Europe except Denmark and
Luxembourg.
The tradition whereby there is a church, a bar and a bank on every block
seems to die hard. On the other hand, more than a third of the bank branches
carry names that are different from those of five or six years ago, such has
been the reorganisation of the sector.
It is a bitter irony that one of the main figures who oversaw the
modernisation of the sector, and one of the main standard-bearers of
economic orthodoxy during the Socialist party's period in government -
Mariano Rubio, for eight years governor of the Bank of Spain - should also
be one of the chief protagonists of the corruption scandals that have
brought the government and some of the country's leading institutions into
disrepute.
It may well be, as some bankers argue, that Mr Rubio's alleged
misdemeanours, such as insider dealing, were 'no more than everybody else
was doing' in the 1980s. His disgrace, then, is a sign of another important
change, to stricter rules and standards.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (1): A choice of power - and
the power of choice / The European Commissioners are frustrated over the
slowness of electricity deregulation. Utilities say they are widening
customers' choice but they also have other priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Viewed from the lofty heights of the European Commission, electricity must
seem one of the slowest, most obdurate industries imaginable.
But the companies which make up the European power industry regard
themselves as part of a fast moving world in which some will struggle to
keep pace. Both sides have a point.
The Brussels view reflects the Commissioners' severe difficulties in
deregulating the electricity and gas sectors. While they have successfully
pushed through the liberalisation of telecommunications and aviation, energy
has successfully resisted serious reform.
Most power companies fear the consequences both for themselves and their
customers, and some are backed by their governments. But change is on the
way. A small but growing number of European countries, both in and outside
the EU, are opening up their electricity markets.
The deregulation process in many cases has been prompted by privatisation of
public utilities. Countries that have already privatised or intend to
privatise parts of their power networks include the UK, Italy, Portugal,
Hungary and the Czech Republic.
However, even in countries which have not introduced privatisation,
electricity companies face a series of tough challenges.
These challenges will be under review at this week's triennial conference in
Birmingham of the Union of Electricity Producers and Distributors (Unipede).
The 1,000 delegates, mainly European, will also be only too aware of the
contrasting growth prospects of eastern and western European countries and
the attendant problems of environmental pollution.
The industry faces five main issues:
eastern Europe. The former Soviet-bloc countries, having broken with command
economy principles, need western allies to invest in new plants as they
embark on far-reaching modernisation programmes. The Czech Republic, for
example, is likely to invite foreign companies to take shares of 15 per cent
in its regional distribution companies later this year or next.
internationalisation: this trend is growing as western companies find their
own markets saturated and seek opportunities in other countries, east and
west. Share swaps are possible and the trend should help the idea of a
pan-European inter-connected grid.
costs: public concern about pollution and nuclear safety, especially in
central and eastern Europe, is raising costs at a time when consumers demand
greater price transparency and the lowest possible tariffs. Western
countries and companies are helping through means such as the European
Energy charter, agreed by 49 states and the European Union in 1991. The
charter provides a framework for western investment in central and eastern
europe and for exchanges of technology.
health scares: there have been widespread fears about a possible link
between cancer and electric and magnetic fields (EMF) associated with
high-voltage grid lines. Industry-sponsored research has found that there is
no link between EMF and cancer but a growing number of cases are coming to
court.
deregulation: important though all of these factors are for the future of
the sector, the issue which will cause most controversy and potentially make
the largest impact is deregulation within the European Union.
Until recently, virtually every European power company operated as a
monopoly, and most were restricted from expanding outside their core
business. The UK Conservative government broke this mould when it split up
the mammoth Central Electricity Generating Board as a prelude to
privatisation of the whole industry.
The cause of reform was taken up in earnest by the Commission in the early
1990s. It has no view on whether privatisation is a good or bad thing but it
argues that a single European market only makes sense if competition can be
applied to electricity and gas.
'It is clearly unfair for industries in energy-intensive sectors like
chemicals or metals to be obliged to compete without having access to energy
on similar conditions,' Mr Claus-Dieter Ehlermann, director-general in the
competition directorate, told a recent conference.
'It is the competitiveness of the whole European industry which is at
stake.'
The Commission is pushing for a system called negotiated third party access
(TPA) which would cajole monopoly suppliers to open up their grid networks
to enable trade between large industrial power consumers and another power
supplier.
The system's many opponents, including most companies, most countries and
most MEPs, argue that such a market would be unable to discharge public
service obligations such as guarantees of supplies and uniform prices.
Electricite de France, the French state utility, fears that long term
planning would be made more difficult, endangering plans to build nuclear
power plants.
Electrabel, one of Belgium's electricity companies, agrees that TPA would
make planning difficult and that the Commission is going too quickly. It
says an essential precondition for deregulation should be the harmonisation
of environmental and fiscal conditions in the countries, claiming that
otherwise some countries would have an unfair advantage over others.
The Commission and TPA opponents may reach a compromise later this year
around a so-called single purchaser system, through which one body
independent of the host generator would be responsible for selling
electricity.
TPA opponents say this would maintain the integrity of the system. TPA
supporters, however, say that it would have little impact since it would not
enable consumers to deal directly with companies other than the host
supplier.
The original draft directive has already been considerbly diluted after
intervention from the European Parliament. The Commission had originally
proposed that companies should have an automatic right to a network, rather
than a negotiated right.
Some feel it would be better to wait for reform to gather pace. At the last
meeting of EU energy ministers in May, the Italians, Spanish and Irish
representatives hinted they were considering ways to liberalise their
markets, although they did not say how.
Another change is the growing number of countries setting up independent
grid networks. An essential pre-requisite of a competitive system is to run
the grid system separately from the power producers, either through separate
accounting or through splitting up the electricity companies.
Whereas five years ago there were no separate grid companies there are now
five.
The pressure for change will be boosted by the expected integration of the
union of the Nordic countries with the continental network. Norway, Sweden
and Finland either have liberal regimes for electricity or plan to introduce
them.
Further ahead, some central European states might prove to be allies for the
liberalisers. Poland, for example, has already separated the three arms of
its electricity system.
In the near future, however, much will depend on the German government which
assumes presidency of the European Union next month. In recent months, parts
of the Bonn administration have been pushing for third party access in
Germany as a means of bringing down power prices.
That, however, would cause significant political problems with France which
has much cheaper electricity prices for industrial consumers.
One German electricity executive says: 'We are fighting with all our might
against liberalisation of the European power industry. But at the same time
we have no choice but to prepare for it.'

Monday: Recent monthly figures for UK bank and building society (M4) lending
have moved erratically, so it is no surprise that analysts' forecasts for
seasonally adjusted M4 lending in May range from Pounds 600m to Pounds 4bn.
The consensus forecast of Pounds 1.9bn compares with actual lending of
Pounds 500m in April.
Tuesday: US trade in goods and services is expected to notch up another
significant deficit in April, with analysts' forecasts ranging from Dollars
7bn to Dollars 9.5bn. However, the consensus forecast, at Dollars 7.5bn,
indicates no change from the March outturn.
Friday: Final first-quarter UK GDP and current account balance of payments
figures will be last economic in-
formation published before release of the government's revised forecast for
the economy on June 28.
First-quarter GDP is expected to grow year-on-year at 2.6 per cent, above
the 2.5 per cent growth forecast for 1994 by the Treasury last November.
The consensus forecast for the current account points to a first-quarter
deficit of Pounds 2.2bn, an improvement on the Pounds 2.6bn seasonally
adjusted deficit of the 1993 fourth quarter.

MONDAY 20
Union leaders meet Kohl
European trade union leaders will meet chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn to
urge Germany to give top priority during its forthcoming presidency of the
European Union (which begins on July 1) to strategies of job-creation,
economic expansion, and social protection.
Unice, the European employers' organisation, today publishes Making Europe
More Competitive. The report calls on EU members to acknowledge and take on
board the details of its action plan: to reverse Europe's declining
competitiveness, to create growth and generate new jobs. The report has the
backing of the Confederation of British Industry.
Italy's foreign minister, Antonio Martino visits Bonn to meet his German
counterpart Klaus Kinkel. Cesare Previti, Italy's defence minister is also
visiting Germany and Paris to meet his respective counterparts. The visits
are seen as a public relations exercise by Italy's right-wing coalition
government.
Tennis: The Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Championships begin (to July 3).
World Bank Report: Developing nations must reduce inefficiency and waste in
their use of infrastructure, according to the World Bank. This year's World
Development Report, published today, argues that the savings from more
efficient use of infrastructure over a three-year period could generate
sufficient resources to provide safe drinking water for 1bn people.
FT Conference: A two-day conference on European Telecommunications -
Responding to Change is being held at the Inter-Continental hotel in London.
The need for and impact of liberalisation of the marketplace are among
issues being discussed.
'Harry and Louise' return to US television screens for another round in the
ferocious lobbying campaign conducted by the Health Insurance Association of
America against the Clinton health care reform plan. Hard-hitting television
advertisements featuring the yuppie couple are credited with much of the
weakening in public support for the plan.
FT Surveys: Electricity in Europe and Spain: Banking and Finance.
Holidays: Argentina, Bangladesh, Cyprus, Greece, Pakistan.
TUESDAY 21
Talks on Hong Kong
Britain and China are to hold a meeting of the Joint Liaison Group, the
bilateral body which is overseeing Hong Kong's transfer to China in July
1997 (to June 23). It is the first such meeting to be held since December
last year.
The talks come amid signals from Beijing that China wants to improve
relations with Britain. What this means for bilateral talks over Hong Kong
remains to be seen, but hopes are high that the colony's project to build a
multi-billion dollar airport will benefit.
US vice-president Al Gore and Russian prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin
begin three days of talks in Washington on mutual economic cooperation. The
meeting could be topped by the signing of a Dollars 9bn deal to develop oil
reserves on Sakhalin Island. Mr Chernomyrdin is also expected to sign loan
documents for four World Bank loans totalling nearly Dollars 1bn.
Vaclav Havel, the Czech president, begins a two-day visit to Romania where
he will sign a friendship treaty between the two countries. It is Mr Havel's
first visit to Romania as president. Mr Havel, who will travel on to
Bulgaria, has previously declined to visit Romania, mainly due to the
country's human rights record.
Saleroom: Sotheby's in London offers its fifth sale of manuscripts from the
library of David Solomon Sassoon (1880-1942) this afternoon. Among the 76
lots is a medieval Spanish Hebrew Bible in contemporary binding, estimated
at Pounds 150,000-Pounds 200,000. The sale of western manuscripts and
miniatures includes the most important classical text on vetinary medicine,
written and illuminated for Ferrante I of Aragon, King of Naples 1458-94.
This royal manuscript (detail below) also belonged to Lorenzo the
Magnificent and is estimated at Pounds 80,000-Pounds 120,000.
Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's former prime minister, is to testify in the Diet
about his personal finances - the issue that forced him out of office in
April. He will be questioned about a Y100m (Dollars 9,523,000) loan he took
from transport company Sagawa Kyubin in 1982.
Anti-semitism report: The Institute of Jewish Affairs in London releases its
annual Anti-semitism World Report.
Holidays: Algeria, Bombay, Pakistan.
WEDNESDAY 22
Close to peace partnership
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to meet in Brussels with Mr
Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, before a meeting of the North
Atlantic Council at which Russia will formally sign up for Nato's military
co-operation programme Partnership for Peace.
South African budget
It is budget day for South Africa's new government of national unity:
international investors will be watching closely as finance minister Derek
Keys balances the demands of the country's post-apartheid reconstruction and
development plan, while keeping the budget deficit to the targeted six per
cent of GDP.
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, testifies before the House of
Representatives budget committee. Financial markets will be looking for
confirmation that the pace of economic growth is slowing, making interest
rate increases less likely. The Fed's 'beige book' assessment of regional
business conditions will also provide data on economic conditions.
Germany's opposition Social Democrats hold an extraordinary congress in
Halle. Party leader Rudolf Scharping may face criticism of his leadership,
held responsible for a poor performance in last week's European Parliament
and local government elections. However, he will likely be nominated as the
party's candidate for chancellor, as it has no obvious alternative.
UK monetary policy: The minutes of May 4's meeting between Kenneth Clarke,
UK chancellor, and Eddie George, Bank of England governor, will be studied
for a shift in monetary policy from the previous 'bias towards easing' to a
neutral or more rigorous stance.
Before Corfu: Christian Democrat leaders from member states meet in Brussels
to try to agree on a candidate to succeed Jacques Delors as Commission
president. Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl is expected to try to persuade
Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch premier, to give way to Belgian prime minister
Jean-Luc Dehaene. Meanwhile, Socialist leaders meet in Corfu to agree their
position on the succession, and on how to operate in the European
Parliament, where they are the dominant group.
Romanian trade unions and government have set a deadline for today for
agreement over the collective labour contract.
Holidays: Sri Lanka.
THURSDAY 23
Japan presents budget
The long overdue budget for the year starting April 1 is expected to clear
the upper house of parliament the final hurdle, today. This brings to an end
a political amnesty between the opposition and minority government, setting
the scene for another round in Japan's perennial party political power
struggle.
Germany's Bundesbank council, heads for Potsdam, near Berlin, for its annual
token meeting in the east.
For once, the question of whether M3 and prices statistics will be ready in
time for the council meeting is not of pressing interest. Central bankers
have made plain their short-term discount and Lombard rates are to stay for
the time being. However, May M3 data due this week is expected to show
higher growth than the Bundesbank's 4 to 6 per cent target range. The
consensus forecast is for 14 per cent against 15.4 per cent in April.
Belarus, a nation of 10m on Russia's western border and the
least-independent minded of former Soviet republics, is to hold its first
presidential election. Front-runner for the new post is Vyacheslav Kebich,
the neo-Communist prime minister.
Mr Kebich has the advantage of the full support of the state-
controlled media; he considers his other ace to be his negotiations for a
monetary union with Russia, which he claims will save Belarus' unreformed
economy from disaster.
Mr Kebich enjoys an advantage over his competitors if only because of his
media exposure, yet it is not clear whether he will overcome widespread
discontent with his government.
WTO bids: Switzerland and Germany push their respective bids to host the
World Trade Organisation, due to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade on January 1 1995. Germany applied last week for Bonn to become
the site of the secretariat. Switzerland's offer for the trade watchdog to
remain in Geneva is the only other candidacy.
Golf: The French Open
The competition begins at the National Golf Course in Paris (to June 26),
when Europe's top players get a little relaxation after Oakmont.
FT Survey: Korea.
Holidays: Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg.
FRIDAY 24
EU holds summit in Corfu
EU heads of government will try to choose a successor to European Commission
president Jacques Delors at their two-day summit on the Greek island of
Corfu. Two Christian Democrat prime ministers from the Low Countries, the
Dutchman Ruud Lubbers and the Belgian Jean-Luc Dehaene are the
front-runners. Neither appears willing to step aside for the other,
increasing the chances of a deadlock, and possibly an extra summit to settle
the issue.
The 12 will also sign a wide-ranging partnership agreement with Russia's
president Boris Yeltsin, opening the way to an EU-Russia free-trade zone by
the end of the century. A similar accord was reached last week with the
Ukraine, and a priority at the summit will be to follow this with a nuclear
safety plan, aimed at closing the Chernobyl reactors.
Turks in Bosnia: The first contingent of Turkish troops is due to set off to
join UN peacekeepers.
FT Surveys: Indonesia and Norway.
Holidays: Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Sweden, Thailand, Venezuela.
WEEKEND 25-26
State poll in Saxony-Anhalt
The eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt votes for a government on Sunday.
The first result since the recent European Parliament poll, it should
provide an indicator for the October federal elections.
The Christian Democrats, governing in coalition with the Free Democrats, as
in the federal government in Bonn, are attempting to retain power. The party
lost only 2 percentage points in the recent local government elections,
despite a spate of corruption scandals.
Ukraine's presidential poll on Sunday sees incumbent Leonid Kravchuk
fighting a close race against his former prime minister, an industrialist
who favours closer ties with Russia. Communists and extreme nationalists are
figuring prominently in simultaneous local elections.
Germany's president Richard von Weizsacker visits Poland on Saturday on the
last foreign trip of his presidency, before Roman Herzog takes over on July
1.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Index stands firm against summer storms -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market has run into a series of summer storms and can take comfort
from the fact that the FT-SE 100
3,000 mark has been re-tested and held. This week should have opened against
a more reliable domestic background than for some time; at least, the
European and UK by-elections are out of the way. But the chancellor of the
exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England have managed, between
them, to scare the market by ruling out tax cuts now and threatening higher
interest rates
later.
The stock market perhaps should have been hurt by the combined Mansion House
effect, but in fact was not. Mr Richard Jeffrey of Charterhouse Tilney
characterises Mr Eddie George's speech as 'innocuous . . . a precautionary
statement of the obvious'. The market knows that interest rates may rise
this year and is more interested in assurances that the move can be
postponed as long as possible.
It is not possible to be equally sanguine about the blow delivered to global
bonds by the negative turn in the Korean situation. Unfortunately, nor is it
possible to say whether the same situation could blow markets about this
week.
Several City analysts identify one significant feature of the Korean
shake-out. 'Despite political concerns, the US dollar has not gained
ground,' says NatWest Securities, adding that US bonds would be unable to
continue outperforming core European bonds if the dollar continued to
disappoint. Given that healthy bond markets are the key to healthy equities,
the Korean factor could benefit UK share prices.
Nomura Research refuses to see the North Korean developments as any sound
reason for a withdrawal from Far Eastern markets but warns that Japanese
funds still see US bonds and equities as the best buys.
In spite of the problematical outlook on the international front, underlying
faith in the current levels of the London equity market remains sound, even
if some of the reasons may surprise.
Mr Albert Edwards of Kleinwort Benson does not accept the view that base
rates will rise. 'The UK economy is set to weaken sharply. Higher base rates
are not justified,' he says bluntly. Kleinwort has reined in its forecast
for earnings growth in the non-financial corporate sector to only 10 per
cent, compared with a market consensus forecast which started the year at
12.6 per cent and has now been raised to around 13.4 per cent.
Most analysts see the UK stock market continuing to move within its existing
range for the Footsie of 3,000 to 3,050 - an extremely narrow range by
recent comparisons. Stock Exchange volume statistics confirm that
institutions are willing traders at these levels.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Opinion splits on the Dow's direction - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Has the four-month correction in the bull market run its course, or is the
Dow destined to revisit its mid-April lows? Wall Street analysts are divided
in their opinions, but there is a general consensus that the market could
plod higher over the next few days.
At issue is whether stocks will begin a sustained decline in the face of
unpleasant surprises, or whether the market will show the kind of resilience
which slowly carried share prices to record highs last year.
Certainly, the action last week seemed like a reprise of the good old days
which preceded February's shift in monetary policy. As expected, volatility
increased, but when the dust settled after Friday's 'triple witching hour',
the Dow had managed a net gain of 3 points on the week.
Cyclical stocks, such as Caterpillar and Alcoa were also reinvigorated.
'More market participants are becoming comfortable that the Fed did not
abort the recovery, and it's showing up in renewed interest in economically
sensitive stocks,' says Alfred Goldman, an analyst at A. G. Edwards in St
Louis. 'That's going to drag the market upwards, just like in 1993. The
bottom line is we are returning to a difficult, stock-picker type of
market.'
Thomas McManus, a stock strategist at Morgan Stanley, acknowledges that the
cyclicals have begun to return to their old form. However, he views their
strength as one sign that the market is riding too high and ready for a
fall. He fears investors have become too complacent in recent weeks. Their
over-confidence has in turn increased the downside risk to share prices.
As evidence, he points out that many of the 'put' options taken out during
the bearish days of April were not renewed after their expiration.
'Investors have decided they don't need the protection.'
On technical grounds, the positive mood should carry stocks forward, he
says. 'The fact that investors have let their puts expire creates support
for the market, because hedges sold against those puts are bought back.'
So why worry? Because the market is in a lose-lose situation, says Mr
McManus. If the economy continues to resist the Fed's efforts to slow it
down, look for a further tightening and a fresh sell-off. The more likely
scenario, he says, is that the central bank has already pushed rates high
enough to cool the economy, putting a pinch on corporate earnings.
If so, look for more companies to join PepsiCo, Hasbro, Unisys and others
which issued profits warnings last week. 'This is the time when corporate
America begins to confess,' the Morgan Stanley analyst says. 'Indeed, it is
really this period, before the reporting season, which is the most dangerous
for stocks.'

While share prices face a short-term correction following the rally in early
June, increased trading by retail investors seems to hold the key to a
further rise in the Nikkei index this week.
However, since participation by individual investors has been based solely
on a recovery in sentiment, rather than an improvement in economic
fundamentals, Mr Alex Kinmont of Morgan Stanley says the improvement remains
vulnerable to negative news. Meanwhile another fall in bonds may prompt a
further shift in funds to stocks.

into the black last year after much improved performances from its main
forestry and engineering activities. Meanwhile, parliament votes today on
the supplementary budget, which includes government plans to cut state

The market has been on the downturn since early this month and the trend,
baring a technical rally, looks set to continue throughout the month. After
reaching an all-time high in early February the market has under-performed
the rest of Europe, partly due to the rise in US interest rates and the
draining of liquidity for privatisation issues. Yet the economy is sound and
recovery is well under way. Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko Europe thinks
investors may have some time to wait for recovery, with interim results in
the early autumn perhaps sparking new interest.

Worries about the economy and the prospects for higher interest rates
conspired to keep the pressure on Milan last week. The weight of forthcoming
capital calls and privatisations, estimated at more than L10,000bn, also
preyed on the market as the new account began last Thursday. This Saturday
will see the price set for one of the privatisations, the 51 per cent of
shares being offered next week in Ina, the insurance group.
The Treasury has already confirmed that the price will be in the range of
L2,200 to L2,700 per share for the 2.04bn shares on offer.

Hints of imminent transformation at Elektrowatt and Motor-Columbus,
Switzerland's two big quoted electric power generators, have been building
in recent months, and more may emerge tomorrow when Elektrowatt reports its
interim results, writes Ian Rodger.
The big questions are whether the two will merge and, if so, who will take
over whom.
Oddly, both are controlled by one of Switzerland's big banks, Elektrowatt by
CS Holding, Motor by Union Bank of Switzerland, so Zurich gnomic pride could
play a big role.
UBS has made clear that it does not regard its Motor holding as strategic,
and Motor's chief executive Ernst Thomke publicly nudged the bank two weeks
ago to put an end to the uncertainty. In March, Oskar Ronner, the new
Elektrowatt chief executive, said the group's main future growth would come
from its industrial division.
As for the likely trend of the interim results to March 30, the electricity
division probably enjoyed buoyant export sales, thanks to unusually heavy
precipitation in Switzerland last winter.
The market will be awaiting publication this week of consumer price indices
for Basle and Geneva.

The key event for German equity markets next week is the opening of
subscriptions for the near DM3bn rights issue from Daimler-Benz, the German
automotive, engineering and aerospace group. It priced the issue 12 days ago
at DM640 a share, a then 20 per cent discount to the existing share price of
DM804.50, writes William Cochrane.
Since then, notes Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, Daimler has
dropped to DM725, in line with a thoroughgoing correction in German cyclical
stocks, and the discount has narrowed accordingly.
The Daimler issue forms part of a projected equity raising total of DM24bn
to DM25bn in the German markets this year, compared with DM15bn to DM16bn in
1993. However, says Mr Frahm, it is thought that major shareholders like
Deutsche Bank, the government of Kuwait and Stella, a holding company owned
by large German industrial and financial companies - owning an aggregate of
51 per cent of the Daimler equity - will take up their rights, easing the
potential pressure on institutional investors. Strategists will also be
looking, on Tuesday, at the latest M3 money supply figures.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Heading for record year - International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bearish sentiment which has dogged most financial markets for the first
half of 1994 has failed to suppress activity in the international equities
market.
While the lacklustre performance of most stock markets has forced companies
to price new share offerings more cheaply to attract investors, the broad
trend towards distributing equity offerings internationally - or adding
international tranches to domestic offerings - shows no sign of abating.
So far this year, Dollars 45.7bn of new international equity offerings has
been absorbed, according to IFR Securities Data, which puts the market on
target for another record year, after last year's Dollars 73.7bn.
The trend for international offerings was kick-started in the mid-1980s,
when a number of governments keen to sell large amounts of equity through
privatisations found that they could get better pricing by targeting foreign
investors. Keen to facilitate their own deals, regulations restricting such
offerings were rapidly adjusted.
Deals such as the UK's British Gas and Spain's Telefonica in the late 1980s
proved that paper placed overseas did not always drift back to the domestic
market.
Re-examining their policies on asset allocation, fund managers began to
increase the weighting of international equities in their portfolios. In
particular, the massive US market became more outward-looking.
'Historically, US investors had been running with 3 to 5 per cent of their
assets in non-US stocks. That has now risen to 7 to 8 per cent, and we think
it could easily double again in the next three years,' said Mr Tom Davis,
head of equity capital markets at Merrill Lynch in New York.
The market for global offerings was also boosted by the introduction of
book-building techniques developed in the US domestic market, which helped
improve transparency.
However, the market has not been reliant on US issuers. In fact, many
participants are sceptical about international tranches, usually comprising
10 to 15 per cent of the total transaction, tacked on to US offerings, often
for league table, rather than distribution purposes.
This year, the normally active new issues market in the US has suffered from
the relative weakness of stock prices, causing many public offerings to be
cancelled.
However, 'a lot of the slack in the US calendar has been picked up by the
explosion of activity in Europe,' according to Mr Davis of Merrill.
The flow of prime European names on the privatisation calendar has been
little affected by more difficult market conditions.
Many governments, concerned about deficit financing problems, are willing to
scale down their pricing expectations, while companies may prefer to wait
for more favourable conditions.
A more competitive environment for deals is also the result of the
proliferation of privatisation programmes among European countries - as well
as what one banker describes as 'a ton of smaller corporate deals'.
Nevertheless, the second half of the year is likely to be dominated by a
spate of large privatisations for the likes of Ina, the Italian insurance
company, Repsol in Spain and Lufthansa in Germany.
Emerging market transactions, which suffered from the sell-off in those
markets earlier this year, could also stage a come-back, although at more
realistic pricing levels, while some analysts expect the stronger
performance of the Japanese market to pave the way for a resurgence of
Japanese convertible offerings.
'There is a global market for stocks now,' says Mr Ian Hannam, director of
Robert Fleming, with London as the main centre for the origination and
distribution of these international offerings.
An international equities column will run in this space every Monday. Our
weekly derivatives column will now run on Thursdays.

FT  20 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: The real reason behind rising yields -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bond markets have had a bad year. In the UK, government bond prices have
fallen by more than 20 per cent, while yields have risen from below 6 1/2
per cent to more than 8 1/2 per cent.
Why have yields risen so far? Fears of rising inflation and higher interest
rates can only be part of the answer. Yields, it is becoming increasingly
clear, are rising because of a global capital shortage.
The demand on the world's supply of capital is beginning to grow just as the
lenders of that capital have deserted the market place.
Bond investors hate inflation and rising interest rates. When the Federal
Reserve raised US interest rates on February 4, yields, especially on US and
UK bonds, already on their way up, rose further still and the consensus had
it that this was because expectations of inflation had increased.
There was some justification for this view. The gap between the yield on a
conventional gilt and that on an index-linked gilt, a useful measure of
inflation expectations, had jumped to almost 4 per cent, while actual
inflation was running at almost half that rate.
However, a rise in inflation expectations can only be part of the
explanation for the rise in bond yields.
'It is interesting,' says Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at S. G. Warburg,
'that since then most inflation forecasts have actually fallen.'
Investors must also be compensated for risk and uncertainty. The Bank of
England, in its latest inflation report, estimates that volatility in the
gilt market doubled between January and May of this year. The Conservative
party's protracted political woes, as well as currency risk and uncertainty
about the strength of economic recovery are responsible for that.
The British government's handling of economic policy has also been blamed.
Certainly, the UK base rate cut on February 8, which, it was later revealed,
Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, had argued against,
was taken very badly by the gilt market.
No doubt it was further unnerved by recent talk of tax cuts to boost the
Conservatives' standing.
Increased risk, however, is not enough to explain the rise in yields. This
leaves one other explanation: yields have risen because the real yield, the
yield over and above inflation and risk, has increased.
Last year, funding the large European government budget deficits was easy. A
scarcity of other worthwhile investments, with most of Europe still in
recession, and relatively low financing costs - due to falling interest
rates - meant that investors willing to buy government bonds were easy to
find.
Mr Sanjay Joshi, head of bond research at Daiwa Europe, estimates that last
year Pounds 16bn of gilts were bought by overseas investors, mainly the
Japanese, the Americans and hedge funds - large pools of speculative capital
which are switched between financial markets to exploit short-term
opportunities.
Now all that has changed. The hedge funds, having pushed up bond prices to
unsustainable heights, have taken their profits and moved on, to
commodities, it seems.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has put up short-term interest rates, the US
economy is growing strongly, and there is evidence that the European
economic recovery is well under way.
US investors, afraid that the dollar will soon begin to rise, and the
Japanese, seeing the yen continue to strengthen, have dropped bonds
denominated in European currencies and taken their money home.
'That colossal increase in government borrowing, which we ignored while
there was all that leveraged money around to mop it up, is now coming back
to haunt us with a vengeance.' says Mr Kit Juckes, international economist
at S. G. Warburg.
Mr Joshi estimates that the hedge funds alone have taken back about Dollars
40bn they had invested in bonds and equities. To say that the bottom has
dropped out of the bond market is perhaps not an exaggeration.
But it may even be worse than that. The government deficits have not gone
away. On top of heavy bond sales by investors this year, there is still more
new stock arriving on the market. The UK alone will probably have to issue
about Pounds 40bn of gilts to finance its deficit this year.
'Just who is going to buy the bonds that are still to be auctioned?' asks Mr
Joshi. Some commentators have even spoken of a funding crisis.
This, however, may be missing the point. Real yields have certainly risen -
to about 4 1/2 per cent in Germany and to more than 5 per cent in the UK, by
some calculations. But this is not necessarily just because the supply of
capital is drying up.
This leaves one final explanation. World economic growth is picking up
speed, most importantly in the US, and capital will be needed to fuel that
growth.
Bond yields have risen because of an impending global capital shortage. The
bond market's bad year looks set to continue.

FT  20 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: Italian deficit keeps investors at bay -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italian bonds took a pounding last week on fears over Italy's swelling
budget deficit. And until Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi makes a clear
commitment to cutting the country's debt, investor confidence is unlikely to
return in a hurry.
The first indications of his government's fiscal stance are likely to be
unveiled within the next six weeks, when it presents its economic and
financial programme to parliament, setting the guidelines for budgetary
policies for the next three years. The document was to have been presented
at the end of May, but was delayed as the government had only taken office a
month earlier.
Moreover, just as the programme was ready for publication, the country's
constitutional court surprised policy-makers with a ruling requiring the
state-run pensions system to pay L30,000bn compensation for under-payment of
pensions since 1983.
This fuelled fears that Italy would be unable to meet this year's L144,000bn
deficit target, which is already set to overshoot by L15,000bn, without a
supplementary budget to cut the shortfall.
'They have to revise their whole fiscal outlook as a result of the ruling,'
said Mr Jose Luis Alzola, economist at Salomon Brothers, who expects the
three-year plan to be announced by mid-July.
While the impact of the pension ruling on this year's funding may be
moderate - if only because the government may spread payments over the next
few years - it has served to highlight the market's unease over Italy's
deficit outlook.
'After the euphoria following the elections, the market was reminded that
the key issue remains the budget deficit and the debt outlook,' said Mr
Graham McDevitt bond strategist at market analysts IDEA. 'The pension ruling
magnified those risks.'
Salomon Brothers' world government bond index shows Italian government bonds
fell by 1.9 per cent last week, the sharpest losses in Europe.
The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent government bond due April 2004 had jumped to
11.03 per cent by Friday afternoon, from 9.93 per cent a week earlier. Its
yield spread over German bonds widened to 388 basis points on Friday from
310 a week earlier. In late April the spread had narrowed to around 250
basis points.
'That level reflected an overshoot - there was too much euphoria after the
elections without real news on the budget front,' says Mr Alzola. However,
he feels that the market has now 'over-reacted on the negative side' and
sees little reason for further substantial spread widening. On the other
hand, 'I don't think we will see a significant narrowing of the spreads
until the economic plan is released and restrictive fiscal measures are
implemented,' he says.
Having been elected on the promise of eventual tax cuts, Mr Berlusconi is
likely to focus on spending cuts, rather than tax increases, to trim the
deficit. And what better place to start than the state pensions system,
which, before the ruling, was set to cost the government around 14 per cent
of GDP this year?
'Painful measures are likely to be needed, as well as a shift towards
private pension funds, so as to curb the increase in expenditure,' says Mr
Colin Warren, European economist at HILFE, a political and economic research
house in London.
The government last week announced plans to promote the development of
private pension funds. There are also plans to raise the retirement age from
60 to 65 for men and from 55 to 60 for women.
'If they convince the market that they're serious about cutting spending,
for instance on pensions, the market could reward them with lower yields -
which in turn could lower the interest burden on their debt,' says Mr
Alzola.
But a far-reaching pension reform will take considerable time to implement,
and some observers are arguing for indirect tax increases to boost revenue
in the short term.
'An increase in indirect taxes . . . would have the greatest immediate
effect,' argues Mr Warren at HILFE.
However, higher indirect taxes could threaten the inflation outlook, further
depressing bonds.
Dealers will be closely watching this week's release of June CPI data which
may see the year-on-year inflation rate fall below 4 per cent for the first
time this year.
In its budget plan, the government is also expected to address the problem
of refinancing next year's masses of maturing debt.
Around L295,000bn of government debt matures next year, of which some
L190,000bn is long-term. In comparison, this year has seen redemptions of
L80,000bn.
The government was hoping to pre-fund some of this refinancing this year,
but given the current condition of the bond market, 'it is doubtful they
will be over-funding this year,' said one dealer.

The stage is set for a volatile few days in the bund market ahead of two
significant events later this week.
On Thursday, the Bundesbank's policy-making council holds its traditional
'out of town' meeting, this year in the east German city of Potsdam, near
Berlin. As usual, the meeting will be followed by a press conference in
which Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, is likely to comment on
the state of the German economy and field questions on the course of
monetary policy.
At around the same time - perhaps at the press conference itself - the
Bundesbank is set to unveil details of M3 money supply in May. After growth
of more than 15 per cent on an annualised, seasonally adjusted basis in the
previous two months, the consensus forecast is for a modest reduction in the
rate of growth to about 14.5 per cent.
Any more than that and the market will be disappointed. Evidence of a
slowdown in bank lending or a pick-up in long-term capital formation will be
deemed positive.
For the past two years the out of town meeting has gone hand-in-hand with a
piece of good news. Last year in Leipzig, the Bundesbank cut the discount
rate. This is unlikely to be repeated on Thursday but the central bank may
have other surprises up its sleeve.

After last week's troubling late sell-off, which pushed the yield on the
benchmark 30-year bond up to 7.44 per cent, traders and investors are likely
to be grateful that the absence of any important economic releases this week
should allow them to catch their breath.
The only two sets of data likely to have much of an impact upon prices are
the April trade report and the May durable goods orders.
The trade numbers are out tomorrow and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the
Wall Street brokers, predicts that the trade deficit of goods and services
will have widened from Dollars 7.5bn in March to Dollars 8.5bn in April. The
firm expects the deficit to have widened because it believes the recent
slowdown in economic growth will have led to a larger fall in exports than
in imports.
Normally, this would not prompt much of a reaction in Treasury prices,
because the bond market does not pay a great deal of attention to the trade
figures. Yet, given the fact that the weakness of the dollar helped to
undermine Treasury prices last week as investors are always wary of imported
inflation, any larger than expected widening in the trade deficit could
unsettle the US currency, and with it Treasury prices.
As for the durable goods orders, DLJ forecasts a modest increase in orders
of 0.2 per cent in May, compared with growth of 0.1 per cent in April.

There seems little in prospect this week to help Britain's confused and
uncertain gilts market recover its poise against a background of weak bond
markets world-wide.
In the face of investor reluctance to buy fixed-coupon bonds, the Bank of
England played safe on Friday by announcing the auction on June 29 of
floating-rate gilts due 1999.
However, instead of welcoming the announcement as a step to protect the
fixed-interest gilts market from further supply, the market slid sharply on
the belief that the decision highlighted low confidence in conventional
gilts.
With few domestic economic indicators due this week, today's broad money and
M4 lending figures for May will be scrutinised for inflationary
implications. The best that can be said is that they should cause little
concern if they turn out close to the consensus forecasts of 5.8 per cent
annual growth for M4 and Pounds 1.9bn for bank and building society lending.
Following last week's warning from Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England
governor, of higher interest rates at some point in the future, it will be a
big surprise if Wednesday's minutes of his May 4 monetary meeting with Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, do not chronicle the end of the 'bias
towards easing' in monetary policy.

Japanese government bond prices have been weakening in tandem with
international bond markets, but have also been hit by rising expectations of
an economic recovery.
Shifts in funds from bonds to stocks are likely to continue this week.
Massive selling by foreign and domestic institutions depressed the No 164
10-year government bond last week pushing up the yield to 4.41 per cent, the
highest since June last year.
Economic data to be released this week is likely to confirm such views,
placing further pressure on bond prices. The diffusion index for April, the
leading indicator for business sentiment, which is scheduled to be released
tomorrow, is expected to be sharply higher than the 'boom or bust' line of
50.
The weakness in the government bond market prompted the ministry of finance
to postpone its four-year bond offering for the third consecutive week. The
government is expected to offer 10-year bonds next week and traders now
regard the medium-term bond as unlikely to be issued this month.
'Recovery fever is gripping the market,' says Mr Marshall Gittler, bond
analyst at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. He expects continued weakness in the bond
market this week, with the yield curve steepening, as the central bank is
likely to maintain short-term interest rates at the current low levels.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: Markets focus on dollar under pressure -
Currency Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchange markets will continue to focus attention on the dollar,
which was under severe pressure last week as US Treasuries fell and the
outlook for recovery in Europe improved.
In the absence of concerted central bank intervention after the dollar
plunged below significant technical lows against the D-Mark last Friday,
analysts expect the markets to push down the US currency in an effort to
test the resolve of central banks to take action.
Traders will be watching for changes in the US and European bond markets for
clues on how currencies will perform. Some observers say bearish sentiment
will dominate global bond markets with inflationary concerns causing jitters
in US Treasuries and worries about excessively strong growth in Germany
hitting the bund market.
In recent weeks the dollar has been linked to US Treasuries. Although the US
currency showed an upward trend last Friday as falling commodity prices gave
US bonds a lift, the Fed has not eased inflationary concerns and Treasuries
are likely to remain vulnerable next week, bringing the dollar down with
them.
In Europe, where the link between currencies and bond markets is reversed,
the D-Mark and the Swiss franc are likely to benefit from the fall in
European bonds.
Without any key statistics to guide the market this week, foreign exchange
traders will look to the release of the Fed's tan book on Wednesday, which
helps it evaluate the US economy in advance of the July 5-6 FOMC meeting.
Although figures which emerged from the US last week suggested a moderation
in the pace of expansion, officials are still worried about inflation and
analysts expect the tan book will do nothing to dampen expectations of
further tightening by the Fed during the summer months.
The markets will also be watching Mr Alan Greenspan's testimony before the
House Budget Committee next Wednesday. Mr Greenspan will be discussing
inflation and interest rates, giving currency traders an indication of US
monetary policy.
In Germany, analysts are expecting data next week to show further strong
growth in the M3 money supply measure for the month of May. M3 growth rates
have this year far exceeded the target range of 4 to 6 per cent.
Increasing optimism about German recovery have caused expectations of a
German interest rate cut to recede, giving strength to the D-Mark.
Sterling may have trouble rising above Dollars 1.52 as markets have been
reluctant to buy the pound above that level. This trend is also keeping
sterling down against the D-Mark.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: Kuala Lumpur mirage may prove fruitful -
The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Nomura Securities announced early last week that it was setting up a
multi-million dollar fund to invest in the Malaysian stock market, Kuala
Lumpur traders thought the rescue boat had finally arrived.
The Kuala Lumpur market was one of the world's high flyers last year, rising
98 per cent.
This year the story has been different. Analysts said that the new Nomura
fund could be investing as much as MDollars 7bn (Dollars 2.7bn) in Malaysian
stocks. There were hopes of an upturn in a market that had dropped 20 per
cent since the beginning of January.
In the event it was all something of a mirage.
Somewhere along the line someone had got the figures wrong. Yes, the
Japanese were investing - but the figure was closer to MDollars 700m than
MDollars 7bn.
Yet a bullish breeze is beginning to blow through Kuala Lumpur.
Daily trading volumes have increased from only 50m shares at the end of May
to an average of more than 300m last week. Foreign institutions have become
cautious about what is regarded as one of the most volatile bourses in the
region, but locals are piling back in.
'The amount of liquidity in this market is fairly amazing,' says Mr Lum Ming
Jang of Phileo Peregrine Securities in Kuala Lumpur.
'It was the retail sector, not the institutions, which drove the market to
all-time highs at the end of December and in early January. After a few
months rest it looks like the individuals are coming into the market again -
the difference now is that while volumes have increased there has been no
big jump in values.'
1993 was the year Kuala Lumpur firmly established itself as the leading
market in south-east Asia. The retail sector caught stock market fever. On
some heady days last year trading volumes in Kuala Lumpur exceeded those of
New York.
Kuala Lumpur became a favourite off-loading point for foreign funds
searching for investment opportunities in Asia.
Out of an estimated total of Dollars 20bn that was transferred from
developed markets to the bourses of Asia Pacific over the year, about
Dollars 4bn went to Malaysia.
Kuala Lumpur's market capitalisation rose more than 150 per cent in 1993 to
MDollars 620bn: the KLSE now ranks fifth in terms of market capitalisation
in Asia Pacific behind Tokyo, Osaka, Hong Kong and Sydney.
Kuala Lumpur also has a significant influence on the smaller Singapore
bourse. It is estimated that up to 60 per cent of Singapore's daily trading
volumes are in Malaysian stocks, traded on an over-the-counter basis.
After the euphoria of last year and the sharp correction in early January,
there seems little consensus on future market trends.
Mr Eugene Morais, a regional director at Baring Securities, says that with
the Malaysian economy expected to grow at well over 8 per cent this year he
is advising clients to overweight Kuala Lumpur stocks on a regional basis.
'The good quality rather than the more speculative stocks are the ones to go
for in this quiet period' says Mr Morais.
Mr Manu Bhaskaran, a regional analyst with Crosby Securities, has a more
cautious view. 'Kuala Lumpur is still the most expensive market in the
region with p/e's running at 23 or 24 times. In the long term prospects are
good but investors should be wary.'
Most of Malaysia's economic fundamentals look good. Exports grew about 20
per cent in the first two months of 1994.
After a sharp drop in both foreign and domestic investment last year there
was a large jump in investments in the first quarter of this year. Officials
are confidently predicting annual growth of more than 7 per cent over the
next 25 years.
The government has committed itself to a multi-billion dollar infrastructure
programme. Infrastructure related stocks are some of the hottest items on
the market.
On the negative side, imports, much of which comprise capital equipment like
aircraft and power generation materials, have surged this year. Inflation is
edging up to near the 5 per cent cent level.
In the past local investors have paid scant regard to fundamentals.
In Malaysia politics and business are closely interlinked. Political
connections are often viewed as more important than balance sheets. The
shares of companies with known or perceived links to figures in the
government hierarchy were the star performers last year.
A main reason for the recent retail rally has been talk of a general
election, possibly as early as August.
The government led by Dr Mahathir Mohamad, is in no danger of losing its
strong control over virtually every aspect of the nation's life.
Elections, however, are a time when so called 'money politics' comes to the
fore, of the granting of favours to politically supportive groups and
companies.
A combination of rising interest rates in the US and falling bond prices
caused a sizeable chunk of foreign funds to be withdrawn from the Malaysian
market this year.
Many institutional fund managers, frightened by the highly speculative
nature of the market, baled out before the plunge in share values.
One factor that has made foreigners wary of Kuala Lumpur has been a number
of abuses in share transactions and the lack of market transparency.
In recent months a newly formed Securities Commission has made considerable
progress in righting some of the more blatant deficiencies of the market.
The SC has issued strict new guidelines on corporate manoeuverings such as
reverse takeovers and backdoor listings.
Locals have blamed the SC for this year's market malaise. 'There is no use
having a clinically clean market if it's a dead market,' said one broker.
'Misinformation and rumour mongering, not regulations, stand in the way of a
fundamentally sound market,' countered Mr Mohamed Abdul Majid, the SC's
chairman.
International fund managers say policy changes by Bank Negara, the central
bank, have been a dampener on market activity.
In January Bank Negara started imposing a series of measures to prevent
foreign speculation on the ringgit, the Malaysian dollar.
Fund managers say a lack of consistency in Bank Negara policy, coupled with
troublesome regulations on the movement of currency, has deterred many
foreign investors.
The Japanese, however, seem undeterred by the negative factors.
The amount of funds from Japan being invested might not be as spectacular as
at first envisaged but it's still being seen as a significant move.
'We are very bullish on the Malaysian market,' said one Japanese fund
manager.
Not everyone will follow Japan's lead. Late last year Japanese investors
plunged into the Malaysian market - and got badly burnt.

STRATEGY
Having caught the top of the emerging market bubble before the storm broke
at the start of the year, reducing allocations in, for example, Hong Kong,
Thailand, Turkey and Poland, Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets now
believes that the time is right to move back in.
Mr Arnab Banerji, F &amp; C's chief investment officer, notes that the downturn
in performance experienced this year has left exceptional scope for
outperformance henceforward. He remains bearish on Hong Kong, favouring
South Korea and Taiwan. In Latin America Argentina and Peru feature, while
he is neutral on Brazil for the time being. Elsewhere, F &amp; C favour
Portugal, and have slightly increased allocations in South Africa and
Zimbabwe.
CAIRO
An acceleration of the country's privatisation programme is planned, with
the sale of assets worth up to EPounds 3.2bn between now and the end of the
year, Reuter reports.
Mr Atef Obeid, the Public Sector minister, said the reform programme now had
its own momentum and slowing down was out of the question.
He said the government had exceeded its privatisation targets for the period
up to March 1994, selling assets worth EPounds 3.5bn and offering for sale
assets worth EPounds 6.2b.
JAKARTA
Indonesia's total foreign investment approvals reached Dollars 5.1bn in the
first five months of 1994 and should exceed Dollars 10bn for the full year,
the Antara news agency said.
HARARE
Zimbabwe has said that it intends to speed up the privatisation of those
state-owned companies which are a drain on the economy. Last month the
government said that it would commercialise the operations of the Dairy
Marketing Board, the Cold Storage Commission and the Cotton Marketing Board.

FT  20 JUN 94 / The Markets: Aluminium figures awaited - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The aluminium market is anxiously awaiting today's production statistics
from the International Primary Aluminium Institute to make sure that the
voluntary cuts in output agreed by the big producing countries earlier this
year are continuing to bite.
It is widely anticipated that the IPAI figures will show production in May,
in countries outside the former Soviet Union, fell by about another 600
tonnes a day. This follows a drop of 570 tonnes a day in April and one of
632 tonnes in March. By April the annual production rate had fallen to 14.4m
tonnes, a drop of 3.2 per cent and equivalent to 486,000 tonnes of
aluminium.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, says
further falls in the daily output rate can be expected in June and July.
Nevertheless, he suggests that there will be no substantial fall in the
highly-visible London Metal Exchange stocks - now standing at more than 2m
tonnes - this summer. Although the aluminium industry has started on the
road to recovery, he recalls that when aluminium seemed to be recovering
from the last recession in the 1980s LME stocks stopped falling and prices
slumped again.
Mr Stewart Spector, who produces the Spector Report on the aluminium
industry, says the IPAI statistics show that many smelters have not cut
output as quickly as their formal announcements suggested. 'However, because
production is declining and demand is rising faster than anticipated, the
end results will be the same. There will be a full industry recovery in 1995
and production in 1996 will be nearly 100 per cent of capacity.'
Also today in Moscow the second round of negotiations will take place
between De Beers, which controls 80 per cent of the uncut diamond market,
and Russian officials about a new contract with the cartel organised by the
South African group. Some Russians are seeking large changes and it is
unlikely that agreement will be reached quickly.

FT  20 JUN 94 / The Markets: Oil becomes a security risk barometer - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Markets are notoriously bad at assessing political or security risks. Nor is
it easy for investors to know just how far markets are discounting such
risks in advance. Yet the questions cannot be sidestepped.
Would the dollar now be substantially lower and US bond yields higher
without the row over North Korea's nuclear intentions? How far do recent
rises in commodity prices reflect concern over global flashpoints? And to
what extent are the more mundane political worries of the developed world
exerting upward pressure on global bond yields?
It is hard to believe that the dollar can be playing much of a safe haven
role when east Asian markets have resolutely failed to panic. Even in South
Korea share price declines have been less than catastrophic, given the
nature of the threat. And there are more fundamental questions, anyway,
about what constitutes a safe haven in today's circumstances.
If the threat from rogue nuclear powers in the third world is one of global
incineration, there is not much point in markets seeking to discount it. But
for the outward-bound survivalists who persist in packing shotguns and baked
beans, the currencies of the remoter reaches of the southern hemisphere
would seem a better bet than the dollar. If, on the other hand, the threat
is one of destabilising regional conflict, the economic consequences may not
be wholly adverse. It was, after all, the Korean War which set Japan on the
path to its economic miracle.
As for commodities, the traditional bolt hole, gold, has not been notably
buoyant. But is it really a safe haven any more? In a high-technology world
where financial transaction costs have collapsed, it is much easier to
transfer financial balances from one end of the globe to the other at the
press of a button than to shift bars of gold.
The barbaric metal, as Keynes called it, may be a hedge against political or
inflationary risk in third world countries with under-developed financial
markets. Yet the market which nowadays seems a more plausible barometer of
security risk is oil.
The threat of conflict in Korea could be expected to lead to precautionary
stockbuilding. And now that there is a fully developed market in oil,
complete with derivatives trading and the rest, hedge funds can add
financial leverage to the equation. Sure enough, the oil price was rising
strongly last week. It may not be quite the same as a safe haven, but it
clearly struck some speculators, as well as cash buyers, as a safe bet. But
where stock markets are concerned, past history suggests that investors
prefer to address global flashpoints when the bad news actually occurs.
TECTONICS
That is not to say that shifts in the global and regional political balance
are unimportant. Usually they are reflection of longer run changes in
underlying economic strength. And a further lesson from history is that when
a hegemonic power goes into political and economic decline, and is forced to
cede its role to another leading actor, the transition can be associated
with volcanic upheavals in markets.
Between the wars, when the US turned isolationist and was reluctant to see
the dollar take over sterling's role in the global system, international
capital flows were subject to interruption, trade friction turned into
rampant protectionism, stock markets crashed and currencies were prone to
sustained misalignment. In the 1980s and 1990s the transition is more
complicated. To the extent that the US is passing its economic mantle, it is
not to a single hegemonic power but to more than one country, with the
developed world's only big creditor, Japan, reluctant to be primus inter
pares.
We also have the additional hazard that the relatively stable bipolar
nuclear world has given way to a more fluid and less easily defined
political order. It is not surprising then that over the past two decades or
more, when the Japanese have given in to US pressure to support the dollar,
the world has once again seen constant interruptions to capital flows,
growing resort to bilateralism in US-Japanese trade relations and a Japanese
version of the 1929 Wall Street Crash.
One lesson is that when the global system is coping with huge adjustments in
the balance of power, currency markets need to be free to act as an escape
valve for the pressure. The collapse of the Bretton Woods system was, after
all, a symptom of what the historian Paul Kennedy identified as imperial
over-reach in the US. The point applies with equal force to regional power
shifts, such as German reunification. At times like this, the tectonic
plates are not prone to obey the dictates of fixed exchange rate systems.
SOUTHERN DISCOMFORT
In contrast, bond markets this year have not only failed to act as an escape
valve, but have added to political risk, at least in the short run. Take
Italy, where the yield on 10-year benchmark bonds have topped 10 per cent.
The resulting high real interest rates savagely impair the Berlusconi
government's ability to stabilise a huge inherited public sector debt stock.
Spain, whose bond yields have also topped 10 per cent, faces a comparable
bind.
Yet these are countries with a dismal record in managing their public
finances. The Italian administration consists of a motley collection of
politicians, short on experience; the Spanish government is discredited by
scandal and corruption. If the effect is to stiffen the sinews of the
politicians and force them to confront the need to raise taxes and cut
expenditure, the longer run impact will prove benign. The alternative - a
prolonged bond market strike and hyper-inflation - is not a recipe for
stabilising anything.

FT  20 JUN 94 / The Markets: Privatising the world - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Between 1988 and 1992, 25 developing countries undertook privatisations
worth, in total, no less than Dollars 61.6bn. Of these Dollars 19.8bn were
of infrastructure - telecommunications, power generation, power and gas
distribution, railways, roads, ports and water supply. Furthermore, almost
three quarters of the total privatisations and two thirds of the
privatisations of infrastructure occurred in 1991 and 1992 alone. What is
happening is little short of a redefinition of the economic role of the
state.
These fascinating figures come from the World Bank's latest World
Development Report, out today.* Just how big a change this is I can
recognise from personal experience. When I joined the staff of the World
Bank in 1971, the old orthodoxy - that development simply demanded higher
resource mobilisation and investment - was already being modified by concern
about price distortions and by calls for better project appraisals. But few
questioned the state's role in the running of such industries as steel, let
alone power.
This is true no longer. The reason for the change is the shocking waste.
This waste is particularly significant in infrastructure, because
infrastructure is itself so important. Without clean water, sewerage, roads,
railways, ports, energy and telecommunications, life is intolerable and
development inconceivable. Ironically, it is the central place of these
activities that was used to justify the state's role as provider. Too often
this has meant that the more vital is the service, the worse it has been
run.
On average, says the report, 40 per cent of the power-generating capacity in
developing countries is unavailable for production. Only 60 per cent of
locomotives were available for service in Latin America in 1991. In
sub-Saharan Africa, almost Dollars 13bn worth of roads - one third of those
built in the past twenty years - have eroded because of lack of maintenance.
In a 1988 study of Nigerian manufacturers, 92 per cent were found to own
their own power-generating equipment because of the chronically unreliable
public service. But these were operating at only 25 per cent of capacity,
because the government forbade them to sell their surplus power.
Whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad. Nor is the price of such
follies small. Developing countries invest Dollars 200bn a year in
infrastructure, which accounts for almost 60 per cent of total public
investment in the middle-income countries. But failure to charge adequately
for power, water and railways imposes an annual fiscal burden of some
Dollars 120bn, the benefits of which accrue disproportionately to the better
off. Improved efficiency could, argues the Bank, also increase developing
country gross domestic product by Dollars 55bn.
As the chart shows for privatisation of telecommunications, the gains from a
transformation can be enormous. This is why the policy agenda on
infrastructure has moved away from concern with investment towards concern
with service as 'the goal and measure of development in infrastructure'.
The report's main message is that 'the causes of past poor performance, and
the source of improved performance, lie in the incentives facing providers'.
Its main recommendations are: first, manage infrastructure like a business,
not a bureaucracy; second, introduce competition wherever feasible; third,
give users and other stakeholders a strong voice; and, fourth, nurture
public-private partnership, notably in finance.
How can these improvements be made? Infrastructure, notes the report, can be
provided in four main ways: by public ownership and operation; by public
ownership, with private operation; by private ownership and operation, often
under regulation; and by community and user provision. The first, though the
classic approach, is the least effective by far. Admittedly, public entities
do sometimes perform well for a time, but they usually succumb to political
interference in the end.
The others alternatives all have some merit, depending on circumstances. But
privatisation is the obvious route wherever competition is feasible.
Contrary to the views of many economists, privatisation can also be the best
alternative for monopoly services. This is mainly because privatisation
automatically creates separation from government, along with a powerful
countervailing force to politicians, in the form of shareholders.
As with any revolution in its early stages, there remains much to be learned
 -about how best to regulate privatised utilities, for example, or how to
involve the private sector in infrastructure provision. But this is already
a hugely encouraging transformation, not least because it dethrones the
foolish belief that the level of aggregate investment matters more than
where and how investment is implemented. This folly is the main reason why
the real income per head of the Czech Republic, 60 years ago among the most
industrialised countries in Europe, is only 40 per cent of Austria's,
despite decades of high, but largely wasted, investment.
The report is, in fact, almost as relevant to advanced industrial countries
as to the developing ones. Just how relevant can be judged from the
concentration, particularly in the political left, on the need for higher
investment. While useful, higher investment does not begin to be enough.
This report shows that incentives must also be transformed, to ensure that
scarce resources are used far less wastefully than hitherto.

FT  20 JUN 94 / International Company News: Cott warns of attack from other
cola makers

<TEXT>
Cott Corporation, the fast-growing Canadian maker of private-label soft
drinks, has cautioned that an intensifying counter-attack from Coca-Cola and
PepsiCo may dampen its earnings growth this year.
Cott said in its annual report that price competition from national brand
soft drinks abated during much of its fiscal year to January 1994. But Coke
and Pepsi have hit back hard in recent months by cutting prices, widening
retailers' margins and reducing the cost of cola concentrate to bottlers.
Cott said it expected the strong response to continue throughout the coming
year in the UK and Canada, and 'sporadically' in the US and other countries.
Rising sales volumes, productivity improvements and cost controls would only
partially offset downward pressure on North American prices, Cott said.
Cott's net income almost trebled last year to CDollars 35.4m (Pounds 17.1m)
and its sales doubled to CDollars 665.4m. The strong growth rate continued
in the three months to April 30.
But Cott's shares lost almost a quarter of their value on the Toronto stock
exchange last week, tumbling from CDollars 26 to CDollars 19.75.
Cott's critics also question its accounting practices.

Anheuser-Busch, the biggest brewer in the US, is continuing the
international assault on China's beer market with the planned takeover of
the Zhongde brewery in Wuhan on the Yangtze River.
The group, which produces Budweiser beer, has announced that it would take
an 80 per cent stake in the Wuhan brewery and expected the deal to be
completed by the end of this year.
Last year, Anheuser-Busch secured a 5 per cent stake in the Tsingtao
brewery, China's best known brewer and one of nine companies selected for a
listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
The US company's investment in the Wuhan brewery will be made through
Anheuser-Busch International and is part of aggressive expansion plans in
emerging markets.
It is certain to pay a premium price for its stake in the Zhongde
Chinese-German joint venture, which was established in 1988.

FT  20 JUN 94 / International Company News: Life company farms out
derivatives management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confederation Life, Canada's fourth biggest life company, has passed on the
management of its derivatives portfolio to Sumitomo Bank Capital Markets.
Many companies have become increasingly nervous about using derivatives,
following losses in recent months by Metallgesellschaft, Procter &amp; Gamble,
and others.
While it is highly unusual for a company to farm out all its derivatives
management to an outside specialist, the growing need for sophisticated
operational controls and computer systems when using derivatives has made it
increasingly difficult for companies to manage risk effectively in-house.
SBCM will take over the risk management activities of Confederation Treasury
Services under guidelines and policies set by the company. 'We will manage
their books, but some transactions will require authorisation,' said SBCM.
It will use its Prism front-to-back office system, developed in-house, to
perform services such as daily valuation, risk analysis, trade
confirmations, payments and rate resets.
Prism supports SBCM's current portfolio of over 10,000 swap transactions in
17 currencies. SBCM's Derivatives Products Group has 170 employees in New
York, London and Hong Kong, having poached teams from Pru-Bache and Security
Pacific in the late 1980s.

FT  20 JUN 94 / International Company News: Timber group in Dollars 1bn
alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesian and Malaysian corporate interests are to form one of the world's
biggest timber concerns in a complex deal valued at around Dollars 1bn.
Barito Pacific Timber, one of Indonesia's largest companies and the world's
leading plywood exporter, will purchase about 70 per cent of Construction
and Supplies House group (Cash), a relatively small, loss-making building
supplies company listed on the Kuala Lumpur exchange. At the same time Cash
is to buy a 30 per cent interest in Barito Pacific.
The deal is the biggest cross-border transaction so far between listed
companies in south-east Asia. Malaysia and Indonesia account for more than
90 per cent of global tropical plywood production and analysts suggest the
two countries could be seeking greater control of plywood prices through the
alliance.
Barito Pacific has timber concessions in Indonesia of more than 5m hectares
 -an area larger than Switzerland. The company is controlled by Mr Prajogo
Pangestu, an Indonesian Chinese who has become one of Indonesia's leading
corporate figures.
Apart from Barito, Mr Prajogo has a 10 per cent holding in Astra
International, one of Indonesia's biggest conglomerates, and has business
partnerships with two of the children of President Suharto.
Last year about 12 per cent of Barito was listed on the Jakarta stock
exchange and the company now accounts for more than 10 per cent of the stock
market's total capitalisation. Private family interests of Mr Prajogo
control the rest of Barito.
At a news conference in Kuala Lumpur, Mr Prajogo said the alliance with the
Cash group was the first step in plans for Barito to go international.
Analysts feel Mr Prajogo has other reasons for the move.
Recent industrial disputes and riots in Indonesia have made the small but
economically powerful Chinese community nervous. The Cash deal effectively
moves a large part of Mr Prajogo's private assets offshore.
By injecting a substantial part of his private interests into a listed
Malaysian concern, Mr Prajogo will take advantage of the high price/earnings
ratios commanded by timber companies on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange.
Foreign fund managers are also seen to favour Kuala Lumpur-listed companies
over those listed in Jakarta.
On completion of the deal, Mr Prajogo will still retain control of Barito
and own more than 60 per cent of Cash. The newly enlarged Cash will become
one of the biggest timber companies on the Kuala Lumpur exchange.
The terms of the transaction, valued at MDollars 2.59m (Dollars 1bn),
include Mr Prajogo injecting privately held interests in Papua New Guinea
and China into Cash in exchange for newly issued Cash shares. Cash will use
a combination of rights issues, cash and irredeemable, convertible unsecured
loan stocks to purchase 30 per cent of Barito shares.

<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the largest US long-distance telephone company, has won a Supreme
Court ruling which will force smaller rivals to continue to publish
commercially sensitive information.
The Federal Communications Commission, the industry's regulator, had earlier
ruled that MCI, the second largest carrier, need not publish details of
agreements which did not match the company's published tariffs.
The ruling, though, was overturned in a federal appeals court, a decision
that has been confirmed in the Supreme Court. The courts ruled the FCC had
exceeded the discretion it has under statute to alter the filing
requirements.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Japanese regional bank has pulled out of a finance ministry-inspired
merger with two competitors, a setback to government attempts to reorganise
the weakest local financial institutions.
Mr Yukio Shimodate, managing director of Kita-Nippon Bank, in Morioka,
northern Japan, announced over the weekend his decision to withdraw from a
proposed merger with bad debt-laden Tokuyo City Bank and Shokusan Bank. The
merger would have threatened the survival of Kita-Nippon, he maintained.
The plan, proposed in April by Kita-Nippon with MoF backing, ran into
intense opposition from customers and businesses, on the grounds that
Tokuyo's bad debts would weaken the other partners.
A Kita-Nippon consumer group had collected 20,000 signatures opposing the
scheme, in an almost unheard of confrontation with government policy. Unions
were also anxious that the costs of writing down some of Tokuyo City's
estimated Y100bn bad debts would hit bonuses and add to the risk of branch
closures.
This was to have been the largest of a series of regional bank mergers
orchestrated by the MoF in an attempt to encourage them to share costs in
the face of growing competition in local banking from Tokyo-based city
banks.
Most regional banks have a solid client base of local business borrowers,
but some second tier banks have built up problem loans from over-lending in
the late 1980s. The three in the aborted merger are second tier banks.

It is certain to pay a premium price for its stake in the Zhongde
Chinese-German joint venture, which was established in 1988 and produces the
Steinbrau brand. It plans to use Wuhan as a base for production of
Budweiser.
Anheuser-Busch last year acquired a 17.7 per cent stake in Grupo Modelo,
Mexico's largest brewer for Dollars 477m. The Wuhan investment would be its
first majority stake abroad.
Foster's Brewing of Australia and Anheuser-Busch are leading the charge
among international brewers to secure a niche in the Chinese market, but
they are far from the only players.
San Miguel, Carlsberg, Becks, Pabst Blue Ribbon and Holstein are among
foreign companies who have either established joint ventures or licensing
arrangements with local brewers.
China is the world's third largest and fastest growing beer market. Per
capita consumption at 8.4 litres is negligible compared with 92 litres in
the US and 158 in Germany.
China last year produced 12m tons of beer, passing Germany to become the
world's second biggest producer after the US.

FT  20 JUN 94 / International Company News: Liberty Life plans global
convertible bond offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liberty Life, South Africa's largest proprietary life insurer, is preparing
to launch the first global offering of convertible bonds for a South African
company.
The issue marks an important step in the country's return to the
international financial markets, following its first non-racial elections in
May.
The plan to raise up to Dollars 500m globally is ambitious, given the
relatively low profile of South African companies among international
investors. However, the deal should benefit from the increased weighting of
South Africa in many international investment portfolios.
The convertible bonds are likely to have a relatively high coupon of about 6
per cent, given the large size of the transaction, and a maturity of 10
years.
The bonds will be convertible into Liberty Life shares at a premium of 10 to
12 per cent, according to Robert Fleming, the UK investment bank charged
with arranging the transaction.
On Thursday, Fleming will lead a visit by underwriters and investment
managers to South Africa. Subsequently, roadshows will be held in Singapore,
Tokyo and Hong Kong as well as cities in the US and Europe, over a two-week
period.
Liberty Life, South Africa's fourth largest company, was chosen to take a
leading role in the country's return to the international capital markets
because of its particular attractions for international equity investors.
As well as its stakes in top South African companies like Standard Bank,
South African Breweries and Premier Group, the group also has substantial
offshore holdings. The interests of its 57 per cent-owned, UK-based
subsidiary Transatlantic Holdings include Sun Life, the UK life insurer, and
Capital Shopping Centres, the retail development company which was recently
listed on the London Stock Exchange.
It is planned that around Dollars 100m of the bond proceeds will be used in
the development of Liberty Life's business in South Africa and about Dollars
200m will be used to repay existing debt.
The company 'has required a lot of mezzanine borrowing for the last 15
years,' which will now be replaced with longer-term financing, according to
Mr Donald Gordon, chairman. He added that he would expect the bonds to be
converted into equity quite rapidly.
With regard to the remaining proceeds of the offering, Mr Gordon commented
that 'we like to have a bit of a war chest'. He declined to comment on any
specific targets, but observed that the reversal in the American interest
rate cycle has increased the receptiveness of companies which until recently
were unwilling to enter into discussions.

FT  20 JUN 94 / UK Company News: BET incentive gives directors Pounds 4.6m
boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Executive directors at BET, the business services group which returned to
the black for 1993-94, stand to gain Pounds 4.6m from an incentive plan
established during the year.
The annual report also shows that the total remuneration of Mr John Clark,
chief executive, rose by 30 per cent from Pounds 708,000 to Pounds 924,000,
including Pounds 281,000 in bonuses and Pounds 163,000 in pension
contributions.
The report says that the group, which is reviewing its remuneration strategy
for senior executives, 'continues to view share-based incentive schemes as a
key motivator for them to deliver superior performance and increases in
shareholder value'.
On Friday the shares closed at 118p - just 2p above the year's low.
The group's remuneration committee, led by Lord Tebbit, operates the
medium-term incentive plan, which is described as a key component of its
revised strategy. It has set target benefits for 60 eligible executives 'to
recognise the performance and contribution of participants during the
turnround period (1991-93) and their continuing superior performance during
the next three to five years'. The group has made an initial provision of
Pounds 2m.
In order to trigger the benefit the share price must reach 'a minimum
predetermined threshold' and exceed the FT-SE-A All-Share Index 'by a
challenging margin'. However, details are not given.
Awards will be made in BET shares bought at the market price. Recipients
will have to hold the shares for at least six months.
Last month BET announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 92m in the year to April
2, compared with losses of Pounds 9.8m.
Sir John Egan, chief executive of BAA, the privatised UK airports group, was
paid a total of Pounds 544,000 last year, up 33 per cent on 1992-93, the
annual report shows. His performance-related bonus increased from Pounds
82,000 to Pounds 119,000, and he received pension contributions of Pounds
11,000 in addition to salary and taxable benefits of Pounds 414,000.

FT  20 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Pru completes Pounds 160m deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential, the insurance company, is expected to complete two property
deals worth more than Pounds 160m within the next 10 days, writes Bethan
Hutton.
One deal, worth an estimated Pounds 90m, is for Wimpey's 50 per cent stake
in Little Britain, a central London office development. The other is for a
half-share in the Cwmbran shopping centre in south Wales, for which it will
pay Ladbroke Group about Pounds 75m.
Prudential indicated earlier this year that it had up to Pounds 1bn to
invest in commercial property during 1994. The completion of these two
purchases will mean it has spent almost half that amount.

FT  20 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Swiss banking licence for Hinduja group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British-based Hinduja international trading group has been granted a
banking licence by Swiss authorities for Amas, its Geneva-based finance and
asset management company.
The new bank, Amas Bank (Switzerland), is expected to focus on niche
markets, providing private banking and portfolio management services to
wealthy individuals, and capitalising on the group's Indian links to advise
on investment opportunities in India.
Amas' application for a banking licence was overshadowed by allegations of
drug-money laundering, but these were dismissed as nonsense by the Hinduja
family, as Amas was not a deposit-taking business. The fact that it has now
been granted a banking licence could be seen as confirmation by Swiss
authorities that the allegations were unfounded.
The private Hinduja group is run by four brothers of the billionaire Hinduja
family, with interests apart from finance, including trading, manufacturing,
and infrastructure.

FT  20 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Baxi down 25% to Pounds 6.87m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baxi Partnership, which makes domestic heating boilers and claims to be the
UK's largest employee-owned manufacturer, made profits of Pounds 6.87m
before tax and profit-sharing in the year ended April 2, down 25 per cent on
last year's Pounds 9.16m, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey.
Turnover was 8 per cent higher at Pounds 77m, primarily because of a six
months' contribution from recently-acquired HS Group. The profit fall was
caused by intense competition in the UK heating market and development costs
in aluminium castings.
The poorer performance means employee shareholders will get an 18 per cent
(20 per cent) share of profits, or Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 1.87m).

FT  20 JUN 94 / International Company News: O'Reilly again gets the bounce
of the ball - The international media ambitions of the former rugby player
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony O'Reilly first shot to fame as an 18-year old in South Africa, as a
member of the British Lions rugby team nearly 40 years ago. The ball bounced
well for him, and for a time at least, the unknown Irish teenager, was
considered the best wing threequarter in the world.
The ball is bouncing well again in South Africa for Mr O'Reilly, chairman
and chief executive of HJ Heinz and also chairman of the media company he
controls, Independent Newspapers of Ireland.
Around the same time as the Dublin-based company was making its play for
Newspaper Publishing, the lossmaking company that owns The Independent in
the UK, and buying a 29.9 per cent stake, it pulled off a far more
significant deal in South Africa.
Mr O'Reilly agreed to buy nearly a third of Argus Newspapers of South
Africa, arguably the most influential newspaper group on the continent from
Anglo-American Corporation and Johannesburg Consolidated Investment.
The key initial 31 per cent stake cost the Irish about IPounds 20m (Pounds
19.6m). Mr O'Reilly will pay R11.50 a share, but with the shares already
trading at up to R15 there is already a paper profit of more than IPounds 6m
for Mr O'Reilly.
The performance on the South African rugby field and on the Johannesburg
Stock Exchange 40 years later are connected. When Mr O'Reilly charged down
the wing in the crowd was a Mr Mandela. A young player in one of the warm-up
games before the big match was a Mr de Klerk.
The Irish businessman's position in Africa was later consolidated when as
Heinz chief executive he decided to construct a food plant in Mr Robert
Mugabe's Zimbabwe. When Anglo-American decided they did not wish to be in
the media in South Africa any more, they came to Mr O'Reilly, as a newspaper
publisher likely to be acceptable to a new South African government to see
whether he would be interested in investing in the Argus group, whose titles
include The Star and the Sunday Tribune.
'There are 15 high speed presses in all of Africa and we have got 11 of
them. The equipment they have could print 12m papers (a week). We're
printing 5m. We have vast spare capacity,' says O'Reilly.
Before the recent South African elections it was a move that could have been
risky. It looks much less so now.
Mr O'Reilly believes he will be able to produce there a company with a
market capitalisation of Pounds 200m. The move into South Africa is the most
dramatic example so far of the international media ambitions of both Mr
O'Reilly and the Independent Newspapers group.
At its recent annual meeting, Mr O'Reilly, who bought control of Independent
for Pounds 1.1m 21 years ago, was able to tell shareholders that IPounds
1,000 invested then would, together with dividends being reinvested in the
company, be now worth IPounds 154,000. Pre-tax profits rose 81 per cent last
year to IPounds 29m.
Mr O'Reilly moved on Friday to strengthen the management of the group's
Irish newspapers by appointing Mr David Palmer, former chief executive of
the Financial Times group, to the vacant post of managing director.
Yet apart from the core business in Ireland, which now includes investments
in cable and microwave television distribution, as well as newspapers, the
company has expanded into France, Mexico, the UK and Australia.
The investments range from billboards in Mexico, through local and regional
papers and advertising on buses to local newspapers and the stake in The
Independent in the UK.
Mr Brenden Hopkins, who runs the UK business and is responsible for
international acquisitions, notes the change in the nature of the group.
'Three years ago we were an Irish group with international interests and now
we are an international group with interests in Ireland, Australia, France
and the UK,' says Mr Hopkins. He hopes he will be able to buy more in the UK
regional press in the next 12 months or so.
So far only between 12 and 13 per cent of the company's shares are held in
London, although it says London stockbrokers are starting to take more
interest following the acquisition of the stake in The
Independent.
Mr O'Reilly plans to take a more direct interest in running the company when
he retires from Heinz in about two years.
At the moment it is in the hands of Mr Liam Healy, the quietly spoken, but
tough-minded chief executive who has worked for the group for 30 years.
Mr O'Reilly hopes he can create a group with a total capitalisation of
Pounds 1bn within the next three years, although that would include
consolidating existing minority stakes.
He is also ambitious to expand his newspaper interests, possibly including
United Newspapers, publishers of the Daily and Sunday Express.
'If someone like Michael Green (chairman of Carlton Communications) wanted
the Daily Express as the standard bearer for his communications company and
I could find a way in which he would buy at a higher multiple and I got the
(United's) regionals at a lower multiple, it would be a good deal,' says Mr
O'Reilly.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Comcast to buy cable TV unit for Dollars 1.27bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Comcast, the US telecommunications group, announced yesterday that it has
agreed to buy the cable television operations of Maclean Hunter, the
Canadian communications and media group, for Dollars 1.27bn in cash.
The acquisition is the latest mega-deal in the consolidation of the US cable
TV market, which is becoming rapidly dominated by a few large operators. Two
weeks ago, Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises paid Dollars 2.3bn for Times
Mirror's cable TV unit.
Comcast is buying the cable interests of Maclean Hunter, which include
services and operations for about 550,000 subscribers in New Jersey,
Michigan and Florida, from Maclean Hunter's parent, Rogers Communications,
Canada's largest cable TV group. Rogers bought Maclean Hunter three months
ago for Dollars 2.2bn. Rogers said then it would sell Maclean Hunter's US
cable operations.
The purchase will make Comcast the third largest cable TV operator in the US
with 3.5m subscribers, behind TCI, which has 10m subscribers, and Time
Warner, which has 7m. Comcast also provides cellular telephone services to
more than 7.4m people.
Comcast's purchase, however, has several regulatory hurdles to overcome. Not
only is the deal subject to US government approval, but Rogers' acquisition
of Maclean Hunter is also awaiting approval in Canada, where the federal
Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and the Bureau of
Competition are likely to scrutinise carefully a merger between the
country's two largest cable TV operators.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Magnet case damages could be up to Pounds 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advisers and bankers to the ill-fated management buy-out of Magnet, the
fitted kitchens retailer, face potential damages of up to Pounds 1bn, those
involved in the litigation said yesterday.
The total value of the claim is only likely to be settled by the courts, but
with interest and costs may substantially outstrip the Pounds 629m cost of
the original MBO in 1989.
Parties involved include Bankers Trust, leader of the banking syndicate,
Arthur Andersen, adviser to the management, and Arthur Young, Magnet's
auditor.
In its day Magnet was the largest MBO ever and the first involving
'mezzanine' finance.
The case, which is due to be heard in the High Court in October, involves
two separate sets of writs: GE Capital suing Bankers Trust, and Bankers
Trust in turn suing professional advisers.
It will raise a series of important legal precedents about the nature of
diligence on acquisitions, and the duty of care of corporate finance
advisers and lead banks to syndicate members.
All parties involved yesterday vigorously defended their positions and
maintained that the dispute was unlikely to be settled on the steps of the
court.
Bankers Trust is expected to argue that it believed it had a contract with
Andersen to verify the figures which allowed the MBO to proceed.
However, Arthur Andersen says there was no such agreement, that its duty was
entirely to the management team of Magnet and that there would have been a
conflict of interest if it had also acted for Bankers Trust.
Mr Chris Nunn, a partner with Andersen, said: 'This is a pretty outrageous
example of a deep pocket action. It is so outrageous that it makes some look
respectable. Our role was never what those suing us have claimed.'
As part of its defence, Andersen has drawn in to the litigation Arthur
Young, now part of Ernst &amp; Young, which was auditor to Magnet and approved a
series of profit estimates.
Ernst &amp; Young said: 'Arthur Young had peripheral involvement in the exercise
confined to reporting on a profit estimate prepared by the directors for the
benefit of existing shareholders. It did not have a duty of care to the
investors.'

FT  20 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Tarnished image fades as profits
replace loss - British Steel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This time last year, British Steel was unveiling its worst set of results
since privatisation in 1988. Today, things will be very different.
The company's Pounds 149m pre-tax loss for 1992-93 was the result of
recession and falling demand at home and abroad, and price reductions caused
by excess production capacity in the European steel industry.
Since then, British Steel has started a long climb back into the black. In
November, it reported first-half pre-tax profits of Pounds 27m, reflecting
improvements in prices and in operating performance. It restored an interim
dividend of 0.5p.
Today, even the most pessimistic of analysts expects pre-tax profits of
Pounds 60m for the year to March, and forecasts range as high as Pounds 95m.
The majority believe a maintained final dividend of 1p per share is likely.
While the expected results remain a long way short of the record Pounds 733m
in 1989-90, the company is at least making profits and generating cash.
Some robust comments are likely from Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief
executive, on the progress of the European Commission's rescue plans for the
industry. The UK company is adamant that a line should be drawn under state
subsidies and that the capacity cuts already pledged by continental
producers should be implemented.
But analysts will also be looking closely at his remarks on market
conditions and price trends. At the interim stage the company reported that
UK demand for steel had recovered markedly, but noted that this was due
largely to an increase in inventory levels and the underlying improvement
was modest. Continental markets remained 'very depressed'.
For 1994-95, the City's most optimistic forecasts run to as much as Pounds
300m for the current year's pre-tax profits.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Opec ministers trade frowns for smiles as oil prices rally:
Production ceilings have played their part
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fresh optimism that short-term oil prices are on their way up was clearly
reflected in the smiles and jaunty steps of oil ministers at last week's
meeting in Vienna of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Gone were the tense negotiations and mutual recriminations that accompanied
abortive attempts last November and March to prop up collapsing prices. They
were replaced by satisfaction with the present strategy of maintaining
Opec's production ceiling at 24.52m barrels a day until the end of the year,
and perhaps even beyond.
Last week's price rally, which saw the benchmark Brent blend reach Dollars
17 a barrel, more than Dollars 4 above February's five-year low, may have
had little to do with the ministers' decision to re-confirm their adherence
to the ceiling. The news from Korea and supply bottlenecks in the fast
growing US market were more important factors. But ministers, and most
independent analysts, believe Opec's present course should help to underpin
prices as long as the strong pace of US economic growth is maintained. One
Gulf Arab delegate last week thought prices could rise by another Dollars
3-Dollars 4 by year-end.
Many analysts still expect some short-term price volatility, in part because
of the presence of hedge funds. Most would agree, however, with Mr Vahan
Zanoyan, an analyst with the Washington-based Petroleum Finance Company, who
says 'all market sensitivities are on the up side'.
The Centre for Global Energy Studies in London believes 'prices could rise
steeply towards the end of the year if Opec continues to restrain output' in
the face of sharply rising demand. It recently warned that sudden price
rises were possible because stocks held by oil companies are likely to fall
sharply by the fourth quarter.
Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris believes the inventory
strategies of companies in the second and third quarters will play 'a key
role in avoiding strong upward price movement later in the year'.
Oil companies will obviously welcome the stronger cash flows which higher
prices bring. But few are likely to drop their caution over longer-term
prices. And there is little likelihood of a new wave of investment in the
North Sea or elsewhere.
The link between prices and investment is changing, according to Ms Jo
Armstrong, economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland. She says recent price
fluctuations have caused companies to focus on factors which are within
their control, such as cost cutting, when reviewing individual projects.
'Companies try to identify the break-even price of oil for a project,' and a
judgement is then made as to 'whether or not such a price level is likely
within the critical time frame', she says.
It also makes companies less reliant on future Opec actions for their
profits. In spite of last week's smiles, the outlook for the organisation is
not altogether rosy. The presence in Vienna of the Iraqi oil minister for
the first time in several years was a reminder that Opec has yet to face
what could be its biggest test: the need, perhaps early next year, to
re-integrate Iraq, one of its biggest exporters, without causing prices to
crash.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Dissidents seek sale of
subsidiaries - Kmart
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kmart shareholders are anxiously awaiting the outcome of tomorrow's board
meeting amid expectations that Mr Joseph Antonini, the embattled chairman
and chief executive, will push for the approval of a restructuring proposal.
Mr Antonini is convening the session a fortnight after the discount store
group's annual meeting, when disgruntled investors soundly rejected his plan
to create new shares linked to the performance of four profitable specialty
chains.
The sale of the stock would have generated much needed cash while allowing
Kmart to retain control of the businesses.
The defeated proposal - centrepiece of a strategy to revive the company's
fortunes after years of decline - represented a stunning personal defeat for
Kmart's boss. It was a triumph for institutional investors seeking more
control of corporate decision-making.
The dissidents are pressing Kmart to opt for the outright sale of the four
chains - OfficeMax, Borders-Waldenbooks, The Sports Authority and Builders
Square. This amounts to asking Mr Antonini to repudiate a decade-long effort
to diversify. Instead, they want management to concentrate on recapturing
market share lost to Wal-Mart and other rival discount department stores.

Eurotunnel: At 3 o'clock on Wednesday, Eurotunnel's Pounds 858m rights issue
will close, and it is going to be a race to the finish for the underwriters.
Having started the week with a 77p cushion above the rights issue, the
margin had dropped to 23p by Friday evening, as the shares closed at 288p.
Today is the last day of trading for the nil paid rights, and this will
provide a pointer for the likely take-up of the issue. Any further fall in
the price could prove costly to the sub-underwriters.

disappointing pre-tax profit figure for 1993-94. The total will be depressed
by Pounds 130m as a result of post-privatisation acquisitions which have

Wessex Water is expected to draw the sector's reporting season to a close
tomorrow with the biggest dividend increase of all the top 10 water
companies. Forecasts are for a pay-out of between 23.5p and 24p, against
last year's 21.5p. The main issues, as with its fellow companies, will be
cost savings and the performance of the non-regulated waste management
business. Wessex is expected to score on both counts. Profit is estimated to

FT  20 JUN 94 / PO staff may get free shares in sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of postal workers may receive more than Pounds 400 in free shares
in the Post Office if Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
wins support for his plan to sell 51 per cent of the Royal Mail and
Parcelforce.
Mr Heseltine wants to distribute more free shares to workers in the sale of
the Post Office than in any previous privatisation. He disclosed the plan
during recent presentations to Tory backbenchers in an effort to gain their
support for the planned sale.
Mr Heseltine hopes next week to publish a green paper setting out the
options for change. He wants 10 per cent of the shares reserved for the
workforce, the maximum number allowed under Stock Exchange rules.
However, under Mr Heseltine's plan a greater proportion of the shares
reserved for employees would be free than in any previous government
flotation. He is considering offering the free shares on the basis of length
of employee service. He is also considering offering postal staff free
shares to match the amount they purchase.
With more than 170,000 employees working for Royal Mail, the letter service
and Parcelforce, 10 per cent of the shares in the Pounds 1bn sell-off would
see postal staff rewarded with more than Pounds 800 worth of preferential
shares. Half of those shares would be free for longer-serving staff.
While the green paper recognises that the Royal Mail and Parcelforce could
be kept in the public sector, the DTI remains confident that Mr Heseltine
will win his cabinet colleagues' backing to proceed with privatisation.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, the DTI minister responsible for the Post Office,
will outline the importance of changing the Post Offices structure in a
speech tomorrow to a London Conference on the future of the corporation.
He is expected to issue a warning to Tory backbenchers who want to limit
privatisation to the sale of a 49 per cent stake in the corporation that the
sale of a minority stake would not give the corporation enough freedom from
the constraints of the public sector.
The Post Office will today announce record pre-tax profits of more than
Pounds 300m in the year to the end of the March 1994.
But Mr Mike Heron, Post Office chairman, will point out that a decline in
letterbox mail, the first in recent history, underlines the need for the
greater commercialisation at the corporation.

FT  20 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fate of Eurotunnel's Pounds 858m rescue rights issue, which closes on
Wednesday, is touch and go. Last week the share price collapsed to 288p -
perilously close to the rights issue price of 265p. The value of the nil
paid shares slumped to 13p in heavy volumes. There must now be a real danger
that underwriters will be left with a large slug of shares. And given that
institutional investors have shown little enthusiasm for the stock to date,
that could depress trading after the issue. If Eurotunnel's shares remain
subdued in the longer term, the company could even find itself back in
financial difficulties before long. Nearly half its financial cushion is
predicated on the assumption that investors will exercise Pounds 200m of
warrants next year. But that is unlikely unless the shares bounce.
There is a more comforting scenario, based on a repeat of what happened
during the previous 1990 rights issue. Then too, the share price fell to
within a whisker of the rights price but recovered in the nick of time.
Subsequently the shares raced ahead as speculators who sold short were
caught on the wrong foot. Some brokers detect the same pattern of
short-selling this time round. But others believe the shares would have
fallen even further if the issue's supporters had not been buying the shares
during much of last week. Given the current swirl of speculation, it is hard
to tell which scenario is the more credible.

FT  20 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: UK water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As the regulatory squeeze on the water industry gets tighter, shareholders
will demand more by way of efficiency. That extends beyond control of
operating costs and delivering capital projects within budget. The net debt
of the 10 privatised water companies is likely to rise by around Pounds 8bn
through the second half of the decade. The cost to shareholders of borrowing
at unattractive rates could be great.
So far the companies have had access to cheap debt through the European
Investment Bank. Perhaps a quarter of all capital spending can also be
funded through leasing deals. But the EIB will only lend so much, while
underground assets such as pipes are unsuitable for leasing. Bond market
borrowing is therefore likely to play a greater role, even though the
companies' efforts have produced mixed results. Only Welsh Water borrowed in
the public markets when bond yields were at their trough earlier this year.
Anglian's Pounds 100m sterling bond issue in December 1990 now looks
expensive, although the company's index-linked bond six months before has
proved better value.
With revenues linked to inflation, index-linked should be an ideal form of
finance for water companies. There are tax problems to overcome, but the
bigger hurdle may be companies' belief that they can out-guess the bond
market on inflation and get cheaper funds by borrowing at fixed rates. Given
their dismal record at most activities outside water and sewerage,
shareholders might prefer a more risk-averse approach.

FT  20 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Free movement of capital within the European Union has died a quiet death. A
proposed EU directive defending the right of pension funds to invest
overseas was dropped last week after three years of disagreement. There will
be little immediate impact on financial markets: of the Pounds 800bn held in
EU pension funds, the vast majority is in UK and Dutch schemes which are
free to invest as they choose. With other countries edging towards funded
schemes, though, the long-term impact on European capital markets could be
profound.
It is difficult to justify any blanket limit on overseas investment. An
equity portfolio containing around 30 per cent overseas shares is often seen
as offering the optimum balance of risk and return. UK pension funds on
average hold 25 per cent of their assets in overseas equities and 5 per cent
in foreign bonds, but that level of overseas investment is not without risk.
As UK funds mature, such a large mismatch between foreign currency assets
and sterling liabilities will be more difficult to justify.
The government's proposals for a solvency test for pension funds, expected
this week, could bring matters to a head. Under the test, liabilities would
be valued with reference to UK bond and equity yields. Overseas equities are
unlikely to feature in the calculation. Older schemes which are less well
endowed will question whether the risk of falling below the solvency
threshold is worth the additional returns from investing abroad. That does
not alter the case against an explicit cap on foreign investment, but the
drift of UK pension fund assets overseas may have reached its peak.

FT  20 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: The drooping dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If leading central banks thought they had fixed the dollar problem with
their intervention in April, they must be disappointed. The currency is
again slipping in foreign exchange markets, reaching new lows for the year
last week against the D-mark and other European currencies including
sterling. Assuming the absolute level of exchange rates matters to the
central banks, that would call for another round of concerted intervention.
In the short time since their last effort, though, a number of basic
assumptions have changed which may make the central banks less keen to step
in.
Not only has the Federal Reserve declared a period of hiatus in its monetary
tightening but also economic recovery has become established in Germany,
which reduces the imperative for rate cuts there. It is thus harder to argue
that the dollar is moving against what ought to be its fundamental trend.
There is less concern that the dollar's weakness will upset the US
Treasury's funding programme, while the continuing overshoot in German money
supply must make the Bundesbank reluctant to intervene in currencies.
As long as the dollar's fall does not turn disorderly, these arguments may
well hold. It helps, perhaps, that there is less talk now of a US desire to
drive the dollar down against the yen. The yen itself is probably prevented
from showing its true strength by Korean nuclear worries as well as by some
discreet intervention from the Bank of Japan. Yet while the broader
community of central banks may be unworried for now, Friday night's steep
fall suggests they may eventually have to become involved. One cannot
imagine the dollar's decline remaining orderly below DM1.60 or Yen100.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Jericho waits for its president: Arafat keeps world guessing
about timing of his arrival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
First Voice: Do you think he will come today?
Second voice: Yes I am sure he will come.
In recent weeks it has been easy for many people in the Holy Land to believe
they have got caught up in a conversation between the characters in Samuel
Beckett's play Waiting for Godot.
Waiting for Yassir Arafat has become an obsession.
Every day brings a new rumour that Mr Arafat, the veteran PLO chairman and
almost mythical embodiment of Palestinian nationalism, is about to set foot
in Jericho. And at the end of every day there is renewed speculation about
tomorrow.
Everybody is waiting for him - the Palestinian people, the international
press, the embryonic Palestinian government and the Israeli authorities.
Almost every project seems to be on hold until Mr Arafat's triumphant
arrival - billed as one of the greatest media events of 1994.
Mr Arafat was widely expected to return to Jericho shortly after signing the
May 4 Israeli-PLO peace agreement for Gaza and Jericho in Cairo. Last month,
he said he would not go to Jericho until international aid donors produced
their promised funds. The donors gave the PLO Dollars 42m earlier this
month, and Mr Arafat has since maintained a solid silence about his plans.
The most convincing explanation about Mr Arafat's indecision is that he is
worried that as soon as he steps foot in Jericho the decades of myth and
legend that have surrounded him will begin to wear off. 'He is going to have
to govern on a practical day-to-day basis and with every day he will
diminish,' said a senior PLO official.
Despite the uncertainty, almost every Palestinian official claims to have
spoken to him 'just hours ago' and to know the date of his arrival. 'Of
course I know when the president will come,' said Col Jibril Rajoub, head of
the PLO internal security forces in the West Bank. 'The question is not when
President Arafat will come but whether I will tell you. I certainly won't
tell you.'
Even in Tunis, among Mr Arafat's closest confidants, there is widespread
confusion about his plans. Almost everybody, including Suha, his wife, has
packed their bags in anticipation of making the journey home at short notice
on the whim of Mr Arafat. 'The truth is that Arafat will probably make a
decision in the early hours one morning and we will all be given a couple of
hours notice,' said one senior PLO official.
'That's his way of doing things to prolong the mystery he likes to surround
himself with. Usually not even his pilots are told where we are going until
we are airborne.'
Israeli television reported last week that Mr Arafat would arrive with King
Hassan of Morocco and King Hussein of Jordan, both descendants of the
Prophet Mohammed, and with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. Israel has
officially denied any plans to allow Mr Arafat an early visit to Jerusalem.
In Jericho, where Mr Arafat is known by the nickname 'The Traveller,' the
arrival of the president is taken more philosophically. 'Today, tomorrow,
next month - it doesn't really matter,' said Mr Isaac Shawa, a storekeeper.
'We are used to waiting. He will come - that is the only thing known.'
Meanwhile everybody is cashing in. Stores around the central square are
doing a brisk business in Palestinian flags, stickers and T-shirts.
Journalists are scrambling for roof space above the square to record
Arafat's every move, A one-square metre piece of roof, just big enough for a
tripod, is going for three thousand dollars for photographers. Television
networks are paying Dollars 20,000 to Dollars 30,000 for a whole rooftop to
set up satellite link-ups for a live broadcast of Mr Arafat's return.

FT  20 JUN 94 / An intricate web of influence: Robert Peston explores the
links between Italy's Mediobanca and the interests of Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Silvio Berlusconi, the new prime minister of Italy, devises the policies
of his administration, a secretive and powerful banker, Enrico Cuccia, is
right behind him, watching every move.
The answer to the question of whether the premier or the 86-year-old
Sicilian-born banker has the most power is finely balanced. Is it
Berlusconi, head of the government and owner of three television networks,
which together attract half of Italy's viewers? Or is it Cuccia, the founder
of Mediobanca, Italy's only big merchant bank, and spider at the centre of a
web of powerful, interlinked companies?
Possibly tipping the balance in his favour, Cuccia has, in the past six
months, acquired considerable sway over Berlusconi's vast and overborrowed
business empire and thus over the prime minister's personal wealth. This
influence could be useful in preserving Mediobanca's near monopoly of
advising and financing Italy's biggest companies. Members of the government,
particularly representatives of the Northern League, are determined to
weaken Mediobanca.
They want to undermine the 'Salotto Buono' - the 'good salon', or network of
powerful business dynasties, including the Agnellis of car group Fiat, De
Benedetti of computer company Olivetti, the Pirellis of the eponymous tyre
group - which, though frequently competitors against each other, are
supported by Cuccia and which support him. They believe Mediobanca's power
is holding back the development of Italy's economy.
By contrast, Cuccia is extending the reach of the Salotto Buono by
persuading his corporate allies to take stakes in the succession of Italian
companies being privatised. He is seeking involvement in new businesses
because the recession has eroded the financial strength of some of his most
long-standing allies, such as the Agnellis and De Benedetti. With this end
in view, Mediobanca is raising at least L1,500bn (Pounds 626.56m) from a
share issue.
So Italy's privatisation programme - including sales of state banks,
telecommunication and electricity companies - has become the battleground
between Cuccia and many government members. Ber-lusconi has yet to show his
col-ours.
Never part of the Salotto Buono himself, Berlusconi has indicated he wants
to impose a 5 per cent share ownership ceiling for groups of related
investors in future privatisations. But there has been no test case yet.
Berlusconi may be waiting to see the outcome of Cuccia's other big struggle
 -against the judiciary. Magistrates are investigating whether Mediobanca
has committed a criminal offence by allegedly failing in its duty to ensure
that accurate accounts were filed last year by Ferruzzi, a long-standing
client, just prior to the refinancing of the huge industrial conglomerate
which had been crippled by debt.
Magistrates have already shaken public confidence in many of Mediobanca's
clients - from Fiat to de Benedetti to the king of Milan concrete, Salvatore
Ligresti, until last year a member of Mediobanca's board - by alleging their
involvement in assorted financial scandals. Until now, Mediobanca itself has
always been above the fray, remaining aloof from the corruption charges that
have touched almost all other corners of Italian business and political
life. 'In Italy it is a crime against God even to think bad things about
Mediobanca,' said Francesco Micheli, an independent financier who in the
early 1990s failed in his attempt to create a rival to Mediobanca.
With a horror of publicity, Cuccia has made Mediobanca the paramount
financier of Italy's commercial and industrial aristocracy. Its financial
muscle is enhanced by its 12.5 per cent controlling stake in the giant
insurance company, Generali.
'Mediobanca is always at the crossroads of all business,' said Mario
Sarcinelli, the chairman of the state-controlled bank, BNL.
Cuccia has held the reins for the 48 years of Mediobanca's existence. The
'honorary' tag in his title of 'honorary chairman' is deceptive. He is still
to be found every day at the bank's headquarters in a converted 16th century
convent, beside Milan's La Scala opera house. Its inconspicuous exterior
hides airy, white-washed salons, dotted with Renaissance artefacts.
In other respects too, appearances mislead. It has just 87 executives and a
total staff of 307. However, its net assets are worth L10,301bn (Pounds
4.2bn), at market value, making it a substantial financial institution. The
UK's biggest investment bank, SG Warburg, by comparison has net assets of
Pounds 1.1bn.
The relationship of Mediobanca with the Salotto Buono is one of mutual
advantage. In return for supplying equity and long-term loans to anyone in
the group, it expects members to return the favour when either Mediobanca or
another group member needs capital.
This system is beneficial for a handful of big companies - of which Fiat and
the other interests of the Agnelli family are the prime example - because it
provides them with a stable, long-term source of capital. However,
Mediobanca has virtually ignored medium-sized companies, which have had to
rely on short-term funding from the commercial banks.
'How can you have democracy if not all companies have equal access to
capital?' asked another banker who has tried for years to create an
investment bank to compete with Mediobanca.
The power of the Salotto Buono has also acted as a deterrent to the creation
of independent sources of equity capital. When Mediobanca and its allies act
in concert in a company's affairs, other shareholders have no voice. There
is, therefore, little incentive for those outside the Mediobanca circle to
invest alongside the bank and its friends. 'Mediobanca ignores minority
shareholders,' said Romano Prodi, the economist and departing chairman of
Iri, the state holding company,
For Prodi and Mediobanca's critics in government and banking, Cuccia is
standing in the way of the development of the Italian stock market. Even the
Bank of Italy, long regarded as a supporter of Cuccia, accepts the case for
greater competition. 'What we need is several Mediobancas,' said a senior
Bank official.
The first big test of whether the government will confront Mediobanca will
come this autumn with the privatisation of Stet, the telecommunications
monopoly. Mediobanca, in partnership with Pirelli, wants to take control of
Stet, according to a banker close to Cuccia.
However, Berlusconi is under pressure from other members of the government
to prevent this. For the current privatisation of Ina, the state insurance
company, the government has put in place rules preventing groups of
connected investors - or individual investors - from acquiring more than 5
per cent of the shares. Mediobanca had little interest in taking control of
Ina because of its Generali interests.
It is unclear how vigorously these restrictions will be applied in
forthcoming privatisations, especially that of Stet. Clearly, much will
depend on Berlusconi's stance. He has never been close to Cuccia.
'Cuccia and Berlusconi are so different,' commented a banker who knows them
both. 'Berlusconi is like a pop star, a showman. Cuccia is more like a
priest, not interested in the trappings of power but in power itself.'
Cuccia decided five years ago that Mediobanca would not have any direct
financial involvement with Berlusconi's operations, because 'he did not like
the risks', in the words of a banker who knows Cuccia well. Cuccia was
particularly concerned about the trillions of lire which Berlusconi was
investing in film and TV rights.
'Cuccia said the rights were just hot air (or valueless)', said a
businessman close to both Berlusconi and Mediobanca.
So Berlusconi turned to Italy's commercial banks. By borrowing from them he
was able to expand Fininvest, his holding company of media and financial
services interests, into one of Italy's three biggest private sector groups.
In the end, however, he took on too much debt, about L4,500bn at the end of
last year, as the recession of the past two years put a brake on revenue
growth.
At the same time as Berlusconi started his campaign to become prime minister
at the end of last year, he was forced to initiate a complicated
restructuring of Fininvest, designed both to reduce indebtedness and also to
move borrowings from the top holding company into the operating companies,
which generate cash.
Without the co-operation of Berlusconi's bankers, the reorganisation will
not succeed: and Cuccia has, over the past six months, manoeuvred himself
behind the bankers. He has acquired indirect control of Banca Commerciale
Italiana and Credito Italiano, known as Comit and Credit, two of Fininvest's
five biggest bank creditors.
Cuccia has already exploited his relationship with these two banks to
acquire direct influence over Berlusconi's business. In the spring, Comit
and Fininvest asked Mediobanca if it would organise the flotation of a 53
per cent stake in Mondadori, which owns Berlusconi's magazine, book
publishing and newspaper interests. This is the first important asset
disposal in the Finvinvest restructuring.
Ironically, it was the previous Italian government's failure to prevent
Mediobanca acquiring indirect stakes in Credit and Comit, when they were
privatised, that now gives it a role in the new prime minister's financial
affairs.
Cuccia took control of Credit and Comit at the turn of the year and in
spring respectively. He had been so confident that the government would be
unable to block his raids that he disclosed his intentions at a meeting last
summer with Prodi, who was in charge of the bank sales as head of Iri. Prodi
urged the government to restrict the size of shareholdings in the privatised
banks, to block Mediobanca. Single investors were banned from owning more
than 3 per cent in either.
However, the curbs proved futile because Mediobanca rarely takes direct
shareholdings in companies bigger than 2 or 3 per cent. Cuccia's technique
is to persuade each of his corporate friends to buy 1 or 2 per cent of a
target company and then vote in concert.
The graphic shows the complicated relationship of mutual dependency between
Mediobanca and the two 'syndicates', or groups of companies, which bought
shares in Credit and Comit. Mediobanca owns shares in these companies and
many of them also own shares in Mediobanca.
The syndicates determined the composition of Comit's and Credit's boards
through their voting at the annual meeting. Shareholders must appear in
person to vote, as there is no proxy system, so Mediobanca's syndicates,
whose members always attend, can call the shots. There are few other
sizeable holdings in the banks to counter their influence.
There is a commercial imperative for Cuccia's interest in Comit and Credit.
Mediobanca has traditionally raised much of its finance by selling
certificates of deposit through its branch networks. It needed an assurance
that this funding would be secure for the long term. Cuccia got his way.
Both have extended the contract to sell Mediobanca's certificates of deposit
until the end of 2001 and at a reduced cost.
However, control of Comit and Credit also allowed Cuccia to envelop
Fininvest, at a time when Berlusconi's political star was waxing but his
business was under increasingly heavy financial pressure. It was a no-lose
bet. Even if Berlusconi was not elected Cuccia could nonetheless exploit
Fininvest's financial predicament to bring his TV and publishing interests
firmly into the Mediobanca sphere of influence.
Comit and Credit have loans to Fininvest of L500bn and L300bn respectively.
Cuccia also has substantial influence over a third creditor, Banco di Roma,
which is owned by a charitable trust but which is also a substantial
shareholder in Mediobanca (as are Comit and Credit). Banco di Roma lent
L500bn to Fininvest.
Berlusconi's businesses therefore rely more on Cuccia's goodwill than on any
other single financier. 'Cuccia can turn on the tap to give Fininvest access
to credit,' said a senior Italian banker. 'Or he can turn it off.'
Berlusconi thus faces a possibly insoluble dilemma. If Mediobanca's
syndicates continue to acquire strategic holdings in privatised companies,
especially Stet, he could be accused of acting leniently towards Mediobanca
to protect his private interests.
If, on the other hand, he is aggressive in implementing the new rules to
block the Mediobanca syndicates, he could equally be vulnerable to the
charge of using government office to pressure Mediobanca into supporting
Fininvest's restructuring.
His advisers say he is working assiduously on the problem of how to erect an
effective wall around his business interests. The future of Mediobanca may
depend on whether he succeeds.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Hard slog in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin is making an unexpectedly valiant
effort to stabilise the Russian economy. But the effort could easily fail
and does, in any case, still fall far short of true stabilisation. If Mr
Chernomyrdin is indeed a man with whom the west can do business, it makes
sense to do the decisive business now. To wait may be to lose the
opportunity.
As former head of a large Soviet gas enterprise, Gasprom, Mr Chernomyrdin
has the political clout lacked by the younger reformers, Mr Yegor Gaidar and
Mr Boris Fyodorov. What he lacked, was their understanding. But he does seem
to have come a long way, particularly for someone who proclaimed early this
year that the era of 'market romanticism' was over. It was he, after all,
who wrote in the FT last month that 'it is vitally important that every
member of the Russian government fully understands that a strong rouble is
the indispensable condition for the revival of the Russian economy, and the
Russian state as a whole'.
So far has the government come that Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director
of the International Monetary Fund, was persuaded in March to advance the
Dollars 1.5bn second tranche of the systemic transformation facility.
Negligible in itself, this sum was an important sign of confidence in the
Russian government. Nor has that confidence appeared misplaced. Monetary
policy has been tight, while inflation has been kept down - to just 6.8 per
cent in May, following 10 per cent a month between February and April.
Unfortunately, partly because of a 25 per cent decline in industrial output
since last year, government figures show tax collection 15 per cent below
budget in the first quarter. The deficit has been kept under control mainly
by non-payment of spending obligations, measures that are neither desirable
nor sustainable in the long term. Meanwhile, there are strong pressures for
more spending from lobbies for the military, the military-industrial
complex, agricultural interests (strongly represented in the Duma) and the
northern territories.
The limited success so far may well not last. But it would not be good
enough, even if it were to. Output has already fallen so far that successful
stabilisation might bring a strong turnround in the economy next year. But
first there needs to be not just a prolongation of the present long drawn
out squeeze, but a serious effort to break inflationary expectations.
What is needed, in fact, is true stabilisation. That could be achieved
through a programme to peg the exchange rate, combined with elimination of
inflationary financing of the budget deficit. More funding would be needed
than is now available. Much of it could be raised domestically, some in
higher domestic revenue and some in domestic borrowing, but a precondition
would be more western finance. Some 4-5 per cent of Russian gross domestic
product in external assistance, for two or three years, might do the trick.
The bill for the west would be perhaps Dollars 14bn a year.
Judged by aid budgets this is a large sum. Judged by the more relevant
standard of military spending, it is small. What needs to be understood is
that Russia is not merely an aid problem. Stabilising its economy offers
probably the most significant current opportunity to make the world a better
place. Mr Chernomyrdin's determination offers the west yet another chance to
help, but it may not last. While such an opportunity may come again, it
would be sheer folly for western leaders to act on that assumption.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's decision by the European Commission to shelve the deregulation
of pension fund management is a big setback to the creation of a single
market in the European Union. It is possible that liberalisation can still
be achieved if the Commission brings proceedings to enforce the free
movement of capital promised by the Treaty of Rome. But that will take
years, at high cost to taxpayers and pension fund members of countries that
maintain controls over fund management.
The cost to taxpayers arises from the higher bond yields that will be
required to finance budget deficits in such countries. Controls on pension
fund investment ensure a captive market of buyers for government bonds and
share issues involved in privatisation programmes. But funds can generally
be raised more cheaply from the global savings pool.
The cost to pension fund members comes in the form of increased risk
resulting from inadequate portfolio diversification. Diversification
improves the return that funds achieve by giving access to growing markets.
It is also a less risky strategy than investing in a single country. These
are benefits that no European country can afford to neglect as pension costs
rise with the ageing of populations.
Capital market restrictions are likely to prove ineffective in the long run.
The financial services industry will find ways to create synthetic exposure
to foreign markets for pension funds. So will the sort of cross-border
mergers in insurance and pensions seen this week with the purchase by
Commercial Union of French insurer Groupe Victoire. But it would be better
to purge Europe of pension fund investment restrictions and reap the
benefits of an integrated, efficient European capital market.

<TEXT>
Brazil's long-awaited new currency - the real - is designed to kill
inflation and inspire pride. But it's got off to a poor start. A bag of
reals was found in a rubbish bin in the capital, Brasilia.
The money, in the form of apparently genuine new 1 Real coins - equal in
value to Dollars 1 - was found by a couple of scavengers combing through a
rubbish heap. They spent some of the cash to pay off debts and buy
cigarettes and alcohol - even though the currency is not legal tender until
July 1 - and were caught when they tried to deposit the remaining coins at a
local bank.
Brazil's inflation has eaten up four other currencies since 1986. It is
therefore customary to find old notes in the bin; though a trifle unusual to
find them there before they have even been launched.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The vacuum at the top of the Institute for Public Policy Research, the
left-leaning think-tank, is to be filled by a middle-aged City scribbler.
Gerry Holtham, 49, Lehman Brothers' international economics guru, has been
leant on to take the job after the front-runner - Patricia Hewitt, the
IPPR's telegenic deputy director - went off to make some money as a
management consultant.
Holtham has a lower pink profile than the likes of Goldman Sachs millionaire
Gavyn Davies or Citibank's Neil Mackinnon. But he has a sound, if
unexciting, pedigree - 10 years with the OECD in Paris, and he was an
adviser to the shadow Treasury team.
If Holtham can get the IPPR to figure more prominently in Labour's economic
policy debates he might be rewarded with a walk-on role in any future Labour
administration. In the meantime, his departure leaves a big hole in Lehman's
economic think-tank since Ruth Lea, the chief UK economist, leaves at the
end of the month to be Channel Four's economics editor.

Despite the odds against winning the world cup (500 to one) Saudi Arabia is

However, he knows little about soccer. So to overcome the deficiency the

'Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it's awful.' Irish playwright
Samuel Beckett's words, from Waiting for Godot, don't apply at present to
Dublin's Abbey Theatre - though its current box office of 60-65 per cent
could be improved. But they may be apposite this winter when the theatre is
threatening to lower the curtain until the spring - the first closure for 90
years.
Though the Abbey is guaranteed state aid under Ireland's constitution, the
arts council is reducing its support from 55 per cent of the theatre's
income - IPounds 2m - to 50 per cent in 1995.
The arts minister Michael Higgins, under whose benevolent tutelage Irish
music and film are flourishing, insists that the Arts Council is an
autonomous body and he cannot interfere. His wife, the actress Sabina Coyne,
may have something to say about that . . .

Britain's defence cuts are really starting to bite when the elite Special
Air Service sustains an attack even it cannot withstand.
Observer has learned that defence minister Malcolm Rifkind wants 50 per cent
reductions in the two part-time SAS regiments, SAS 21 and SAS 23, leaving
them with significantly less than 700 men combined. This comes on top of
proposals - leaked earlier this month - to lop 10 per cent from the
full-time SAS 22 regiment.
In June 1993 Rifkind said he would be sacking some 4,000 UK army and naval
reservists, but made no mention of shrinking the SAS. So low is SAS morale
that one senior SAS officer reckons the British army now has 'less
operational capability than Guatemala'.
Dumping half the SAS reservists will save MoD less than Pounds 3m a year.
Hardly a princely sum. In fact, half the cost of one British tank. It looks
like cheese-paring of the daftest kind; after all, government spending on
all reserve forces amounts to less than 3 per cent of the MoD's budget. The
MoD prefers an opaque reticence. It says: 'Quantifying cost effectiveness is
not a simple exercise in statistical analysis' - whatever that means.
Slashing SAS 21 and 23 also sits rather oddly with Rifkind's recent
trumpeting of his determination to use the Territorial Army Volunteer
Reserve (TAVR) - of which SAS 21 and 23 are considered the fighting
spearhead - to plug gaps in the full-time army.
As a defence policy it sounds like one step forward, two steps back - a
marching rhythm unfamiliar to most British soldiers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The topic of research and development, and British industry's supposed
aversion to it, is back in the news again. Last Thursday the UK Department
of Trade and Industry published the latest version of its 'R &amp; D
scoreboard', showing that Britain still spends far less on R &amp; D than its
main competitors. The data also suggested that British companies, uniquely
among the big industrial nations, spend less on R &amp; D than on dividends to
shareholders.
The comparison between R &amp; D and dividends is particularly topical, since
the UK government seems to be toying with the idea of redressing the
balance: for instance, by taxing the income of the pension funds, thus
making dividends less attractive by comparison with cash reinvested. At
worst, this could do industry more harm than good. Either way, it is largely
beside the point.
The debate about the City's alleged reluctance to invest in British industry
goes back at least to the late 1970s, when it was examined by the Wilson
Committee. The answer was clear then, and it is clear now. If industry fails
to invest, it is not primarily because of lack of funds. It is more often
because it cannot find sensible projects to spend money on.
Nor is it true that R &amp; D is self-evidently good and dividends bad. Take a
simple example from the world of high technology. Both Philips of the
Netherlands and Microsoft of the US spend massively on R &amp; D, and neither
paid a dividend last year. Philips could not afford to: its huge spending on
research (over Dollars 1bn annually) has proved largely profitless, and the
money would arguably have been better handed to shareholders. But
shareholders in Microsoft - one of America's most spectacularly successful
companies - have no reason to want dividends. Their company's growth record
is such that they can count on reinvested cash bringing a far higher return
than they could get on their own.
The basic fallacy is to suppose that high R &amp; D spending is the cause of
commercial success, rather than the result. Britain's drug companies have
traditionally spent lavishly on research, and have also enjoyed rapid
profits growth and high stock market ratings. This is because the British
have a talent for discovering useful medicines, so the cost of discovering
them has been money well spent. Now, as it happens, this may be changing.
The glory days of conventional drug discovery appear to be over, and Glaxo
is spending almost as much on dividends as on R &amp; D. Merck of the US - the
world's biggest drug company - is actually paying more.
In seeking to make the more mature sectors of British industry spend more on
R &amp; D, the government may thus be flogging a dead horse. Indeed, proposals
to penalise dividend payments by taxing previously tax-exempt pension funds
could actually be harmful. The paymasters of the pension funds, after all,
are largely the companies themselves. If their net receipts were reduced,
their collective response would have to be either an increase in dividend
payments or a rise in pension contributions. Either way, they would have
less to spend on R &amp; D.
Alternatively, the Treasury could opt for fiscal neutrality, for instance by
reducing the basic rate of corporation tax in compensation. The net effect
might be a mild stimulus to R &amp; D spending, and that would doubtless do no
harm. But it would not do to expect too much. When it comes to productive R
&amp; D, it isn't what you spend, it's the way that you spend it.

<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest Mr John Jackson's letter 'Concerned by banking
practice' (June 16).
This bank has for some time pursued a policy of not appointing investigating
accountants as receivers if, as a result of their investigation, they
recommend receivership. This has certainly reassured customers that the
accountancy investigation is in their best interest, and has led to a
reduction in the number of recommendations to pursue this course.
It is not always possible to do this because, for example, there are
occasions when we are part of a lending syndicate, but in almost every case
we do divide the roles with only a tiny number of exceptions.
Our intention is to appoint a receiver only if there is no alternative
course of action, and this is supported by the reduction in the number of
receivers which we have appointed, down to 150 during 1993 compared with 420
in 1992.
I support Mr Jackson's suggestion that the Institute of Chartered
Accountants should consider its policy on this matter.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Clinton v Friedman on welfare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How attitudes towards the poor have changed. Just over 30 years ago, Milton
Friedman proposed a novel way of coping with poverty, which he dubbed the
'negative income tax'. He argued that government should establish a 'floor'
standard of living. Families with incomes below the floor would receive
credits while those with incomes above it would pay taxes in the normal way.
In Britain, similar schemes are advocated by proponents of a guaranteed
'basic income' for all citizens.
Friedman saw many advantages in a negative income tax. It would be a
transparent form of poverty relief since the appropriate 'floor' standard of
living would be openly debated. It would be simpler to administer than the
profusion of different benefits then available. It would be non-judgmental:
individuals would qualify simply by virtue of being poor. They would not
have to plead their case before sceptical officials. Rough calculations even
indicated the scheme would save money by cutting through layers of
unnecessary bureaucracy.
My purpose is not to argue that a negative income tax is a perfect - or even
practicable - scheme. Studies suggest the work disincentives associated with
any form of basic income would be far higher than Friedman assumed. In
practice, some benefits would have to be tailored to the specific
circumstances of poor families. My point, rather, is to underline the
extraordinary change in attitudes that has occurred since the 1960s. In that
optimistic era, even conservatives believed that a rich society such as the
US could, and should, make unconditional payments to poor families.
Now consider the welfare reform plan published last week by President Bill
Clinton. Set against the Friedman proposal it is a depressingly
authoritarian document. Mr Clinton has no qualms about coercing welfare
recipients, mostly single mothers and their children. The goal is to force
young mothers (those born since 1971) into the paid labour force as quickly
as possible. The plan approves of any kind of work except, of course,
something as socially irrelevant as childrearing. The state's role is not to
provide a floor standard of living, but to act as an 'enforcer' of
disciplined work habits and responsible behaviour.
The Clinton plan would impose dozens of new conditions and requirements for
receipt of benefits. Mothers, including some with children as young as three
months, would be required to accept any job offer in the private or public
sector, no matter how uncongenial to the individual in question. If, after
two years, they had not made a sufficient effort to find employment, or had
proved unco-operative, benefits would be terminated. What would happen to
families who run foul of welfare offices is not made clear. But since there
are no plans to create state orphanages or other institutions, it seems that
some children would end up in cardboard boxes.
Yet the public desire to crack down on welfare mothers is so intense that
many Republicans and conservative Democrats last week dismissed the Clinton
plan as a timid half-measure. Nobody seems to have doubts about the proposed
extension in the discretionary powers of public officials - something that
Friedman was anxious to reduce. The complaint instead is that the two-year
time limit is illusory because mothers who 'played by the rules' - obeyed
orders - would be allowed to remain in subsidised workfare programmes
indefinitely. The critics, if they are to be believed, would throw mothers
and children on to the streets the minute the two years is up.
What explains this sea-change in attitudes: why are leftwingers such as Mr
Clinton embracing policies that conservatives would have recoiled from in
the 1960s? The nation, after all, is much richer and, therefore, more
capable of providing an unconditional safety net.
There is no fully convincing answer. The shift partly reflects bitter
disillusionment with the results of the 'war on poverty' that began in the
late 1960s. A haphazard system of means-tested benefits, which bore no
resemblance to Friedman's negative income tax, was expanded. While possibly
reducing material poverty, this appeared to aggravate the social pathologies
associated with the urban 'underclass': out-of-wedlock births, crime and
drug abuse. By the 1980s social critics were complaining of a 'cycle of
dependency' involving second and third generation single mothers.
This led naturally to the 'new paternalism' of the 1990s: the notion that
government must modify the behaviour of young mothers by imposing work
requirements, dictating where and with whom they live and imposing fines in
the hope of 'reforming' their characters. If poor women could respond to
market incentives, the argument ran, they would not be on welfare. Hence the
need for training and discipline: today the preferred model for welfare is
not Friedman's cash dispenser but the US Army, an institution that many
argue has done more to help the underprivileged than any poverty programme.
The Clinton plan is thus a child of the times. The fact that left-leaning
Democrats are so keen to force people into paid employment  - even young
mothers who are raising children - is a barometer of the sour public mood.
Friedman, in his way, embraced the permissiveness of the 1960s - the belief
that a rich society should be tolerant of lifestyles that contravene
middle-class norms. Ironically, Mr Clinton, a product of those years, is
embracing a philosophy closer to that of the Victorian workhouse. And the
public, like the audience in a Roman amphitheatre, is screaming for more.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Toyota plant's impact will extend
beyond Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEORGE BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Toyota plant fails to boost Midlands economy' (June 15),
gives a rather short-term view. It is important to stress that when our work
was completed in February this year the first phase of the plant was only
just moving to a second shift. The impact to date has been entirely in line
with Toyota's own commitments.
When the investment was first announced, it generated what were, perhaps,
rather unrealistic local expectations and concerns. Our study was
commissioned precisely because there was lack of reliable evidence from
which to project the impact of such a development.
However, it is important that we do not move from a position of unrealistic
expectations to one where we are overly dismissive. The plant remains one of
the largest projects to be attracted to the region, and the UK, in recent
years. Only a limited part of its likely long-term impact has yet been seen.
There is also the potential for the plant to exert a wider impact beyond the
employment, income and trade links. It brings innovative training and
recruitment policies which may provide useful models for other employers.
On a wider basis, Japanese quality demands are having an important impact on
the competitiveness of the UK components supply industry. It also has to be
said that the arrival of the plant has provided a welcome boost to
confidence at a time which the regional economy was at a very low ebb.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tribunal is not best means of
resolving City abuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From LORD SPENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lord Alexander of Weedon, in his address to the 1994 Commercial Bar
Association, suggests the collapse of the second Guinness trial (among
others) gave 'rise to a sceptical view of the City' ('Bank chief presses for
City battle on crime', June 16). He goes on to advocate a tribunal of City
regulators without juries to deal with 'market abuse'.
Lord Alexander can be forgiven for his relative inexperience in the City and
for his lack of knowledge of the facts of the Guinness trials; indeed I
wonder if he is aware that what he recommends is exactly what occurred in
those trials. Unknown to all but a few, a 'Roskill' type tribunal was
convened in December 1988 with a distinguished QC as chairman or judge and
two equally distinguished lay assessors drawn from the senior ranks of City
lawyers and accountants.
The purpose of this tribunal was to hear an appeal under the then Prevention
of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958 from an order of the secretary of state
removing the dealing licence from a registered licensed dealer who dealt for
me in a number of transactions. Included in these transactions was the
so-called Guinness transaction with which I was later to be indicted on
charges of 'creating a false market' and 'breaching S151 of the Companies
Act 1985'.
The evidence and judgment of this tribunal were kept secret by the
government for some three years (for reasons that will become abundantly
clear) and not revealed to the defence in the second Guinness trial until
forced out of the prosecution on the evening of the 54th day (the last
working day before Christmas 1991).
This fundamental and utterly relevant evidence showed that the 1988 tribunal
had found that no false market had been created and no breach of S151 had
been effected. Evidence under oath had been taken from the then director of
the Takeover Panel (something that did not happen in the first Guinness
trial). What is still, to me, surprising is that this evidence had not been
disclosed to the inspectors investigating the Guinness affair nor to the
Bank of England - both were in total ignorance, apparently, of this judgment
and its affiliated evidence.
I am satisfied that, had this evidence been made available to the first
Guinness trial, it too would have collapsed and none of those defendants
would have been convicted.
The scandal of the Guinness trials lay in the almost total ignorance of City
mechanisms displayed by the trial judge and prosecution barristers in
fundamental areas such as stock exchange regulations and the Talisman
settlement system.
Indeed, in so far as the Takeover Code was concerned, the trial judge was to
interpret these rules himself with no regard to established precedents. He
even went so far as to rule that the stock exchange definition of a 'false
market' was quite incorrect.
Lord Alexander should not be so sure that his system would come up with the
'right' result - he might well be surprised.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Fresh formula for complex equation: Ways of making higher
education in the UK more appropriate to greater numbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mass higher education in the UK is already a reality. While there has been
widespread support for its expansion, debate on how best to organise it and
how to fund it is now gathering heat.
The proportion of 18-year-olds going into higher education has more than
doubled in past 15 years, from 13 per cent in 1980-81 to 31 per cent this
year. This growth has been engineered by the government, which had aims to
raise the numbers in higher education to 33 per cent by 2000. Higher
education in the UK now reaches almost as many 18-year-olds as in Germany
(31 per cent) and the US (38 per cent).
But such rapid growth raises questions over the quality of higher education,
and whether the courses on offer are appropriate to today's needs.
They are not suitable, according to Professor Peter Toyne, vice-chancellor
of Liverpool John Moores University, who suggests the system is out-dated.
'We are at an important point in history where we are struggling to keep a
system afloat which is based on past assumptions. If it's going to go
further forward, reform has got to be radical,' he says.
Many employers feel that universities in the UK, despite their recent
expansion, are still organised along lines developed to educate a much
narrower elite in the 19th century. They fear that universities do not take
account of the growing demand from employers for a different, more flexible,
concept of higher education.
For example, the Confederation of British Industry says in its report,
Thinking ahead, published this month, that there needs to be more
flexibility in universities so that they offer access to people at all
stages of their careers, not just for three years after leaving school.
'Higher education is, and must be seen, as a resource for those in
employment to update their knowledge and skills as it is for young people,'
it says.
The CBI wants students to be able to transfer easily between universities,
to take career breaks and to follow courses while working. It also wants the
proportion of 18-year-olds in higher education to rise further to 40 per
cent.
But Mr Tim Boswell, higher education minister, insists there must be 'no
reduction in standards'. He recognises that the problem for policymakers is
that extra flexibility might lead to adulteration of quality.
Last week saw an important attempt in the UK to square this circle. The
Higher Education Quality Council, a self-regulatory body of vice-chancellors
which has government backing, published a report, Choosing to Change, which
advocates a new, flexible system of academic credits and modules.
Large degree courses would be split into discrete subject units, or modules.
Each module would then be worth a fixed number of academic credits. This
would create a 'common currency' for accumulating credits towards a degree -
regardless of whether the credits were obtained in conventional higher
education or vocational training.
The report also recommends the creation of an 'associate degree' mainly via
vocational training. With extra credits this could be upgraded into an
eventual honours degree, normally gained by three years of purely academic
study. The associate degree would also give students a qualification they
could use to look for employment after only a short period in higher
education; later, they could return to complete a superior, honours degree.
Such a system is on the way. Around 85 per cent of UK universities now have
some system of credit accumulation, or plans to introduce it. Agreeing a
common standard should thus be possible.
To make this system work, the report, drafted by Professor David Robertson
of Liverpool John Moores University, recommends that universities should
also adopt a standard national transcript on which tutors and lecturers
would fill in details of students' progress upon completion of each module.
Thus students could transfer more easily from one university to another,
while employers would have a better grasp of a potential recruit's
university career.
The CBI is keen on the idea, and believes it would enhance quality.
According to Mr Tony Webb, the CBI's director of education policy: 'Degree
courses should ensure individuals take control of their learning and develop
their core skills. A final grade cannot capture this development adequately.
It needs to be complemented by a record of achievement.'
But many in the academic community believe the HEQC report goes too far. For
example Professor Robertson attacks some modular courses which have already
been introduced in the UK as 'phantom' arrangements. These split courses
into modules, but 'without necessarily permitting any greater internal
choice or flexibility'.
Several vice-chancellors have implemented the 'phantom arrangements' which
Prof Robertson attacks, and fear that allowing greater freedom to 'pick and
mix' would lead to weaker qualifications. Professor Ron
Johnston,vice-chancellor of the University of Essex says his institution
will introduce modular courses in 1995. But it will be for administrative
convenience and to make life easier for mature students taking a degree
while continuing a career. A core of compulsory modules will be maintained
to ensure students do not avoid important but difficult courses - for
example Chaucer in an English degree or maths in an economics degree.
Prof Johnston says: 'A lot of students benefit from the traditional degrees
even though they aren't equally desirable for some other people. My fear is
that the possibility of a sustained three-year period in higher education
which is linear and structured could be squeezed out.'
Another who is nervous about the more radical suggestions of the HEQC report
is Professor Mike Brown, chief executive of De Montfort University of
Leicester, the fastest expanding university in western Europe. He also has
introduced modular courses but places limits on students' choices.
'We would not want to encourage people that they could just take things off
the shelf. We need them to do something which meets the marketplace's
needs,' he says, adding that American academics now seem nervous that choice
has become too varied, and want to instal more control over the choices
students make.
There are other reasons to fear that quality will be adulterated. Trying to
ensure that credits are fully transferable between institutions means
standards may sink to a 'lowest common denominator'.
Prof Robertson sets out to answer these objections. He wants more guidance
for students, and a quality control 'kite-mark' scheme for educational
brochures, to ensure that students do not misuse their freedom to choose
courses. Assurance of quality, he suggests, should be an institutional
responsibility but it should be buttressed by a central evaluation service
for academic credits, a consultative forum with professional bodies and
employers and an annual conference on higher education and the labour
market.
The higher education community will spend the next few months analysing
whether these safeguards are adequate. Rigorous quality assurance, if it can
be achieved, will be the key to making university expansion work for
emp-loyers.
The government, in the form of Mr Boswell, welcomed the contribution the
report has made to the debate and hinted at government support for the
transcript proposals. But for now the interest of the higher education world
is on how the government plans to fund the expansion in numbers due to
resume in 1997.
The debate among politicians over who should pay for mass higher education -
in particular whether students should bear some of the extra burden - has
barely started. With curriculum reform and restructuring likely to be
costly, such issues cannot be ignored for much longer.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Arts: Strauss back at Garsington - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once the home of Lady Ottoline Morrell and her husband Philip, Garsington
Manor is now the mini-Glyndebourne of Oxfordshire. The Morrell gardens, more
romantic than Glyndebourne's, are superbly kept up; and this year for the
sixth Garsington Opera season the terrace-auditorium has been expanded and
equipped with a retractable canopy.
Emboldened by the success of Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos last year,
Garsington has mounted his Capriccio as the opening 1994 show. No mean
undertaking: old Strauss's 'conversation-piece for music in one act' is in
fact a substantial opera in length, singing personnel and orchestra. Ideally
it requires more seasoned stars than Garsington can afford - and a singable
English version (half the audience kept their eyes glued to the bilingual
text, until it became too dark for reading). That said, however, this brave
performance was full of sympathetic charm.
The conductor Elgar Howarth found just, unhesitating tempi, and balanced his
modest Garsington Opera Orchestra with expert finesse. Except in the lovely
opening string sextet - but anyhow the producer-designer David Fielding
chose to counter that with onstage distractions. Not content with the basic
joke, that the Capriccio we are watching is the very opera that its
participants are deciding to write, Fielding has made it into a practical
dress rehearsal, with the 'director' La Roche constantly fussing at the
edges.
That slightly spoiled Countess Madeleine's final monologue too, where she
havers exquisitely between Words (the poet Olivier) and Music (the composer
Flamand). Yet Edith Pritchard, tall and svelte, had a warm grip on its
sense; all she lacks so far is the long-breathed amplitude for its most
celestial phrases. Her Olivier was Nicholas Sears, with a disaffected touch
of the Gary Oldmans and a sharp white suit; voice forceful at climaxes, dry
elsewhere. When Flamand first appeared in the comfortable, spreading person
of Richard Morton, I took him for the Major-Domo, but he displayed a nice
lyrical intelligence.
If Glenville Hargreaves looked a bit senior for Madeleine's roue brother,
his easy subtlety with the German words and the music surpassed everyone's.
Contrariwise, young Patrick Donnelly has to play 30 years older for La
Roche, but cleverly. Other roles were well filled; all very pleasing.
In repertory until July 8, with Haydn's L'Incontro improvviso and Rossini's
Barbiere di Siviglia (Garsington 0865 361 636)
Since the premiere of his Tryst at Peter Maxwell Davies' Orkney Festival
five years ago, James MacMillan - 35 this year - has become one of the most
successful and sought-after composers of his generation. His 1990 Proms
commission, The Confession of Isobel Gowdie, was a palpable hit; and at the
beginning of last season the Philharmonia made him their Visiting Composer.
This week he conducted them in two of his pieces - respectively old and new,
both very striking: Into the Ferment from 1988, and the trumpet concerto
Epiclesis he wrote last year for John Wallace.
Both of them celebrate states of blissful intoxication, the one on malt
whisky (inspired by a Burns ballad, 'Willie brew'd a peck o' maut') and the
other on the mystery of the Eucharist. MacMillan is a devout Roman Catholic
with a musical sense of humour. Into the Ferment, a Scottish Chamber
Orchestra commission, belongs to that burgeoning genre, music designed for a
youth orchestra - here the excellent Kent County band - stiffened with some
professional players.
It is a model of its kind. It rollicks seriously, if not soberly; gives its
younger performers plenty to do (notably a trio of reeling trombones); and
deploys the grown-up players only where they count, not so as to reduce the
band to mere accompaniment-status. The nine movements of Into the Ferment
are audibly well-argued as well as funny, and they amount to a little epic
of unexpected breadth and depth.
Epiclesis is expressly about transubstantiation, unlikely though that may
seem. MacMillan's device is to set up two distinct musical strands, an
impassioned explosive one and a rich, grave one based on Gregorian chant,
and let them interpenetrate little by little by osmosis.
The solo trumpet, wild and brilliant, serves as a first-person-singular
protagonist (Wallace was superb), with a long, questioning cadenza-reverie.
The large orchestra - six horns, a plethora of percussion - runs from
sonorous mystical background to hammer-fisted blows. The trombone trio of
Into the Ferment acquires a tuba, the better to intone the candidly
hymn-like material.
MacMillan's sophisticated rhythmic tricks take on a towering, exuberant
force as the music moves into ecstatic dance-mode: not unlike Messiaen's
comparable movements in spirit, but far less ritually formal.
It is a mystery why British composers should be at the fore in enhancing the
meagre trumpet repertoire, but they are. Along with Birtwistle's Endless
Parade and the recent Maxwell Davies concerto, MacMillan's Epiclesis sounds
like a permanent gift to virtuoso trumpeters.

When keen to annoy the boys, Maisie of 'The Perishers' used to ask
disingenuously 'Is this the kick ball season or the hit ball season?'
Perhaps she still does, but who reads the Daily Mirror these days? It seems
unlikely, anyway, because the internationalisation of sport has ensured that
there are virtually no seasons any more. Today television brings us the
opening day's play from the hit ball matches at Wimbledon with highlights in
Today At Wimbledon on BBC1 at 10.10. That is followed by highlights from the
last day's play in the England/New Zealand hit ball match at Lord's in
Cricket: Second Test (BBC1 11.10). But the big sports event, of course, is
the kick ball tournament in the USA. Brazil play Russia in World Cup
Grandstand on BBC2 at 8.30, then Holland play Saudi Arabia in World Cup 94
on ITV at 11.40. Those siding with Maisie may prefer to listen to I
Fiamminghi on Radio 3 in a concert which includes work by Handel, Boccherini
and Purcell (7.30) or 'The Monday Play' on Radio 4: The Devil's Province
(7.45). This is about getting by with the locals in Provence ..in 1213 when
efforts were under way to suppress the Cathar heresy.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Arts: Death throes or death wish? - The demise of the
British film industry is said to be inevitable. But, argues producer and
director Ismail Merchant, we may only have ourselves to blame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ISMAIL MERCHANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barely a week passes without another lamentation: the British film industry,
according to hand-wringing obituarists, is mouldering in the grave. Yet each
year Britain manages to produce at least two or three films that shatter box
office records on both sides of the Atlantic. Merchant Ivory did it with A
Room With A View and Howards End. Last year it was The Crying Game and The
Remains of the Day, and now it is Four Weddings and A Funeral. Each year a
steady stream of British films like Shadowlands, In The Name of the Father
and Much Ado About Nothing achieve critical acclaim and commercial success.
All these films compete triumphantly, both at the box office and at awards,
with the best in the world. This does not seem to indicate even a symptom of
ill health let alone death.
And how could it be otherwise when British cinema can draw from the best
writers, the richest source material, the finest actors and excellent
technicians? In addition, it has an enormous advantage over its European
neighbours in sharing a common language and culture with the United States,
so British films are immediately accessible to one of the largest movie
audiences in the world.
The morticians of the industry complain that there is no money for films
here. As a producer who has spent most of his life parting financiers from
their money I believe I am qualified to state with some authority that there
is money here. You have to go and get it, and it isn't always easy - but it
is there. Despite all the recent vicissitudes London is still a major
financial and commercial centre; it is also recognised worldwide for its
pre-eminence in the performing arts. It shouldn't take a great leap of the
imagination to connect the two and develop the possibilities. I have managed
to fund not only British productions, but also Indian and American
productions with City money. You have to work at it, but it can be done.
Film-makers in this country accuse the government of not adequately
supporting and funding the film industry. Of course the government should
provide incentives and subsidies, but it doesn't. So why does the industry
look to a weak and ineffectual government for help when it has been made
clear that the arts are not a priority and barely even on the agenda? The
energy that goes into lobbying the government for greater state intervention
is wasted, and could be channelled more productively into making movies.
Film-makers must take responsibility for their industry, and become more
aggressive in fighting for their films.
What has died in Britain is not the film industry, nor indeed any section of
the arts, which are demonstrably alive and flourishing, but rather the
indomitable spirit that once characterised this nation: the enteprising
spirit that established empires, the unyielding spirit that stoically
endured the hardships of war without a whimper of self-pity.
The passive, negative attitudes that are prevalent now, the constant moan of
complaint, are not just tiresome but a tragedy for this country. Since I
first came here some thirty years ago I have noticed, particularly in the
past decade, a gradual deadening of the spirit of the country. Goals,
ideologies and even thought seem to have died. It is as if a shroud has
descended on this island and everyone is resigned to living in this cocoon
instead of ripping it apart and letting the sunlight in. Even as Britain has
united with Europe it seems to be isolating itself from its partners.
When I work here I can tolerate the climate, the skittish fluctuations of
the economy, the food, and even the ridiculous rigidity of shopkeepers who
smugly slam their doors in your face punctually at closing time even if you
are waving a fistful of money at them; I can deal with any crisis and
calamity, but I'm becoming less tolerant of the pessimism and bleakness of
spirit that has permeated every aspect of life here. Yet people still
gravitate to Britain from every corner of the world seeking a better life.
If so many foreigners can see how much Britain still has to offer why are
the British so blinkered? When you start to believe that your country is
second rate, you are only a step away from creating a second rate country.
Equally damaging is Britain's capacity for disparaging her own achievements.
When we made A Room With A View in 1986 everyone was delighted with the
extraordinary success of the film. By the time we made Howards End six years
later, critics were picking holes in Forster's work and questioning why we
even bothered to film his novels. But those two films, together with our
production of Maurice and David Lean's A Passage to India, brought 28
Academy Award nominations, 10 Oscars and a heap of other awards, as well as
considerable revenue and kudos to Britain. No author in the history of
cinema can claim as much. Anywhere else Forster would be celebrated as a
national hero, a public holiday would be declared on his birthday and
streets would be named after him. But in Britain his reward is to be picked
over by soi disant intellectuals.
The British film industry should applaud its achievements and build on them.
British cinema has the talent and the ability, but it needs to rediscover
its spirit. The grave diggers should put their shovels away before the death
of the British film industry becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

FT  20 JUN 94 / The Monday Interview: Italy's player in a different world
cup - Guy de Jonquieres talks to Renato Ruggiero, who seems set to become
the EU's candidate as founder director-general of the WTO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy is not over-endowed with experienced public figures equipped, by
temperament and background, with a genuinely international outlook. Fewer
still can plausibly present themselves as convinced free-traders. Exclude
the many casualties of the country's political scandals, and the ranks look
even thinner.
Renato Ruggiero is a rare exception.
A former diplomat, trade minister and latterly Fiat's top international
representative, he has spent much of his career negotiating in Brussels,
Geneva, Russia and at world economic summits.
As well as gaining an inside view of the global power game, he has picked up
a working knowledge of half-a-dozen languages and been decorated by the
British and Japanese governments.
He can also claim to be an advocate of an open world economy. He played a
prominent role during a crucial phase of the Uruguay Round trade talks and
was one of the first Europeans to back the idea of a more powerful World
Trade Organisation to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
In just over six months' time, that idea is due to become reality. The
64-year-old Ruggiero is now engaged in an energetic diplomatic shuttle to
canvass support among Gatt's 123 members for his bid to become the WTO's
founding director-general.
The first declared candidate for the job, he has won enthusiastic backing
from Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, who no doubt hopes
the Italian government will return the favour by supporting his own campaign
for the commission presidency.
In recent weeks, Sir Leon has coached his man like a boxing promoter
grooming a heavyweight for a title fight - an analogy encouraged by
Ruggiero's heavy-set physique and pugilist's appearance. If all goes to
plan, his candidacy will be endorsed by EU leaders at their Corfu summit
next weekend.
However, both Ruggiero and Sir Leon know that that will not be enough to win
the prize. 'The players in international trade are no longer the usual old
ones,' says Ruggiero. 'It would be wrong nowadays to suppose you have won
the game if you have US and European support. You have to pay attention to
Latin America, Asia and Africa.'
Many developing countries - which comprise four fifths of Gatt's membership
 -think that after decades of European leadership of that organisation one
of their own should head the WTO.
Brazil has already nominated Rubens Ricupero, its respected finance
minister, and Carlos Salinas, Mexico's outgoing president, is testing the
water, apparently with US encouragement. They may make a virtue of their
national and regional affiliations.
Ruggiero, by contrast, has to go out of his way to prove that his origins
are not a handicap - a task made no easier by developing countries'
suspicions about the depths of the EU's commitment to free trade.
'The new director-general will succeed or fail, depending on whether he
represents not just one set of nations, but a much larger group,' Ruggiero
says.
'He will have a responsibility to help developing countries enter the
multilateral trade system in a real way and not as in the past, when there
was trade among the rich and aid between the rich and poor. That situation
has changed completely.'
He is also steering a careful line on the links between labour standards and
trade - an issue which has sparked bitter controversy in Gatt.
He says that those in the west who seek to promote stronger workers' rights
worldwide need to recognise that the objective is best achieved by
increasing the prosperity of poorer countries through free trade.
Such sentiments seem to have gone down well with the developing country
representatives he set out to woo in Geneva last week. 'He seems quite
folksy,' said one Asian ambassador approvingly, while emphasising that the
WTO contest remained wide open.
Ruggiero believes his strongest credentials are his record as an effective
negotiator and administrator, and his commitment to act as 'honest broker'
between WTO members' different interests.
These qualities, he argues, will be invaluable in the early stages of the
WTO's existence, when the requirement will be for efficient management,
rather than revolutionary change.
The top priority will be to implement the complex provisions of the Uruguay
Round, which runs to 28 separate agreements and 27,000 pages of text.
Equally important will be the proposed creation of stronger procedures for
settling trade disputes. The effectiveness of those mechanisms will
determine the WTO's political authority and, Ruggiero believes, its success
in persuading its members - above all the US - to forsake bilateral trade
weapons in favour of multilateral rules.
The importance of those rules will, he argues, become even greater as global
economic change accelerates and world trade policy focuses on new
challenges. In the future, he says, the biggest will notbe to resist a
relapse into 1930s-style trade protection, because liberalisation has
already demolished so many obstacles at frontiers. That step, he insists, is
irreversible.
Politicians, in Europe or elsewhere, who pretend otherwise are deluding
themselves: 'It would be a mistake to believe Europe can still choose
between openness or protection. Europe's options are closed. Only one is
left - to prepare industries and their management for global competition.
There is no other way. We have already lost too much time.'
In his view, the WTO's central task will be to organise a framework for that
competition. The biggest threat Ruggiero sees is from regional trade blocs.
Though the barriers around their markets are falling, he says, there is a
risk that regions will try to use their political muscle to impose trading
rules on the rest of the world.
He also believes the WTO will need to take a lead in defining international
competition policy disciplines.
'Until now, Gatt has been mainly concerned with the interests of
governments. The future system must also take into account the attitudes of
big multinational companies, some of which have sales bigger than the GDP of
medium-sized countries.'
Ruggiero is less forthcoming about how that prospect is viewed by Fiat - and
the several other big companies which he serves as director or adviser.
However, he insists that should he fail in his bid to become the trade
system's global gamekeeper, he would be content to return to hunting with
the corporate pack. 'I have a position which satisfies me completely. I am
not looking for a change of job.' But he swiftly adds: 'I am looking for
this job.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Though Japanese banks are still suffering from the worst loan crisis since
the second world war, Sanwa Bank has taken the business community by
surprise by moving up to second place in the list of the country's top
earners, writes Emiko Terazono.
And behind this rise is Naotaka Saeki, who masterminded Sanwa's drive to cut
costs and produce an early recovery in earnings. He takes over as president
from Hiroshi Watanabe.
Some critics suggest that Saeki may be 'too dry', implying that he
disregards the old-boy network, which counts for much in Japan, but he has a
strong following within the bank thanks to his straight talking.
Having made Sanwa's the largest domestic network, Saeki will now try to
change its down-to-earth image engendered by its Osaka industrial base into
that of a quality lender.

Francesco Caio, a 36-year-old former McKinsey consultant who has an MBA from
Insead, has become the first chief executive of Omnitel Pronto Italia, which
won the licence to become Italy's second cellular telephone operator in
March, writes Andrew Hill.
Caio, a computer science graduate from the Politecnico di Milano, was head
of the telecom and multimedia division of Olivetti, the Italian computer
group which is the lead member of the Omnitel Pronto consortium. Other
members include Bell Atlantic and Pactel of the US, and Mannesmann of
Germany.
Omnitel Pronto Italia has pledged to invest up to Dollars 1bn in developing
its network in the first two years, and expects to launch its service in the
final quarter of 1995.
The Omnitel Pronto Italia group learned that it had won the licence just
before the polls closed in the Italian general election. Berlusconi's
Fininvest was part of the losing Unitel consortium, headed by the Fiat
industrial group.

FT  20 JUN 94 / People (Names in the News): Expansionist mood for Gerard
Worms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wheeling and dealing is part and parcel of corporate life at Suez, the
sprawling French holding company; yet Gerard Worms, its chairman, can have
greeted few deals with quite so much relief as last week's sale of Abeille
Re, the reinsurance business, to the SCOR group, writes Alice Rawsthorn.
The deal marked the end of three years of arduous negotiations over the
disposal of Victoire, the French insurer that owned Abeille Re and was
recently sold to the UK's Commercial Union. It also marked a turning point
for Worms himself who, having spent his first four years as chairman
embroiled in disposals, is now free to indulge in expansion.
Worms, 57, is an easy man to underestimate, as his fellow French financiers
now realise. His genial air and mild manner prompted some to dismiss him as
a paler shadow of Jean Peyrelevade, his former boss who is now chairman of
the Credit Lyonnais banking group.
He did little to confound his critics during his first few years at Suez
when tussling with the task of instilling some sort of strategic direction
into its vast and varied interests. But he soon showed his mettle by
fiercely resisting the attempts of Peyrelevade (then head of Union des
Assurances de Paris) to achieve an easy - and cheap - takeover of Colonia,
the German insurer controlled by Victoire.
The two men finally struck a deal late last year but Worms was generally
seen as having struck the better bargain. He then went on to auction off
Victoire and, having completed that task, can now settle down to convincing
his critics that he is as good at buying as he was at selling.

FT  20 JUN 94 / People (Names in the News): Lamb to set up another
'listening bank'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grumblers may complain that Britain often seems like a third world country,
writes Peter Norman. But that is not why the World Bank is boosting its
presence in London and installing a full-time senior official in its eyrie
in New Zealand House this summer.
The Bank is sending Geoff Lamb, one of its high flyers, to the UK to build
up relationships with Whitehall, the City, universities and non-government
organisations and tap UK expertise on development issues.
By setting up a 'listening bank' in the UK, the Bank hopes to strengthen its
capability to deal with such thorny issues as development and environment on
its home turf in Washington.
A youthful-looking 50, Lamb was a close aide of and speech writer for Barber
Conable, the Bank's president in the late 1980s. He is currently in charge
of the Bank's policy on public sector reform in former Communist countries
and the Middle East.
Lamb is no stranger to the British Isles. He is an Irish citizen, having
been exiled from South Africa in 1965, and will be responsible for relations
with Ireland in his new job. He was deputy director of the Institute of
Development Studies at Sussex University before joining the Bank.
There are also family ties in London. Lamb is married to Caroline Atkinson,
a former economics correspondent of The Times and daughter of Sir Fred
Atkinson, the government's chief economic adviser in the late 1970s.
With the move to London, Atkinson will have to leave the IMF, where she is
responsible for Italy and Greece. But a new career beckons - probably at the
Bank of England.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Media Futures: US evangelists put case at London forum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You can already send electronic mail messages to the White House. Indeed,
some of the senior Clinton administration officials responsible for trying
to create a US information superhighway will communicate no other way.
But from September the White House will even start sending e-mail messages
back - unless of course the correspondent wants something a little more old
fashioned. After all you can't frame an electronic message from the US
president and hang it on the wall.
'Those who want a letter from the President can have that,' explains David
Lytel. of the US Office of Science and Technology Policy. But those who just
want an answer to a question will get e-mail.
Lytel was one of a group of high-powered US superhighway specialists in
London last week for a forum organised by the Programme on Information and
Communication Technologies, based at Brunel University.
In a video conference from Washington, the shape of the information dream
was spelled out by Michael Nelson, a principal adviser to the Clinton
administration on the information superhighway. He forecasts that almost
certainly by 2010, and probably by 2005, nearly everyone in the US will be
linked to a national information infrastructure which will give Americans
easy cost-effective access to any medium - voice, data, images or video.
'From health care to education it will improve every aspect of our lives,'
said Nelson, who faced considerable scepticism from many UK specialists.
These suspect future services on an information superhighway may, in fact,
be delivered by a wide range of different technologies.
The US government estimates the creation of an information network linking
every home will cost around Dollars 100bn - although some forecasts go as
high as Dollars 400bn. Most of this investment could occur naturally and
gradually as cable and television companies upgrade their networks and
install more fiber optics. The burden is to be borne almost entirely by
business, although the US government is already providing Dollars 26m a year
to help boost new applications - a sum that is now rising to Dollars 100m.
An additional push could also come from the US, by making sure all
government information is available electronically and priced at the cost of
dissemination, rather than the cost of acquisition. Some of the American
visionaries who want to see a broadband, high-capacity connection into every
home do seem also to be placing an each-way bet on the Internet, the
international electronic data network that already has some 20m subscribers
and is said to be growing at the rate of 1m new users a month.
'We love the Internet and we consider it a brilliant success,' said Lytel,
who believes it is at least a model of what a national information
infrastructure could achieve.
At the end of the London Forum a great deal of connecting still needed to be
done between the almost evangelical American search for a global
superhighway and British distrust for ideas raised and rejected in the early
1980s, when the then information technology minister Kenneth Baker tried to
promote visions of 'the wired city' of the future.
As Prof Nicholas Garnham, director of the Centre for Communication and
Information Studies at the University of Westminster, put it: 'Chasing the
concept of a information superhighway is simply chasing a will o' the wisp.
Garnham added that he found it a bizarre notion that American politicians
were placing such emphasis on a superhighway, rather than on issues such as
food and housing.
Martin Elton, another British professor, although now at New York
University, suggested the information superhighway was a political slogan
and as long as it remained undefined it could remain all things to all
people. 'Once, if ever, it is defined it would be likely to create losers as
well as winners. Some interesting battles can be expected then.'

FT  20 JUN 94 / Media Futures: Books - big change to the worm's eye view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reading text on a computer screen may not have the same appeal as curling up
on the couch with a good book, but 'electronic books', on CD-ROM discs, are
rapidly gaining ground.
Among the 'best sellers' in this new market are reference works that take
advantage of the 'navigation' or searching capabilities of a personal
computer to provide indexing far superior to printed texts.
Microsoft's Encarta multimedia encyclopedia does not look as impressive on a
bookshelf as a collection of leather bound volumes, but it provides a more
useful source of information for those who are already familiar with
computers.
High school students, for example, may find the electronic 'hypertext' -
which allows the reader to skip quickly to related topics - a more efficient
and inviting method of researching an essay subject than poring over the
pages of a conventional encyclopedia.
Microsoft also publishes a collection of CD-ROM reference books, called
Bookshelf, including the American Heritage Dictionary, Roget's Thesaurus,
the World Almanac Book of Facts, Barlett's Familiar Quotations, an atlas and
other works on a single disc.
As well as the text of these books, Bookshelf includes sound to demonstrate
the pronunciation of words, and animation and video clips to illustrate
scientific concepts and historic events. The multimedia features of CD-ROM
enhance the value of home reference books, such as the Mayo Clinic Family
Health Book. For instance, if you are going to have knee surgery, the text
provides a description of the knee joint, together with anatomical diagrams.
Click on a symbol representing a camera and you can view a short video clip
of what the surgeon will see inside your knee using an arthroscope.
Text books, travel guides and do-it-yourself instruction books are also well
suited to the CD-ROM format. Media Mosaic, an Oregon software company, plans
to publish interactive multimedia 'how-to' guides for sports. Books That
Work, a California venture, has teamed with the Hearst Corporation to expand
its line of CD-ROM books on home improvement and repairs.
The student of history will also find several CD-ROM publications of
interest. Time Almanac of the 20th Century, published by Compact Publishing
of Washington, DC, has been widely acclaimed for its combination of Time
Magazine texts, graphics and video clips.
Few would suggest that the CD-ROM will replace the paperback novel, but
children's illustrated story books are being adapted. Young computer users
can move through Broderbund's Living Books, such as Arthur's Teacher
Troubles, at their own pace, listen to the story being read or click on
words to explore their meanings through animated illustrations. For a
generation reared on video images, CD-ROMs can make learning to read books
good fun.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Media Futures: Barclays in-house revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank is accelerating in-house multimedia developments designed to
keep it competitive in electronic banking and take it into new business
areas.
It has been shaken by the speed with which the major telecommunications
companies have managed to provide acceptable multimedia services, such as
video-on-demand over conventional telephone lines. Now it is planning to
have its first interactive trials in some branches by the end of the year.
The bank sees VOD as the model for a range of new, electronically-delivered
services which will transform retail and wholesale banking over the next few
years. Among the possibilities are a virtual end to branch banking and its
replacement by video kiosks and interactive television offering a broad
range of services, such as catalogue shopping in addition to current account
processing.
These threats are not new. What is new is the speed with which possibilities
are becoming realities. Barclays senior management is aware of the urgency.
Chairman Andrew Buxton is insisting the bank's 70 top executives take
multimedia awareness training this year.
Joseph De Feo, head of information technology at Barclays, says: 'We thought
we had time. We planned to have the programme motoring by 1996-97 based on
our estimates of the investment in infrastructure the telcos would have to
make to deliver these services. They made faster progress. Here and in the
US, the telcos can provide video-on-demand over the existing telephone
network. We don't have five years now and this is putting pressure on
developments.'
Barclays has its own multimedia unit, part of Barclays Network Services. It
has a staff of 15 and a budget of over Pounds 1m a year. It is managed by
Anwer Shah, an experienced multimedia expert formerly with Sony of Japan and
VideoLogic, the UK electronics company. De Feo believes that only Citibank
of the US is taking a similar approach to multimedia. The group has already
developed some pioneering products through collaboration with partners - an
electronic shopping and banking kiosk with the Italian San Paulo bank, an
electronic shopping catalogue through a project part funded by the European
Commission - but its principal object is to prepare Barclays for the
electronic future.
De Feo says: 'Our intention is to have the know-how inside the group to be
able to make judgments about the right avenues for us to develop: smart
telephones, interactive television, or electronic kiosks.'
Barclays is in close discussions with all the major multimedia players,
British Telecom, AT&amp;T, Mercury and the computer suppliers. An internal
programme, code named 'Columbus' is looking at the future: which suppliers
the bank should form relationships with, which joint ventures it should
pursue, which areas it should exploit first.
De Feo says that organisations like banks will have to think radically about
how multimedia will affect them. They will no longer control the delivery
channel because customers will no longer go physically to branches. So he
believes Barclays should play a part in the new 'channel', in the provision
of software 'agents' that will lie between the customer and a broad range of
multimedia services. These special computer systems will be a critical part
of the delivery mechanism, carrying out a range of services on behalf of the
customer. Seeking out a new car from a dealer's database automatically, for
example, securing the best insurance and settling the deal through
electronic funds transfer.
'Multimedia will make possible a range of services, but the customer will
use an agent to gain access to them. The agent will be the brand. We would
not want to get into agent work outside things we know about. But we believe
we have to be a partner with the telcos or technology companies in
developing agent activities. We could find that we will get as much in the
way of revenues out of our participation in the agent business as we do out
of banking.' De Feo reasons.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Architecture: In worship of Pugin / Review of the new
exhibition at the V and A
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin was a phenomenon. Born in 1812 he was dead
only forty years later, by which time he had married three times, produced
eight children, designed the interior of the Houses of Parliament -
including every stick of furniture, built several Roman Catholic cathedrals
and churches, and almost single-handedly inspired the Gothic Revival in
English architecture and decoration.
His manic energy was combined with intense discipline and a deep but simple
convert's catholic faith. He was a genius with passion. But his work has
never received the level of appreciation it deserves.
That is about to be put right at the exhibition that has just opened at
London's Victoria and Albert Museum. 'Pugin - A Gothic Passion' is sponsored
by Pearson plc, whose interests include the Financial Times, and runs until
September 11.
The exhibition succeeds in being a sumptuous treat, while gently presenting
a scholarly account of a life devoted to a creative mission. Historically
Pugin suffered from the dislike of Ruskin and the kind of intellectual
isolation that is often handed out to creative artists by their immediate
successors.
The exhibition at the V and A is exceptionally ambitious, not only because
of its scale but also because it has involved years of original research and
detective work to track down some 400 artefacts. To display them all in such
a way that they can illuminate the progress of Pugin's life and work is not
easy. The task of designing the exhibition was given to the architects John
Outram and Jeremiah Sheehan, who have created from the fairly basic set of
exhibition rooms a series of dramatic and evocative spaces. They have also
devised a way of making great collages of Pugin's patterns - using computer
technology in a way that Pugin, had he been practising now, would surely
have devised himself.
The usual problem of architectural exhibitions is the absence of the actual
buildings. In Pugin's case this is more than compensated for by the sheer
proligacy of his furniture, ecclesiastical ornaments, wallpapers, materials
and ceramics. Pugin must have dreamt patterns. This exhibition shows above
everything else that he was a master of flat pattern, and that without Pugin
there could have been no William Morris designs.
When you step into the first room you are confronted by a huge version of a
drawing of a gothic church. This was drawn in 1821 when Pugin was nine. It
shows what was in his mind as a child, and he went on to become a prodigy
designer by fulfilling a commission for some furniture for Windsor Castle
when he was only fifteen. Some of this furniture is on show, but the great
Pugin sideboard was destroyed in the Windsor fire of 1992.
Pugin's early passion for the Gothic was not a stylistic obsession but a
conviction that Gothic was an architecture of principle. It was the only
architecture that represented truth to materials and offered the opportunity
of true craftsmanship as a form of Christian worship. The exhibition is
liberally strung with texts and Puginian aphorisms - one of the most typical
is his statement: 'There is nothing worth living for but Christian
architecture and a boat.'
The sea and sailing were his other passion and from his home in Ramsgate he
frequently sailed to London, or to France, for his sketching and antique
collecting trips. He worked on board his various boats and always dressed in
practical sailing clothes, even on land. He clearly responded to the
ship-shape order of life at sea and he ordered his own extraordinary working
life with as much precision as the captain of a ship.
Pugin's greatest monument is the Palace of Westminster where he worked with
Charles Barry on the interiors and furnishings. The throne from the House of
Lords dominates this section of the V and A. Much of the medieval mummery
and flummery of Parliament must be put down to the effect of Pugin's Gothic
dream world upon our legislators. Pugin himself said of his life and work:
'I indulged in a sort of Catholic utopia.'
It is his influence upon the church that provides the exhibition with its
finest display. The re-creation of a church interior is at the heart of the
display - you can rest on a Pugin pew to absorb the quality of the sort of
ecclesiastical stage set that he saw as the setting for the Mass. It is more
than a medieval revival because of the intention behind it to convince the
emerging nineteenth century that heaven was going to be a Gothic dream. The
quality of the metalwork, vestments and embroideries here is incredible.
Beyond this Gothic extravaganza lay a lot of stern messages - and these are
most often realised in the furniture which bears out Pugin's strictures
about truth to materials and simplicity of construction. It will come as a
surprise to discover that Pugin was the pioneer of 'flat-pack' furniture.
There are some tenuous links made by the V and A with 20th century
designers, who may have learned from Pugin - I suspect most of them had
never heard of him.
You end your tour of the exhibition with a visit to a reconstruction of the
Medieval Court from the Great Exhibition of 1851. This does not succeed as
well as the rest of the exhibition, perhaps because the whole of Pugin's
life and work is itself such a miracle that the display of it at the V and A
deserves the title of a great exhibition for itself.
The exhibition is open from 10 00 to 17 30 Tuesday to Sunday and from noon
to 17 30 on Mondays, until September 11. There is no catalogue as such but a
special book of essays has been published by Yale University Press to
coincide with the show - price Pounds 19.95.
A private view of the exhibition for Financial Times readers will be held on
Thursday, July 14 at 6.30-8.30. Tickets, Pounds 10 each, from Louise
Gordon-Foxwell on 071 873 3563

A breakdown in the air-conditioning system of a high-speed train left
passengers ill and gasping for air late last week. One traveller broke a
window on the train, from Paris to the southern city of Tarbes, as heat and
bad air became intolerable, French railway officials reported.
An unspecified number of passengers among the 600-700 making the trip were
taken ill and required medical treatment when the train was forced to make
an unscheduled stop for two hours.

all 188 countries in the world in just 80 days.
Stuart Cheese and David New will be taking 170 flights and travelling 80,000
miles by land, sea and air in the record bid which they hope will raise
Pounds 250,000 for the United Nations Children's Fund.
The existing record for visiting every country on the globe was set by two
American missionaries but it took them 41 years - from 1934 to 1975 - to
complete the task.

Jamaican hotelier Gordon 'Butch' Stewart has agreed to replace Canadian
investors who backed out of a deal to take over Air Jamaica two weeks ago,
according to Reuters.
Stewart is expected to fill the 25 per cent equity gap created when Cochrane
Investments Corp of Toronto, Canada, withdrew its pledge made last month to
invest up to Dollars 14m in the airline.

In a tale of government regulation turned cozy, US federal inspectors placed
on cruise ships to detect illegal immigrants have been taking family and
friends along for free or reduced fares, reports the Associated Press.
Immigration and Naturalization Service agents allowed the cruise lines to
pay the inspectors' travel expenses without documentation.
The INS is required to check cruise ships for aliens as they reach US ports.
But some inspectors took round trips that left them with idle time aboard
the recreational vessels or at foreign ports, then filed for overtime pay.

Burma's ruling military junta has launched a 'Visit Myanmar in 1996'
campaign in a bid to counter bad publicity abroad, according to state
television monitored in Thailand.
Myanmar, as the country is called by the military junta, has set itself the
ambitious target of attracting 600,000 tourists during 1996. Western
diplomats say there were fewer than 30,000 tourist arrivals in 1993.

Several children were injured when a coach taking them home from a church
outing lost control, police said today. The coach, carrying 31 children and
13 adults, ran across a roundabout and narrowly avoided two cars before
coming to a stop on a grassy bank on the A380 at the junction with the
Torbay ring road, Devon.
Some children were treated in hospital for shock before being released; one
12-year-old girl was detained overnight for observation.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Business Travel: Just lounging around
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES JENNINGS

<TEXT>
Airlines have discovered a new area of competition - their executive
lounges. Set apart from the general confusion of the airport terminals, and
dedicated to business-class passengers, these lounges try to be both an
office away from the office, and a home away from home.
They provide somewhere quiet to work, with plenty of telephones, fax and
photocopying facilities, free drinks, newspapers and magazines, and enough
comfy seats to allow travellers to put their feet up. And it's all
complimentary.
Within this framework, however, there are many variations, as exemplified at
London's Heathrow airport (see table).
The Servisair executive lounge, for instance, provides facilities for
passengers flying with Alitalia, Iberia, TAP, Olympic, Finnair and Austrian
Airlines, all in one not very large room tucked away along a corridor in
Terminal Two. It comprises an adequate but rather plastic bar and coffee
area, seating for about 40, three telephones, a fax and (when I looked in) a
large, shoeless businessman, unconscious in front of a television.
The windows have no views, the ceiling has a chilly chrome finish and you
have to use the public loo in the corridor outside.
Compare this with American Airlines' Admirals Club in Terminal Three: the
lounge is vast, with 225 seats, two copiously stocked bars, many telephones,
vibro-chairs, two shower rooms and an immense marble entrance. Being
American, it believes that work is as important as a good Bloody Mary, so it
provides 14 individual, comfortable workstations, each with a phone.
The Admirals Club combines the indulgent (leather armchairs, dark-stained
wood, thick carpeting) and the utilitarian (large, bleak windows overlooking
the apron outside, bare walls, the showers kept locked). It feels like a
luxury garage, devoid of personality.
This highlights a fundamental problem: it is hard to find an executive
lounge that inspires a sense of well-being in its passengers for the brief
time they are using it - a place combining business efficiency with the
virtues of a good hotel.
Qantas comes close to this ideal, with a warm, tasteful, classy facility, up
the stairs in Terminal Three. Japan Airlines' Sakura class, on the other
hand, may have 150 seats, free beer and a place to play cards, but the
furnishings are austere.
There is another option: Virgin Atlantic, with its famous Clubhouse
facility, has a non-self-service bar, staffed by women in red uniforms. It
has a music room with a Pounds 13,000 hi-fi, a massage and aromatherapy
suite, and a large library. And it has a train set.
The train set is symptomatic of all that is best and worst at Virgin. It
looks terrific, but it doesn't work.
Where the track makes a detour behind the bar, it fills up with spilled salt
and sticky liqueurs, resulting in weeks of closure. But, as a Virgin
employee explains, one frequent passenger is so keen on model trains that he
changes out of his suit, mixes himself a drink and disappears underneath the
train set to fix it.
Virgin, it seems, has subverted the whole idea of business travel, and tried
to make it fun.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Working Life: If you can stand the heat - Eating Out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eating in the kitchen usually evokes images of a rushed breakfast or
childhood banishment from the dinner table. It's just the opposite, however,
at Toronto's stately King Edward Hotel, part of the UK-owned Forte chain.
Executive chef John Higgins has set aside a corner of the King Eddy's main
kitchen for The Chef's Table, at which he serves a sumptuous seven-course
dinner.
But the Chef's Table is more than a gastronomic adventure, Higgins completes
each dish and decorates the plates in front of his guests. In his thick
Glaswegian accent, he introduces each course with an explanation of the
ingredients and his reasons for choosing them. Guests are invited to stretch
their legs between the sorbet and main course, with a guided tour of the
kitchen.
Don't expect the decor of an upscale restaurant. A Sterling Vineyards poster
hangs incongruously from the door of a steel fridge. The white-tiled walls
are filled with past guests' appreciative grafitti scrawled in gold marker
pen. Conversation at the spacious, round table is occasionally interrupted
by a loud bell at the nearby room-service station.
Higgins decides on the menu, often just a few hours in advance of the meal.
Wines (one for each course) are chosen by the hotel's restaurant manager
Andrew Laliberte. He makes a point of including at least one selection from
Ontario's fast-improving vineyards.
One recent dinner began with smoked Atlantic salmon marinated in chopped
ginger, and served on a mashed potato well filled with capers, seaweed and
parsley. The second course was Quebec foie gras garnished with Ontario
asparagus spears, followed by pan-seared portobello mushrooms with scallops
escargots on a garlic tomato broth. The main course was spiced, roasted
venison cutlet with grilled yams. Dessert consisted of a poached pear on a
pool of strawberry and rhubarb glaze, decorated with crisp almond tuille.
Higgins tries to tailor his menu to suit the group. On one recent occasion,
when most of the guests were South Africans, he introduced an imaginative
new flavour to gazpacho with biltong flakes.
The table is often booked by companies eager to make an impression on
customers or out-of-town visitors. Perhaps not surprisingly, recent
appreciative diners have included senior managers from McDonald's, the
hamburger group, and one of North America's biggest doughnut chains.
The Chef's Table is available only for groups of six to ten. Advance
reservations are essential. The cost is CDollars 100 per person, plus
CDollars 50 or so for wine, depending on selection.

Every restaurant correspondent hopes that when he, or she, sits down to
their word processor it will inspire readers to go out and enjoy the
restaurants that have been described.
So it is with a heavy heart as a tennis enthusiast (whose greatest claim to
tennis fame is that he once had a most enjoyable lunch in Sydney with a man
who, in his youth, played doubles with Rod Laver) that I sit down and list
some of the restaurants in south London which may be useful over the
forthcoming Wimbledon fortnight. A heavy heart because I hope, like so many

What is it with Ray-Bans, exactly? How is it that they've become the optical
equivalent of Levi's - casual-dress Americana that no-one can now live
without? Heretical as this may sound, are they necessarily the best
sunglasses, or even the ones with the most desirable label? Is there an
alternative to trying to look like Tom Cruise or one of the Blues Brothers?
Well, if you want to get away from that Ray-Bans gangster/used car dealer
look, but are desperate for a name with which to impress your friends, the
most obvious alternative is Armani.
Armani sunglasses (as opposed to the cheaper Emporio Armani range) not only
come in the latest styles (little lozenge-shaped James Joyce-style sunspecs
being very popular at the moment), but are also surprisingly durable. They
carry a two-year guarantee - most sunglasses are only guaranteed for one
year - use glass lenses (for better vision) with anti-reflective coatings,
and will stand up to considerable wear and tear. Prices range from Pounds
115 to Pounds 180.
Serengeti and Vuarnet are also worth mentioning. Serengeti are American,
traditionally-styled, well-made, appealingly low-key glasses with
photochromic glass lenses; and are aimed heavily at car drivers who want
something that will cut out the glare but still allow them to see where
they're going. Prices are between Pounds 89 and Pounds 125.
Vuarnet - somewhere between Pounds 50 and Pounds 75 - are French action
men's sunglasses, extremely tough, extremely black and wrap-around. They are
ideal for skiing and other dynamic sports activities.
But if you really want to be different, you must hit California: this is
where Oakley and REVO sunglasses come from - sunglasses which, if you are a
serious fan, leave Ray-Bans standing.
REVO's frame styles are smart mainstream; but their lenses are full of NASA
technology - pricey but extremely effective. Their H20 range, for instance,
has a glare-reducing treatment which allows fishermen and water sports
enthusiasts to see through the surface of the water to what's below.
Moreover, most REVO's come not with the usual drab black or brown lenses but
with those bearing the most stunningly coloured reflective surfaces,
transforming them into objects of weird beauty. Expect to pay between Pounds
120 and Pounds 170.
Even REVO's, however, have a hard time matching Oakleys. Oakleys are science
fiction: radically-styled one-piece wrap-around shades with detachable arms
and nosepieces, available in an extraordinary, lurid rainbow of colours.
Pounds 110 will buy you a complete pair, while a further Pounds 60 will buy
you a different, interchangeable lens set.
They and the other brands mentioned can be found at Sunglass Hut,
Selfridge's and good opticians.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Working Life: Pension relief for the self-employed - Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are self-employed, in the UK, the second instalment of your income
tax is due on July 1.
This payment will be the second for the 1993/94 assessment. For those who
have been in business for a number of years, it is based on profit earned in
the 1992/93 tax year. One way of reducing the tax bill is to check that you
are happy with the level of contributions paid into your pension scheme. You
obtain relief at your highest rate of tax on premiums paid into a personal
pension plan but only up to a certain percentage of earned income. The
percentage is determined by your age, as the table shows. The earnings cap
for 1994/95 is set at Pounds 76,800, up from Pounds 75,000 the previous
year.
The 'carry back' rules allow pension premiums made now to be treated as if
they had been made in 1993/94 so that the tax relief becomes available
immediately, instead of being delayed until the tax due on the 1994/95
assessment is paid next year. Since the tax relief is granted at the rate
for the earlier year, the carry back provision is useful if you have moved
from being a higher rate taxpayer to the lower band.
Eileen Doherty, tax manager at Fiona Price &amp; Partners, independent financial
advisers, says: 'If you were a higher rate taxpayer last year and pay Pounds
5,000 into a personal pension plan now, you could cut tax due next month by
Pounds 2,000. You need to complete a claim form and send it to your
Inspector of Taxes with a receipt from the pension provider.'
You cannot carry back any further than one year unless you had no taxable
earnings in 1993/94, in which case you could go back to 1992/93. But no
further than that. 'Carry forward' provisions let you 'mop up' unused
pension pension contributions from the past six years but you must have
first used up all the present year's allowance.
Andrew Frape, tax partner with chartered accountant Wheawill &amp; Sudworth,
says people often overlook the fact that life assurance premiums paid under
a pension policy can also qualify for tax relief. The limit is 5 per cent of
earnings regardless of age. Note that this is not in addition to those
limits listed in the table.
Do not, however, increase your pension contributions only to reduce tax.
Consult a fee-based independent financial planner or your accountant to see
if it fits in with your wider financial plans.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Working Life: Company route to drug testing - Health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOKOTO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most employees assume that what they do in their own time, and to their own
bodies, is their own business. But issues of safety and health can sometimes
justify company intervention in personal activities.
One such activity which may concern employers is drug use. In the UK, the
idea of testing employees for substance abuse in the workplace is fairly
new. But in the US, where drug testing has been common since the mid-1980s,
some 30 to 40m drug (including alcohol) tests are performed annually in
about 4,000 laboratories in the US.
There, testing is not limited to industries where safety is the prime
motivation for drug surveillance. In the financial sector, many companies
test recruits and some will also test incumbent employees if they suspect
them of abusing drugs or alcohol.
In the UK, there is currently very little information about the extent of
drug use in the workplace, nor has anyone proved a definite correlation
between drug use and performance. But an increasing number of companies are
not willing to take the risk, especially in safety-sensitive sectors like
oil and transport.
London Transport, for example, has been conducting pre-employment testing
since December 1992 and has now introduced unannounced testing of staff in
safety critical. 'The driving force for implementing testing was safety, but
of course we are concerned about health,' says Dr Pat Diamond, director of
London Transport medical service.
The Faculty of Occupational Medicine of the Royal College of Physicians is
due to publish a report this month* which provides guidelines for testing
for substance abuse in the workplace.
The report draws attention to the importance of setting up an accreditation
system for laboratories, training medical officers and providing information
for medical undergraduates and general practitioners.
It also stresses the importance of knowing why a company wants to test for
drugs in the first place. 'One of the problems is that a lot of companies
feel it would be a good idea to have drug testing but have not identified
their objectives sufficiently,' says Dr Diamond, who chaired the working
party which compiled the report. 'But there is no point in going into this
sort of business if you do not come up with the results you wanted in the
first place.'
A company may wish to test for a number of reasons besides public and
employee safety. Other reasons include improving the health status of
employees, raising performance standards, protecting financial information,
public relations and corporate image or the attainment of a 'drug-free'
workplace.
Once a company decides to launch a drug testing programme, it must consider
what can be quite heavy costs for lab analysis, setting up testing areas,
lost working time, while employees await test results, and the added cost of
conducting unannounced tests on working sites.
'I think it is very important not to rely on a drug testing programme to
prevent drug abuse,' says Dr Diamond. 'I believe that drug abuse policy
awareness, discussion and a counselling service are really far more
constructive ways for preventing drug abuse than testing itself.'
'Guidelines on Testing for Drugs of Abuse in the Workplace' can be ordered
from the Faculty of Occupational Medicine, 6 St Andrew's Place, Regents
Park, London NW1 4LB, 071 487 3414

FT  20 JUN 94 / Sport: Going to the dogs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This Saturday, one of the great English sporting events will take place in
Wimbledon. It will not be set upon the green rectangles of the district's
heartland, but in the urban streets which stretch beyond into unlovely south
London. It will receive no front-page spread in Monday's newspapers, but a
mere paragraph. It will last for less than half-a-minute. Its winner will be
feted by no more than a few thousand fans. Yet this winner will have been
proved perhaps the greatest in the world in his or her sport; as surely a
Wimbledon champion as that infinitely more celebrated one up the road.
The Greyhound Derby - the final of which is being run this Saturday night at
Wimbledon stadium - is still a great sporting occasion to those that follow
dog racing. But beyond them it does not resonate at all.
Yet the Derby still carries within itself the memory of its more glorious
past and the knowledge that it is worth as much as any other test of
excellence. It remembers when it was reported in newspapers with the
unquestioning respect given to all great sporting occasions; when it was
watched by crowds of up to 70,000; and when the dogs that won it were heroes
to millions because people who scarcely understood the sport itself could
still understand its importance.
The memories within the Derby reach back to 1927, when the race was first
run at White City stadium (remaining there until it was demolished in 1984).
Just a year earlier, greyhound racing itself was first staged in England. It
was the remarkable fortune of both the race and the sport that they should
have been almost immediately hijacked by a dog named Mick the Miller.
Plain and workmanlike, with a streetwise glint in his eye, Mick's success
was such that he became a national celebrity, instrumental in raising annual
attendances at race meetings from 5.5m in 1927 to over 20m in 1932. He was
so famous that he was subjected to a rudimentary marketing campaign: he made
a film and had his face embossed on the back of powder compacts. He also won
the Derby in 1929 and 1930, a double that was not emulated until 1973; and
won 19 races in succession, a record which was not broken until 1974. The
definition of excellence that he described has never been re-written.
Above all, he gave to greyhound racing, very early in its history, an almost
unlooked-for focus. The assortment of spectators that had followed the sport
in the first couple of years had been woven together by Mick the Miller into
a bewitched entity. This entity grew ever-larger as the sport, polished by
its brushes against the world of fame, gradually assumed its familiar and
seductive image of earthy, urban, English glamour.
By the late 1930s, everyone was going to the dogs: aristocracy, film stars,
bohemians - all of them helplessly desirous of inhabiting that rich, real
world of fun and money. By 1945, attendances at race meetings had reached
50m. From that dazzling peak they could only fall, as they did almost every
year thereafter; they are now barely one-tenth of that magical figure; but
the image of the sport had coalesced into something less destructable and
the Derby, which would never again be attended by the crowds of the
immediate post-war boom, would never lose the power that those nights had
bestowed upon it.
However, the demolition of White City threatened to cut the links with the
past contained within the race. Would it remember still how Mile Bush Pride
had won by an inch in 1959 or how the anti-post favourite, Hi Joe, had been
kidnapped in 1965, or how Prince Philip's winning dog had been booed in
1968, or how Tartan Khan had won at 25-1 in 1975? Would it remember Mick the
Miller, who had turned the race and himself into the stuff of myth?
It would - because it is through the dogs themselves that the grandeur of
the Derby persists. That is Mick's final legacy. From the moment that he
revealed his greatness, followers of his sport knew what a greyhound could
be, should be, like; and from then on they have always been looking for
another one like him, or better than him. His peculiar fascination was to
have a great, unconscious speed which he controlled by a great and conscious
intelligence. To see the desire to run being transmuted into a desire to win
is still, 65 years later, the most thrilling sight in greyhound racing, and
one of the most thrilling in sport.
Most dogs cannot create such a sight. And most of dog racing is workaday
stuff, betting shop fodder, an endless sequence of numbers from which
gamblers can formulate their meaningless equations. Yet the strange thing is
that one never thinks of it in that way, once one has been to the Greyhound
Derby.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Working Life: Computers off the trolley - Training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's most successful attempt at business sponsorship of schools, the
Tesco Computers for Schools scheme, has been extended.
If you are one of the millions of parents who have been coerced by schools
into collecting vouchers for computer equipment, you may be relieved to know
that the closing date will now be June 26. Schools then have until July 15
to process their applications.
Computers for Schools is an undeniably successful commercial promotion,
which analysts already believe has a noticeable effect on Tesco's sales
volumes.
The retailer is into its third year of running the scheme, and it has
already been copied, with WH Smith launching a scheme for buying school
books, and Boots offering sports equipment. But is it the way forward for
funding the UK's often under-resourced schools? And does it provide voucher
collectors with value for money?
Both of these questions are harder to answer. Take-up shows there is a
demand. Last year 11,000 schools - out of around 40,000 in England and Wales
 -received at least some equipment under the scheme.
But schools now have to teach information technology as a theme running
through the national curriculum, and banks of computers for all pupils to
use are a standard sight in primary schools. Tesco funding might not go that
far.
Cynics can also point to the massive basket-loads of Tesco shopping which
need to be completed to earn a computer. The cheapest computer available
needs 2,500 Pounds 25 vouchers - or Pounds 62,500 spent at Tesco.
But the difficulty schools have in raising the money forces them to work
closely with their local communities. And, teachers attest, that has
encouraged parents to take a greater interest in schools, and, relatively
painlessly, to help with funding.
Some schemes linking with local employers or community groups provide superb
learning opportunities. For example, St Andrew's Academy in Saltcoats, has
joined with a local company, Craigie Carpets, to start its pupils on
computer-aided textile designs.
And some schools managed amazing organisational feats. King Edward VI School
in Lichfield, Staffs, last year claimed five computers, and three multimedia
CD-ROM drives. It had collected 30,600 vouchers - Pounds 765,000 spent at
Tesco.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Management: Mean bosses, nice bosses, no bosses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I'm not sure how best to break the news, so I'd better come out with it
straight. The FT Mean Boss Award has been a total flop.
Two weeks ago I asked readers to nominate up to three mean bosses. I was
looking for leaders of Britain's biggest companies who were tyrannical,
bullying and intransigent. I was expecting so many responses that I had
considered installing a special fax machine.
Sadly, however, I received just one lonely reply that met the criteria laid
down. That came in an anonymous brown envelope and nominated Rudolph Agnew,
chairman of Lasmo. It cited nine unflattering attributes, some of which are
unprintable.
I am reluctant to award the title to Agnew, about whom I know nothing that
substantiates the claims. In any case he is disqualified for being in the
middle of a particularly ugly bid battle. For all I know, the sender is some
joker from Enterprise Oil.
Having rejected him, and in the absence of any other suitable candidate, I
am declaring the competition null and void. But before forgetting this
unhappy episode, I want to understand why the result was so disappointing. I
can think of three possible explanations.
Nobody read the original article.
All British bosses are delightful to work for.
The bosses are so mean that people do not dare to expose them.
The evidence from my in-tray leads me to reject the first two explanations.
There was no shortage of mean boss nominations, but nearly all of them run
companies too small to qualify. Judging from the letters, these bosses are
so horrid as to be barely credible. Here are three particularly mean ones:
The boss of an engineering company who apparently sacked one person for
taking his jacket off during a meeting, and another for humming. He also
shouted at a senior manager for using his private toilet on the company's
jet.
The chairman of a chemicals group who takes colleagues out to lunch, only to
scream at the top of his voice in the middle of a busy restaurant.
Apparently this individual likes nightclubs but always leaves his guest to
pay, and fills his own cigar case from the box provided for company
entertainment.
The head of a distribution company who was so incensed by the state of his
finance director's private car that he subjected him to a humiliating
inspection of his colleagues' cleaner vehicles.
Amid so much evidence of mean bosses of medium-sized companies, how is it
that there could be none at the top? Are they all rumbled before they reach
the first division?
I have occasionally heard say that there was a mean streak running through
Sir Alastair Morton, Sir Colin Marshall, Sir Peter Levene, Mick Newmarch,
Sir Richard Greenbury, Alan Sugar, Sir Allen Sheppard, to name just a very
few. It seems I've been misinformed.
                          *      *      *
Moving on to ultra-nice bosses, I was surprised to learn that Ben &amp; Jerry's,
the Boston ice cream maker, is scrapping its relatively egalitarian pay
scales in its search for a new CEO. The famous New Age, socially aware
company is looking for someone with 'gentleness of spirit', but is having
trouble buying that at its cut-price rate.
However, to conclude that there is a market rate for every job would be
wrong, at least on UK experience. All the studies show a great variance
between comparable jobs in comparable companies. I doubt if Sir David Lees,
who earns Pounds 330,000 at GKN, wants to move to TI Group just because the
top job there commands more than twice as much.
As for Ben &amp; Jerry's, it was all very well if Ben Cohen himself had a small
salary, because he has a big stake in the business. But for a new CEO to run
a thriving company as a wage slave, earning what in the US is peanuts, may
be pushing it.
                          *      *      *
A scurrilous story in the tabloid press linking strippers and call girls to
the eminently respectable Confederation of British Industry turns out to be
true - well, almost. I've just had lunch with Howard Davies who drew my
attention to a News of the World story claiming that the woman who by day
organises the vol-au-vents for the VIP guests at the CBI is by night hiring
out strippers. The only flaw in the story is that the woman in question is
not exactly a 'CBI boss' as stated, but an employee of the contract catering
firm used at Centre Point.
It says much for Davies that he can see the funny side of a story that
claims CBI stands for 'Crumpet, Bonking and Indecency'. Indeed he thinks the
story considerably more accurate - and certainly more amusing - than a
perfectly credible tale in The Independent newspaper last week. That claimed
that the CBI leader was backing Tony Blair for the Labour leadership. Let us
hope that Blair is also amused when he finds out that Davies is less worried
about the CBI being publicly associated with girls in bondage gear than with
a presentable young man who may lead the country one day.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Management: Helping staff to help others
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A novel 'trade fair' at which 40 voluntary organisations effectively compete
for the free time and expertise of up to 35,000 British Airways employees
will be staged near London today.
Designed to achieve a better return on what BA chairman Sir Colin Marshall
calls the airline's 'care capital' - the largely untapped energy, skills and
enthusiasm of staff which can be donated to charitable causes - the
initiative is likely to interest senior managers in other large companies.
The main aim of the Community Partners Fair, to be held in a converted
hangar at Heathrow today and tomorrow, is to identify and recruit mentors.
These are individuals or groups of individuals among BA's staff prepared to
adopt a particular charity and offer their skills on a one-to-one basis. As
well as all employees working at head office, BA has invited its pensioners,
whom the company believes are a potentially valuable voluntary resource.
'This is by far the largest exercise of its kind in Britain,' said the
organisation Business in the Community approvingly last week. 'It is also an
example of a company listening to its employees rather than betraying the
signs of what we used to call the chairman's wife syndrome.'
Gary Gray, BA's head of community relations, sees staff development as one
commercial benefit for the airline but he also maintains that companies such
as BA require a broader 'licence to operate'.
He adds: 'We have listened carefully to those who say that time and skills
can be just as useful as money. In our overall strategy in this area we are
giving surplus resources which are of minimal use to us but which are of
enormous value to the community as a whole.'
Today's fair has been widely promoted within the airline, half of whose
staff said in a survey last year that they wanted to be more involved in
community projects. BA has even costed the manpower value of time
volunteered in the 1993-94 financial year at Pounds 2.7m. 'We want our
employees to come and see what's on offer and decide for themselves how best
to help,' says Gray.
Exhibitors range from local organisations, such as the Hounslow
Afro-Caribbean Association and the West London Somali Association, to
national charities including Age Concern, the British Red Cross Society and
the Prince's Trust.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Management: Desert island manager - John Monks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Monks, 48-year-old general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, is
not looking forward to his time on a desert island. A 'moderniser' who is
trying to reverse years of TUC decline, he would not, however, seek to
direct events back in the office from the end of a telephone. 'I'm one of
those who believes out of sight out of mind,' he says.
How would you cope with loneliness?
'I've got a good strain of self-reliance, which means I like walking the
hills. I'd be pretty relaxed thinking out things. But, after a few days I'd
get bored with my own company.'
If you could take one person with you who would it be?
'I have to say my wife, who would go beserk if I said anybody else. But if I
could one other person it would be a shipwright or somebody who could help
get me back to civilisation.'
One luxury?
'A Portacabin for a degree of comfort. I like roughing it for short periods
but after a couple of weeks I'd get tired of sleeping in a tent.'
What additional item would you need for the beachside office, part from a
fax or a telephone?
'A radio tuned to the World Service. I'm a news junkie. I would probably be
anxious about not being in touch but I don't think that I'd have any
influence on the course of history, or the TUC, while I was away.'
How would you keep yourself occupied?
'I'd like to learn to play the piano and improve my tennis. I'd also try and
polish my writing skills and perhaps write a novel set in provincial
England, a kitchen sink of the 1990s, about a young person growing up in a
town that was a bit less grimy than where I was brought up but where there
are less opportunities than in the 1960s.'
An after dinner film?
'Can I take two please? First, Some Like it Hot, with Jack Lemmon, Tony
Curtis and Marilyn Monroe. I can watch that several times a year. Also, a
film that improves with watching is I'm Alright Jack, with Peter Sellers. I
find the charactures more attractive every time I see them.'
One book?
'The one that bears re-reading and has had a lot of influence on my life is
The Grapes of Wrath, which I first read at 15. Whenever my appetite for
social change gets dulled, re-reading that book replenishes me and I get
stuck in again.'
Music?
'I'm very much into Mozart's operas at the moment. I'm saving Wagner for my
old age.'
Food?
'I eat to live, rather than the other way round. So I would be fairly
relaxed about food. But, I'd enjoy some real ale and a couple of bottles of
malt whisky.
If you were stuck on the desert island for the rest of your life how would
you like to be remembered?
'One generation which passeth away and another generation cometh'.
Ecclesiastes i2.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Management: Private pain of public sector - The role of
non-executives in UK public services is increasingly important as concern
grows over potential waste and corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK public services such as health, transport and education have adopted many
of the methods of the private sector in the past 15 years. But has this
exposed them to the sort of excesses that can arise from a more
entrepreneurial approach?
The government's aim has been to improve the efficiency and responsiveness
of the public sector by encouraging managerial autonomy and placing much
greater emphasis on performance. The move away from the traditional
administrative approach of delivery, however, has led to growing concerns
over waste of taxpayers' money, corruption and fraud.
It has also raised questions over the role of the thousands of outsiders
appointed to the boards of quangos and other bodies that deliver public
services. These 'non-executive directors' have been blamed for several of
the failings of public bodies, which led to the warning in February from the
powerful Commons Public Accounts Committee of a decline in management
standards. This parliamentary watchdog catalogued an increase in 'serious
failures in administrative and financial systems and controls' in government
departments and other public bodies. These included:
The loss of at least Pounds 20m on an abortive plan to computerise the
Wessex regional health authority involving conflicts of interest between
board members and computer contractors.
Serious neglect of their duties by members of the West Midlands regional
health authority that allowed managers to waste more than Pounds 10m on the
authority's services organisation.
Misuse of public funds at the Welsh Development Agency, including the
provision of cars for board members without requiring them to pay for
private motoring.
'If the level of problems continues at its present level, we are just not
capable of handling it,' Michael Stern, a Conservative member of the PAC,
told a recent seminar called to launch a discussion paper on corporate
governance in the public services* published by the Chartered Institute of
Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa).
The seminar brought together more than 50 top managers from the sector to
discuss the responsibility and accountability of those in charge of
high-profile public services.
The starting point for the discussion was the report of the Cadbury
Committee, set up in 1991 to examine the financial aspects of corporate
governance in the private sector. Participants in the seminar were keen to
see whether they could learn anything from the debate in the private sector
over the code of practice recommended by the committee in its 1992 report.
One immediate point of similarity between public and private sectors was
highlighted by Sir Adrian Cadbury, the businessman who chaired the
committee. He pointed out that behind most cases of fraud and mismanagement
lies the unfettered role of a single individual.
'Checks and balances are needed to avoid these undesirable concentrations of
power,' he said.
The Cadbury committee had concluded that strengthening the role of
non-executive directors and separating the roles of chairman and chief
executive was the key to good corporate governance. It was the
responsibility of the non-executives to provide independent judgment on
issues of strategy, performance, resources and standards of conduct, on
behalf of the shareholders.
Noel Hepworth, director of Cipfa, warned that creating such checks and
balances was more difficult in the public sector. These services are
accountable to a variety of stakeholders, including the community at large,
their customers and higher levels of government.
Too often, it was assumed that political accountability was a substitute for
good governance, he said. Yet the interests of politicians and the public
services may not be the same, with the former subject to the short-term
imperative of re-election.
'We have to look for alternative structures which harmonise with, but are
not part of, the political process,' he said.
The Cipfa paper suggests that non-executives in the public services should
play a bigger role in reviewing the systems of internal control, financial
or otherwise. They must ask questions about the balance of power and
authority in the organisation, ensuring that no single individual wields
unfettered power.
They should ensure that their own roles are properly defined, and that there
is a clear understanding of which decisions must be taken at board level.
And they are responsible for ensuring adequate systems of internal control,
monitored by effective internal and external auditors.
Non-executives also need to promote greater openness in the public services
they are responsible for, said Hepworth. He believes that exposing the
public sector to competition has made it more secretive.
'The competitive threat has made managers less willing to disclose
information and discuss problems with others,' he said.
Yet openness is central to good corporate governance, as Sir Adrian reminded
the seminar. 'It is essential if the public are to have confidence in the
organisation,' he said.
If non-executives are to fulfil all these tasks effectively, they need to
understand the wider public interest issues involved in the delivery of
public services, according to Hepworth. Public bodies must work within an
ethos that stresses impartiality and equity as well as efficiency and
effectiveness.
The requirement of equity, for example, implies fairness in the distribution
of scarce resources and equality in the treatment of customers. Training may
be required to introduce those with no experience of public-sector
management to the norms of behaviour expected of them.
Hepworth's hope is that public services will draw up their own equivalents
of the Cadbury code to promote good governance in ways that reflect the
unique features of each service. The National Health Service has already
published a draft code for consultation.
A similar inquiry is under way among housing associations whose board
members - all unpaid non-executives - now handle large amounts of public
money and raise impressive sums on the capital markets.
However, better governance in the public services may also require a greater
commitment from non-executives. Sir Adrian warned the seminar that outside
appointees may need to commit more time than many currently do if they are
to provide the necessary monitoring. They should also be subject to tough
assessment of their performance, he added. 'If someone is not pulling their
weight on the board, the chairman should take action - passengers drag down
the whole ship.'
Those invited to join the boards of bodies delivering public services can
expect much closer scrutiny of their performance in future, with increased
expectations of their responsibility for ensuring good corporate governance.

FT  20 JUN 94 / TV watchdog seeks curbs on 'superhighway'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has been urged to set up strong competition policies for the
media and information industries in order to prevent abuse of power in the
age of multimedia and information 'superhighways'.
The urgent appeal has been made by the British Screen Advisory Council, the
all-industry body set up to advise governments on the film, television and
video industries. The council argues in a report sent to the Department of
National Heritage and the Department of Trade and Industry that the
convergence of media, computers and telecommunications is likely to alter
the rules for the screen-based media business.
If the 'cultural imperative' - the sum of the benefits of public-service
broadcasting - is to endure, then tough competition policy will have to come
before liberalisation and extensive changes in ownership rules. The council
wants the powers of the Office of Fair Trading strengthened so that it can
take more independent initiatives.
'To be truly effective, an enhanced OFT would need enhanced resources,
additional powers and the political will that they should be used,' the
council says. The remit of an enhanced OFT should include monitoring the
market operations of private and public broadcasters in order to protect the
public interest.
It should also be able to allow private lawsuits for damages arising from
the abuse of dominance and distortion of the market.
No one should be allowed to use a dominant position to inhibit the growth of
a competitive programme market, the council says. It also believes that the
BBC must be free to pursue commercial ambitions as long as it continues to
fulfil its public-service obligations. Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of Central
Television and of the ITV Association, registered an objection to the
council's policy on the BBC.
The council believes that a flexible policy framework is needed to cope with
developments, including digital compression technology. That will involve
hundreds of television channels; high-definition, interactive and widescreen
television; multimedia and virtual reality. Rather than dealing with each
activity in isolation, general principles should be developed to manage the
changes under way.
The council says conventional broadcasting will become 'part, and a receding
part, of the entire spectrum'. But technological change should not be
allowed to obscure the role of public-service broadcasting.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Manchester runway hearings open tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two local authorities and eight protest groups trying to stop Manchester
Airport building a second runway will use five main lines of argument at a
public inquiry beginning tomorrow. The inquiry is forecast to last until
March 1995 and to cost about Pounds 2m.
Opponents will say the Pounds 160m, 3,050-metre runway should be shelved on
the grounds of green-belt law, environmental protection, operational
unsoundness, air safety hazards and potential danger to public health.
Instead, Manchester will be urged to operate its one runway more efficiently
and transfer charter business and small aircraft to Liverpool and
Leeds-Bradford airports.
Liverpool's expansion plans will face their own public inquiry if they are
called in by Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary. Mr Gummer has said
the Manchester outcome would not then be announced until he was also ready
to pronounce on Liverpool's plans. Macclesfield District Council and
Liverpool City Council will lead the objections to Manchester's plans,
followed by Majag - Manchester Airport Joint Action Group, formed from eight
separate campaigning bodies.
The airport wants to expand to 30m passengers a year by 2005 from its
present size of 13m-plus and rising. It claims 50,000 jobs would be created.
Surveys have shown more than 90 per cent of businesses in north-west England
support the expansion, which some regard as more important economically to
northern England than the Channel tunnel.
To win, Manchester must show it is in the public interest to set aside the
law protecting Cheshire's green belt. The objectors will say Manchester
needs a second runway only because it operates inefficiently by allowing an
uneconomic mix of sizes and types of aircraft, that the proposed runway
configurations will be unsafe because flight paths overlap, and that
increased activity will disturb residents.

<TEXT>
Mr Peter Wickens, personnel director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK), is
to leave the company.
Mr Wickens, who is also a board member, is credited with moulding the shape
of industrial relations and practices at Nissan's Pounds 900m UK plant at
Sunderland, Tyne and Wear. He joined the Japanese carmaker in October 1984
as the first British employee of its Sunderland plant.
A former industrial-relations manager at Ford, he jettisoned most industrial
relations practices at Nissan, substituting team-working and flexibility.
He instituted a controversial single-union agreement with the AEEU
engineering union, as well as 'flat' management structures and single status
for all employees.
Last autumn he implemented an 'agreed separation' policy - shedding jobs
without redundancies. He will leave the company early next year.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Tories back away from EU funds row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative Euro-sceptics are preparing to back away from confrontation
over a bill increasing Britain's contribution to the European Union's budget
for fear that renewed wrangling could smooth Labour's path to government.
But ministers may be unable to exploit the situation to secure Commons
approval for the measure before MPs begin the summer recess next month, as
they had originally intended.
This is because the bill remains blocked in the EU Council of Ministers.
Meanwhile, in an indication that the government still faces a struggle to
get its way on some European issues, Tory rightwingers yesterday intensified
their calls for Britain to veto the appointment of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the
Belgian prime minister, as president of the European Commission.
The calls were led by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, who said
Britain should reject the nomination of Mr Dehaene and threaten to veto it.
Earlier this month, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, hinted that the
government was not prepared to veto Mr Dehaene's appointment if its
preferred candidate - Sir Leon Brittan - did not gain enough support among
other EU states.
Tory Euro-sceptics yesterday played down the prospects of a Maastricht-style
rebellion over the bill giving force to changes in the European Union's
funding system. They warned of a 'sea-change' in attitudes brought about by
growing concern in Conservative ranks that Labour was making itself
'electable'.
But Sir Teddy Taylor, a leading Euro-sceptic, made it clear that he would
oppose the bill, which will lift Britain's contribution to the EU budget in
line with the agreement reached at Edinburgh in December 1992.
Sir Teddy, the MP for Southend East, said he found the idea of passing a
bill to give the EU more money 'literally unbelievable'.
According to the Treasury, Britain's net payments to the EU are set to more
than double to Pounds 2.8bn in the year beginning April 1995 from Pounds
1.3bn in 1994-95.
The government said last month that the bill was being blocked by Italy in
the Council of Ministers, making it increasingly unlikely that it can be
presented to MPs before the Commons summer recess starts next month.
If ministers are unable to introduce the measure until the autumn, it will
raise the prospect that next year's legislative timetable will have a
pronounced European flavour, which would be unwelcome to the government. A
bill to permit the enlargement of the EU is also expected to be included in
the timetable.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Spending level to govern pre-election tax cuts: A view from
the Institute for Fiscal Studies about the chancellor's options in post-1994
Budgets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Mr Kenneth Clarke used his 1995 or 1996 Budget to make pre-election tax
cuts, he would be following closely in the footsteps of several of his
recent predecessors. Lord Howe's 1983 Budget saw a pre-election increase in
the ceiling on mortgage interest relief, Lord Lawson's 1987 Budget cut 2p
off the standard rate of income tax, while Mr Norman Lamont, even amid
gathering fiscal gloom, found room to cut income tax by around Pounds 2bn by
introducing a new 20p tax rate in 1992. But if electoral considerations are
at the forefront of the present chancellor's thinking, his scope for
implementing substantial tax cuts looks rather limited.
One important fact to bear in mind is that the government has yet to finish
implementing all of Mr Lamont's tax increases announced in March 1993, to
say nothing of the additional tax increases set out by Mr Clarke last
November. Chief among the Lamont measures is the increase in the rate of
value added tax on domestic fuel from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent due in
April 1995. In addition, both chancellors announced sharp real increases in
duties on petrol, and to these Mr Clarke added increases in tobacco duty and
further cuts in income-tax allowances.
Altogether, these measures represent an additional Pounds 6.5bn of tax
increases still to come in April 1995 and another Pounds 2.5bn in April 1996
as the full effects of these measures work through.
What evidence is there to suggest that the fiscal (as opposed to political)
climate has changed so much since last November that there is now scope for
tax reductions? One promising sign is that the out-turn for the public
sector borrowing requirement in 1993-94 was about Pounds 4bn lower than had
been expected at the time of the November Budget. While some of this was due
to one-off factors such as higher local-authority capital receipts, a
significant part did reflect slightly better than expected economic
performance.
A further source of encouragement has been the recent trend in unemployment.
By convention, it is assumed that over the planning horizon unemployment
will remain unchanged, and the November projections were based on a figure
of 2.75mn. This is likely to be an over-estimate for 1994-95, where on
present trends unemployment looks likely to average less than 2.5m. Given
that each 100,000 off the unemployment register is estimated to save the
government about Pounds 350m in social security spending alone, the overall
effect of the fall in unemployment could be to add a further Pounds 1bn or
so to the chancellor's room for manoeuvre.
If the chancellor was perhaps Pounds 2bn or Pounds 3bn better off than he
had anticipated, he could - in principle - either cancel some of the planned
tax increases, or go ahead with the announced changes but at the same time
cut other taxes. If he went down the first route the most attractive option
would probably be to cancel the second stage of the imposition of VAT on
fuel. The loss of revenue from this would be more than Pounds 1.5bn, but he
could also cancel the second stage of the social security compensation
package and reduce the net cost to around Pounds 1bn.
As an alternative, the chancellor could attempt to re-establish the
Conservatives' tax-cutting credentials by going straight for the most
prominent tax rate of all - the standard rate of income tax. The government
is in principle still committed to moving towards a standard rate of 20p,
and just under Pounds 2bn of the chancellor's spare cash would buy him a
standard rate of 24p. The beneficial political effects of such a change
might however be somewhat diminished if implemented next April, since the
overall package would still represent a net tax increase of about Pounds
4bn.
All of this speculation is based on the assumption that the existing
public-spending plans will be adhered to. An overshoot on the rather
stringent public-sector pay targets would soon change the picture. In the
longer term the message is that significant tax cuts will be possible only
if there are substantial cuts in public spending.
Over the past 15 years this has simply not happened, with spending in
1994-95 accounting for almost exactly the same share of national income as
in 1978-79. Unless the economy performs markedly better than expected Mr
Clarke will have to wield the knife on spending far more effectively than
his predecessors if he is to have any scope for significant pre-election tax
cuts.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Call for tougher trademark bill likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturers of leading brands are vowing to continue their campaign for
legislation to curb supermarket 'lookalike' brands, in spite of their
failure to get measures included in the trademarks bill, which has its third
reading in the Commons today.
Several MPs are expected to call for tougher measures against lookalike
brands, own-label products designed to resemble closely those of top
manufacturers, but the bill is thought likely to be passed by the Commons
without significant amendments.
Brand manufacturers are hopeful, however, that they may extract a promise
from Mr Patrick McLoughlin, a junior trade and industry minister, to look
into the issue further.
They want legislation to stop supermarkets not only infringing registered
trademarks, but copying the overall look of branded goods, including the
colour and shape of packaging.
The manufacturers say existing safeguards, such as the threat of legal
action against 'passing off', are inadequate, especially compared with
legislation in continental Europe.
The British Producers' and Brand Owners' Group, which includes companies
such as Unilever, Mars and Grand Metropolitan, was originally formed as a
loose alliance to campaign for measures in the trademarks bill. It is now
expected to appoint a formal secretariat, with a constitution and agreed
funding, to continue its fight against lookalike brands.
The group's spokesman, Mr John Murphy of Interbrand, the consulting group
specialising in branded goods, said brand owners had no alternative but to
fight on.
Own-label products now account for more than 50 per cent of turnover in
superstore chains such as Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway, but have been
strongest in areas such as chilled and fresh foods and some packaged goods.
However, after the launch of Sainsbury's Classic Cola as a direct competitor
to Coca-Cola, manufacturers fear the supermarkets will take the battle into
areas where branded goods remain dominant, such as soft drinks and branded
alcoholic beverages, pet foods and cereals.
Mr Murphy cites Sainsbury's recently launched peach schnapps, which brand
owners claim is a lookalike of IDV's Archers, as another example of the
trend.
Sainsbury insists the drink is not a copy of Archers, and in fact more
closely resembles some brands in continental Europe, where peach schnapps is
a well-established drink. It defended its use of a frosted-glass bottle with
the claim that this was necessary to protect the drink.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Nissan's personnel chief at Sunderland to quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Wickens, personnel director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK), is
to leave the company.
Mr Wickens, who is also a board member, is credited with being the man who
moulded the shape of industrial relations and practices at Nissan's Pounds
900m UK plant at Sunderland, Tyne and Wear. He joined the Japanese carmaker
in October 1984 as the first British employee of its Sunderland plant.
A former industrial-relations manager at the Dagenham body-plant of Ford, he
jettisoned most industrial relations practices at Nissan, substituting a
philosophy of team-working, flexibility and quality.
He instituted a controversial single-union agreement with the AEEU
engineering union, as well as 'flat' management structures and single status
for all employees. He will leave the company early next year.
Mr Wickens masterminded the recruitment needed for the swift expansion of
the Nissan plant, which now employs 4,250. It was the UK's biggest car
exporter in 1993, with nearly Pounds 1bn in export earnings, and is Europe's
most productive car plant.
Last autumn he implemented an 'agreed separation' policy - shedding jobs
without redundancies in the face of the European car sales downturn. He said
he was not leaving under this programme. 'Unfortunately it's closed,' he
remarked.
The AEEU has not found recruitment easy given its lack of a
collective-bargaining role at the plant: just 40 per cent of employees are
members. But Mr Wickens said he is 'a friend of trade unions' and believes
they have a role to play in the new style of industrial relations.
He said: 'The vast majority of British trades unions haven't really
addressed these issues. It's up to trades unions to find their relevance.'
He said at the weekend that this was an 'opportune time' to move on, having
been at Nissan 10 years.
However, he is not moving to another job in industry - his plans include
lecturing. His second book, The Ascendant Organisation, is to be published
next year.

FT  20 JUN 94 / University bonds plan completed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most universities will be able to raise private capital from the bond
markets, possibly by the end of this year, under a financial blueprint
commissioned by university vice-chancellors and the government.
Formal government guarantees would not be needed under the scheme, which
marks the first extension to the higher-education sector of the government's
private finance initiative. The initiative was launched two years ago by Mr
Norman Lamont when he was chancellor.
Primary legislation is also unnecessary, according to the blueprint, which
was completed last week. Universities will not be forced to borrow money
this way, but most are thought likely to find the long-term fixed interest
rates on offer in the bond markets very attractive.
European Capital, the merchant banking advisory group, and the solicitors
Trowers &amp; Hamlins, which were commissioned by universities to draw up the
blueprint earlier this year, estimate that a bond issue of Pounds 75m is
possible by the end of this year, depending on how quickly universities can
fix their budgets after the beginning of the academic year in September.
They would do so in a syndicate, using a vehicle company with a small
permanent staff, similar to The Housing Finance Corporation, which has
raised Pounds 770m for housing associations in bond issues since 1990.
European Capital is confident there is sufficient demand in the City for
universities to be able to borrow at rates significantly better than they
could obtain from banks.
Not all universities and other higher-education institutions will be able to
raise funds this way, as the City will not be convinced about their
credit-worthiness. However, European Capital is certain the majority will be
able to.
Universities need the finance for capital projects such as libraries and
laboratories. Many say they are under-resourced after the sharp expansion in
student numbers over the past 15 years, which has seen the proportion of
18-year-olds going into higher education more than doubling from 13 per cent
in 1980-81 to 31 per cent this year.
The universities recognise the reluctance of the government to pay for
projects which could be funded elsewhere. This year the Committee of
Vice-Chancellors and Principals made no request for student accommodation in
its submission for Treasury funding.
Alternative plans to raise finance only for the financially strongest
universities, or to attempt to put together bond issues for all higher
education institutions, were considered but rejected.
Some universities are alarmed by the prospect that by joining a syndicate
with other lower-ranked institutions they will in effect be providing them
with a subsidy. However, European Capital's research shows that all the
institutions involved in a syndicate would gain from the preferential rates
on offer for larger-scale syndicated borrowing.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Performance pay backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost half the average pay increase is linked to how well staff perform at
work, says a survey of more than 1,000 managers by the Industrial Society,
the advisory and training organisation.
The survey acknowledged that performance-related pay has had a relatively
bad public image recently, attributing this to suspicion that companies used
it to cut pay bills rather than as an integrated part of company strategy. A
report about to be published by Superboss, a consultancy in Windsor, will
claim that PRP is rarely effective.
The Industrial Society survey also covered the more general area of
'performance management' where appraisal may not necessarily be linked to
pay. Half the organisations surveyed linked the results of appraisal to
individuals' pay.
A majority of managers favoured a link between pay and the outcome of
appraisal, but a majority also lacked confidence that their organisation had
got this link right so far.
The financial sector appeared to have embraced PRP most enthusiastically.
Overall 43 per cent of the average pay increase was linked to individual
performance but in finance this rose to 61 per cent. In the public sector
the share was 26 per cent. Rises were 100 per cent determined by performance
in fewer than one in five organisations nationwide but in almost one in
three financial sector companies.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Tax-collection record slammed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday attacked the government's 'scandalous' tax-collection
record, saying 10 times more tax was being written off today than when the
Tories came to power.
Releasing figures indicating that the amount of tax written off last year
was a record Pounds 1.5bn, Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief Treasury
secretary, said this was more than would be raised by increasing the rate of
value added tax on domestic fuel from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent.
She said the sum was also equivalent to nearly half the government's
employment and training budget.
The Inland Revenue said last month that more than three-quarters of the
amount of tax written off was the product of insolvencies during recession.

Weakness in the housing market is the greatest threat to further consumer
spending growth, PA Cambridge Economic Consultants says today in its latest
quarterly survey.
It adds that consumer confidence remains fragile but has improved slightly
following the impact of April's tax increases. Only 12 per cent of people
believe the recession has ended, it says.
However, the number of people intending to buy houses or flats within the
next year has fallen to its lowest level since the survey began more than
three years ago.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Council chief attacks Banham
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chief executive of Cleveland County Council, Mr Bruce Stevenson,
yesterday accused Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government
Commission, of misrepresenting the council's popularity, John Authers
writes. The commission has recommended abolition of the county council.
Mr Stevenson rejected Sir John's claim that Cleveland was unpopular, and
said results of MORI opinion polls for the commission itself showed that the
level of community identification with Cleveland was above average and
higher than that for Lincolnshire and Gloucestershire. The commission has
said both of those counties should remain intact.
Lobbying of MPs by councillors intensified over the weekend as they reacted
to last week's proposals from the commission that eight county councils
should be abolished.
In Cumbria, which the commission wants to split into two all-purpose
authorities, one district council described the proposals as
'anti-democratic'.
However, the Association of District Councils, which is campaigning for
all-purpose unitary authorities, published a telephone poll by MORI which
showed that 76 per cent of people would rather their services were not split
as they are at present between counties and districts.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Boost vocational qualifications, says CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More resources should be devoted to maintaining the 'quality and
credibility' of the new vocational qualifications aimed at improving skills,
the Confederation of British Industry says today.
The organisation says in a review that the quality assurance systems that
underpin the vocational qualifications, which measure an individual's
competence to do a job, must be 'sound and robust'. Labour MPs claimed
recently that former employees of a training provider had made fraudulent
claims for attainments of NVQs, which are awarded by internal assessors but
are verified externally by awarding bodies.
More than 68 recommendations for general reform of NVQs and the bodies
responsible for administering them are given by the CBI in the first big
independent review of the system. The CBI was one of the pioneers of the
national system, which is based on measuring an individual's competence in
day-to-day tasks.
The review treads a careful path between endorsing NVQs and making radical
proposals for change.
Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman of the CBI's education and training committee,
said: 'The overwhelming message of the report is one of widespread support
from employers for the NVQ system.
'Just because it contains so many recommendations for change, it should not
be taken as a negative document,' he said. 'Indeed, the reason why so many
recommendations are made is because employers want to see NVQs succeed.'
Recommendations in the report, which will be put out for consultation,
include:
Redesigning NVQs to increase their flexibility. This could be achieved quite
easily in many cases but could require substantial change in a number of
task-specific NVQs.
Expanding the policing role of the National Council for Vocational
Qualifications, the government-funded body that set up NVQs. This would give
it more responsibility for quality and marketing. Additional staff and
funding should be provided to enable this expansion to take place.
Marketing NVQs more effectively. The present marketing is seen by companies
as confused and ineffective with no central co-ordination, the CBI says.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Picking winners in groves of academe: Higher education's
capital-market potential
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City analysts will soon have to grapple with a new problem - how to
credit-score a university.
European Capital, the merchant banking advisory company, has compiled a
blueprint for higher education institutions on how they can raise capital
from the bond markets.
But it does not believe all of them will be able to do so. Analysts will
have the sensitive job of assessing which institutions are sufficiently
credit-worthy, and where the cut-off point for funding should be made.
Institutions judged to be good credit risks will not necessarily be
restricted to universities. Several specialist institutions, such as music
colleges, may prove very safe borrowers.
Mr John Holden, of European Capital, says two sets of tests will determine
whether colleges can borrow. First there are financial tests - reserves,
interest coverage ratios, surpluses of income over expenditure and all the
normal indicators.
These need extra research, but much of the information is already available
and will be looked on favourably by financial institutions. Universities
have the advantage of a regular stream of income from the government.
The second set of tests relates to likely future demand for the university's
services. They would try to answer the question: 'Is this institution going
to be around long enough to repay in 25 years?'
After the fast expansion of student numbers, some City institutions may be
anxious about this. They will need to look at universities' research track
records, and also at their popularity with students and with industrial
sponsors. Any indication that a university is thriving academically will
help convince the City that its future stream of cash from the government is
assured. The test of whether buildings could be sold for alternative uses -
usually regarded as central to credit-rating - may be less important.
Successful universities such as Bath and York have purpose-built campuses a
few miles outside provincial centres which would be difficult to sell for
any alternative use, but European Capital believes they would still have no
difficulty borrowing.
Universities will not be forced to use the new bond finance when it becomes
available, but it holds several advantages for them. They will have access
to funds in a volume which banks might not be prepared to offer - and at
more favourable terms and costs, thanks to the large deals involved. Most
importantly, their finance will be long-term - probably for 25 years - and
at a fixed rate.
This type of funding suits universities, which expect assets such as
libraries and laboratories to last over a similarly long timescale, and
would be almost impossible to obtain elsewhere.

FT  20 JUN 94 / SNP attempts to don the mantle of socialism: James Buxton
assesses prospects in the Monklands by-election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
State ownership is yielding to privatisation everywhere from Poland to
Mongolia but its virtues are still being preached in Monklands East, the
Scottish constituency which votes in a by-election next week to elect a
successor to John Smith.
Mrs Kay Ullrich, the Scottish National party candidate, proclaimed last week
that an SNP government would renationalise Scotland's gas and electricity -
and its water, if it had been sold off. Coal, steel, transport and
telephones would also go back into state ownership.
These views may not disturb people in Airdrie, the former steel town outside
Glasgow which lies in the constituency. But they sound a little strange from
a party which 10 days ago won support from thousands of ex-Tory voters to
take the North East Scotland seat in the European elections from Labour.
In those elections the SNP won a record 32.6 per cent of the vote across
Scotland. It is trying to follow up its success by seizing Monklands East, a
Labour stronghold where Mr Smith had a majority of 15,712 in 1992.
It is not as unlikely a prospect as it might seem. The SNP took the Airdrie
South council seat, which makes up 40 per cent of the constituency, in the
regional elections in May.
It believes it achieved a swing from Labour over the whole constituency of
17 per cent - only four points short of that required to oust Labour in the
by-election.
But Labour, remembering the humiliating defeat it suffered at the hands of
the SNP in the 1988 Glasgow Govan by-election, has moved with almost
unseemly haste to schedule the by-election for June 30, allowing little more
than two weeks for campaigning after the Euro-elections.
It also selected one of its most formidable Scottish figures, Mrs Helen
Liddell, former secretary of the Scottish Labour party, manager of many an
election campaign and once an executive at Mirror Group's Daily Record.
Immaculately coiffed and dressed to radiate power, she is professional to
her fingertips and was closely associated with John Smith.
But she represents a party which has allowed the word Monklands to become a
byword for Labour municipal malpractice. In 1992 and 1993 the local
newspaper revealed that Monklands District Council was controlled by a
'mafia' in the Labour party which appointed many of its own relatives to
council jobs.
The council administers the similarly-sized towns of Airdrie and Coatbridge.
But Coatbridge has had capital spending of Pounds 471m in the past three
years to Airdrie's Pounds 59m, gaining a leisure complex and a shopping
centre.
Airdrie people put Coatbridge's advantage down to the fact that they are
excluded from the 'mafia' - and that they are mostly Protestant while the
people of Coatbridge are Catholic, as are all the councillors. Mrs Liddell
admits that Monklands council is 'something of a curate's egg' but, like
John Smith, prefers to stay above the issue. Mrs Ullrich has called vaguely
for a public inquiry into the council.
It has been left to the Conservatives, whose candidate, Mrs Susan Bell, is a
leading member of the Tory Reform Group, to highlight the religious divide
and associate itself with the Protestants: on Saturday she witnessed the
annual march through the town by its Orange Lodge. The Liberal Democrat
candidate, Mr Stephen Gallagher, plays down the sectarian issue.
Several people on the streets of Airdrie talk of their resentment at the
council. 'You see all the building going on in Coatbridge and then you look
around here where nothing is happening and it makes you really angry,' says
a middle-aged man, adding that the SNP will get his vote for the first time
on June 30.
Mrs Ullrich tries to portray the SNP as the true socialists, having 'more in
common with the Red Clydesiders (Scottish Labour radicals of the 1920s) than
today's pinko Labour party.' But she is far less sure-footed than Mrs
Liddell.
SNP volunteers are coming in from outside the constituency to make up for
the lack of an established organisation to match Labour's. But there may not
enough time left. The odds are on the SNP coming a very good second.
General election: John Smith (Labour) 22,266; SNP 6,554; Conservative 5,830;
Liberal Democrat 1,679. Majority 15,712. Candidates: Helen Liddell, Labour;
Kay Ullrich, SNP; Susan Bell, Conservative; Stephen Gallagher, Liberal
Democrat; Duncan Paterson, Natural Law party; Abi Bremner, Network Against

FT  20 JUN 94 / First fall for five years in graduate unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Graduate unemployment fell for the first time in five years last year,
government figures show today.
Six months after completion of courses, the proportion of graduates who had
entered full-time employment rose from 43 per cent for the equivalent period
in 1991-92 to 45 per cent, while the unemployment rate fell from 11.6 to
10.5 per cent.
This was achieved in spite of continuing expansion in student and graduate
numbers. Overall, the number of students graduating successfully from 'old'
universities - excluding former polytechnics - last year rose 6 per cent to
87,073 compared with 1992.
The number unemployed dropped from 7,832 to 7,472 - having been as low as
3,079 in 1989 - while the number in full-time employment rose almost 10 per
cent from 29,199 to 31,949.
However, the proportion of graduates choosing careers in industry reached an
all-time low of 21 per cent. In the academic year 1982-83 the proportion was
as high as 33 per cent.
Most of the extra recruitment came in white-collar service industries, with
commercial jobs accounting for 34 per cent of employed graduates, compared
with 31 per cent the year before.
According to the Universities Statistical Record, which produced the
figures, heavier recruitment by advertising and market research agencies
accounted for most of the rise.
The immediate prospects for women remained much better than those for men,
with an unemployment rate after six months of only 7.7 per cent. Male
unemployment was 12.9 per cent.
This was in spite of a much sharper increase in the number of women
graduating - up 9 per cent, compared with 5 per cent for men. Male graduates
still outnumbered women graduates by more than 20 per cent, although the
evidence from admissions services is that this gap will continue to narrow
next year.
Figures for individual subjects will deepen government concern that
university expansion has avoided the mathematical and scientific subjects it
wants to encourage - the number of mathematics graduates increased just 1
per cent compared with 1991-92, while the numbers graduating in
creative-arts subjects rose 11 per cent.
They could add to suspicions voiced by Mr William Waldegrave, the science
minister, that science degrees are unpopular because employers are not
sending the right signals to the jobs market. After humanities graduates, on
13.5 per cent, unemployment rates were worst for mathematicians (13.4 per
cent), engineers (12.7 per cent) and physicists (12.5 per cent).

FT  20 JUN 94 / University borrowing scheme complete
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most universities will be able to raise private capital from the bond
markets, possibly by the end of this year, under a financial blueprint
commissioned by university vice-chancellors and the government.
Formal government guarantees would not be needed under the scheme, which
marks the first extension to the higher-education sector of the government's
private finance initiative. The initiative was launched two years ago by Mr
Norman Lamont when he was chancellor.
Primary legislation is also unnecessary, according to the blueprint, which
was completed last week. Universities will not be forced to borrow money
this way, but most are thought likely to find the long-term fixed interest
rates on offer in the bond markets very attractive.
European Capital, the merchant banking advisory group, and the solicitors
Trowers &amp; Hamlins, which were commissioned by universities to draw up the
blueprint earlier this year, estimate that a bond issue of Pounds 75m is
possible by the end of this year, depending on how quickly universities can
fix their budgets after the beginning of the academic year in September.
They would do so in a syndicate, using a vehicle company with a small
permanent staff, similar to The Housing Finance Corporation, which has
raised Pounds 770m for housing associations in bond issues since 1990.
European Capital is now confident that there is sufficient demand in the
City for universities to be able to borrow at rates significantly better
than they could obtain from banks.
Not all universities and other higher-education institutions will be able to
raise funds this way, as the City will not be convinced about their
credit-worthiness. However, European Capital is certain that the majority
will be able to do so, and it will work over the next few months to decide
what percentage of universities will be able to raise finance in this way.
The first issue is likely to involve a range of institutions including both
the more highly regarded universities such as Oxford and Cambridge, and
newer institutions.
Universities need the finance for capital projects such as libraries and
laboratories.
Many say they are under-resourced after the sharp expansion in student
numbers over the past 15 years, which has seen the proportion of
18-year-olds going into higher education more than doubling from 13 per cent
in 1980-81 to 31 per cent this year.
However, they also recognise the reluctance of the government to pay for
building which could be funded elsewhere. This year, for the first time, the
Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals made no request for student
accommodation funding in its submission for Treasury funding.
Alternative plans to raise finance only for the financially strongest
universities, or to attempt to put together bond issues for all higher
education institutions, were considered but rejected.
Copies of the blueprint are being sent to university vice-chancellors, the
Department for Education, and the higher education funding councils.
Some universities are alarmed by the prospect that by joining a syndicate
with other lower-ranked institutions they will in effect be providing them
with a subsidy.
However, European Capital's research shows that all the institutions
involved in the syndicate would gain from the preferential rates on offer
for larger-scale syndicated borrowing.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Council chief attacks Banham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chief executive of Cleveland County Council, Mr Bruce Stevenson,
yesterday accused Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government
Commission, of misrepresenting the council's popularity. The commission has
recommended abolition of the county council.
He rejected Sir John's claim that Cleveland was unpopular, and said results
of MORl opinion polls for the commission itself showed that the level of
community identity with Cleveland was above average and higher than that for
Lincolnshire and Gloucestershire. The commission has said both of those
counties should remain intact.
Lobbying of MPs by councillors intensified over the weekend as they reacted
to last week's proposals from the commission that eight county councils
should be abolished.
In Cumbria, which the commission wants to split into two all-purpose
authorities, one district council described the proposals as
'anti-democratic'.
However, the Association of District Councils, which is campaigning for
all-purpose unitary authorities, published a telephone poll by MORI which
showed that 76 per cent of people would rather their services were not split
as they are at present between counties and districts.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Middle classes on rise in trade unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The image of the average trade unionist conjured up by the rail dispute or
by the union voters in the Labour leadership contest is strongly male and
blue collar, but the latest data from the polling organisation MORI
underlines how false this image has become.
Not only are a majority of trade unionists not manual workers, but very
nearly half are middle class under the standard occupational classification.
MORI says that 47 per cent of union members now belong to the white collar
and professional classes A, B and C1. That compares with only 30 per cent
classified as ABC1 in 1979.
There has also been a substantial increase in the proportion of women trade
unionists, up from 24 per cent in 1979 to 38 per cent in 1994. In 1979 a
total of 30 per cent of all adults over 18 were trade unionists - 76 per
cent men and 24 per cent women. By 1994 the overall adult figure had fallen
to 19 per cent - 62 per cent men and 38 per cent women.
The age structure of trade unionists has changed relatively little. In 1979
a total of 37 per cent were aged 18-34, 42 per cent 35-54, and 21 per cent
55 and over. The figures are now 33 per cent, 48 per cent and 19 per cent.
The change in the class composition largely reflects the change in the class
and occupational structure of the population as a whole. In 1979 a total of
33 per cent of the population was classified as ABC1, 34 per cent as C2
(skilled manual workers) and 33 per cent as DE (semi-skilled and unskilled).
By 1994 that had changed to 44 per cent, 26 per cent and 30 per cent.
Mr Roger Mortimore, a political analyst at MORI, said: 'The changes in trade
union membership are broadly in line with those in the population as a
whole, but political leaders have not adapted to the rise of the
middle-class trade unionist.' One possible reason is the greater publicity
given to those unions, mainly manual worker, affiliated to the Labour party.
The shift in the figures also reflects the decline in manufacturing
employment and the continuing high levels of unionisation in the public
sector among health, teaching and central and local government
professionals.
The Department of Employment's Labour Force Survey says that more than half
of all trade unionists have educational qualifications to A level or
equivalent. The same survey found that only 24 per cent of trade unionists
work in manufacturing.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Lib dem spokesman advises union to sever ties with Labour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the trade union movement is serious about adopting Continental-style
social partnership it will have to stop being politically tied to the Labour
party, Mr Alex Carlile, the Liberal Democrat employment spokesman, told a
conference organised by The Guardian newspaper and the Fabian Society.
Mr Carlile said: 'The unions will never become full partners in industry if
they are tied to one party.' He is in favour of unions sponsoring MPs from
other parties, including the Liberal Democrats. He also suggested unions
should help small companies by providing venture capital. 'They would get a
better return than they have got from investing in the Labour party,' he
said.
Mr Clive Brooke, general secretary of the IRSF civil service union, told the
conference that 99 per cent of his union's members had agreed to having
their union dues deducted from pay by their employer, as required by the
government's new legislation on 'check-off'.

FT  20 JUN 94 / HMSO may face legal action on copyright
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Legal publishers may take legal action against HMSO, the stationery office,
after talks broke down over material covered by crown copyright.
The Professional Publishers Permissions Group which comprises all the main
legal publishers complains that since HMSO was given executive agency status
in 1988 it has adopted a more restrictive approach to licensing of crown
copyright.
The group says that HMSO's new stance amounts to an abuse of its monopoly
position as supplier of crown and parliamentary copyright material and
threatens the future viability of their businesses.
The publishers add value to basic legislative texts, such as statutes and
regulations, by collating relevant materials on related topics, providing
commentary and notes and updating the materials.
They are concerned over HMSO's refusal to license them to reproduce some
crown copyright material, such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
codes, the Highway Code and other departmental guidance notes. They are also
concerned that HMSO has begun to enter the value-added market, exploiting
its exclusive rights over source materials.
HMSO has entered into joint ventures with electronic publishers but is
preventing the publishers from reproducing acts and statutory instruments in
electronic form by demanding royalties at full commercial rates. At the
moment statutory material can be reproduced in value-added book form without
HMSO's permission and without the payment of any royalty.
Mr David Millett, a director of legal publisher Butterworths, said:
'Effectively what they are doing is locking us out of the market.'
The publishers have been negotiating with HMSO for more than three years on
guidelines for the terms on which HMSO will license crown copyright
material. Those negotiations had now broken down, he said.
The publishers have written to Mr David Davis, public services minister, but
Mr Millet said that if he declined to intervene they would have little
alternative but to take legal action.
Mr Millett added that the UK was the only country in the western world which
still enforced copyright over legislative source materials. All other
countries treated such material as being in the public domain.
Mr Peter Macdonald of HMSO denied that negotiations had broken down. He said
that at the publishers' request HMSO had been working on a group licence
rather than individual licences for reproducing crown copyright material.
Details of the group licence scheme had now been finalised and would be put
to the publishers after an HMSO board meeting on Thursday.
He accepted however that HMSO was not prepared to license some materials,
such as the Highway Code which HMSO sells itself, having added value to the
raw material. He also confirmed HMSO's intention to charge publishers full
commercial royalties for reproducing statutory material in electronic form.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Beckett proud to be described as leftwinger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Margaret Beckett yesterday underlined her credentials as the candidate
of the left in Labour's leadership election by raising the prospect of
renationalising the water industry and making it clear she remained
committed to nuclear disarmament.
But Labour's acting leader was also careful to highlight her experience and
to promote herself as a candidate capable of uniting the party.
She said on BBC TV: 'I would be happy and proud to be described as a
leftwinger but what I am is somebody who has always made up their mind on
the merits of a case and tried to argue that case honestly and
forthrightly.'
Mrs Beckett invited a resurgence of Tory claims that a Labour government
would be soft on defence by acknowledging that she might remain a member of
the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament if she became prime minister.
Stressing that she would leave CND if it became a pacifist organisation, she
said she was still a member because it was the only body working for nuclear
disarmament. But she said she would be prepared to tolerate higher defence
spending if she was convinced this was in Britain's interests.
On the water industry Mrs Beckett said she was 'not averse' to it coming
back into public control, depending on 'what degree of public ownership is
needed for that'. She added: 'What I certainly want to see is the water
industry taken under very firm control. I think it is outrageous the way
people are being rooked at present by an industry which is paying huge
salaries to the people who run it and making huge profits which go to a
small group of people.'
Her comments appeared to open a new gap on policy with Mr Tony Blair, the
arch-moderniser who is firm favourite to succeed the late John Smith as
Labour leader.
Mr Blair recently told the Financial Times: 'I think that most people would
not regard it as a sensible expenditure of money . . . that you
renationalise the water industry as opposed to, say, spending money on
health or education.'
Mr Blair is expected to launch his leadership manifesto later this week and
to follow this with a series of six speeches setting out his views on
individual issues. The subjects are expected to be education, the economy,
constitutional change, Europe, the welfare state and the future of the
Labour party.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Railtrack policy on costs attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack, the company which owns the rail network's track, signals and
stations, has been accused of making it unduly expensive for companies to
buy a stake in the network.
Central Railway Group, which wants to create a freight link between the
Midlands and the Channel tunnel, says Railtrack is demanding that companies
proposing projects reimburse it for any costs it incurs in case a scheme
does not go ahead.
Mr Andrew Gritten, chairman of Central Railway, said Railtrack expected
these costs to be paid in stages as talks proceeded.
He also said that Railtrack expected to carry out expensive evaluations of
proposals which were put to it with little regard for the costs this imposed
on companies trying to break into the railway industry.
Central Railway, which has plans for a 180-mile freight line large enough to
carry trucks on flatbed rail wagons, said it was happy to work to standards
set by Railtrack but for Railtrack to duplicate the work of its consultants
was wasteful.
Railtrack denied it was putting barriers in the way of smaller companies. It
said: 'We act as consultants for them and are happy to do their research.
Their costs will be in proportion to the size of the railway they want to
run. It is natural that the costs of the research should be born by them and
included in their start-up costs.'
Central Railway said it was prepared to reach an agreement with Railtrack
over the payment of costs but was concerned at the approach being taken by
Railtrack. 'They need to get into deal-making, not consultancy,' Mr Gritten
said.
The company is attempting to raise between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m from
investors to obtain parliamentary approval for its proposal although the
final cost of building the line could be Pounds 3bn.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Inefficiency and bad maintenance attacked: World Development
Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank is urging a complete reorientation of policy on
infrastructure provision in developing countries, to shift the focus from
building new roads, electricity plants and water pipelines towards ensuring
such installations provide the service they were designed for.
An extensive analysis of infrastructure issues in the latest edition of the
World Bank's annual world development report shows that about Dollars 200bn
(Pounds 132bn) a year of infrastructure investment in developing countries
has greatly increased access to electricity, sanitation, paved roads,
telephones and water. But inefficiency and poor maintenance have meant that
money is wasted and service is patchy.
'The report's main message is clear: there has been too much emphasis on the
stock of infrastructure built and not enough on the service provided,' said
Mr Lewis Preston, the World Bank's president.
'The emphasis everywhere must be less on cutting ribbons to open new
facilities and more on ensuring that those facilities deliver the intended
services,' he added.
The report notes that spending Dollars 1m to reduce the very high losses of
electricity in transmission and distribution networks could save some
African countries Dollars 12m in generating capacity, while the proportion
of water delivered to the field in irrigation projects is typically only
25-30 per cent, compared wth 40-45 per cent in the most efficient projects.
World Bank highway projects primarily involving maintenance produce returns
that are almost twice as high as those concentrating on new road
construction. But almost Dollars 13bn worth of roads - one third of those
built in the last 20 years - have eroded for lack of maintenance.
Overall, the World Bank estimates that technical inefficiency such as
leaking water pipes, electricity transmission losses and railway
overstaffing costs the developing world Dollars 55bn a year.
In addition, it calculates that inefficient pricing structures that fail to
recover costs fully from users cost developing country governments Dollars
123bn a year.
These inefficiencies cause great hardships not only for the very poor but
also for businesses, the report says.
A study in Istanbul showed that nearly all households used back-up water
supply systems such as wells, rivers and street vendors because of the
unreliability of publicly supplied water. For the poorest households,
however, these back-ups cost 5 per cent of total income, while for the
richest it was only 1 per cent.
Another survey of 179 businesses in Nigeria showed that more than half owned
their own electricity generators, an expense which amounted to around 10 per
cent of the total machinery and equipment for the largest companies but as
much as 25 per cent for the smallest.
Yet because Nigerian regulations prevent the sale of surplus power, they
operated their generators on average at no more than 25 per cent of
capacity.
While efficiency of operation is typically much higher in industrialised
countries, the report argues that there is nothing inevitable about this.
'Although the availability of infrastructure facilities does increase in
step with national income, the efficiency and quality of service delivered
is relatively independent of income - that is, low income countries can be
good performers, while chronic waste and inefficiency can be found among
middle and even high income countries,' said Mr Gregory Ingram, who headed
the team that wrote the report.
The report suggests three ways in which service can be improved:
manage infrastructure like a business, not a bureaucracy
introduce competition directly, if feasible, and indirectly if not
give users and stakeholders a strong voice and real responsibility.
Analysing 42 developing countries the report found that in those with
centralised road maintenance systems one third of unpaved roads and more
than 20 per cent of paved roads were in poor condition; in those with
decentralised systems only 15 per cent of unpaved roads and just over 10 per
cent of paved roads were in poor condition.
Another study of 121 rural water supply projects in Africa, Asia and Latin
America showed that of those where participation by the local population was
classified as high, 83 per cent had good maintenance levels and 81 per cent
were graded as effective in achieving their goals. Of those where
participation was low, 23 per cent had good maintenance levels and only 8
per cent were graded as effective.
While non-governmental development groups applauded the World Bank's call
for more emphasis on maintenance and for greater user participation, they
said that the Bank itself was part of the problem.
'What proportion of Bank infrastructure lending goes to maintenance? There
is no figure in the report,' said Mr Paul Spray, head of policy at
London-based Christian Aid.
The emphasis on improving infrastructural service rather than expanding the
stock of infrastructure contained in the world development report echoes a
theme which has been repeated in World Bank internal analyses in recent
years; most notably in the Wapenhans report, which found an alarming
deterioration in the success rate of Bank projects and attributed it in part
to an in-house culture that rewarded officers more for the volume of new
loans arranged than for success with which they followed through on
projects.
Although the Bank has taken steps to counter this cultural tendency, it has
so far failed to convince many of its critics that it has really changed its
spots.

FT  20 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Colombia upset
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Romanian striker Florin Raducioiu scored one goal in each half as Romania
surprised Colombia 3-1 in a Group A game on Saturday in Los Angeles.
Colombia, rated by many as among the best of the 24 qualifiers, started well
but could not reassert themselves after going 2-0 down against a team that
counter-attacked furiously.
The US and Switzerland drew 1-1 in the weekend's other Group A game, at the
Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan - the first World Cup match ever played
indoors. The game drew an overnight television rating of 5.8 points in the
US, beating the US Open Golf Championship.
The ABC television network, which carried the game, also said Sunday the
game produced an 18 share in a survey of 31 markets.
A ratings point represents 942,000 homes in the United States. The share is
the percentage of televisions tuned to the program at the time.

FT  20 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Spain and Bolivia hit by two-game bans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Spanish captain Miguel Angel Nadal and Bolivian star striker Marco
Etcheverry were both suspended for two matches yesterday after being sent
off in their teams' opening games.
The ban means both will miss their remaining two first-round group matches.
Both countries were also fined Dollars 3,500, the minimum automatic fine.
The disciplinary committee of Fifa, soccer's governing body, decided that in
principle a direct expulsion will lead to at least a two-match suspension.
General secretary Sepp Blatter also said that all teams were being warned to
observe rules on shirt advertising after Germany, Switzerland and Romania
all breached rules in the opening two days.
Fifa added that if a player was sent off for two yellow-card offences, he
would receive a one-match suspension.

FT  20 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Violence mars Belgian victory over Morocco
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last night's celebrations after Belgium's 1-0 victory over Morocco turned
nasty in Brussels and elsewhere.
One person was shot and wounded in the southern Belgian town of Verviers
when fighting broke out between several hundred Belgian and Moroccan fans.
Police said the wounded person was not in a serious condition and the
situation was under control.
In Brussels, where some of the 200,000 Moroccans residing in Belgium live,
police said fighting broke out between rival supporters on the city's
historic Grand'Place. Cars were damaged and some shop windows smashed in the
centre of the capital.
There were also incidents in Antwerp, Belgium's second-largest city. Belgian
television said police arrested members of a right-wing extremist party
accused by local residents of being responsible for the shooting.
In the match in Orlando, Belgium secured victory thanks to an 11th minute
goal by Anderlecht's Marc Degryse, but Morocco hit the crossbar in both
halves.
Later, Norway overcame tough Mexican opposition with an 85th minute goal
from substitute Kjetil Rekdal in a Group E clash at the RFK Memorial Stadium
in Washington.
Moments before the finish Norway had a narrow escape when a Mexican effort
hit the post and the rebound was headed onto the bar.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Zedillo hails departure of Chiapas envoy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ernesto Zedillo, presidential candidate of Mexico's ruling party, has
welcomed the resignation of Mr Manuel Camacho, former peace commissioner in
the Mexican state of Chiapas, although he has strongly denied any
responsibility for it.
Mr Camacho resigned last week after accusing Mr Zedillo of deliberately
undermining his efforts to secure peace in Chiapas. The resignation came
just a few days after Zapatista rebels formally rejected the government
peace offer for Chiapas, and has raised concern of a resumption of violence
there before or after the August presidential election.
Far from showing any regret, Mr Zedillo said Mr Camacho's departure was the
right decision for the country. He denied that his description of Mr
Camacho's peace efforts as a 'failure' played any part in the resignation,
claiming Mr Camacho had already made up his mind to leave before the
Zapatistas rejected the government peace offer.
The Zapatistas launched a rebellion in Chiapas on new year's day, demanding
greater rights for the indigenous population and more democracy.
Mr Zedillo's continued snipes at Mr Camacho indicate that he may be seeking
to finish off a political rival who has never hidden his presidential
ambitions, and shore up support among the conservative, so-called hardline
wing of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party, who have long opposed
the reformist Mr Camacho, and his support for further democratic opening.
But the strategy has opened up Mr Zedillo to criticisms from the opposition,
who have accused him of obstructing the peace process in Chiapas. Mr Zedillo
may have alienated Mr Camacho's supporters and possibly angered President
Carlos Salinas, who has strongly backed Mr Camacho's peace efforts and
publicly praised him after he resigned.
Nevertheless, many supporters of Mr Zedillo believe that Mr Camacho's
withdrawal from the national stage may help over the coming months. Party
officials were increasingly concerned that Mr Camacho was undermining Mr
Zedillo's presidential bid by attacking hardliners in the PRI and
campaigning for democratic reforms. In a similar way earlier this year Mr
Camacho's peace efforts in Chiapas had overshadowed the campaign of Mr Luis
Donaldo Colosio, the slain presidential candidate of the PRI.

FT  20 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: A language with many accents - New York's
ethnic soccer communities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SHAPIRO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two kinds of people here who care passionately about the coming of
the World Cup to America - the recently born and the recently arrived.
For the first group, and their parents, who were reared on Little League
baseball, soccer still represents something exotic and therefore a bit
mysterious: 'You mean, no time-outs for beer commercials?' Not so those
whose forbears first played the game in distant places and later on the
playing fields of Astoria, Red Hook and Greenpoint.
Each represents a New York neighbourhood defined by ethnicity. Brooklyn's
Bensonhurst has endured as a transplanted Italian village for generations,
while Flushing, in Queens, is, in its newest incarnation, Korean and
Chinese.
Immigrants, needless to say, carry many things with them, some reviled by
those who arrived before them, while others, music and food especially, are
embraced - at least until something newer comes along.
They also bring their games: cricket and field hockey to the Caribbean
sections of Brooklyn, Gaelic football to Inwood, in northern Manhattan. But
the games, unlike food and dress and odd bits of language and unlike the
children who leave for the assimilated life, remain in the neighbourhood.
New Yorkers have been playing soccer for 100 years. Not that anyone would
necessarily know it outside the neighbourhoods where the game has spawned
some 250 local clubs.
Now, with World Cup banners fluttering from midtown light poles and with
World Cup traffic alerts posted all over town, this supposedly inclusive
city is slowly beginning to discover that the game the rest of the world
plays has been here all along.
'They've always played it,' says Frank Vardy, a city demographer and
authority on local immigration. 'Now they're being reinforced by people from
new countries.'
He refers to the present wave of immigration, the greatest the city has seen
this century. The earlier tide was mostly European, the new one more from
Asia and from central and south America. On any given weekend, the fields of
Manhattan's Central and Riverside parks are filled with men in cleats and
shorts, most speaking Spanish. Wives and children linger nearby.
This ethnic cohesiveness parallels the experience of those who came many
years before and formed their own clubs with their own people, says Fritz
Marth, administrator of the Cosmopolitan Soccer League.
Over the generations, ethnic exclusivity has lessened. But that is a
function of time. The more recently established Albanian clubs, for
instance, dominated by immigrants from Kosovo, are homogeneous, as are the
Latino clubs.
While the older clubs, like Gjoa, of Norwegian ancestry - one of whose
directors goes by the name of Paddy O'Sullivan - endure as sporting and
social clubs, the newer players bring with them the nationalistic and ethnic
passions recently left at home. 'I wouldn't like to be the referee,' Marth
said of matches between newly-arrived Serbs and the Croats who preceded them
to Chicago.
Because immigrants have been coming to and through New York for so long, and
because so many have written so eloquently about their experiences, a
mythology about the city has evolved. Like all myths, it is rooted in a
hastily inflated version of the truth: in this case, that all who come here
really want to become Americans, leading to (outward appearances aside)
rapid and enthusiastic assimilation.
In reality, a third of all immigrants have, after some time, gone back. Many
are disappointed. Many never intended to stay. And many who remain never
quite get used to the sound of America as home. This means that almost any
excuse to embrace the past will do.
Italian restaurants, which for years hung portraits of the national team
above their cash registers, now display hand-printed 'Forza Azzurri' signs
in their windows.
It is much the same in Irish pubs, where second- and third-generation
Americans, often only Irish on St Patrick's Day, reaffirm their kinship with
the young men who have recently arrived, looking for work in the building
trades.
The World Cup also comes to a New York caught in the midst of one of its
most frenzied sporting seasons in decades. The ice hockey Rangers have just
won their first championship in 54 years and basketball's Knicks have
elbowed their way into the championship playoff.
It was always tough for soccer to compete, given national ignorance of the
game. But that matters little in the city's 'Second Little Italy' on Arthur
Avenue in the Bronx, or in the Irish pubs of Woodside, in Queens. 'It's your
team,' says Vardy. 'It's your country's team.'

FT  20 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Scathing press greets frustrated Italians
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian team is staying in the US but may have to leave the New York
area after their bitter 1-0 defeat by Ireland in their opening World Cup
match at the weekend. In some eyes, Ireland's performance stamped them as an
authentic world soccer power.
Italy's loss jeopardised their chances of finishing first in Group E, and
thus staying in the New York area for the second-round stage. The other
members of Group E, Norway and Mexico, clashed yesterday in Washington.
Italian players and coach Arrigo Sacchi said they were already thinking of
their next match - against Norway on Thursday. 'All we can do now is win,'
said striker Giuseppe Signori.
Italy were overwhelmed both on the field and on the stands by the Irish, and
suffered in the heat and humidity.
Sacchi noted that Norway are as physically tough as Ireland, suggesting that
Italy face another difficult test at Giants Stadium on Thursday. Norway
knocked the Italians out of the European championship two years ago.
In Italy yesterday, the reaction was savage. 'What a disaster, Sacchi]' said
the headline in Gazzetta dell Sport, typifying widespread frustration and
anger with Italy's team and their coach.
Italian soccer writers were scathingly critical of the team's lacklustre
play, and drubbed the complicated passing and attack strategies favoured by
Sacchi.
Corriere della Sera described the result as a great disappointment, while La
Repubblica said it was the end of Italy's World Cup dream. 'Poor Italy,'
read the headline above a story calling the team fielded against Ireland the
worst Italy has ever produced.
The banner headline of Il Messaggero, a Rome-based daily, said, simply: 'A
small, small Italy.'

FT  20 JUN 94 / Paris shrugs off Rwanda threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France is seeking rapid United Nations approval for its plan to send forces
to the Rwandan border as part of a humanitarian mission despite a warning
from Rwandan rebels yesterday that they would regard French intervention as
hostile.
Paris is hoping for the go-ahead from the UN security council today or
tomorrow, government officials said yesterday. President Francois Mitterrand
said France wanted to send forces to Rwanda without waiting for the
formation of a full UN force. 'Increasingly savage fighting is taking place
and one can no longer wait. This is a matter of great urgency,' he said.
The decision to send forces to support a humanitarian effort in Rwanda's
civil war was announced in a joint statement on Saturday from the offices of
President Mitterrand and Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister. The
statement said that the operation would be limited to the transitional
period before the arrival of a larger UN force to support the existing
450-strong UN Rwandan mission.
Senior French defence officials met last night to discuss details of the
operation. A government spokesman declined to comment on how and where the
French forces might operate. But he said that the dispatch of French troops
was conditional on UN approval and on the participation of other countries.
Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, ruled out the possibility that
France would go it alone. Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister said,
however, that he had received a commitment from Senegal to send troops.
French officials said a few other African countries had also responded
favourably to French requests for support. However no European countries are
prepared to contribute troops. Last night Italy, which earlier had said it
might lend support, made clear it had no intention of taking part.
According to Mr Juppe, French troops could be sent to the Rwandan border as
early as this week or next week. Officials in Paris indicated the forces
could amount to between 1,000 and 2,000 troops.
Rwanda's rebel leaders yesterday warned France to keep out of the country,
saying they would regard a French-led military intervention as hostile.
The Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), said France's
'humanitarian' initiative was a pretext to deny the rebels an outright
victory against the French-armed and French-trained government forces in
Rwanda.
'The French are not a neutral party to this conflict,' Mr Carlos Mugambage,
an RPF spokesman, said from the capital, Kigali. 'They are partly
responsible for the chaos and massacres in Rwanda. Their presence would only
complicate the situation here.'
In Kigali yesterday heavy fighting erupted and a Red Cross worker was killed
when a hospital complex in the government-held city centre was hit by a
mortar bomb.
The rebels' hostility towards France is based on material and financial
support Paris gave to the government of Gen Juvenal Habyarimana, a member of
the majority Hutu tribe and Rwanda's military leader until his death in an
aircraft crash on April 6. When the RPF launched its civil war in 1990,
France bolstered Gen Habyarimana's crumbling army with military advisers,
weapons, armoured cars and helicopters. It also sent more than 300 French
troops.
Paris denies its forces fought the guerrillas, but several independent
reports speak of French soldiers manning roadblocks and helping government
troops defend the frontline.
Mr Juppe said he hoped to convince the RPF that the French operation would
be exclusively humanitarian.

<DATELINE>
   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ernesto Samper, Colombia's governing Liberal party candidate, last night
held a narrow lead in the second round of the country's presidential
elections.
Mr Samper's followers were preparing victory celebrations with 91 per cent
of the ballots counted. Mr Samper was 106,000 votes ahead of his opponent,
the Conservatives' Mr Andreas Pastrana, with 50 per cent of the votes
against 49 per cent. The remaining 1 per cent represented invalid ballots.
In the first round Mr Samper and his vice-presidential candidate Mr Humberto
de la Calle, had an advantage of 18,000 votes but did not win the necessary
overall majority.
Mr Samper, 43, is an economist and former minister of economic development.
He has been on the campaign trail for a year and fought three elections,
starting with the battle for the Liberal party candidacy. He has promised to
raise social investment to offset the effects of economic liberalisation and
to create 1.5m new jobs.
Only minor incidents marred the election day.
Turnout was higher than in the first round. Outgoing President Cesar
Gaviria, who is barred by the constitution from seeking re-election,
yesterday reminded Colombians of their duty to vote despite the disaster
which had befallen the national soccer side in the World Cup. On Saturday
night the team was beaten 3-1 by Romania, deflating the candidates'
publicity campaigns linked to the team.
Mr Samper and Mr Pastrana had toured more than a dozen cities in a final
dash for votes among the 17m registered voters.
Most of the 16 other first round candidates had told their followers to
choose as they pleased between the two remaining candidates, though General
Miguel Maza, with 55,000 votes, joined the Samper campaign.

Both candidates in the second round of Colombia's presidential elections
yesterday launched intensive television publicity campaigns tied to the
country's much-revered World Cup soccer team. But in the wake of the team's
3-1 defeat by Romania on Saturday night, such populist efforts to rouse
voters appeared to have fallen flat.
Outgoing President Cesar Gaviria, who is barred by the constitution from
seeking re-election, opened voting early yesterday in central Bogota
reminding Colombians of their duty to vote despite the disaster on the
football field.
'I think citizens know that voting is not just a right but also an
obligation and the decision which is being taken today is too important to
be left to one side for lesser reasons,' Mr Gaviria told reporters after
casting his ballot.
Opinion polls give the governing Liberal party candidate, Mr Ernesto Samper,
and the Conservatives' Mr Andres Pastrana identical percentages of the vote.
In the first round, Mr Samper and his vice-presidential candidate, Mr
Humberto de la Calle, had an advantage of 18,000 votes but did not win the
necessary overall majority.
However, television news on Saturday barely mentioned the elections,
dedicating virtually their whole bulletins to exhaustive coverage of the
World Cup. Mr Samper and Mr Pastrana toured more than a dozen cities in a
final dash for votes but the 17m registered voters hardly noticed amid the
torrent of football news.
Most of the 16 other first round candidates have told their followers to
choose as they please between the two remaining candidates, though General
Miguel Maza, with 55,000 votes, joined the Samper campaign.
Despite minor guerrilla incidents - including the kidnapping of some
officials - voting started quietly yesterday.

FT  20 JUN 94 / China warms to Hong Kong task: Beijing is talking of
improved relations with the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of Hong Kong's few remaining colonial mansions, painstakingly restored
to its full 19th-century splendour, is the venue this week for a test of
whether an apparent thaw in Sino-British relations is real or imagined.
A three-day meeting begins tomorrow at 28 Kennedy Road, in Hong Kong's
fashionable mid-levels district, of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group
(JLG), the body established to oversee the nitty gritty of Hong Kong's
reversion to Chinese rule in 1997.
The meeting - the 29th JLG since 1985 - comes at a time when Hong Kong has
been encouraged to hope for an end to the political stand-off which has held
up a critical revision of the colony's law, and vital infrastructure
projects such as a container terminal and new airport.
Since the spring, Beijing has been sending signals that China wants to get
back to business with Britain and resolve outstanding issues about Hong
Kong. The strongest indication came last week with a report that Mr Qian
Qichen, China's foreign minister, had spoken of the need to 'correct and
improve' relations with Britain.
On Thursday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry, while declining to confirm Mr
Qian's remarks made last Tuesday to a visiting group of Hong Kong trade
unionists, said: 'The Chinese side hopes that the difficulties on the
question of Hong Kong will not affect ties between the two countries in
other areas.'
The most compelling explanation for China's apparent change of heart is
self-interest. At the end of this month there will be just three years to go
until China resumes sovereignty over, and responsibility for, Hong Kong, and
much needs to be done.
According to a senior Hong Kong government official, Beijing's appreciation
of the difficulties of achieving a smooth transition without active British
assistance is beginning to override hostility towards Governor Chris Patten
and his administration.
Negotiations for the financing of the colony's HKDollars 158.2bn (Pounds
13.6bn) airport project, conducted in earnest for the past two months after
earlier delays, may have now entered the final phase.
China has promised a meeting of the Sino-British committee to discuss
airport finance before the end of the month. The Hong Kong government last
week said it would go to the Legislative Council (LegCo) on July 1 for
HKDollars 15bn of financing to build the airport terminal and runway.
Both sides say their differences are small. But a possible snag is that the
timing for the meeting on the airport may coincide with a LegCo vote on June
29 on Mr Patten's democracy legislation. However there are signs that
Beijing has put the row about Hong Kong politics behind it and wants to move
on.
Hong Kong government officials have also been heartened by China's request
that the development of the colony's container terminal be included on the
agenda for this week's JLG.
Approval for both projects was held up pending the outcome of bilateral
talks about Hong Kong's political development. These talks ended last year
with Mr Patten going it alone. China has always said it is concerned about
Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, a claim which would be difficult to
sustain if it continued to hold up projects vital to Hong Kong's economic
well-being.
Although many signs of improvement can be identified there are, as yet, no
agreements. Indeed, an accord on the issue of military land, which the UK
had hoped to sign at this week's JLG meeting, dissolved before British
negotiators' eyes a month ago.
The Hong Kong government had undertaken to build and outfit a naval base
large enough for a modern aircraft carrier.
But Chinese negotiators have demanded a large increase in the naval base's
size and also want to keep a lot of the military land which they had
previously agreed to return to the government.
In spite of the setbacks, the UK has attempted to encourage a more moderate
line from Beijing by avoiding policy measures which might anger China.
As one Foreign Office official put it: 'In my judgment, the community is
thoroughly fed up with confrontation. It is much better to slow things down
and handle the essentials in a steady way.'
Over the past month, and to the disenchantment of pro-democracy groups in
Hong Kong, Mr Patten has rebuffed calls for a freedom of information law, a
human rights commission, and visas for two leading Chinese dissidents
wanting to speak at a meeting commemorating the June 1989 Tiananmen
massacre.
Some officials claim that the confluence of these events was simply
coincidence, but democracy activists believe that Mr Patten and the British
government do not have the stomach for a fight.

Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, claimed at the weekend that
North Korea did not yet have a nuclear bomb and quoted 'experts' as saying
it would take the former Soviet ally three to seven years to develop one,
Leyla Boulton reports from Moscow.
Mr Kozyrev seemed to hint his information came from Russian intelligence
when he cited 'all the sources of information reaching Moscow and not just
the Foreign Ministry'.
While reiterating criticism of the US for failing to consult Moscow on its
proposals for phased sanctions of increasing severity against Pyongyang, he
said there was no point in rushing ahead with them because China would veto
them in the Security Coun cil.
However he warned that sanctions against the hardline Communist state were
'inevitable' if it persisted in keeping the International Atomic Energy
Agency in the dark about its nuclear programme. He also criticised what he
called the Russian parliament's 'North Korean lobby'.

The Japanese government is struggling to contain a controversy provoked by
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's official acknowledgment that Japan has the
capacity to make nuclear weapons.
Mr Hata's remark, in reply to a parliamentary question, drew an instant
attack from the opposition Liberal Democratic party, whose leaders are
considering whether to launch a vote of no-confidence against the minority
coalition. This first public recognition that Japan is able to make nuclear
bombs challenges a taboo imposed by Japan's wartime experiences and its
neighbours' suspicions - repeatedly denied - that it might develop nuclear
weapons in response to a serious threat.
Mr Hata said that Japan had the capacity to make nuclear weapons but had not
done so because of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the self-imposed
three non-nuclear principles of not owning, making or allowing the import of
nuclear weapons.
Mr Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic party, said: 'How could
the prime minister make such comments when every nation is making efforts to
resolve North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development programme?'
Japan's world-beating technological achievements might make it more
surprising if it could not make an nuclear bomb. However, Mr Hata's
announcement created enough of a stir for Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, the government
spokesman, to qualify the prime minister's announcement.
Mr Kumagai stressed Japan's unshaken adherence to its non-nuclear principles
and said Japan's use of nuclear power was limited to peaceful purposes,
regardless of whether it could make weapons.

Kashmiri militants who kidnapped two Britons are trying to involve United
Nations military observers in plans for their release, Reuter reports from
Srinagar.
Militant representatives yesterday said the pro-Pakistan Harakatul Ansar
group, which abducted Kim Housego and David Mackie on June 6 while they were
trekking in mountains south-east of Srinagar, wanted to hand the pair over
to the UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP).
The small UN group has been based in both countries since 1949, watching
over a tense ceasefire line which cuts through Kashmir after the two
neighbours fought two wars over the Himalayan state. No reaction from
UNMOGIP was immediately available.
Militant sources said Harakatul Ansar also wanted journalists to be present
at the release of Housego, 16, and Mackie, 36. Kim Housego's father David,
who met the kidnappers last week in the mountains where the abduction took
place, said on Saturday they assured him the pair were safe and would be
freed in Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital. They did not say when.
Earlier promises to free the Britons have fallen through, with the militants
objecting to what they say is Indian military activity in the area.
The Indian government is sensitive about UNMOGIP's role, saying it has no
mandate to observe a four-year-old uprising against Indian rule in the
Moslem majority state.
UNMOGIP officers were turned away when they tried to act as neutral
observers to an army siege last October at Kashmir's holiest Moslem shrine,
where militants and some civilians were holed up. The militants emerged
peacefully after a month.
The kidnap has been widely condemned by other militant groups who see it as
bad publicity for their uprising, in which more than 16,000 are reported to
have died.

FT  20 JUN 94 / International Press Review: Pyongyang's charm offensive -
North Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The North Korean nuclear dispute has not diverted the Pyongyang media from
reporting other weighty matters, such as the fifth congress of the North
Korean Juvenile Corps.
The 3m children, age seven to 13, who are members of North Korea's version
of the scouts and guides, were called upon to serve and protect their
'graceful father' and Dear Leader, Kim Jong-il, the son and designated
successor to the Great Leader, President Kim Il-sung.
'Away from his side, members of the corps are not able to be happy or even
laugh,' declared Mr Choe Ruong-hae, the league's head, as quoted by the
(North) Korean Central Broadcasting Station.
'If the 3m members of the Juvenile Corps, like the 5m (older) members of the
League of Socialist Working Youth, become guns and bombs, there will be no
power to beat them,' he added.
In explaining the importance of the juvenile congress, Chollima, a monthly
magazine, noted that the Soviet Union and east European socialist countries
had collapsed because the 'third and fourth generations of the revolution
spoiled' the revolution's achievements.
'To complete the great tasks of socialism in North Korea, the rising
generation must be educated to become a revolutionary successor loyal to Kim
Jong-il,' the magazine stressed.
The education campaign for revolutionary successors includes such
stimulating television programmes as a quiz show which questions children on
the achievements and sayings of the junior Kim.
The forthcoming transfer of power from the 82-year-old Great Leader to the
52-year-old Dear Leader is a dominant theme of the North Korean
state-controlled media. That is when reports are not condemning 'American
imperialists and their South Korean puppets' and, lately, the 'International
Atomic Energy Agency puppets'.
'It is my great pleasure to see that Comrade Kim Jong-il is respected, loved
and praised by the people as the leader to continue the revolutionary
tasks,' KCBS recently quoted his father as saying.
The junior Kim is portrayed in the west as spoiled and unbalanced, with a
taste for foreign women and Hollywood movies. He appears to have an image
problem in North Korea as well, according to defectors. While his
charismatic father is respected, the public blames his pudgy son for the
country's mounting economic problems.
The rhetorical overkill displayed by the North Korean media on the nuclear
dispute, with its threats that Seoul will taste 'the flame of war,' may be
an attempt to create a crisis atmosphere at home that will suppress public
discontent over the worsening economy and unite support behind the junior
Kim.
Listeners are continually reminded by KCBS of his 'military genius' and told
that he 'began to teach the North Korean People's Army as early as in 1963,
when he was 21 years old, to make it the strongest in the world.'
Kim junior's support within the military is believed to be questionable,
leading to speculation that the army might overthrow him in a coup once his
father dies. Kim senior rose to power after his guerrilla activity against
Japanese colonial rule in the 1930s, but his son is distrusted by the army
because he lacks military experience.
There is consequently great emphasis placed by the media on the Kim
Jong-il's relations with the military as teacher and guide. The media also
warns North Koreans, isolated from foreign sources of information, that
things are much worse in the former Socialist countries that have chosen
capitalism.
'The world is in a food crisis. Especially, the soil in Russia, the Ukraine
and Hungary has become desolate due to the private ownership of land,
resulting in worse food conditions facing these countries,' said Rodong
(Labour) Shinmun, the newspaper of the ruling Korean Workers' party, in
apparent attempt to console North Koreans who are suffering food shortages.
Mr Kim Jong-il no doubt is hoping that propaganda offensive on his behalf
will succeed and enable people to continue singing what KCBS says is the
country's most popular song, 'Without you, there will be no fatherland.'

FT  20 JUN 94 / Opposition pressure on Hata grows: LDP and SDP join forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's two main opposition parties have joined forces to step up pressure
on the fragile eight-week-old minority government.
The Liberal Democratic party and Social Democratic party have overridden
government protests to summon former prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa to
testify before parliament tomorrow over allegations of financial
impropriety.
Mr Hosokawa resigned in April because of LDP pressure to divulge details of
loans from a gangster-linked parcel delivery company.
The opposition hopes the hearings will embarrass the ruling coalition and
increase the pressure for a vote of no-confidence. The LDP and SDP are
internally divided, but if they can agree on the confidence issue, a vote
could happen some time after this year's long overdue budget passes the
upper house of parliament. This is expected on Wednesday or Thursday, and
before the parliamentary session ends on June 29.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the prime minister, said over the weekend his cabinet would
resign to pave the way for the formation of a new government rather than
call a general election if a no-confidence vote succeeded. In that event a
new coalition would probably include members of the LDP and SDP, Japan's
traditional government and opposition respectively for 38 years until last
July.
A majority of members of parliament signed a petition last week opposing a
snap election for fear of delaying popular plans to reform the electoral
system.
This latest political tremor comes at an inopportune time for Mr Hata
because his hands are already full with urgent international business. Fresh
talks with the US to resolve the trade deadlock are in full swing and the
North Korean crisis is barely under control. Mr Hata's team is also working
hard on a deregulation and tax reform package for presentation at the Group
of Seven industrial nations' summit in Naples early next month.
Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP's president, is planning to meet Mr Tomiichi
Murayama, his Socialist counterpart, this week to seek support for a
no-confidence vote.
It is not yet clear, however, whether the two opposition leaders have the
support of their party ranks, which are split on whether to accept or reject
coalition overtures to join the government.
Mr Kono is out of line with such powerful LDP elders as former prime
minister Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, and former foreign ministers Mr Michio
Watanabe and Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka. They want to negotiate a wide and stable
alliance of centrist politicians, not unlike the LDP before it started to
fragment last summer.
Such an alliance would best suit the current political situation, Mr
Nakasone said on a visit to Washington last week. Indeed, Mr Watanabe was
reported in the Japanese press to have presented plans for a new coalition
including the LDP to Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's backroom strategist.
The SDP's left wing ironically supports uniting with the conservative LDP to
bring down the government. Yet the Socialists' right wing represented by Mr
Wataru Kubo, the party's second in command, still hopes to rejoin the ruling
coalition without LDP help.
In the meantime, Mr Ozawa is making use of remaining LDP and SDP hesitation
over launching a no-confidence vote, to seek an alliance with members of
both camps.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Carter solution awaits the test of time: Questions remain on
North Korean nuclear issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The next few weeks are likely to determine if former US President Jimmy
Carter's trip to Pyongyang has produced a possible solution to the North
Korean nuclear dispute or whether it will prove to be another diplomatic
mirage.
The essence of the proposed agreement, which Mr Carter reached after two
meetings with North Korean President Kim Il-sung last week, is a pledge by
Pyongyang to freeze its nuclear programme if the US holds another round of
high-level talks on possible diplomatic recognition and agrees to help
supply North Korea with safer light-water reactors.
If the deal is concluded, it would prevent North Korea from possibly
building more nuclear devices but leave unanswered the question, for the
time being at least, of whether North Korea has already acquired one or two
atomic bombs as claimed by US intelligence.
'All of the agreement will be confirmed through official channels, which
might take several days, but I think that the crisis which was possibly
approaching war has been defused,' said Mr Carter before returning to
Washington to meet administration officials.
'We think we should explore this,' Mr Anthony Lake, US national security
adviser, told Cable Network News. 'In the meantime, we will continue with
the (United Nations) Security Council on our consultations for a sanctions
resolution.' North Korea also asked for a security guarantee from Washington
that it would not be subject to a nuclear attack by the US or other
countries.
'I was authorised to say that in the context of the North-South (Korean)
declaration on denuclearisation, that the US will be willing to join in on
such an assurance,' Mr Carter said on Saturday in Seoul after returning from
Pyongyang.
Mr Carter's statement suggested North Korea must adhere to the 1991
denuclearisation agreement with Seoul in return for the US non-nuclear
guarantee. The agreement has not been implemented, thanks to disagreements
between the two Koreas on some of its provisions, including mutual
inspections. North Korea has sought inspections of US military bases in
South Korea as part of the agreement, while Seoul wanted to conduct
inspections of suspected nuclear facilities in the North.
Mr Carter indicated the US was willing to accept North Korean inspections of
its military bases to assure Pyongyang that it was not storing tactical
nuclear weapons.
One issue that remains to be answered is how long the North's freeze would
last on its nuclear activity, including suspending the operation of its 5MW
reactor.
Mr Kim said that he would freeze his country's nuclear activities only while
there were talks between Pyongyang and Washington on diplomatic recognition,
but added that the freeze would be extended 'if there is an assurance of
light-water reactor technology being available to North Korea'.
But Mr Carter said it was 'unclear' whether North Korea would suspend
nuclear activity for the five to eight years it would take to build a
light-water reactor.
Another unresolved issue is whether North Korea would suspend the
construction of its much bigger 50MW and 200MW reactors, expected to be
completed in 1995 and 1998 respectively, that could produce considerable
amounts of weapons-grade plutonium.
The replacement of the North's current gas-coolled, graphite-moderated
reactors with light-water ones would curb its ability to produce
weapons-grade plutonium and force Pyongyang to rely on outside sources for
its reactor fuel.
The US last year expressed support for North Korean acquisition of the
light-water reactors but added it would not supply the technology and
finance the estimated Dollars 2bn cost. Mr Kim 'understands that the US
itself is not prepared to finance or furnish the equipment', Mr Carter said.
One noticeable gap in the deal outlined by Mr Carter is whether North Korea
is willing to accept full inspections demanded by the International Atomic
Energy Agency to determine if Pyongyang diverted plutonium from its 5MW
reactor in 1989 to build one or two nuclear devices. The disagreement over
IAEA inspections triggered the nuclear dispute 15 months ago.
North Korea has blocked complete IAEA inspections, possibly as a negotiating
ploy to gain US diplomatic recognition. Mr Carter expressed his support for
US diplomatic recognition of Pyongyang, while calling the threat of UN
sanctions against North Korea 'counter-productive'.
Mr Kim promised that two IAEA inspectors could remain at the North's nuclear
complex at Yongbyon to verify that Pyongyang was not reprocessing and
extracting plutonium from spent fuel rods recently removed from its 5MW
reactor. The US had feared North Korea would use the absence of inspectors
to reprocess the plutonium to build four or five nuclear devices.
The US has refused to hold recent talks with North Korea until it accepted
routine IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities. But it would appear
under the Carter proposal that the US might agreed to discuss the IAEA
inspection procedures as part of the negotiations with North Korea in return
for Pyongyang stopping the clock on its nuclear programme.
Government officials in Seoul expressed cautious optimism about Mr Carter's
proposals. They had expressed concerned that North Korea was using the talks
as another delaying tactic.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Yeltsin seeks crackdown on crime: Russia's 'mafia' is
terrorising business and ordinary citizens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's President Boris Yeltsin paid a symbolic visit to a crack
paramilitary division outside Moscow at the weekend.
Coinciding with a string of bomb blasts in the capital, the Russian leader
last week issued a barrage of instructions giving the security forces
unprecedented powers for a law-and-order crackdown.
Condemned as unconstitutional by the parliament and liberal media, these new
powers include the right to detain suspects for up to 30 days without
charge, to search without a warrant the premises and examine bank accounts
of any companies and to use in court evidence gathered by undercover methods
such as phone-tapping and infiltration of criminal gangs.
On Saturday, Mr Yeltsin told the regiment named after Felix Dzerzhinsky, the
hated founder of the Soviet secret police: 'I am counting on your willpower,
honour and courage. Preserve and multiply what has always distinguished the
forces of law and order - constant vigilance, military-readiness, and strong
military discipline.'
Russia's so-called 'mafia' - a term used to describe anything from organised
crime bosses to small-time racketeers and violent criminals - is terrorising
both the business community and ordinary citizens.
A successful crackdown on Russian society's number one scourge would yield
priceless political benefits for Mr Yeltsin, whose unpopularity is at an
all-time low.
In a front page editorial, Izvestia recognised an overwhelming public desire
for law and order when its commentator wrote: 'I am sure that the decree
would have received an even warmer response had it provided for summary
executions on the spot, without trial or investigation.'
But the criminals' close links to corrupt officials and police are the
strongest reason to doubt that this crackdown will yield its intended
results.
Mr Vladimir Tsekhanov, a senior official of the Federal Counter-Intelligence
Service, recently provided a telling illustration of the scale of corruption
within the security forces.
He claimed that Russia's equivalent of the FBI had 'uncovered a wide
criminal group' including Interior Ministry officials and Moscow police
officers 'who took large bribes to release Moscow mobsters under
investigation on charges of robbery, smuggling, illegal possession of
firearms, or at least to scale down their prison terms.'
Izvestia went on to warn that the security organs' repressive traditions,
inherited from the Communist-era police-state, could easily backfire against
the healthy businesses Mr Yeltsin says he wants to protect.
'From now on, a law-enforcement official may uncover a commercial secret,
disrupt the privacy of investment, inviolability of banking and financial
documents. . . Can anyone guarantee that interference in a business will be
dictated by the fight against crime or a bribe given by competitors?'
Under pressure from Mr Yeltsin's initiative, parliament on Friday tried to
speed up its own discussion of a separate law on fighting crime. It failed
not only to adopt this law, but even to agree a resolution demanding that
President Yeltsin rescind his decree's unconstitutional provisions. It
settled instead on sending its best wishes to the Russian soccer team as the
World Cup opened in the US.
Waging war against crime in these circumstances will require not just
political will at the highest level - which Mr Yeltsin appears to be
displaying - but utmost caution in its prosecution.

Health ministers and officials from industrialised nations pledged at the

Aids but fell short of a specific commitment of funds.
Representatives from about 40 countries attending a two-day conference in
Paris agreed, however, to take part in a summit of heads of state and
government aimed at curbing the spread of Aids. The summit is scheduled for
December.
In a joint statement participating nations emphasised the need for a
combined effort by rich and poor nations. Political leaders must ensure,
they said, that 'no continent, no country, or population group is
marginalised or stigmatised'. Mr Hiroshi Nakajima, director of the World
Health Organisation, urged governments to make a concrete commitment to
tackle the spread of Aids.

Seven Icelandic trawlers yesterday decided to leave disputed fishing waters
after the Norwegian coast guard crippled several nets in a mini 'cod war'
between the two countries. A coastguard vessel yesterday cut one of the
wires of the Mar trawler near Svalbard, where Norway has sovereignty under a
1920 treaty, forcing it to stop fishing. The Norwegians cut one of the trawl
wires of another Icelandic trawler on Saturday and on Tuesday sabotaged the
nets of four Icelandic vessels and fired a warning shot at a fifth in the
same area.
Iceland's government has called the actions illegal, threatening to take
Norway to court unless the row is settled by talks.

The Danish Social Democratic party, trying to restore its fortunes after a
poor performance in last week's European Parliament elections, is seeking an
amendment to the Maastricht treaty to ensure that environmental safety takes
precedence over European free trade in goods. The SDP is Denmark's largest
party, with 69 seats in the 179-seat Folketing (parliament), and it
dominates the centre-left coalition government. Mr Ove Fich, a former
Euro-MP and the party's parliamentary spokesman on European affairs, said
the party intended to make the environmental issue the main plank in the
Danish position at the 1996 inter-governmental conference at which the
future shape of Europe would be discussed. 'It must be affirmed by treaty
that consumer interests, the environment and the work environment take
precedence over free trade,' said Mr Fich.

Spain will not deviate from its current economic policies, despite the
defeat suffered by the ruling Socialist party in last week's European
elections, according to economy minister Pedro Solbes. He told an audience
of businessmen in Catalonia at the weekend that this would mean tight
national budgets for the next three years. Cutting the public sector deficit
was essential to enable the country to grow and create jobs on a permanent
basis, he said. His comments, aimed at reassuring business in an unsettled
political climate, followed pressure from hardline sectors of the Socialist
party to move towards the left and seek a rapprochement with the
Communist-led United Left party. The Socialists need United Left support to
continue running the regional government in Andalucia, where they suffered
heavy setbacks in elections last week.
The government has at the same time been pressed by leaders of the
conservative Popular party to respond to the verdict of voters in the
European ballot. Mr Rodrigo Rato, the PP's parliamentary spokesman, said in
an interview published yesterday that Spain needed tougher budget cuts and
lower social costs to industry.

Insider dealers in Germany face up to five years in jail and heavy fines
under the terms of a new law voted through the Bundestag, the lower house of
the German parliament.
The second financial markets promotion act, passed on Friday, will also
introduce a new regulatory body for the German securities industry - the
German equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US - and
will allow banks to introduce money market funds, a form of short-term
investment vehicle hitherto outlawed in Germany. The law, which in part
implements European Union legislation, is a plank of government policy to
strengthen Germany as a financial centre and is due to take effect at the
beginning of August. The initiative for the law came from Mr Theo Waigel,
finance minister, who outlined plans for the legislation in early 1992.
The law is designed to bring the regulatory regime for German securities
markets up to international standards after controversial cases in Frankfurt
highlighted weaknesses. The German authorities are especially worried that
the absence of a law against insider dealing has diverted business away from
the German stock exchanges to London.
Other measures include stringent disclosure requirements for companies
listed on the stock market. They will be subject to fines of up to DM3m
(Pounds 1.2m) if they delay releasing price- sensitive information to the
stock market and will be obliged to release details of stake-building in
other companies when the stake reaches 5 per cent compared with the present
20 to 25 per cent disclosure threshold.

Preparations are under way for Russia's second massive privatisation
programme to begin next month in an effort to restructure Russian industry
through investment.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation,
revealed the plans in Stockholm over the weekend and expressed hope he would
guide the privatisation through its next phase following his role in the
introduction of economic reform.
The early part of the first privatisation issued free vouchers to Russia's
150m men, women and children. Government legislation made privatisation
compulsory for large and small companies and cut into Russia's vast state
sector more deeply than any efforts exerted by other former communist
states. Mr Chubais said that 'the main goal of privatisation has been
achieved. The distribution of vouchers has changed the distribution of
political power. The level of change makes the process of reform
irreversible.'
He said that by the end of this year around 70 per cent of property would be
in private hands, 70 per cent of workers would work in the private sector,
40m people would hold shares in industry and 1m people would own small
businesses.
The next phase, said Mr Chubais, would involve the sell-off of the rest of
the state companies and residual state ownership of most of the companies
already part-privatised. This will mean:
a transition from giving away shares for vouchers to selling shares for
money. fewer privileges for workers and managers in the privatised companies
compared with the incentives which marked the first stage.
two new ways in which companies can be privatised: the first giving 25 per
cent of all non-voting shares to workers and managers, with the remainder
sold at auction; and the second giving 10 per cent of voting shares away
free, a further 10 per cent at a nominal price (fixed at June 1994) with a
30 per cent discount, and the rest sold at auction.
51 per cent of the income raised from privatisation will go into the
company, rather than to the state budget.
Other issues to be tackled in the programme, which is at least as ambitious
as the first stage, will be privatisation of land on which enterprises are
located. This issue is fraught with legal uncertainties. The privatisation
of agricultural land remains mired in the bureaucracy.
Another plank of the programme will be restructuring at enterprise level by
giving shareholders more rights to change management. In addition, the
extensive social provisions from enterprises will be transferred to local
administration and a working securities market is to be created.
Though a start has been made on all of these matters, they represent a vast
agenda which even Mr Chubais acknowledges will take up to the end of the
century.
The deputy prime minister said that this programme had already been approved
by the government and should be published before the end of June. However,
he warned of obstacles and dangers which he described as 'the price of
success' and which the next phase must tackle.
The main issue, he said, is that the speed of privatisation had left no time
to develop institutional investment by Russian and foreign companies.
However, financial companies had built up reserves and expertise and would
now be encouraged to invest.
Mr Chubais said that he expected to be blamed for encouraging foreign
investment and for the 'sell-off of Russian industry.' Since that was the
case, he said, he would appeal to foreign companies to come as quickly as
possible.
Mr Peter Aven, the former trade minister and now chairman of Alpha Bank,
part of one of Russia's largest financial groups, said: 'This will now be
the period of Russian investment in Russian industry. We are ready for it.'

in Fatih district as Mr Bulent Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left party
and a former prime minister, was due to address thousands of people gathered
for a local election campaign. No group has claimed responsibility for the
bomb attack. Mr Ecevit, a leading anti-fundamentalist figure in Turkey, has

Three political parties whose support is central to efforts to overcome
strong opposition to European Union membership in the Nordic applicant
countries have swung behind the campaign for a Yes vote in referendums to be
held in the autumn in Finland, Norway and Sweden, writes Hugh Carnegy in
Stockholm.
Yesterday special congresses of Norway's ruling Labour party and Sweden's
opposition Social Democratic party - both the biggest political parties in
their respective countries - -voted by wide margins to support membership.
On Saturday, the Finnish Centre Party, led by Prime Minister Esko Aho,
decided by 1,607 votes to 834 to back a pro-EU line despite considerable
scepticism among its grassroots rural supporters.
The Labour party in Norway, skilfully led to a pro-EU stance against the
current of national opinion over the past two years by Prime Minister Gro
Harlem Brundtland, voted to support membership by 197 votes to 93.
Similarly, the Swedish Social Democrats decided by a margin of 232-103 to
join the Yes campaign.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Greece faces loss of EU cotton subsidies: As many as 10,000
farmers are suspected of fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece faces the possible withholding of its entire European Union subsidy
for cotton production amounting to about Ecu500m (Pounds 385m), in a highly
embarrassing development before this week's EU summit in Corfu.
European Commission officials are considering the sanction in the closing
stages of a two-year inquiry into allegations of widespread fraud involving
subsidies to Greek cotton, one of the country's most important products.
The extent of the action against Greece will be an important test of the
EC's recent tough talk about cracking down on fraud and other
irregularities, which are believed to account for about 10 per cent of total
EU spending.
Mr Andreas Papastavrou, a leading cotton farmer and president of the
Federation of Farm Co-operatives in Levadia, central Greece, says there have
been 'complications' involving the flow of EU subsidies to the local cotton
industry.
Levadia, a bustling town of 20,000 people, has many bars, nightclubs and
shops. The signs of prosperity are linked to the high level of cotton
subsidies since the 1980s, which compensate farmers for the relatively low
price of cotton on the world market.
On average, each of the 7,000 cotton farmers in the area around Levadia have
received about Ecu5,000 a year in EU subsidies over the past few years - in
many cases amounting to more than half their overall incomes, according to
estimates.
Documents related to cotton production around Levadia have been particularly
carefully scrutinised in the EU's inquiry, which has centred on nine cotton
processing plants - or gins - of which seven are in or around the town.
It has been alleged that in 1991-92 cotton farmers in Greece as a whole
inflated their production figures by 10 per cent, gaining about Ecu50m in
subsidies to which they were not entitled.
The gins are central to the inquiry because these plants - of which there
are about 70 throughout Greece - act as collection points for cotton. It is
separated into fibres used in the textile industry, seeds used for oil and
the vegetation which is thrown away.
On grounds of administrative ease, the gins receive the EU subsidies before
channelling them to farmers. Investigators believe some gins have
collaborated with growers to falsify the amounts of cotton produced, either
by entering incorrect weights into production records or by expedients such
as 'double weighing' the same bale of cotton.
Another theory is that farmers have regularly inflated their figures for the
area planted with cotton, aided by lax checking procedures by the cotton
board.
According to one gin owner involved with the inquiry, up to 10,000 cotton
farmers may have been involved with fraud or other irregularities over the
past few years. The Greek Cotton Board, the organisation which administers
the EU payments, is said by EU investigators to have presided over an
'inadequate' system for checking that documentation related to cotton
production was filled in correctly.
Under special scrutiny have been managers of nine gins, seven of them in the
Levadia area, suspected by the cotton board of having made false claims. In
some cases, the board has imposed fines but none of the fines has been paid.
Mr Stathis Angeloussis, who owns two cotton gins in Levadia, was one of
those named by the board but says the fraud allegations are 'a pack of
lies'.
He adds: 'The fines were imposed without a proper investigation. The cotton
board inspectors looked around and came up with what suited them. The
process was quite illegal because it wasn't backed by a judicial decision.'
According to Mr Papastavrou, the cotton farmer, some irregularities have
taken place but many of these have concerned the technicalities of adjusting
records of cotton production for the level of moisture and impurities which
affects the subsidy.
He is not surprised that so far no one has paid fines for any wrongdoing -
in spite of the involvement in the inquiry of public prosecutors in Athens
and other regional centres. 'In Greece judicial investigations can go on for
10 years. That is the nature of the place.'
Mr Markos Tsambos, a cotton board official in Levadia who has his own cotton
farm, said: 'You can't rule out criminal activities. If you have a criminal
disposition then it (false accounting) may have taken place.'
Sparking the EC's investigation, which has also involved officials at the
Greek cotton board and the Court of Auditors, the EC's Luxembourg-based
financial watchdog, was that the board's declared production of 719,449
tonnes for 1991-92 was nearly 15 per cent higher than its initial estimate
before harvesting.
That alerted investigators to the idea that widespread fraud might have
taken place to take maximum advantage of the subsidies - which during 1991
climbed by about 50 per cent due to a sharp fall in the world cotton price.
Over the past year, the subsidy has fallen slightly and has accounted for
between 50 and 80 per cent of the price paid to farmers for their cotton.
The amount of cotton grown in Greece has increased to nearly 1m tonnes last
year, according to the cotton board. A big factor behind this has been the
attractive subsidies which make the life of a cotton farmer relatively
prosperous and keep cotton among Greece's most important agricultural
products along with tobacco and fruit.
However, many in the Greek cotton industry fear that, whatever the result of
the EC inquiry, the subsidies are likely to fall following calls worldwide
for less government support for agriculture and the specific proposals
related to farm aid in the latest round of the Gatt trade negotiations.
Mr Athanasios Kostoyannos, who farms in the village of Exarchos near
Levadia, said: 'We've done nothing fraudulent. Life as a cotton farmer is
hard and without the subsidy it would be impossible.'

FT  20 JUN 94 / Socialist leader Rocard gambles and loses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michel Rocard and, to some extent, logic lost yesterday.
He gambled that, however controversial his year leading France's Socialist
party and however sore the party felt over its poor showing in last week's
Euro-elections, it would not topple him until it had coalesced behind an
alternative leader.
But a majority of the 300 members of the party's national council threw
caution to the wind, voting him out. His replacement, Mr Henri Emmanuelli, a
former parliamentary whip, is a provisional head. His task is to help guide
the party as it attempts to tackle the problems which underpinned its meagre
14.5 per cent support in France's European polls and as it searches for a
credible presidential candidate.
Mr Rocard yesterday staked his position on his own plans to tackle the
party's deep-rooted problems. But his proposals to rejuvenate the party's
national executive to include possible rivals such as Mr Jack Lang, the
former education minister, and popular younger figures such as Mrs Elizabeth
Guigou and Mrs Martine Aubry (the latter having the extra merit of being
European Commission president Jacques Delors' daughter) and his plan to
eliminate the courants, or clans that compose the party, evidently seemed to
most to be treating the symptoms of the party's malaise but not its cause.
Equally important was the failure of Mr Rocard to appeal to the young voters
and his failure to capitalise on the problems facing the RPR-UDF coalition
headed by prime minister Edouard Balladur.
'We have unemployment of 12.3 per cent, the highest level in living memory,'
said one party member. 'We should be winning more support.'
Part of the failure to win the youth vote is explained by the extraordinary
appeal of Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial businessman who strikes a
charismatic figure compared with the rest of France's establishment
politicians. Mr Tapie's Mouvement des Radicaux de Gauche won 12.3 per cent
of votes in the European election, compounding the poor showing of the
Socialists.
The immediate priority facing the party is to overcome the factionalism
which has bedevilled its organisation and helped oust Mr Rocard. Originally
the democratic hallmark of the Socialist party, the courants have frequently
been the bane of the party. The threat of the factions was clear even when
Mr Rocard was elected general secretary in October last year. At the party
congress which voted him into office, there were more than 100 blank ballots
and 51 abstentions.
The factions and the decline in popularity of the traditional left are,
however, not amenable to a rapid resolution. The most plausible unifier
could be Mr Delors, who last held office in France as a Socialist finance
minister in the early 1980s. The entreaties coming from Paris for him to
leave Brussels before the end of his term in December are fast multiplying.
He appeals to the remaining supporters of Mr Rocard, because the two men
share the same brand of Social Democratic pragmatism. He has had a
complicated relationship with President Francois Mitterrand who did not
initially propose him for the Commission presidency, but the two men have
made up their differences.
Nor is there a generational problem. Two years ago a group of Socialists in
their 40s set up a political fan club in France to promote the cause and
ideas of the 67-year-old Commission president. Nor is there any question
that Mr Delors is 'presidential', in the sense that he has more or less
incarnated Europe, not just France, over the past decade.
Current opinion polls show he would lose a presidential election to Mr
Balladur by several points, but he would run Mr Jacques Chirac very close
and would defeat other conservative candidates.
There is however the question of whether after 10 tiring years in Brussels
Mr Delors would want seven more in the Elysee. If he succumbed to the
entreaties of a desperate party, he would be in a strong position to dictate
the terms on which he would carry its colours.
One of these is likely to be that if elected he would only serve a single
five-year term. That would involve a constitutional change from the present
seven-year term, but the change after 14 years of Mitterrandism might prove
popular.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Natural gas to double market share by 2010
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Natural gas is forecast to more than double its share of the electricity
generating market in western Europe to 20 per cent in the next 15 years at
the expense of coal, oil and nuclear power.
The International Union of Electricity Producers and Distributors (Unipede)
forecasts that gas growth and increased efficiency in power production
should lead to a 15 per cent fall in carbon dioxide emissions per unit of
electricity between 1990 and 2010.
Demand for power is also likely to grow more slowly as fuel efficiency
measures take effect. Unipede puts the annual rise at 1.8 per cent between
1990 and 2010, against 3.4 per cent in the previous two decades.
Growth will be considerably more marked in southern Europe than in the
north.
Unipede's forecasts are published today as more than 1,000 mainly European
delegates meet in Birmingham, England, for the union's week-long triennial
conference.
The growing use of natural gas has been prompted by economic and
environmental considerations. In most countries power stations fired by
combined cycle gas turbine technology produce cheaper electricity than new
plants using coal and nuclear power energy.
Unipede forecasts that nuclear power's share of the market will fall from 34
to 31 per cent between 1990 and 2010. Coal is predicted to suffer the
biggest decline, from 37 to 29 per cent, and oil to drop from 10 to 6 per
cent. Gas is expected to rise from 7 to 20 per cent. Electricity demand is
expected to grow by 43 per cent during the two decades.
Within the overall increase, the share of domestic and agricultural sectors
is expected to remain at about 25 per cent and 2 per cent respectively. The
share of demand from services is expected to rise from 22 to 26 per cent but
industrial consumption is forecast to fall from 44 to 40 per cent.
Although there is currently a surplus of electricity generation in western
Europe, Unipede expects the total to grow by about a fifth from the current
500 gigawatts.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deep divisions re-emerged in Germany's opposition Social Democratic party
(SPD) at the weekend, only three days before a critical party conference to
endorse its leader, Mr Rudolf Scharping, as the candidate to fight
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in next October's general election.
Scarcely-veiled criticism of Mr Scharping's leadership, and the party's
election strategy, was voiced by leading figures in the SPD, and a formal
proposal will be put to the party conference in Halle on Wednesday to back
an SPD-Green alliance in the October election, flatly contradicting the
strategy adopted by Mr Scharping.
The most prominent criticism of party tactics came from Mr Gerhard Schroder,
the SPD state premier in Lower Saxony and the man defeated by Mr Scharping
last year for the party leadership.
In an interview with Der Spiegel magazine, Mr Schroder accused the party of
relying too heavily on the theme of law-and-order, and concentrating too
much on the person - ality of the party leader at the expense of his team,
in its campaign strategy.
He insisted that he was not calling for any change in leadership so close to
the general election, yet he made it clear that much of the Scharping
strategy, seeking to win the political centre ground by opting for a tough
line on crime prevention, and to distance itself from any identification
with the radical Greens, was wrong.
'We cannot compete with the CDU with law-and-order slogans, and, thank God,
we can certainly not win,' Mr Schroder said. He insisted it was up to Mr
Scharping to decide whether he wanted to seek a red-green coalition, as the
party left is urging, or keep his options open for a revival of the
coalition with the liberal Free Democratic party.
The South Hesse branch of the SPD, the second strongest provincial branch
after North Rhine-Westphalia, agreed at the weekend formally to propose a
red-green coalition, a strategy seen by Mr Scharping and his advisers on the
party's right as electoral suicide, because it would enable Mr Kohl and the
CDU to label the SPD with the radical pacifist policies of the Greens.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Construction output rising in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A modest and fragile recovery has begun in western European construction
markets but output is unlikely to approach previous high levels, according
to forecasts from 15 countries.
Euro-Construct, a federation of European Construction Research Agencies and
Economic Forecasting bodies say that output in the region is likely to fall
by just 0.1 per cent this year before rising by 1.9 per cent next year.*
It will be the first overall rise reported since 1990, although individual
countries such as Germany have increased construction output during the
period.
The value of western European construction output next year, forecast at
Ecu657.5bn (Pounds 506bn), would still be almost 3 per cent lower than 1990
output. Output in West Germany by comparison is forecast to be 11 per cent
higher next year than at the beginning of the decade.
The growth in eastern German construction activity, since the country was
unified, is even more striking and is forecast by Euro-Construct to increase
by a further 16 per cent this year and by 12.5 per cent next year.
The boom in activity is being led by construction and renovation of flats
and houses and is forecast to rise by almost a third in eastern Germany this
year and a further fifth in 1995. Residential construction in western
Germany is forecast to rise by 7.6 per cent over the next two years as the
region seeks to house large numbers of immigrants, mostly from eastern
Europe.
Other European countries, which saw a sharp fall in construction activity in
the early 1990s, are expected to enjoy a small recovery over the next 18
months as housing markets in particular benefit from lower interest rates.
Governments in France, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Portugal and Switzerland
have raised subsidies or introduced tax or other measures to encourage
building and renovation of homes, which generates large numbers of jobs as
well as improving the housing stock, says Euro-Construct.
Sweden, conversely, is seeking to reduce the high cost of its housing
subsidies. Residential construction, down 29.9 per cent last year, is
forecast to fall a further 59.3 per cent this year and 6 per cent in 1995.
High unemployment will also put a brake on the pace of housing recovery,
with 17.4m people estimated to be still out of work in the 15 countries.
Euro-Construct expects construction output to rise as economies recover with
housing and repair, maintenance and improvement work the early
beneficiaries.
Public spending however is likely to remain under pressure. Private
non-residential construction output, of offices, shops, factories and
warehouses, is forecast to fall by a further 8 per cent this year across the
region but rise by 2.5 per cent next year as the large amounts of empty
office space start to be occupied.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Candidate Scharping fails to unite SPD behind him

Deep divisions re-emerged in Germany's opposition Social Democratic party
(SPD) at the weekend, only three days before a critical party conference to
endorse its leader, Mr Rudolf Scharping, as the candidate to fight
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in next October's general election.
Scarcely-veiled criticism of Mr Scharping's leadership, and the party's
election strategy, was voiced by leading figures in the SPD.
And a formal proposal will be put to the party conference in Halle on
Wednesday to back an SPD-Green alliance in the October election, flatly
contradicting the strategy adopted by Mr Scharping.
The most prominent criticism of party tactics came from Mr Gerhard Schroder,
the SPD state premier in Lower Saxony and the man defeated by Mr Scharping
last year for the party leadership.
In an interview with Der Spiegel magazine, Mr Schroder accused the party of
relying too heavily on the theme of law-and-order, and concentrating too
much on the personality of the party leader at the expense of his team, in
its campaign strategy.
He insisted that he was not calling for any change in leadership so close to
the general election. 'It would be the stupidest thing the SPD could do now,
to have a debate about personalities,' he said.
Yet he made it clear that much of the Scharping strategy, seeking to win the
political centre ground by opting for a tough line on crime prevention, and
to distance itself from any identification with the radical Greens, was
wrong.
'We cannot compete with the CDU with law-and-order slogans, and, thank God,
we can certainly not win,' Mr Schroder said.
He insisted that it was up to Mr Scharping to decide whether he wanted to
seek a red-green coalition, as the party left is urging, or keep his options
open for a revival of the coalition with the liberal Free Democratic party
which ruled Germany under Mr Willy Brandt and Mr Helmut Schmidt in the
1970s.
That issue seems certain to become a bone of contention at the party
conference. The South Hesse branch of the SPD, the second strongest
provincial branch after North Rhine-Westphalia, agreed at the weekend
formally to propose a red-green coalition.
Such a strategy is seen by Mr Scharping and his advisers on the right of the
party as electoral suicide, because it would enable Mr Kohl and the CDU to
label the SPD with the radical pacifist policies of the Greens - including
withdrawal from Nato and abolition of the German army.
The party leader now needs to reassert his authority, and sweep away the
growing doubts within the party about his capacity to defeat Mr Kohl in
October.
The danger he faces is a secret ballot on Wednesday to endorse his candidacy
for the chancellorship, which could see a significant minority vote against
him or at least a number of abstentions.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Stand-off in search for EU chief: Kohl opposes Dutch PM as
replacement for Delors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A stand-off between Germany and the Netherlands is holding up efforts to
break the deadlock over the succession to Mr Jacques Delors as president of
the European Commission ahead of this week's EU summit in Corfu.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl remains opposed to Mr Ruud Lubbers, Dutch prime
minister, and is canvassing support for Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian
prime minister, who formally announced his candidacy last Friday.
The implicit threat of a German veto at the Corfu summit has irritated the
Dutch government. Mr Lubbers has sought to call Mr Kohl's bluff by offering
to pull out of the race, but only if the German chancellor took public
responsibility for blocking his candidacy, according to senior diplomats in
Brussels.
Efforts to reach a compromise could turn on a meeting of Christian Democrat
leaders on Wednesday in Brussels, two days before the opening of the Corfu
summit. Mr Kohl, Mr Lubbers and Mr Dehaene are all due to attend.
Belgian officials believe Mr Dehaene can count on as many as eight EU member
states to support his candidacy. Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the
UK remaining are said to be opposed or uncommitted.
The choice of the Commission president is traditionally settled in secret by
unanimity among the 12 heads of government. A stalemate boosts the chances
of victory by a compromise candidate, either Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU
trade negotiator, or Mr Peter Sutherland, outgoing head of the Gatt world
trade organisation.
Greece, which holds the rotating EU presidency, fears that controversy over
the Delors succession could poison the summit atmosphere and overshadow the
visit of President Boris Yeltsin of Russia. Mr Yeltsin arrives in Corfu on
Thursday to sign a new trade and political agreement with the Union.
Senior diplomats in Brussels said a compromise could be reached in the form
of a 'package deal' covering top posts at the Western European Union, the
EU's defence arm, the European Council secretariat, as well as the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Organisation of Economic Co-operation
and Development.
But Greece's authority has suffered as a result of its unilateral trade
embargo against neighbouring Macedonia and partly because Mr Andreas
Papandreou, the ailing 75-year-old prime minister, is too weak to make the
customary pre-summit tour of EU capitals.
The result is that Mr Kohl has emerged as the principal EU powerbroker, his
status enhanced by his Christian Democrat party's strong performance in last
week's European parliamentary elections.
One favoured scenario would give Germany the post of secretary general of
the European Council secretariat and Spain the top job at the WEU. EU
leaders would also agree to back Mr Renato Ruggiero of Italy and Lord Lawson
of the UK as European candidates for the World Trade Organisation and the
OECD.
Mr Kohl is also said to be willing to consider supporting Mr Lubbers as
successor to the ailing Mr Manfred Worner at Nato.
Topics at the Corfu summit will include a progress report on implementing
the European Commission's White Paper on growth and unemployment; approval
of 11 new rail and road projects known as trans-European networks, subject
to further study and without a commitment for new financing instruments; and
the signing of the EU accession treaties by the leaders of Austria, Finland,
Sweden and Norway.
Greece is also expected to make a pitch for the opening of accession
negotiations with Cyprus on January 1, 1995 - but few expect EU leaders to
commit themselves to a firm date.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Madrid acts to reassure business over economy

<TEXT>
Spain will not deviate from its current economic policies, despite the
defeat suffered by the ruling Socialist party in last week's European
elections, according to economy minister Pedro Solbes.
He told an audience of businessmen in Catalonia at the weekend that this
would mean tight national budgets for the next three years. Cutting the
public sector deficit was essential to enable the country to grow and create
jobs on a permanent basis, he said.
His comments, aimed at reassuring business in an unsettled political
climate, followed pressure from hardline sectors of the Socialist party to
move towards the left and seek a rapprochement with the Communist-led United
Left party. The Socialists need United Left support to continue running the
regional government in Andalucia, where they suffered heavy setbacks in
elections last week.
The government has at the same time been pressed by leaders of the
conservative Popular party to respond to the verdict of voters in the
European ballot. Mr Rodrigo Rato, the PP's parliamentary spokesman, said in
an interview published yesterday that Spain needed tougher budget cuts and
lower social costs to industry.
However, Mr Solbes, appointed last year as a non-party independent in the
Socialist administration, said the government would 'swerve neither to the
right not to the left'.
Any rapprochement with United Left would jeopardise the government's current
pact with the Catalan nationalist party Convergencia i Union, whose 17
deputies provide the Socialists with just enough support for a working
majority in parliament.
Mr Jordi Pujol, the CiU leader and Catalan regional president, reaffirmed
his readiness to keep supporting the government in a meeting on Thursday
night with Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister. However, he made clear
this was pegged to specific economic and regional policies. Both the CiU and
the Basque Nationalist Party have discouraged the government from seeking
their explicit backing in a confidence motion in parliament.

FT  20 JUN 94 / French socialists in turmoil as Rocard resigns: Interim
leader named but speculation surrounds Delors

Mr Michel Rocard resigned as head of the French Socialist party yesterday
after his defeat in a vote of confidence among the party's leadership,
throwing the party's plans for next year's presidential elections into
confusion.
Mr Rocard was replaced last night with Mr Henri Emmanuelli, a former
parliamentary whip. But his election as provisional party chief will fuel
speculation that Mr Jacques Delors, the French president of the European
Commission, may be tempted to enter the presidential contest.
Mr Delors had made clear that he would not stand against Mr Rocard. The
resignation thus meets one of Mr Delors' preconditions for entering the
race, although his appetite for politics was diminished by the bruising
experience of winning approval for the Maastricht Treaty.
Mr Rocard is the latest casualty of the traditional continental European
left's dismal showing in the recent elections for the European parliament.
The French Socialists won just 14.5 per cent of the vote, their worst result
in a national poll for more than 20 years.
Mr Achille Occhetto resigned last week as leader of Italy's Democratic party
of the Left. Ominously deep divisions have re-emerged in Germany's
opposition Social Democratic party, only three days before a critical party
conference called to endorse its leader, Mr Rudolf Scharping, as the
candidate to fight Chancellor Helmut Kohl in next October's general
election.
Mr Rocard called for the vote of confidence after criticism of his
leadership and the party's showing in the European elections. He won 88
votes for his proposals to revitalise the party. There were 129 votes
against and 48 abstentions in the party's national leadership council.
Mr Emmanuelli, 49, was chosen as leader by 140 votes to 64. He is expected
to head the party until a scheduled party congress this autumn or until a
special convention is called to decide on the Socialist candidate for the
presidential elections due in April 1995.
On Saturday Mr Laurent Fabius, the former Socialist prime minister and a
rival of Mr Rocard, said Mr Delors was the person 'best placed' to lead the
Socialists in next year's presidential election. Mr Fabius said the choice
of a candidate for the presidential elections should be left until the
beginning of next year, coinciding neatly with Mr Delors' scheduled date of
departure from the Commission's presidency.
Mr Jack Lang, former culture minister, has also been suggested as a possible
Socialist leader.
Mr Rocard told the national council: 'Uncertain political and strategic
positions, confirmed isolation, and absurd means of operation are our three
main failures that require radical change.'
Mr Rocard took over as general secretary of the party last year. He rose to
the party leadership after the Socialists' general election defeat last
March at the hands of the centre-right RPR-UDF ruling coalition.
After the setback in the European elections he had proposed a new party
platform and a renovation of the party machinery.
